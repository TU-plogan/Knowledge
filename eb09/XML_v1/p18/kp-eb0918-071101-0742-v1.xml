                    of Birds (of which more than 100 species are recognized) from the habit which
                    some of them possess of apparently walking on the surface of the water as the
                    apostle St Peter (of whose name the word is a diminutive form) is recorded
                    (Matt. xiv. 29) to have done. For a long while the Petrels were ranked as a

                    opinion has gradually given way, and it is now hard to resist the conclusion
                    that they have to be regarded as an “Order,” to which the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tubinares</hi> has been applied from the tubular form of their nostrils, a
                    feature possessed in greater or less degree by all of them, and by which each
                    may at a glance be recognized. They have usually been subdivided into three
                    groups or Subfamilies, (1) <hi rend="italic">Pelecanoidinae</hi> (or <hi
                    rend="italic">Halodrominae),</hi> containing some three or four species known as
                    Diving-Petrels, with habits very different from others of the Family, and almost
                    peculiar to high southern latitudes from Cape Horn to New Zealand; (2) <hi
                    rend="italic">Procellariinae,</hi> or Petrels proper; and (3) <hi rend="italic"
                    >Diomedeinae,</hi> or Albatrosses (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Mallemuck,</hi> vol.
                    xv. p. 334). Recently, however, the anatomy of the group has been subjected to
                    very close examination by Garrod and W. A. Forbes, the latter of whom has summed
                    up the results obtained by himself and his predecessor in an elaborate essay,
                    forming part ix. of the <hi rend="italic">Zoology</hi> of the voyage of the
                    “Challenger,” which shew determinations that differ greatly from any that had

                <p>Petrels are dispersed throughout all the seas and oceans of the world, and some
                    species apparently never resort to land except for the purpose of nidification,
                    though nearly all are liable at times to be driven ashore, and often very far
                    inland, by gales of wind.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    It would also seem that during the breeding-season many of them are wholly
                    nocturnal in their habits, passing the day in holes of the ground, or in clefts
                    of the rocks, in which they generally nestle, the hen of each pair laying a
                    single white egg, sparsely speckled in a few species with fine reddish dots. Of
                    those species that frequent the North Atlantic, the common Storm-Petrel, <hi

                    which has to the ordinary eye rather the look of a Swift or Swallow, is the
                    “Mother Carey’s chicken” of sailors, and is widely believed to be the harbinger
                    of bad weather; but seamen hardly discriminate between this and others nearly
                    resembling it in appearance, such as Leach’s or the</p>
                <p>Fork-tailed Petrel, <hi rend="italic">Cymochorea leucorrhoa,</hi> a rather larger

                    But it is in the Southern Ocean that Petrels most abound, both as species and as
                    individuals. The Cape-Pigeon or Pintado Petrel, <hi rend="italic">Daption
                    capeηsis,</hi> is one that has long been well known to mariners and other
                    wayfarers on the great waters, while those who voyage to or from Australia,
                    whatever be the route they take, are certain to meet with many more species,
                    some, as <hi rend="italic">Ossifraga</hi><hi rend="italic">gigantea,</hi> as
                    large as Albatrosses, and several of them called by sailors by a variety of
                    choice names, generally having reference to the strong smell of musk emitted by
                    the birds, among which that of “Stink-pot” is not the most opprobrious. None of
                    the Petrels are endowed with any brilliant colouring—sooty-black, grey of
                    various tints (one of which is often called “blue”), and white being the only
                    hues their plumage exhibits; but their graceful flight, and their companionship
                    when no other life is visible around a lonely vessel on the widest of oceans,
                    give them an interest to beholders, though this is too often marred by the
                    wanton destruction dealt out by brutal or thoughtless persons who thus seek to
                    break the tediousness of a long voyage. The distribution of the several species
                    of Petrels in the Southern Ocean has been ably treated by Prof. A. Milne-Edwards
