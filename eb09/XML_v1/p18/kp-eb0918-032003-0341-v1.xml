                <p><label type="entry">PARR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label> (1747-1825),
                    the son of Samuel Parr, surgeon at Harrow-on-the-Hill, was born there 15th
                    January 1747. At Easter 1752 he was sent to Harrow School as a free scholar,
                    where he made the acquaintance of many pupils, such as Bishop Bennet, Sir
                    William Jones, and Warburton Lytton, who became eminent in after life. They read
                    in the same class, they shared in the same sports, and their friendship lasted
                    from youth to age. As Parr was destined for his father’s profession, he was
                    removed from school in the spring of 1761, and for the next few years assisted
                    his father in his practice. When the old surgeon realized that his son was but
                    ill-adapted for this pursuit, the boy was sent to Emmanuel College, Cambridge
                    (autumn of 1765), but on his father’s death shortly afterwards he was compelled,
                    through lack of means, to return to Harrow. From February 1767 to the close of
                    1771 he acted as head assistant at Harrow School to Dr Sumner, a teacher whom he
                    idolized, and had under his care many pupils, of whom Sheridan was the best
                    known. When the headmaster died in September 1771 Parr became a candidate for
                    the place, but was rejected, chiefly on account of his youth, whereupon he
                    started another school at Stanmore, and drew after him about forty of his former
                    scholars. After a trial of five years he found himself unable to bear up against
                    the attractions of his old establishment, and dismissed the boys entrusted to
                    his charge, becoming first the headmaster of Colchester Grammar School (1776-78)
                    and then of Norwich School (1778-86). The small rectory of Asterby in
                    Lincolnshire was conferred upon him in 1780, and it was followed three years
                    later by the vicarage of Hatton near Warwick. Though he exchanged this latter
                    benefice for Wadenhoe in Northamptonshire in 1789, he stipulated to be allowed
                    to reside, as assistant curate, in the parsonage of Hatton. In this retirement
                    he spent the rest of his days, cheered by the attractions of an excellent
                    library, described by Mr H. G. Bohn in <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca
                    Parriana</hi> (1827), and the converse of his classical friends, some of whom,
                    like Porson and E. H. Barker, passed many months in his company. The degree of
                    LL.D, was conferred on him by the university of Cambridge in 1781. Parr died at
                    Hatton vicarage, 6th March 1825, and was buried in the chancel of its church. He
                    had to middle age felt the pressure of poverty, but through the gift in 1788 of
                    the prebendal stall of Wenlock Barns in St Paul’s Cathedral (then worth only a
                    reserved rent of £20 a year, but on the lapse of the lease in 1804 a preferment
                    of considerable value), and through the purchase for him by his friends in 1789
                    of an annuity of £300, he died possessed of a large fortune.</p>
                <p>Dr Parr’s writings fill several volumes, but they are all beneath the reputation
                    which he acquired through the variety of his knowledge and the dogmatism of his
                    conversation. The chief of them are his character of Charles James Fox; his
                    Latin preface, a long eulogy of Burke, North, and Fox, to a new edition of three
                    books of Bellendenus; and his reprint of the <hi rend="italic">Tracts of
                    Warburton and a Warburtoηian, not admitted into their works,</hi> a volume still
                    not without interest for its scathing exposure of Warburton and Hurd. The
                    character of Parr’s compositions may be gathered from a passage in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> (October 1802) on his Spital sermon, “a
                    discourse of no common length . . . . an immeasurable mass of notes which appear
                    to concern every learned thing, every <pb break="no"

                    the beginning of the world.” Even amid the terrors of the French Revolution he
                    adhered to Whiggism, and his correspondence included every man of eminence,
                    either literary or political, who adopted the same creed. There are two memoirs
                    of his life, one by the Rev. William Field (1828, 2 vols.), the other, with his
                    works and his letters, by John Johnstone (1828, 8 vols.); and E. H. Barker
                    published in 1828-29 two volumes of <hi rend="italic">Parriana,</hi> a confused
                    mass of information on Parr and his friends. An essay on his life is included in
                    De Quincey’s works, vol. v., and a little volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphorisms, Opinions, and Reflections of the late Dr Pan·</hi> appeared in
                    1826.</p>
