                    (1810-1860), a distinguished American rationalistic preacher and social
                    reformer, born at Lexington, Massachusetts, August 24, 1810, was the youngest of
                    eleven children. His father, John Parker, a small farmer and skilful mechanic,
                    was a typical New England yeoman, a man of sterling moral worth, of strong
                    intellect, meditative, and fond of reading,—a strict disciplinarian in his
                    house, a Unitarian in his theology before Unitarianism was known in New England
                    as a system, and a Federalist in his politics when there were but four
                    Federalists in Lexington. His mother, “an imaginative, delicate-minded, poetic,
                    yet very practical woman,” took great pains with the religious education of her
                    children, “caring, however, but little for doctrines,” and making religion to
                    consist of love and good works. Theodore’s paternal grandfather, Captain John
                    Parker, fired the first shot upon the British at the battle of Lexington,
                    commanding on that occasion a troop of seventy men. The historic musket from
                    which that shot was fired became one of the most valued ornaments of the
                    grandson’s study. His mother taught him to listen to the monitions of conscience
                    as the voice of God, and from his infancy his life was dominated by moral and
                    religious emotions and ideas of overpowering force. The boy was richly endowed
                    intellectually and physically. His memory was marvellously retentive. The
                    acquisition of languages was a delight and recreation to him. He obtained the
                    elements of knowledge in the schools of the district, which were open during the
                    winter months only. During the rest of the year he worked on his father’s farm.
                    He was all the time an immense and omnivorous reader, and his powerful memory
                    enabled him to remember all that he read. At the age of seventeen he became
