                <p><label type="entry">PATNA</label>, chief city of the above district, is situated
                    in 25° 37' 15" N. lat. and 85° 12' 31" E. long., on the right or south bank of
                    the Ganges, and adjoining Bánkipur, the civil station and administrative
                    headquarters of the district. Its central position at the junction of three
                    great rivers, the Son, the Gandak, and the Ganges, where the traffic of the
                    North-Western Provinces meets that of Bengal, gives it great natural advantages.
                    The city proper comprises the large business quarters of Márúfganj, Mán-súrganj,
                    the Kilá or fort, the Chauk, with Mirchaiganj, Mahárájganj,Sádikpur,
                    Alábakhshpur, Gulzárbágh, Colonel-ganj, and other petty bazaars extending
                    westwards as far as Bánkipur civil station. According to the census of 1881 its
                    population was 170,654 — Hindus 127,076, Mohammedans 43,086, “others” 492.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Patna city has been identified with Pátaliputra
                    (the Palibothra of Megasthenes, who came as ambassador from Seleucus Nicator to
                    Chandragupta about 300 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.).</hi> Megasthenes describes
                    Palibothra as being the capital city of India. He adds that its length was 80
                    stadia, and breadth 15, that it was surrounded by a ditch 30 cubits deep, and
                    that the walls were adorned with 570 towers and 64 gates. According to this
                    account the circumference of the city would be 190 stadia or 25⅜ miles. When
                    Hwen T’sang visited the place in 637 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> the kingdom
                    of Magadha was subject to the rule of Kanauj. The old city had then been
                    deserted for a long time, and was in ruins, although a new Pátaliputra had
                    sprung up close to it. In the south-east of Patna district, in the Rájágríhá
                    Hills, are found some of the earliest remains of Indian Buddhism. During the
                    early years of Mohammedan rule the governor of the Erovince resided at Behar
                    town in the south-east of the district.</p>
                <p>•tiring Sher Sháh’s revolt against the Mughals, Patna became the capital of an
                    independent state, which was afterwards reduced to subjection by Akbar. The two
                    events in the modern history of the district are the massacre of Patna (1763)
                    and the Sepoy Mutiny in 1857. The former occurrence, which may be said to have
                    settled the fate of Mohammedan rule in Bengal, was the result of a quarrel
                    between the nawáb, Mir Kásim, and the English authorities regarding transit
                    duties, which ultimately led to open hostilities. The company’s sepoys, who had
                    occupied Patna city by the orders of the company’s factor, were driven out by
                    the nawáb’s troops and nearly all killed. The remainder afterwards surrendered,
                    and were put into confinement, together with the European officers and the
                    entire staff of the Kásimbázár factory, who had also been arrested on the first
                    outbreak of hostilities. Mir Kásim was defeated in two pitched battles at Gheriá
                    and Udhánálá (Oodeynullah) in August and September 1763, and in revenge ordered
                    the massacre of the whole of his prisoners, which was carried out with the help
                    of a Swiss renegade in his employment, named Walter Reinhardt (afterwards the
                    husband of the famous Begam Samru). About sixty English prisoners were murdered
                    on this occasion, the bodies being thrown into a well belonging to the house in
                    which they were confined.</p>
                <p>At the outbreak of the mutiny in May 1857 the three sepoy regiments stationed at
                    Dinápur (the military cantonment of Patna, adjoining the city) were allowed to
                    retain their arms till July, when, on an attempt being made to disarm them, they
                    broke into open revolt. Although many who attempted to cross the Ganges in boats
                    were fired into and run down by a pursuing steamer, the majority crossed by the
                    Son river into Sháhábád, where they joined the rebels under Kuar Sinh, who were
                    then besieging a small European community at Arrah.</p>
