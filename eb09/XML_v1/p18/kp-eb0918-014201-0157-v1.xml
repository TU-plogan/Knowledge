                    (Francis)</hi></label> (1798-1876), the Bohemian historian, was born in the year
                    1798 in the village of Hodslavice, in the north-eastern corner of Moravia, where
                    his father was a schoolmaster. His ancestors had secretly remained Protestants
                    through all the persecutions of the 17th century, and only declared themselves
                    as such on the publication of the edict of toleration by the emperor Joseph II.
                    His mother’s name was Anna Krizan; she died in the year 1822, before her son had
                    gained his great reputation. His father, Jiri (George), died in 1836; besides
                    Francis. they had three other sons and three daughters. Concerning the early
                    years of the future historian we are told that he was an indefatigable reader,
                    eagerly devouring all books which came in his way. In 1812 Palacky entered the
                    gymnasium of Pressburg; his original intention was to become a Protestant
                    clergyman. The national movement then going on in the country aroused the
                    enthusiasm of the youthful student, who was induced to apply himself to the
                    study of his native tongue by the <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Bohemian
                    Language</hi> of Jungmann. While in Pressburg, Palacky assisted the publicist
                    Palko-vich in his journal, <hi rend="italic">Tydennik,</hi> and first made his
                    appearance as an author with a translation of some of the poems of Ossian
                    (1817), then so popular throughout Europe. After this he was for some time
                    private tutor in various families. In 1823 Palacky removed to Prague, and formed
                    friendships with the leading Czech literati—Jungmann, Presl, Dobrovsky, Hanka,
                    and others. Dobrovsky introduced him to Count Sternberg, and he was appointed
                    editor of the new <hi rend="italic">Casopis Ceskeho</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Musea,</hi> which is still published. In this occupation he continued till
                    1838. Count Caspar Sternberg and his brother were munificent patrons of the new
                    Bohemian Museum, which had finally been founded after many efforts. The conduct
                    of these men was the more remarkable that the Bohemian aristocracy had then
                    become almost entirely Germanized.</p>
                <p>In 1829 Palacky was appointed public historiographer by the Bohemian states, and
                    made several lengthened tours to consult documents in public libraries at
                    Munich, Berlin, Dresden, Rome, and elsewhere. He then commenced his <hi
                    rend="italic">History of the Bohemian People,</hi> which has earned him the
                    undying gratitude of his countrymen. The first volume appeared in German in
                    1836, but the work was carried on in the Bohemian language from 1848, and was
                    concluded with the year 1526, the period when Ferdinand I. ascended the throne
                    and the political independence of the Czechs ceased. Besides this Palacky
                    obtained a prize from the Bohemian Society of Arts for his work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Würdigung der alten böhmischen Geschichtschreiber.</hi> In the
                    year 1840 he published, in conjunction with Schafarik, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Die</hi><hi rend="italic">ältesten Denkmäler der Böhmischen Sprache.</hi> In
                    this he appears as the champion of the early Bohemian manuscripts, the
                    authenticity of which has been so much disputed, adopting among others the
                    glosses in the <hi rend="italic">Mater</hi><hi rend="italic">Verborum</hi> in
                    the library at Prague, which have been proved to be forgeries. In the troubled
                    year 1848 Palacky, a man of the student type, was forced into political life,
                    but acquitted himself well. He refused to take a seat in the German parliament
                    at Frankfort when invited to do so, on the ground that as a Czech he had nothing
                    to do with German affairs. It was on this occasion that he uttered the memorable
                    sentiment that so essential was Austria to the interests of Europe that, if such
                    an empire had not existed, it would have been necessary to create one—words
                    which were afterwards used by Jellachich as the device on his flag. Before his
                    death, however, Palacky had changed his opinion, and despaired of any help
                    coming from such a source. Thus in a series of articles which he published in
                    his old age under the title <hi rend="italic">Radhost,</hi> he tells us—“I have
                    thought all my life that the right would prevail, and my mistake has been in
                    believing in the good sense and spirit of justice of the German people.”</p>
                <p>Sb great was the influence of Palacky at this period that he was offered a
                    portfolio in the ministry of Pillersdorf; but in a short time the confidence
                    placed in him by the Austrian Government was withdrawn, and he was regarded with
                    suspicion. He soon, however, quitted politics and betook himself to his literary
                    labours. His influence among his countrymen was now at its height. In 1860 he
                    had the misfortune to lose his wife, whom he had married in 1827. In 1861 he was
                    made a life member of the Austrian senate. He died in 1876, busy with literature
                    to the end.</p>
                <p>The great work of Palacky, his <hi rend="italic">History of the Bohemian
                    People,</hi> is indeed a monument of conscientious labour. His love of truth and
                    marvellous accuracy are conspicuous on every page. To enable the Bohemians to
                    resist the insidious attempts at their denationalization which had been steadily
                    pursued by their enemies during the 17th and 18th centuries, it was necessary to
                    bring before them the great past which they had been taught to forget. This
                    Palacky has done, and his work has become a national monument. The occupation of
                    the last years of his life was the rewriting of some of the chapters, which had
                    seemed to him imperfectly executed, owing to the want of original documents or
                    the censorship of the Austrian Government. In 1845 the first part of his third
                    volume appeared, dealing with the life and religious opinions of Huss. As the
                    work was published, it had already undergone serious mutilation at the hands of
                    the appointed censors, but the Bohemians saw the history of Huss presented to
                    them in its true colours; and so great was the sensation created that a Roman
                    Catholic publicist named Helfert was commissioned to write an account of Huss
                    and Jerome, his disciple, with the view of counteracting the effects of
                    Palacky’s work. This book duly appeared at Prague in 1857. Palacky, however,
                    must be considered to have triumphed in the controversy. He published two other
                    polemical works on the same subject in German: in 1868 appeared <hi
                    rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic">Geschichte</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Hussiten-thums</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">Prof. C.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Höfler,</hi> and in 1871 another work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zur Böhmischen Geschichtschreibung.</hi> Besides the interesting portion of his
                    work dealing with Huss and the subsequent Hussite wars, Palacky appears to great
                    advantage when dwelling upon the most prosperous periods of Bohemian
                    nationality, as the reigns of Charles IV. and George Podébrad. No pains were
                    spared by him in his researches. Dr Kalousek tells us in his interesting memoir
                    that, when he visited Rome in 1837 to consult the library of the Vatican, he
                    read through 45,000 documents in ten weeks and copied 400 of them with his own
                    hand. The work is a monument of erudition; but it may perhaps be said to be
                    written in a somewhat dry and frigid style. It has become familiar to general
                    readers in a German translation. Palacky also founded an historical school in
                    Bohemia, foremost among his pupils being Vaclav Tomek and Antonin Gindely.</p>
