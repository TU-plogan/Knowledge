                <p><label type="entry">PESARO</label>, a city and seaport of Italy, the capital of
                    the province of Pesaro and Urbino, lies on the coast of the Adriatic 36 miles
                    north of Ancona and 20⅜ south of</p>
                <p>Rimini on the right bank of the Foglia, the ancient</p>
                <p>Pisaurus. The ground on which it is built is only from 10</p>
                <p>to 40 feet above the sea, but it is surrounded by hills,— on the east by Monte
                    Ardizio, on the west by Monte Accio or San Bartolo, which derives one of its
                    names from the Roman dramatist L. Attius, born and buried on the spot. The city
                    walls, which were strengthened by bastions and moat and made a circuit of about
                    a mile, were in 1830 transformed into a public promenade. Besides the ancient
                    cathedral of the Annunciation (restored since 1860) the more conspicuous
                    buildings are the prefecture (a palace originally erected by the Sforza, and
                    restored by Francesco Maria della Rovere), the seminary, the Rossini theatre
                    (opened in 1818), the fortress or Rocca Costanzia (built by Costanzo Sforza in
                    1474), the harbour-fort (due to Napoleon I.), and the large lunatic asylum.
                    Rossini, who was a native of Pesaro, left all his fortune to found a musical
                    lyceum in the city, and his statue by Marochetti (1864) stands near the railway
                    station. The Olivieri library (established by the antiquary of that name, author
                    of <hi rend="italic">Marmora</hi><hi rend="italic">Pisaurensia,</hi> &amp;c.)
                    contains about 14,000 volumes, MSS. of Tasso’s, &amp;c., various antiquities,
                    and a fine collection of majolica from the old Urbino manufactory. Among the
                    industries of Pesaro are the growing, spinning, and weaving of silk, tanning,
                    iron-founding, and the manufacture of glass and pottery. The harbour is of no
                    great importance, and the aggregate burden of the 437 vessels entering or
                    clearing in 1883 was less than 12,000 tons. The population of the city and port
                    in 1870 was 11,952 and in 1880 12,913; that of the commune 19,691 and 20,909 in

                    it was restored and strengthened by Belisarius, and afterwards along with
                    Ancona, Fano, Sinigaglia, and Rimini formed the Pentapolis Maritima. In the
                    course of the 13th century Pesaro was sometimes under the government of the
                    popes, sometimes under that of the emperors; but the Malatesta family, which
                    first took root in the city about 1285, gradually became the real masters of the
                    place. In 1445 they sold their rights to Francesco Sforza; and in 1512, through
                    the influence of Julius II., the Sforza were supplanted by his nephew Francesco
                    Maria, duke of Urbino. Leo X. took the city away from Francesco and gave it to
                    Lorenzo de’ Medici; but on Lorenzo’s death Francesco was restored and Pesaro
                    became the ordinary residence of the dukes of Urbino till the death of Francesco
                    Maria II. in 1631, when it reverted to the States of the Church. It has formed
                    part of the present kingdom of Italy since 1860. Terenzio Mamiani della Rovere,
                    poet and statesman, was born at Pesaro in 1800.</p>
