                    Gottlob</hi></label> (1761-1851), the distinguished representative of the
                    rationalistic school of German theologians of the beginning of this century, was
                    born at Leonberg, near Stuttgart, 1st September 1761. His father, the Lutheran
                    clergyman at Leonberg, was convinced of the immortality of the soul by
                    spiritualism, and was deprived of his living in consequence of his belief in the
                    intercourse of departed spirits with men. He likewise required of his children
                    unconditional obedience, and commanded them to believe the doctrines of religion
                    without asking wherefore. The father’s spiritualism and dogmatism drove the son
                    by natural reaction to the rationalism which prevailed at the time, and of
                    which, in its application to Biblical history, Paulus became the most famous
                    representative. He was educated at Tübingen, was three years headmaster of a
                    German school, and then spent two years in travelling through England and the
                    principal countries of the Continent. He subsequently published interesting
                    passages from the journal of his tour. In 1789 he was chosen ordinary professor
                    of Oriental languages at Jena. In addition to the studies of his own department
                    he prosecuted especially mathematics, as the best preparation for clear
                    thinking. At Jena he lived in close intercourse with Schiller, Goethe, Herder,
                    and the most distinguished literary men of the time. In 1793 he succeeded
                    Doederlein as professor of theology. His special work was the exposition of the
                    Old and New Testaments in the light of his great Oriental learning and according
                    to his characteristic principle of “natural explanation.” He held that miracles
                    in the strict sense were impossible, that the events recorded in the Bible took
                    place naturally, and that the narratives of the Gospels are the true reports of
                    men who either were eyewitnesses or had obtained information from such as were.
                    From a purely apologetic motive he sought to remove what other interpreters
                    regarded as miracles from the Bible by distinguishing between the <hi
                    rend="italic">fact</hi> related and the author’s <hi rend="italic">opinion</hi>
                    of it, by seeking a naturalistic exegesis of a narrative, <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> that <hi rend="italic">επι</hi><hi rend="italic">της θαλάσσης</hi>
                    (Matt. xiv. 25) means <hi rend="italic">by the shore</hi> and not <hi
                    rend="italic">on the sea,</hi> by supplying circumstances omitted by the author,
                    by remembering that the author produces as miracles occurrences which can now be
                    explained otherwise, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">
                    i</hi> exorcisms. The chief exegetical works of Paulus are his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philologisch-kritischer und. histor</hi><hi rend="italic">ischer</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Commentar uber</hi><hi rend="italic">das Neue Testament</hi> (4
                    vols., 1800- 1804), <hi rend="italic">Clavis uber</hi><hi rend="italic">die
                    Psalmen</hi> (1791), and <hi rend="italic">Clavis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >über</hi><hi rend="italic">Jesaias</hi> (1793), and particularly his <hi
                    rend="italic">Exegetisches Handbuch über die drei ersten Evangelien</hi> (3
                    vols., 1830-33; 2d ed., 1841-42). His <hi rend="italic">Life of Jesus</hi> (2
                    vols., 1828) is a synoptical translation of the Gospels, prefaced by an account
                    of the preparation for the Christ and a brief summary of His history, and
                    accompanied by very short explanations interwoven in the translation. The form
                    of the work was fatal to its success, and the subsequent <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exegetisches Handbuch</hi> rendered it quite superfluous. In the latter work
                    Paulus really contributed much to a true interpretation of the Gospel
                    narratives, notwithstanding his entire failure to explain the miracles away. The
                    historical and geographical excursuses and dissertations interwoven in his
                    commentaries are of considerable value. He was particularly well acquainted with
                    the conditions of Oriental life. In the year 1803 Paulus left Jena on account of
                    his health, and filled various posts in south Germany until 1811, when he became
                    professor of exegesis and ecclesiastical history at Heidelberg. It was there
                    that he found the freest scope for his great learning and tutorial abilities. He
                    filled this chair until 1844, when he retired on account of his great age. He
                    died, faithful to his first rationalistic position, a staunch friend of
                    intellectual and political freedom and light, 10th August 1851, in his ninetieth
                    year.</p>
                <p>The literary labours of Paulus were not confined to exegesis. He edited a
                    collected small edition of Spinoza’s works (1802-1803), a collection of the most
                    noted Eastern travels (1792-1803), Schelling’s <hi rend="italic">Vorlesungen
                    über</hi><hi rend="italic">dis</hi><hi rend="italic">Offenbarung</hi> (1843),
                    &amp;c. He was also the author of <hi rend="italic">Skizzen aus meiner</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bildungs-</hi><hi rend="italic">und Lebensgeschichte</hi> (1839),
                    and he left behind him the materials for a biography, which was published by
                    Professor Reichlin-Meldegg, under the title <hi rend="italic">II. E. G.
                    Paulus</hi><hi rend="italic">und</hi><hi rend="italic">seine</hi><hi
