                <p><label type="entry">PAS DE CALAIS</label>, a maritime department of northern
                    France, formed in 1790 of nearly the whole of Artois and the northern maritime
                    portion of Picardy, including the Boulonnais, Calaisis, Ardrésis, and the
                    districts of Langle and Bredenarde, lies between 50° 2' and 51° N. lat. and 1
                    35' and 3° 10' E. long., and is bounded N. by the Straits of Dover (“Pas de
                    Calais”), E. by the department of Nord, S. by that of Somme, and W. by the
                    English Channel. The distance from England is only 21 miles. Nord, which
                    separates Pas de Calais from Belgium, is at one place only 3 miles wide, and
                    from Arras (the chief town) to Paris in a direct line is about 100 miles. Except
                    in the neighbourhood of Boulogne, with its côtes de fer or “iron coasts,” the
                    seaboard of the department, which measures 65 miles, consists of dunes. From the
                    mouth of the Aa (the limit towards Nord) it trends west-southwest to Gris Nez,
                    the point of France nearest to England; in this section lie the port of Calais,
                    Cape Blanc Nez, rising 440 feet above the sandy shores, and the port of Wissant
                    (Wishant). Beyond Gris Nez the direction is due south; in this section are the
                    port of Ambleteuse, Boulogne at the mouth of the Liane, and the two bays formed
                    by the estuaries of the Canche and the Authie (the limit towards Somme). The
                    highest point in the department (700 feet) is in the west, between Boulogne and
                    St Omer. From the uplands in which it is situated the Lys and Scarpe flow east
                    to the Scheldt, the Aa north to the German Ocean, and the Slack, Wimereux, and
                    Liane to the Channel. Farther south are the valleys of the Canche and the
                    Authie, running from east-south-east to west-northwest, and thus parallel with
                    the Somme. Vast plains, open and monotonous, but extremely fertile and well
                    cultivated, occupy most of the department. The greenest and most picturesque
                    valleys are in the west. To the north of the hills running between St Omer and
                    Boulogne, to the south of Gravelines and the south-east of Calais, lies the
                    district of the Wattergands, fens now drained by means of canals and dykes, and
                    turned into highly productive land. The climate is free from extremes of heat
                    and cold, but damp and changeable. At Arras the mean annual temperature is 47°;
                    on the coast it is higher. The rainfall in the one case is 22 inches, in the
                    other 31.</p>
                <p>With a total area of 2550 square miles, the department has 1899 square miles
                    (more than two-thirds) of arable land, while woods and pasture land each occupy
                    only about a twentieth. The live stock in 1880 comprised 76,224 horses, 9642
                    asses or mules, 156,060 cows, 35,272 calves, 5080 bulls or oxen, 256,031 sheep,
                    131,722 pigs, 26,760 goats. The sheep in 1880 yielded 857 tons of wool, worth
                    £57,398. The national sheepfolds of Tingry are in Pas de Calais. The 22,260
                    beehives of the department yielded in 1878 1753 tons of honey and 39⅜ tons of
                    wax. No department except Somme breeds fowls so extensively. Wheat, beetroot,
                    and oil seeds are the principal crops. In 1882 wheat gave 9,855,483 bushels,
                    meslin 920,023 bushels; in 1879, rye 781,150 bushels, barley 2,362,133 bushels,
                    oats 9,421,818 bushels, beetroot 1,576,355 tons (almost entirely consumed by the
                    sugar works), potatoes 7,250,813 bushels, vegetables 581,727, and colza seed
                    30,263. Besides there were considerable quantities of poppy-seed, flax (of
                    excellent quality), hops, hemp, and tobacco (1275 tons). There are two great
                    coalfields, that of Pas de Calais proper, a continuation of the coal-field of
                    Valenciennes and Hainault, and that of Boulonnais. The former contains a total
                    area of 134,270 acres; the latter is about a tenth of that size. Taken together
                    they number 72 pits, 57 of which are active. In 1882 5,036,455 tons of coal were
                    extracted and 1,378,818 consumed in the department; the industry gives
                    employment to 22,925 persons. Peat (to the amount of 375,034 tons in 1882) is
                    obtained in the valleys of the Scarpe and the Aa. Iron-mines in the
                    arrondissement of Boulogne employ 162 workmen (26,674 tons); the stone and
                    marble quarries 2130 workmen; and about 800 are engaged in obtaining phosphates
                    of lime (295,566 tons), which are exported for manure. Blast furnaces,
                    foundries, engineering works, naileries, boiler-works, agricultural implement
                    factories, and steelpen works are all carried on in the department. In 1883 305
                    tons of iron, 16,355 tons of steel, 65,025 tons of cast iron were manufactured;
                    and the average production of pens is 400,000,000 per annum. The establishments
                    at Biache St Vaast melt, refine, and roll copper and zinc, and also work lead
                    and auriferous silver. The shipyards do not launch any large vessels, but in
                    1881 they built eighty luggers or sloops, with an aggregate burden of 2456 tons.
                    The eighty-nine sugar-works in 1880 produced 42,121 tons of sugar and 29,730 of
                    molasses; the distilleries 4,658,984 gallons of spirits; the oil works 15 tons
                    of hempseed oil, 389 tons of linseed oil, 3066 tons of poppyseed, rapeseed, and
                    cameline oil, &amp;c., and 797 tons of colza oil. There are 553 breweries in the
                    department. Cotton-spinning and weaving employ 116,364 spindles and 625 looms;
                    woolspinning 26,300 spindles; and the flax, hemp, and jute manufacture 35,700
                    spindles and 497 looms. St Pierre-lès-Calais carries on the weaving of tulles in
                    linen, cotton, and silk, employing 10,000 hands, and producing with its 1506
                    looms goods to the value of £2,400,0 0 per annum. There are besides in the
                    department establishments <pb break="no"

                    hosiery, embroidery, boots and shoes (for exportation), flooring, pipes, glass
                    wares, chemical products, pottery, chicory, starch, biscuits (300 to 400
                    workmen), and gin. The national powder-mills of Esquerdes are among the largest
                    in France. The port towns fit out a considerable number of vessels for the
                    mackerel, cod, and herring fishing—a growing industry. In 1882 Boulogne and
                    Etaples had 340 boats (13,919 tons) and 4586 fishermen, and Calais 37 boats (265
                    tons) and 281 fishermen, and their united take was 2356 tons. There is a large
                    export of sugar, spirits, calves, sheep, and eggs to England. In 1882 the port
                    of Boulogne had a movement of 3614 vessels and that of Calais 4436, with a total
                    burden for the two ports of 2,212,920 tons. In 1878 404,769 travellers passed by
                    this way between France and England. Calais is emphatically a transit port;
                    Boulogne has besides an export trade in local products such as marble,
                    freestone, minerals, and Boulogne horses, remarkable for size and strength. The
                    roads of the department (national, departmental, &amp;c. ) make a length of 9393
                    miles, the waterways 105⅜ miles, the railways 546 miles, and the industrial
                    railways 60 miles. The canal system comprises part of the Aa, the Lys, the
                    Scarpe, the Deule (a tributary of the Lys passing by Lille), the Lawe (a
                    tributary of the Lys passing by Bethune), and the Sensée (an affluent of the
                    Scheldt), as well as the various canals proper from Aire to La Bassée,
                    Neuffossé, Calais, &amp;c., and in this way a line of communication is formed
                    from the Scheldt to the sea by Bethune, St Omer, and Calais, with branches to
                    Gravelines and Dunkirk in Nord. The total tonnage of the whole inland navigation
                    was 2,124,442 tons in 1878.</p>
                <p>In 1881 Pas de Calais had 819,022 inhabitants (311 per square mile), ranking
                    sixth among the departments in density of population. It forms the diocese of
                    Arras in the archbishopric of Cambrai, belongs to the district of the first (or
                    Lille) corps d’armée, and is within the jurisdiction of the Douai court of
                    appeal. There are six arrondissements bearing the names of their chief towns—
                    Arras (27,041 inhabitants), Bethune (10,374), Boulogne (44,842), Montreuil
                    (3352), St Omer (20,479), and St Pol (3694). Other places of importance are St
                    Pierre-lès-Calais (30,786 inhabitants), the industrial town of Calais (13,529),
                    Lens (10,515), Lievin (8281), Carvin (6430)—the last three with important
                    coal-mines, and Aire (5000), formerly a fortified place.</p>
