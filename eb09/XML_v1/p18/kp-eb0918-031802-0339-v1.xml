                    (1679-1718), has a place in literature among the minor Queen Anne poets. He was
                    a man of some private fortune, being the head of an English family settled in
                    Ireland, and inheriting landed property both there and in Cheshire. Born in
                    Dublin in 1679, and educated at Trinity College, he took orders and obtained
                    various preferments in the Irish Church. But both as a landowner and a clergyman
                    he was an absentee, and spent most of his time in London, where he was
                    patronized by Harley, and received into the intimate friendship of Swift and
                    Pope. He was a member of the Scriblerus Club, and co-operated in burlesquing the
                    “Dunces” and defending the Tory ministry, at the same time attaining some repute
                    in the London pulpits as a preacher. An easy-going wit, with interests mainly in
                    literature and society, he made his peace with the Whigs on the accession of
                    George, but still continued his alliance with Pope. When Pope published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Homer</hi>, Parnell produced a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Battle of the Frogs and Mice</hi> (1717), and indirectly defended
                    Pope against his critics in the accompanying “remarks of Zoilus” on the
                    principles of translation. After his death in 1718— he died on his way to a
                    living in Ireland—Pope published a collection of his poems. They are nearly all
                    translations and adaptations. The best known of them, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Hermit,</hi> is sometimes overpraised on the supposition that it is original;
                    all that Parnell did was to trick out a tale from the <hi rend="italic">Gesta
                    Romanorum</hi> with reflexions in the “elevated diction” of the period. “His
                    praise,” Johnson says with justice, “must be derived from the easy sweetness of
                    his diction; in his verses there is more happiness than pains; he is sprightly
                    without effort, and always delights, though he never ravishes; everything is
