                <p><label type="entry">PARCHMENT</label> consists of skins of various animals,
                    unhaired, cleaned, and dried so as to form sheets of uniform thickness suitable
                    for writing upon and for the numerous other purposes to which such preparations
                    are devoted (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Palaeography,</hi> p. 144), The skins
                    employed for parchment are principally those of sheep, lambs, and calves; but
                    goat and ass skins are similarly dressed for special purposes. The preliminary
                    unhairing and cleaning of the skins are effected as in the leather manufacture
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Leather,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 380). In their moist
                    flexible condition the unhaired skins are tightly and uniformly stretched over a
                    wooden frame termed a herse, and on the flesh side they are carefully gone over
                    with a semicircular fleshing knife which removes all adherent flesh. The grain
                    side is also gone over to clean the surface and squeeze out a proportion of the
                    absorbed moisture. Ordinary binder’s parchment and drum-head parchment need no
                    further preparation, but are simply allowed to dry gradually on the frames on
                    which the skins are stretched. But fine parchment for writing and vellum are
                    powdered with chalk on the flesh side and carefully rubbed with fine pumice
                    stone till a delicate uniform velvety surface is raised. All inequalities on the
                    grain side are also removed by paring and rubbing with fine pumice. Stout vellum
                    is made from calf skins, and ordinary qualities from split sheep skins; for drum
                    heads, tambourines, and like applications goat and calf skins are used, and it
                    is said that wolf skins yield the best drum heads.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetable Parchment,</hi> or parchment paper, is a modified
                    form of paper produced by chemical treatment, having considerable similarity to
                    ordinary animal parchment. It is prepared by acting on ordinary unsized paper
                    with dilute sulphuric acid, and immediately washing away all trace of acid.
                    Paper so treated will be found to have undergone a remarkable change: the porous
                    intertexture of cellulose composing unsized paper will have expanded and
                    agglutinated, forming a homogeneous surface, translucent, horny, and
                    parchment-like; it will have acquired about five times the strength of ordinary
                    paper; it will become soft and flaccid when steeped in water, to which, however,
                    it is impervious; and it is unaffected by boiling in water. The formation of
                    vegetable parchment is due to a molecular change in cellulose when acted on by
                    sulphuric acid, owing to which the substance is transformed into a starch-like
                    body—amyloid—with simultaneous swelling of the fibres, which thereby soften and
                    agglutinate. The preparation of vegetable parchment was patented in 1857 by Mr
                    W. E. Gaine, and machinery has been adapted for the manufacture. The paper to be
                    acted on passes in a continuous web through a vat containing commercial
                    sulphuric acid diluted with half its volume of water. In this it is immersed
                    from five to twenty seconds at a temperature of about 60° Fahr. It then passes
                    in succession through pure water, next an ammoniacal solution to remove all
                    acid, and finally again through water, after which it is dried and finished by
                    passing between felted rollers and over heated polished metal cylinders. A
                    similar effect is produced on paper by treating it with a syrupy solution of
                    zinc chloride at from 120° to 212° Fahr. Vegetable parchment has not realized
                    all the expectations of it. It is most largely used as covers for preserve jars,
                    bottles, &amp;c., and to some extent for tracings of plans, charts, &amp;c.</p>
