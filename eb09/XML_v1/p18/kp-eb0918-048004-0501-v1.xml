                <p><label type="entry">PELTIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean Charles
                    Athanase</hi></label>, was originally a watchmaker, but retired from business
                    about the age of thirty and devoted himself to experimental and observational
                    science. He was born at Ham (Somme) in February 1785; his death took place at
                    Paris in October 1845.</p>
                <p>His great experimental discovery was the heating or <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0502-0481"/><hi rend="italic">cooling</hi> of the junctions in
                    a heterogeneous circuit of metals according to the direction in which an
                    electric current is made to pass round the circuit (1834). This reversible
                    effect is proportional directly to the strength of the current, not to its
                    square, as is the irreversible generation of heat due to resistance in all parts
                    of the circuit. It is found that, if a current pass from an external source
                    through a circuit of two metals, it <hi rend="italic">cools</hi> one junction
                    and heats the other. It cools the junction if it be in the same direction as the
                    thermo-electric current which would be caused by directly heating that junction.
                    In other words, the passage of a current from an external source produces in the
                    junctions of the circuit a distribution of temperature which leads to the
                    weakening of the current by the superposition of a thermo-electric current
                    running in the opposite direction. The true importance of this so-called
                    “Peltier effect” in the explanation of thermoelectric currents was first clearly
                    pointed out by Joule; and Sir W. Thomson (see vol. viii. p. 97) further extended
                    the subject by showing, both theoretically and experimentally, that there is
                    something closely analogous to the Peltier effect when the heterogeneity is due,
                    not to difference of quality of matter, but to difference of temperature in
                    contiguous portions of the same material. Shortly after Peltier’s discovery was
                    published, Lenz effected by means of it the freezing of small quantities of
                    water by the cold developed in a bismuth-antimony junction when a voltaic
                    current was passed through the metals in the order named.</p>
                <p>Peltier’s other papers, which are numerous, are devoted in great part to
                    atmospheric electricity, waterspouts, cyanometry and polarization of sky-light,
                    the temperature of water in the spheroidal state, and the boiling-point at great
                    elevations. There are also a few devoted to curious points of natural history.
                    But his name will always be associated with the thermal effects at junctions in
                    a voltaic circuit, a discovery of importance quite comparable with those of
                    Seebeck and Cumming.</p>
