                    III. and of Catherine, was born on the 2d of October 1754. During the early part
                    of his life he was treated with great harshness by his mother, who had usurped
                    the throne and did not allow him to take any part in the government. There is
                    little doubt that she did not intend him to succeed, but her -will was burnt by
                    one of Paul’s adherents. His days were spent in retirement, with the exception
                    of a tour which he made in the west of Europe in the year 1780. He was twice
                    married, first, in 1773, to Augusta, princess of Hesse Darmstadt, who died three
                    years afterwards, leaving no issue; secondly, in 1776, to Dorothea Sophia,
                    princess of Würtemberg, who was received into the Greek Church as Maria
                    Feodorovna. Paul Petrovich ascended the throne on the death of his mother
                    Catherine, 17th November 1796. One of his first acts was to cause the body of
                    his father to be exhumed from the Nevski monastery and buried with the empress
                    his wife in the Petropavlovski church among the rest of the czars. Orloff and
                    the other persons implicated in Peter’s assassination were compelled to follow
                    the coffins, <pb break="no"

                    chief ministers of the new emperor were Rostopchin and Arakchéeff. Paul now gave
                    signs of a benevolent disposition; among other acts of generosity he set at
                    liberty Kosciusko, who had been detained a prisoner at St Petersburg. He,
                    however, revived many obsolete imperial privileges which were offensive to the
                    nobility, and became unpopular by introducing German regulations into the army.
                    He altered the <hi rend="italic">oukaz</hi> (ukase) of Peter the Great which
                    made the succession to the throne dependent upon the will of the reigning
                    sovereign, and declared it inherent in the eldest son. In 1798 he was appointed
                    grandmaster of the order of the Knights of Malta. Alarmed at the progress of the
                    French Republic, he joined Turkey, England, Austria, and Naples in a coalition
                    against Bonaparte. To command the Russians, the veteran Suwaroff was summoned
                    from his rural retreat, to which he had been banished in consequence of making
                    some satirical verses on the new regulations which had been introduced by Paul.
                    For the campaigns of the Russian general, the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Russia</hi> may be consulted. It may suffice to say here that he, triumphant at
                    first, was eventually compelled to retreat, and was recalled by Paul. He died in
                    disgrace in the year 1800. Soon afterwards the capricious emperor completely
                    changed his plans. Having been flattered by Bonaparte, he secretly made
                    overtures to him and quarrelled with England, seizing English vessels and goods
                    which happened to be in the Russian ports. Bonaparte now entered into an
                    agreement with Paid, whereby they should simultaneously invade the English
                    possessions in India. But the coalition was broken up by the assassination of
                    the Russian emperor in the night of 23d to 24th March 1801, which Bonaparte had
                    the meanness to declare in the <hi rend="italic">Moniteur</hi> had been planned
                    by the English. The story of his death is well known: he was strangled in the
                    Mikhailovski Palace by Zouboff, Pahlen, and other conspirators. Their original
                    object appears to have been only to make him abdicate. An interesting account of
                    the events immediately preceding the emperor’s death has been given by General
                    Sabloukoff, who was on duty that evening at the palace. The empress Maria
                    survived till 1828.</p>
                <p>The solution of the incongruities of the character of Paul seems to lie in the
                    fact that he was more or less insane. Hence his outbursts of cruelty in such
                    cases as those of the pastor Seidler and Kotzebue, alternating with generosity,
                    as in his treatment of Kosciusko and other Poles. Englishmen are familiar with
                    some of his mad pranks from the highly interesting travels of Edward Clarke, who
                    suffered from the despot’s caprice. Among other whimsicalities, Kotzebue tells
                    us that he seriously proposed that the sovereigns of Europe should settle their
                    differences by single combat. He had so imperilled the position of the country
                    by his extravagance and eccentric policy that his death, however unjustifiable
                    the means, seemed almost a necessity. All Russia breathed afresh when Alexander
                    II. ascended the throne.</p>
                <p>The only event of the reign of Paul of permanent importance to Russia was the
                    annexation of Georgia in 1799.</p>
