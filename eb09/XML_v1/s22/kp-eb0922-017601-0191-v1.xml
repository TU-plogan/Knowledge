                    (1752-1812), English painter and mezzotint engraver, a son of Thomas Smith of
                    Derby, the landscape painter, was born in 1752. He was apprenticed to a linen
                    draper in Derby, and afterwards pursued the same business in London, adding,
                    however, to his income by the production of miniatures. He then turned to
                    engraving, and executed his plate of the Public Ledger, which had great
                    popularity, and was followed by his mezzotints of Edwin the Minstrel (a portrait
                    of Thomas Haden), after Wright of Derby, and Mercury Inventing the Lyre, after
                    Barry. He reproduced some forty of the works of Reynolds, some of these plates
                    ranking among the masterpieces of the art of mezzotint, and he was appointed
                    engraver to the Prince of Wales. Adding to his artistic pursuits an extensive
                    connexion as a print-dealer and publisher, he would soon have acquired wealth
                    had it not been for his dissipated habits. He was passionately attached to
                    field-sports, pugilism, and the stage, and was a boon companion of George
                    Morland, whose figure-pieces he excellently mezzotinted. He executed many
                    original portraits in chalks, and painted subject-pictures such as the
                    Unsuspecting Maid, Inattention, and the Moralist, exhibiting in the Royal
                    Academy from 1779 to 1790. Upon the decline of his business as a printseller he
                    made a tour as an itinerant portrait painter through the northern and midland
                    counties of England, producing much hasty and indifferent work, and settled in
                    Doncaster, where he died on 2d March 1812.</p>
                <p>As a mezzotint engraver Smith occupies the very first rank. His<pb break="no"
