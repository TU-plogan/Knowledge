                    incorrect, for one of the first principles of zoological nomenclature has always
                    been that a generic term, to be valid, must be defined. In the absence of
                    definition such a term may be, by courtesy, occasionally accepted; but this
                    courtesy has never been, nor except in America is likely to be, extended to the
                    misapplication here in question.</p></note> Returning, usually already paired,
                    to its summer-haunts, after its winter-sojourn in southern lands, and generally
                    reaching England about the first week in April, it at once repairs to its old
                    quarters, nearly always around the abodes of men; and, about a month later, the
                    site of the nest is chosen, resort being had in most cases to the very spot that
                    has formerly served the same purpose—the old structure, if still remaining,
                    being restored and refurnished. So trustful is the bird that it commonly
                    establishes itself in any of men’s works that will supply the necessary
                    accommodation, and a shed, a barn, or any building with an open roof, a
                    chimney<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hence the common
                    English name of “Chimney-Swallow.” In North America it is usually the
                    “Barn-Swallow.”</p></note> that affords a support for the nest, or even the room
                    of an inhabited house—if chance should give free access thereto, —to say nothing
                    of extraordinary positions, may be the place of its choice. Wheresoever placed,
                    the nest is formed of small lumps of moist earth, which, carried to the spot in
                    the bird’s bill, are duly arranged and modelled, with the aid of short straws or
                    slender sticks, into the required shape. This is generally that of a
                    half-saucer, but it varies according to the exigencies of the site. The
                    materials dry quickly into a hard crust, which is lined with soft feathers, and
                    therein are laid from four to six white eggs, blotched and speckled with grey
                    and orange-brown deepening into black. Two broods are usually reared in the
                    season, and the young on leaving the nest soon make their way to some leafless
                    bough, whence they try their powers of flight, at first accompanying their
                    parents in short excursions on the wing, receiving from them the food themselves
                    are as yet unable to capture, until able to shift for themselves. They collect
                    in flocks, often of many hundreds, and finally leave the country about the end
                    of August or early in September, to be followed, after a few weeks, by their
                    progenitors. The Swallows of Europe doubtless pass into Africa far beyond the
                    equator,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>It must be
                    noted that the Swallow has been observed in England in every month of the year;
                    but its presence from the beginning of December to the middle of March is an
                    extremely rare occurrence.</p></note> and those of Northern Asia, though many
                    stop in India or Burmah, even further to the southward, occasionally reaching
                    Australia, while those of North America extend their winter-wanderings to
                    southern Brazil; but, whithersoever they then resort, they during that season
                    moult their feathers, and this fact affords one of the strongest arguments
                    against the popular belief (which, curious to say, is still partly if not fully
                    entertained by many who should know better) of their becoming torpid in winter,
                    for a state of torpidity would suspend all animal action.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Taking the word Swallow in a more extended sense, it is used for all the members

                    perhaps, with that required for an understanding of the results at which he has
                    arrived. Nothing can better shew the difficulty of unravelling the many puzzles
                    which the Family offers than this; and it is to be hoped that in his
                    finely-illustrated <hi rend="italic">Monograph</hi> which is now in course of
                    publication he will succeed in clearing up some of them.</p></note> excepting a
                    few to which the name <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin</hi> (vol. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">xv.</hi> p. 581) has been applied, and this Family includes
                    from 80 to 100 species, which have been placed in many different genera. The
                    true Swallow has very many affines, some of which range almost as widely as
                    itself docs, while others seem to have curiously restricted limits, and much the
                    same may be said of several of its more distant relatives. But altogether the
                    Family forms one of the most circumscribed and therefore one of the most natural
                    groups of <hi rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> having no near allies; for, though in
                    outward appearance and in some habits the Swallows bear a considerable
                    resemblance to <hi rend="smallcaps">Swifts</hi><hi rend="italic">(q. v.</hi>),
                    the latter belong to a very different Order, and are not Passerine birds at all,
                    as their structure, both internal and external, proves. It has been sometimes
                    stated that the <hi rend="italic">Hirundinidae</hi> have their nearest relations
                    in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Flycatchers</hi> (vol. ix. p. 351); but the
                    assertion is very questionable, and the supposition that they are allied to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Ampelidae</hi> (<hi rend="italic">cf</hi>. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Waxwing),</hi> though possibly better founded, has not as yet
                    been confirmed by any anatomical investigation. An affinity to the Indian and
                    Australian <hi rend="italic">Artamus</hi> (the species of which genus are often
                    known as Wood-Swallows, or Swallow-Shrikes) has also been suggested; and it may
                    turn out that this genus, with its neighbours, may be the direct and less
                    modified descendants of a generalized type, whence the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hirundinidae</hi> have diverged; but at present it would seem as if the
                    suggestion originated only in the similarity of certain habits, such as swift
                    flight and the capacity of uninterruptedly taking and swallowing insect-food on
                    the wing.</p>
                <p>Swallows are nearly cosmopolitan birds, inhabiting every considerable country
                    except New Zealand, wherein only a stray example, presumably from Australia,
                    occasionally occurs. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
