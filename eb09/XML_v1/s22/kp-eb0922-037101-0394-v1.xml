                <p><label type="entry">SPARTACUS</label>, the leader of a formidable insurrection of
                    slaves against Rome in the 1st century <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> was a
                    Thracian by birth, and perhaps a descendant of the kings of Panticapaeum whose
                    name he bore. He served in the Roman army, but seems to have deserted, for we
                    are told that he was taken prisoner and sold as a slave. Destined for the arena,
                    he, with a band of his fellow-gladiators, broke out of a training-school at
                    Capua and took refuge on Mount Vesuvius (73 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi>
                    Here he maintained himself as a captain of brigands, his lieutenants being
                    Crixus and Oenomaus, who like himself had been gladiators. Their numbers soon
                    swelled through the accession of runaway slaves and desperados from the
                    neighbourhood. A hastily-collected force of 3000 men under Claudius endeavoured
                    to besiege and starve out the rebels, but the latter clambered down the
                    precipices and put the Romans to flight. Swarms of hardy and desperate men now
                    joined the rebels, and when the praetor Publius Varinius took the field against
                    them he found them entrenched like a regular army on the plain. But they gave
                    him the slip, and when he advanced to storm their lines he found them deserted.
                    From Campania the rebels marched into Lucania, a country better suited for
                    guerilla warfare. Here, in spite of the commands and entreaties of Spartacus,
                    the slaves committed excesses of lust and cruelty. Varinius followed him, but
                    was defeated in several engagements and narrowly escaped being taken prisoner.
                    Spartacus, whose heart was “where his rude cottage by the Danube lay,” now
                    endeavoured to push northward. His object was to cross the Alps and allow the
                    slaves, who were mostly Thracians, Germans, and Gauls, to disperse to their
                    homes. But intoxicated by success his wild followers refused to listen to him;
                    their thoughts were all of plunder, and their track was marked by the
                    devastation of Italy. Vola, Nuceria, Thurii, Metapontum, were sacked with every
                    circumstance of savage cruelty. In this serious position of affairs the senate
                    despatched both consuls against the rebels (72 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi>
                    The German slaves under Crixus, who had separated from the rest, were defeated
                    and cut in pieces at Mount Gargarus in Apulia by the praetor Arrius. But
                    Spartacus overthrew both consuls, one after the other, and then pressed towards
                    the Alps. Cassius, governor of Cisalpine Gaul, and the praetor Manlius flung
                    themselves in his way at the head of 20,000 men, but were trampled under foot.
                    Freedom was within sight, but with fatal infatuation the slaves declined to
                    abandon Italy. Spartacus led them against Rome, but their hearts seem to have
                    failed them, for the capital was not attacked. Spartacus then occupied the port
                    of Thurii and tried to procure supplies of iron and bronze, probably through the
                    pirates. He also endeavoured by means of the herds of horses captured in
                    southern Italy to form a body of cavalry. The conduct of the war against
                    Spartacus, together with eight legions, was now committed to the praetor Marcus
                    Crassus. He restored discipline by decimating the first troops that ran before
                    the enemy. In the next battle Spartacus was worsted and retreated towards the
                    straits of Messina, intending to cross into Sicily, where he would have been
                    welcomed by fresh hordes of slaves; but the pirates who had agreed to transport
                    his army proved faithless. Crassus endeavoured to shut in the rebels by carrying
                    a ditch and rampart right across the peninsula, a distance of 32 miles. But on a
                    wintry night Spartacus forced the lines, and once more Italy lay at his feet.
                    Disunion, however, was at work in the rebel camp. The Gauls and Germans had
                    again drawn off from the main body. Crassus attacked and destroyed them.
                    Spartacus was now fain to secure a retreat into the mountains of Petelia (near
                    Strongoli∙ in Calabria), and succeeded in inflicting a reverse on the pursuing
                    army. But his men refused to retreat farther, and in a pitched battle which
                    followed soon afterwards the rebel army was annihilated. Spartacus, who had
                    stabbed his horse before the battle began, fell sword in hand. A body of the
                    rebels which had escaped from the field was met and cut in pieces by Pompey,
                    who, with his usual knack of reaping where other men had sowed, claimed and
                    received the credit of having put an end to the war (71 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.).</hi> Six thousand slaves, who had not found a soldier’s death, were

                <p>A history of the war against Spartacus has to he pieced together with much
