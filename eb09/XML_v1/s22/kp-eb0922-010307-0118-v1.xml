                <p><label type="entry">SIXTUS IV</label>. (Francesco della Rovere), pope from 1471
                    to 1484, was born 21st July 1414, near Savona. The statements respecting his
                    parents’ situation in life are very conflicting. In consequence of a vow made by
                    his mother he entered the Franciscan order at an early age, and speedily
                    acquired a great reputation for eloquence and learning. After filling several
                    minor offices he became general of his order, and in 1467 was to his own
                    surprise made cardinal by Paul II., at the recommendation, it is asserted, of
                    Cardinal Bessarion. When, upon Paul’s death in 1471, the rigour of Bessarion’s
                    principles prevented his profiting by the favourable sentiments of influential
                    cardinals, who, nevertheless, expected to be recompensed for their suffrages,
                    Rovere seems to have been found more accommodating. The liberality of his
                    donations after his election, at all events, raised suspicion; but the
                    friendship of Bessarion has also been enumerated among the causes of the sudden
                    elevation of the most recent member of the Sacred College. He was elected on 9th
                    August 1471, and immediately proceeded to lavish Paul’s treasures— partly in
                    laudable preparations against the Turks; partly in embassies, receptions of
                    foreign princes, public improvements, and other expenses possibly imprudent, but
                    at least not indecorous; partly, without any excuse, upon his unworthy nephews,
                    Count and Cardinal Riario. The prodigalities of the latter surpassed all
                    measure, and he compromised his uncle much more seriously by his complicity in
                    the conspiracy of the Pazzi, aiming at the assassination of the Medici family.
                    Sixtus was cognizant of the plot, but had positively forbidden the shedding of
                    blood, which he must nevertheless have known to be inevitable. He deserves still
                    more censure for entering into a fruitless and inglorious war with Florence,
                    which terminated in 1480, after having kept Italy for two years in confusion.
                    Scarcely was it over when he allowed himself to be involved in yet more
                    troublesome and discreditable contests,—first inciting the Venetians to attack
                    Ferrara, and then, after having been delivered by their general Roberto
                    Malatesta from a Neapolitan invasion, turning round upon them and eventually
                    assailing them on their refusal to desist from the hostilities which he had
                    himself instigated. He relied on the co-operation of Lodovico Sforza, who
                    speedily forsook him; and the scandal was witnessed of the secular princes and
                    cities of Italy agreeing to a peace which the Father of Christendom did his best
                    to thwart, and vexation at which was believed to have hastened his death. He
                    died, at all events, a few days afterwards, 13th August 1484, leaving an
                    unfortunate reputation as the first pope who brought nepotism into politics,
                    and, not content with enriching his relatives by gifts and lucrative offices,
                    made their aggrandizement the principal object of his policy as a secular
                    prince. His private character was nevertheless estimable: he was pious, of
                    blameless morals, hospitable and munificent to a fault, and so exempt from
                    avarice, says his secretary Conti, that he could not endure the sight of money.
                    His faults were those of a monk who had no natural outlet for strong affections
                    except unworthy relatives, and who had been called from a cloister to fill the
                    most conspicuous position in the world. His secular policy was capricious and
                    spasmodic; he neither maintained the peace of Italy like his predecessor and
                    successor nor carried out a consistent and well-considered scheme of conquest
                    like Alexander VI. He was, notwithstanding, always firm in his resistance to the
                    Turks, and showed magnanimity by aiding his enemy the king of Naples against the
                    common foe of Christendom. The brilliant side of his administration was his
                    munificence as a founder or restorer of useful institutions and a patron of
                    letters and art. He established and richly endowed the first foundling hospital,
                    built and repaired numerous churches, constructed the Sixtine Chapel and the
                    Sixtine Bridge, commissioned paintings on the largest scale, pensioned and<pb

                    immortalized himself as the second founder of the Vatican library. It has been
                    said that the stones alone inscribed with his name would serve to erect a
                    considerable edifice. These great works, however, were not accomplished without
                    grievous taxation and questionable methods of raising money; and Sixtus’s
                    successor expressed the general condemnation of his government when he declared
                    that he for his part would imitate the example of Paul II. Sixtus was succeeded
                    by Innocent VIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r. g.)</hi></p>
