                    >Swartow</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Shan-row</hi>), a port of China, in the
                    province of Kwang-tung, opened to foreign trade in 1869. It is situated at the
                    mouth of the main branch of the river Han, which 30 miles inland flows past the
                    great city of Chow-chu or Tai-chu (Tie-chu), and the surrounding country is more
                    populous and full of towns and villages than any other part of the province.
                    English merchants settled on Double Island in the river as early as 1856; but
                    the city, which is built on ground but recently recovered from the sea, was
                    formerly a mere fishing village. The trade of the port has rapidly increased. In
                    1869 718 vessels of all nations entered or cleared (of 310,500 tons burden), in
                    1884 1387 vessels (1,282,936 tons)—the total value of the trade being
                    respectively £4,800,000 and £5,519,772. The surrounding country is a great
                    sugar-cane district producing annually about 2,000,000 piculs (= 133 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> lb) of sugar, and
                    there is an extensive refinery in the town employing upwards of 600 workmen and
                    possessing a reservoir for 7,000,000 gallons of water. Next in value comes the
                    manufacture of bean-cake, which is also imported in large quanti-<pb break="no"

                    HongKong (total import in 1874, 1,408,384 piculs; in 1884, 2,539,710). Among the
                    leading exports are tea (since about 1872); grass-cloth, manufactured at Swatow
                    from so-called Taiwan hemp (the fibre of the <hi rend="italic">Boehmeria
                    nivea</hi> from Formosa); pine-apple cloth, manufactured in the villages about
                    Kieh-Yang (a town 22 miles distant); oranges, for which the district is famous;
                    cheap fans; and pewter, iron, and tin wares. Swatow is also a great emigration
                    port. In 1870 about 22,000 Chinese embarked there for Singapore, Bangkok, and
                    Saigon; and the number of emigrants has since increased so that British vessels
                    alone carry 50,000 to 53,000 per annum. Of the whole foreign trade of the port
                    upwards of 83 per cent. is in British bottoms, the trade with Hong-Kong being of
                    especial importance. The population of Swatow is upwards of 30,000. In 1874 the
                    foreign residents numbered 147 (63 British), including Double Island.</p>
                <p>About 1865 the whole Swatow district was still divided into a number of
                    “independent townships, each ruled by its own headmen,” and the population was
                    described in the official gazetteer as “generally rebellious and wicked in the
                    highest degree.” Mr Forrest, British consular agent, relates that in that year
                    he was witness to the preparations for a fight between the people living on the
                    opposite sides of the estuary, which was only prevented by an English
                    war-vessel. The Taipings swept over the country, and by their ravages and
                    plundering did much to tame the independence of the clans. The punishment
                    inflicted in 1869 by Commander Jones on the inhabitants of Otingpui
                    (Ou-ting-pei), about 8 miles from Swatow, for the attack they had made on the
                    boats of H.M.S. “Cockchafer,” showed the Chinese authorities that such piratical
                    villages were not so strong as had been supposed. General Fang (a native of
                    Chow-chu-fu) was sent to reduce the district to order, and he carried out his
                    instructions with remorseless rigour.</p>
