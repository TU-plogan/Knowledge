                    administratively the most important of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Straits
                    Settlements</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> which form a separate colonial
                    government. It consists principally of an island 27 miles long by 14 broad,
                    lying off the south end of the Malay Peninsula, but also includes upwards of 70
                    insignificant islets to the south and west within a radius of 10 miles. From the
                    mainland of Johor, as this part of the peninsula is called, Singapore island is
                    separated by a strait, Salat Tabras or Tambrosh, less than half a mile wide at
                    the narrowest point, which was formerly the main channel of navigation to the
                    Chinese seas. The name of Singapore Strait is given to the much wider channel
                    which separates the island on the south from the various islands of Butang,
                    Batang, Bintang, &amp;c., belonging to the Dutch East Indies. The surface of
                    Singapore is undulating, and diversified by hills ranging from 70 to rather less
                    than 400 feet, the highest point being Bukit Timah, to the north-west of the
                    town (about 519 feet). Geologically<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0108-0093"/> the core of the island consists of crystalline
                    rocks; but in the west there are shales, conglomerates, and sandstones; and all
                    round the island the valleys are filled with alluvial deposits on a much more
                    extensive scale than might be looked for where none of the streams have a course
                    of more than six miles, or attain to any considerable size except after heavy
                    rains (see details in J. R. Logan’s “Local and Relative Geology of Singapore,”
                    in <hi rend="italic">Jour. Beng. Asi. Soc.,</hi> vol. xvi., and “The Geology of
                    the Straits of Singapore,” in <hi rend="italic">Lond. Geol. Jour.,</hi> 1851,
                    vol. vii.). The southwestern shores are fringed with coral reefs, and living
                    coral fields are found in many parts of the strait. Being chiefly composed of
                    red clays and laterite, the soil is not generally rich, and requires careful and
                    liberal husbandry to make it really productive. When it was first occupied by
                    the English the whole island was covered with forest and jungle; and, although
                    this was largely cleared off subsequent to 1837, when a mania for nutmeg
                    plantations set in, the moisture and warmth of the climate have kept it clothed
                    with luxuriant and perpetual verdure, in which palms, ferns, and orchids are
                    conspicuous forms. “Near the shore, by the mouths of creeks, are grouped quaint
                    dwellings of fishermen, built of wood or palm leaf standing on piles over the
                    water. In the smooth sandy bays cocoa-nut palms shelter picturesque Malay
                    houses. More inland we find groves of fruit trees, small patches of sugar-cane,
                    Chinese gardens, tapioca and indigo fields. Neat bungalows—the residences of
                    officials, merchants, and rich Chinese and Arabs—diversify the scene,
                    particularly in the vicinity of the town. In the remote parts of the island more
                    especially there are waste spaces which were formerly gambier plantations and
                    are now covered with coarse lalang grass” (Governor Wild). The nutmeg trees
                    which had for twenty years been a main source of wealth were blighted in 1860;
                    the plantations were completely given up; and, though many of the abandoned
                    trees recovered and nutmegs can still be gathered in Singapore, they have never
                    again been cultivated. Cotton-planting was next tried, but without success, and
                    though cinnamon grows well the labour necessary for its cultivation and
                    manufacture is too expensive. Gutta percha, originally introduced to England
                    from Singapore, was so much run upon that all the trees of that kind in the
                    island were exterminated. Gambier and pepper, both at one time largely grown,
                    have for many years been of little account. Liberian coffee, pine-apples,
                    cocoa-nuts, and aloes are now the most important objects of cultivation. Quite
                    recently districts have been enclosed for reforestation and the eucalyptus and
                    other trees have been planted. Almost all kinds of fruits do well in the
                    island,—the custard-apple, pine-apple, sour-sop, lime, orange, and plantain
                    being in season nearly all the year, and the durian, blimbing, duku, langsat,
                    mangosteen, rambutan, tarrup, tampang, &amp;c., in July and August and also for
                    all or some of the months between November and February. The botanical and
                    zoological gardens at Singapore, connected with the Agri-Horticultural Society,
                    have been devoted to the introduction of economic plants, such as China and
                    Assam tea, salt-bush or <hi rend="italic">Rhagodia,</hi> which forms excellent
                    fodder, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In climate Singapore is wonderfully fortunate for a country within one degree of
                    the equator. There is hardly any seasonal change, and the annual range of
                    temperature is generally only from 70° to 90°. “The nights especially are very
                    cool and refreshing, and enable people to sleep without difficulty.” The
                    atmosphere is almost uniformly serene, and the face of the ocean is only
                    disturbed by the swell of distant tempests in the China Sea or the Bay of
                    Bengal. The north-east monsoon is the master wind from November to April, but is
                    generally neither persistent nor powerful, and the south-west monsoon is even
                    less regular in its action. The southerly winds in May and June known as Java
                    winds have very much the character of land and sea breezes, but are considered
                    very enervating in spite of the pleasant feeling of freshness which they at
                    first produce. Rapid squalls (sumatras) also occur during the south-west monsoon
                    and beneficially clear the air. Instead of periodical rains there are (on a
                    sixteen years’ average) 167 wet days distributed throughout the year. The annual
                    rainfall is 92∙27 inches; 1885, a very dry year, showed only 69 inches,
                    according to Dr Rowell’s report. The mean maximum temperature in the shade is
                    86°∙7, the mean minimum in the shade 73°. The highest temperature observed
                    during the sixteen years was 94° in April 1878, and the lowest 65° in February
                    1874. Most of the domestic animals of Europe have been introduced, but not in
                    great numbers. Deer, wild hogs, sloths, monkeys, and squirrels are the more
                    noteworthy mammals; and tigers, which formerly committed serious depredations
                    among the natives, still occasionally find their way across the strait from the
                    mainland. When the first census was taken in 1824 the settlement of Singapore
                    was found to contain 10,603 inhabitants, and by 1850 this number had increased
                    to nearly 60,000. The following figures show the more important components of
                    the population in 1860, 1871, and 1881,—the totals for those years being 80,792,
                    97,111, and 139,208 respectively :—</p>

                <p>The total is estimated to be now well over 150,000. The preponderance and rapid
                    increase of the Chinese is a most striking feature, mainly due, however, to a
                    steady stream of immigration. The death-rate in Singapore is very much higher
                    than the birthrate—4473 being the average number of deaths in 1881-83 against
                    1919 births. This is largely to be ascribed to the paucity of women —33,785
                    females to 105,423 males in 1881. In the small number of Europeans
                    proper—1283—there are nineteen nationalities represented.</p>
                <p>The only town in the settlement is the city of Singapore, the general capital of
                    the Straits Settlements. It lies on the south side of the island in 1° 16' N.
                    lat. and 103° 53' E. long., a bright, picturesque, prosperous, and progressive
                    place, with a sea-frontage extending for about 6 miles from New Harbour
                    north-east to the Rochore and Kallang suburbs. Under the control of its
                    municipality, which has a yearly revenue of more than 300,000 dollars, a great
                    variety of improvements have been effected—the river dredged and deepened,
                    foreshores reclaimed, bridges built, trees planted, and public buildings
                    erected—within the last six or seven years. The principal churches, the
                    court-house, and the European quarters generally are situated on the north side
                    of the river, while on the south side extend the warehouses and shops of the
                    European and Chinese traders. On Peel Hill, 170 feet high, stands a citadel; and
                    on Government Hill is the Government house—a palatial residence in park-like
                    grounds. The cosmopolitan character of the population gives great brightness of
                    colour to the crowded streets and is reflected in the architectural
                    peculiarities of the native quarters —where Mohammedan mosques, Chinese
                    joss-houses, and Hindu temples are equally at home. Among the more important
                    European edifices are St Andrew’s cathedral (first consecrated in 1838, present
                    building erected in 1861, became cathedral in 1870), the Roman Catholic
                    cathedral, the supreme court-house, the new post office (1883-84), the new
                    police courts (1884), the European hospital, the jail, the Tanglin barracks, and
                    the Raffles school (dating from 1823). The Raffles public library and museum had
                    320 subscribers in 1885 and 34,250 visitors, the books issued numbering 16,348.
                    Several English papers, as well as one Chinese and one Malay, are published at
                    Singapore. As a trading-port Singapore has great advantages over and above its
                    position on the Straits. The harbour is safe and has good anchorage, and it can
                    be approached without the assistance of pilots from three directions. New
                    Harbour is the name of the channel which lies between the southern projection of
                    the main island and the small island of Blakan Mati, and is divided by the still
                    smaller island of Ayer Brazi. It is there that the Peninsular and Oriental Steam
                    Navigation Company and the Messageries Maritimes have their docks and depôts. At
                    Tanjong Pagar there are two graving docks,—Victoria Dock having a length of 450
                    feet, a breadth of 65 feet, and a sill-depth at spring-tides of 20 feet, and the
                    corresponding figures for Albert Dock being 470 feet, 60 feet, and 21 feet. The
                    two New Harbour Docks are respectively 415 and 459 feet long, and 42 and 62 feet
                    broad, and have sill-depths of 14-15 ½ and 19-20 feet. At Pulo Brani, Bon Accord
                    Dock has a length of 330 feet, a breadth of 50, and a sill-depth of 17. A large
                    admiralty dock for the use of ships of the British navy is being constructed.
                    Opposite Singapore proper the sea shallows to a few fathoms. The tides (tables
                    of which were first published in 1884) are as yet imperfectly registered, but in
                    general they consist of a principal high-water and low-water succeeded by a
                    secondary high water and low water of the most limited range.<pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0109-0094"/> The commercial movement of the port has rapidly
                    attained vast dimensions. While in 1851-52 the total exports and imports
                    amounted to £5,739,556, they reached £10,371,300 in 1859-60, £18,292,180 in
                    1870, £23,050,943 in 1880, and £25,931,930 in 1883. There is no railway in the
                    island; but in 1886 a steam tramway was opened from Tanjong Pagar to Elgin
                    Bridge. Till quite recently the town was practically without defences , hut
                    since 1885 the colony has constructed a series of batteries at Sera-pong, Blakan
                    Mati, Mount Palmer, &amp;c., at a cost of £75,000, and the home Government has
                    expended £90,000 on the ordnance.</p>
                <p>The name Singapore or Sinhapura, <hi rend="italic">i.e</hi>., Lion City, was
                    originally given to a town founded by Hinduized Malay or Javanese settlers from
                    Sumatra at an early date in the Christian era. The commercial importance of the
                    place in the 14th century is attested by Barros, but the Sanskrit origin of the
                    name had by his time been forgotten, and he was taught to derive it from Malay
                    words. Not long afterwards the town must have fallen into decay, and at the
                    begin <hi rend="underline">nin</hi> g of the present century the only trace of
                    its existence was certain rock-inscriptions in a very old character, and the
                    whole island had not more than 150 inhabitants. Alexander Scott recognized the
                    excellent position of the island in the 18th century, and Sir Stamford Baffles,
                    whose attention was called to it by Captains Ross and Crawford of the Bombay
                    marine, fixed on it as the site of the great commercial emporium which he
                    determined to found for the encouragement of British trade in the East. In 1819
                    permission was obtained to build a British factory on the south coast; and in
                    1824 the island was purchased from the sultan of Johor for 60,000 Spanish
                    dollars (£13,500) and a life annuity of 24,000 dollars (£5400). The city became
                    the capital of the Straits Settlements instead of Prince of Wales Island in
                    1832.</p>
