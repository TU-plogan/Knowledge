                    (1803-1859), engineer, son of the preceding by his first wife Fanny Henderson,
                    was born at Willington Quay, 16th October 1803. Remembering his own early
                    difficulties owing to deficient instruction, his father bestowed special care on
                    his education, sending him in his twelfth year to attend Mr Bruce’s school in
                    Percy Street, Newcastle, where he remained about four years. In 1819 he was
                    apprenticed to a coalviewer at Killingworth to learn the business of the
                    colliery, after which, to perfect his training in technical science, he was sent
                    in 1822 to attend the science classes at the university of Edinburgh. On his
                    return he assisted his father in the survey of various railway lines, but in
                    1824 he accepted an engagement to take charge of the engineering operations of
                    the Columbian Mining Association of London. On account of the harassing
                    difficulties of the situation he resigned it in 1827, and after his return to
                    England undertook the management of his father’s factory in Newcastle, greatly
                    aiding him in the improvement of his locomotives, the result being the
                    construction of the “Rocket,” which firmly established the practicability of
                    steam locomotion on railways. Subsequently his services were in great request as
                    a railway engineer, and after the retirement of his father he was regarded as
                    the chief authority on the subject. In this connexion his most remarkable
                    achievements were his railway viaducts on the tubular system, constructed with
                    the aid of the practical knowledge of Sir William Fairbairn, and justly
                    characterized as “the greatest discovery in construction in our day.” Among his
                    more notable bridges are the Royal Border bridge at Berwick-on-Tweed, the
                    high-level bridge at Newcastle-on-Tyne, the Britannia tubular bridge over the
                    Menai Straits, the Conway tubular bridge, and the Victoria tubular bridge over
