                <p><label type="entry">SYNEDRIUM</label> (<hi rend="italic">συvέδpιov</hi>), a Greek
                    word which means “assembly” and is especially used of judicial or representative
                    assemblies, is the name by which (or by its Hebrew transcription, םנחדין, <hi
                    rend="italic">sanhedrin, sanhedrim)</hi> that Jewish body is known which in its
                    origin was the municipal council of Jerusalem, but acquired extended functions
                    and no small authority and influence over the Jews at large (see vol. xiii. p.
                    424 <hi rend="italic">sq.).</hi> In the Mishnah it is called “the sanhedrin,”
                    “the great sanhedrin,” “the sanhedrin of seventy-one [members],” and “the great
                    court of justice” (<hi rend="italic">bêth dîn haggadôl).</hi> The oldest
                    testimony to the existence and constitution of the synedrium of Jerusalem is
                    probably to be found in 2 Chron, xix. 8; for the priests, Levites, and
                    hereditary heads of houses there spoken of as sitting at Jerusalem as a court of
                    appeal from the local judicatories does not correspond with anything mentioned
                    in the old history, and it is the practice of the Chronicler to refer the
                    institutions of his own time to an origin in ancient Israel. And just such an
                    aristocratic council is what seems to be meant by the gerusia or senate of
                    “elders” repeatedly mentioned in the history of the Jews, both under the Greeks
                    from the time of Antiochus the Great (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xii. 3,
                    3) and under the Hasmonean high priests and princes. The high priest as the head
                    of the state was doubtless also the head of the senate, which, according to
                    Eastern usage, exercised both judicial and administrative or political functions
                    (comp. 1 Mac. xii. 6, xiv. 20). The exact measure of its authority must have
                    varied from time to time, at first with the measure of autonomy left to the
                    nation by its foreign lords and afterwards with the more or less autocratic
                    power claimed by the native sovereigns.</p>
                <p>As has been shown in vol. xiii. p. 424 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> the original
                    aristocratic constitution of the senate began to be modified under the later
                    Hasmoneans by the inevitable introduction of representatives of the rising party
                    of the Pharisees, and this new element gained strength under Herod the Great,
                    the bitter enemy of the priestly aristocracy.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The name <hi rend="italic">synedrium</hi>
                    first appears under Hyrcanus II. (Jos., <hi rend="italic">Ant.,</hi> xiv. 9,
                    4).</p></note> Finally under the Roman procurators the synedrium was left under
                    the presidency of the chief priest as the highest native tribunal, though
                    without the power of life and death (John xviii. 31). The aristocratic element
                    now again preponderated, as appears from Josephus and from the New Testament, in
                    which “chief priests” and “rulers” are synonymous expressions. But with these
                    there sat also “scribes” or trained legal doctors of the Pharisees and other
                    notables, who are simply called “elders” (Mark xv. 1). The Jewish tradition
                    which regards the synedrium as entirely composed of rabbins sitting under the
                    presidency and vice-presidency of a pair of chief doctors, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nasi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ab beth din,</hi><note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The former word properly means the sovereign
                    and the latter the president of the tribunal. The false traditional application
                    is post-Mishnic.</p></note> is quite false as regards the true synedrium. It was
                    after the fall of the state that a merely rabbinical <hi rend="italic">beth
                    din</hi> sat at Jabneh and afterwards at Tiberias, and gave legal responses to
                    those who chose to admit a judicature not recognized by the civil power.
                    Gradually this illegal court usurped such authority that it even ventured to
                    pronounce capital sentences,—acting, however, with so much secrecy as to allow
                    the Roman authorities to close their eyes to its proceedings (Origen, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ep. ad Afr.,</hi> § 14). That this was possible will appear less
                    surprising if we remember that in like manner the synedrium of Jerusalem was
                    able to extend an authority not sanctioned by Roman law over Jews beyond Judaea,
                    <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in Damascus (Acts ix. 2; xxii. 5).</p>
                <p>The council-chamber (<hi rend="italic">βουλή)</hi> where the synedrium usually
                    sat was between the Xystus and the temple, probably on the temple-hill, hut
                    hardly, as the Mishnah states, within the inner court. The meeting in the palace
                    of the high priest which condemned our Lord was exceptional. The proceedings
                    also on this occasion were highly irregular, if measured by the rules of
                    procedure which, according to Jewish tradition, were laid down to secure order
                    and a fair trial for the accused.</p>
