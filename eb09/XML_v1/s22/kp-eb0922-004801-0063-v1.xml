                <p><label type="entry">SIGISMUND</label> (1362-1437), German emperor, was born on
                    14th February 1362. After the death of his father, the emperor Charles IV., he
                    received the margraviate of Brandenburg; and his betrothal with Mary, the
                    daughter and heiress of Louis of Poland and Hungary, gave him a right to look
                    forward to the succession in these two countries. But in 1383, when Louis died,
                    the Poles chose Hedwig, Mary’s sister, as their queen; and Sigismund was unable
                    to marry Mary and to secure the crown of Hungary until 1387, as her rights had
                    been seized by Charles of Durazzo, and after his death she had been made
                    prisoner by the ban of Croatia. Sigismund was soon involved in a war with the
                    Turks, and in order to obtain the means of carrying on the struggle he gave
                    Brandenburg in pledge to his cousin Jobst of Moravia. Defeated at Nicopolis in
                    1396, Sigismund fled to Greece; and in his absence his wife died. When he
                    returned to Hungary the people rose against him, made him prisoner, and gave the
                    crown to Ladislaus of Naples. Sigismund escaped, and having sold the Altmark,
                    which he had inherited from his brother John, he was able to collect an army and
                    to crush the Hungarian rebellion. Meanwhile his brother Wenceslaus, king of the
                    Romans, had been deposed, and Rupert of the Palatinate was chosen as his
                    successor. In 1410 Rupert died, and Sigismund and Jobst of Moravia were both
                    elected to the crown. Jobst died in the following year, and then Sigismund was
                    universally recognized as king. One of the chief events of his reign was the
                    assembling of the council of Constance, which met for the purpose of bringing
                    the great schism in the church to an end. Sigismund marred his services in
                    connexion with the council by assenting to the burning of John Hus, to whom he
                    had granted a safe conduct. For this treachery he had to pay a heavy penalty,
                    for it led indirectly to the Husite War, which raged for about sixteen years. In
                    1435 peace was restored, and Sigismund obtained possession of Bohemia. In 1415
                    he gave Brandenburg, which had been restored to him after Jobst’s death, in fief
                    to Frederick, burgrave of Nuremberg; and in 1423, in reward for services
                    rendered in the Husite War, Frederick, margrave of Meissen, received the duchy
                    of Saxony with the electoral dignity. Sigismund was crowned emperor in 1433,
                    having obtained the Italian crown two years before. He died at Znaim in Moravia
                    on 9th December 1437. He possessed considerable intellectual ability, but he
                    never did full justice to his powers,—being recklessly extravagant and of a
                    wayward and impulsive temper.</p>
