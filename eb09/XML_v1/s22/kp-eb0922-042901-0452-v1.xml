                <p><label type="entry">SPONSOR</label>. The presence of some suitable sponsor or
                    sponsors to give the answers required and undertake the vows involved would seem
                    to be almost essential to the right administration of the sacrament of baptism,
                    in the case of infants at least. In this aspect, however, as in many others, the
                    early history of the development of the rite of baptism remains obscure. The
                    Greek word for the person undertaking this function is <hi rend="italic"
                    >ἀνάδοχος,</hi> to which the Latin <hi rend="italic">susceptor</hi> is
                    equivalent. The word “sponsor” in this ecclesiastical sense occurs for the first
                    time, but incidentally only, and as if it were already long familiar, in
                    Tertullian’s treatise <hi rend="italic">De Baptismo</hi> (c. 18), where, arguing
                    that in certain circumstances baptism may conveniently be postponed, especially
                    in the case of little children, he asks, “For why is it necessary that the
                    sponsors likewise should be thrust into danger, who both themselves by reason of
                    mortality may fail to fulfil their promises, and may also be disappointed by the
                    development of an evil disposition [in those for whom they become sponsors]?”
                    There is nothing to make it unlikely that the sponsors here alluded to may have
                    been in many cases the actual parents, and even in the 5th century it was not
                    felt to be inappropriate that they should be so; Augustine, indeed, in one
                    passage appears to speak of it as a matter of course that parents should bring
                    their children and answer for them “tanquam fidejussores” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Epist. . . . ad Bonif,</hi> 98). The comparatively early appearance, however,
                    of such names as <hi rend="italic">com-patres, commatres, propatres, promatres,
                    patrini, matrinae</hi> is of itself sufficient evidence, not only that the
                    sponsorial relationship had come to be regarded as a very close one, but also
                    that it was not usually assumed by the natural parents. How very close it was
                    held to be is shown by the Justinianian prohibition of marriage between
                    godparents and godchildren. On the other hand, the anciently allowable practice
                    of parents becoming sponsors for their own children seems to have lingered until
                    the 9th century, when it was at last formally prohibited by the council of Mainz
                    (813). For a long time there was no fixed rule as to the necessary or allowable
                    number of sponsors, and sometimes the number actually assumed was large. By the
                    council of Trent, however, it was decreed that one only, or at most two, these
                    not being of the same sex, should be permitted. The rubric of the Church of
                    England according to which “there shall be for every male child to be baptized
                    two godfathers and one godmother, and for every female one godfather and two
                    godmothers,” is not older than 1561; in the <hi rend="italic">Catechism</hi> the
                    child is taught to say that he received his name from his “godfathers and
                    godmothers.” At the Reformation the Lutheran churches retained godfathers and
                    godmothers, but the Reformed churches reverted to what they believed to be the
                    more primitive rule, that in ordinary circumstances this function should be
                    undertaken by a child’s proper parents. All churches, it may be added, of course
                    demand of sponsors that they be in full communion. In the Church of Rome
                    priests, monks, and nuns are disqualified from being sponsors, either “because
                    it might involve their entanglement in worldly affairs,” or more probably
                    because every relationship of fatherhood or motherhood is felt to be in their
                    case inappropriate.</p>
