                <p><label type="entry">STRYPE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1643-1737),
                    historian and biographer, was the son of John Strype or Van Stryp, a native of
                    Brabant, who to escape religious persecution went to England, and settled near
                    London, in a locality afterwards known as Strype’s Yard, formerly in the parish
                    of Stepney, but subsequently annexed to that of Christ Church, Spitalfields.
                    Here he carried on the business of a merchant and silk throwster. The son was
                    born 1st November 1643. He was educated at St Paul’s School, and on 5th July
                    1662 entered Jesus College, Cambridge. Thence he proceeded to Catherine Hall,
                    where he graduated B.A. in 1665 and M.A. in 1669. On the 14th July of the latter
                    year he was preferred to the curacy of Theydon-Bois, Essex, and a few months
                    afterwards was chosen curate and lecturer of Low Leyton in the same county. On
                    account of the smallness of the salary, the patron allowed the people to choose
                    their own minister, the vacancy in the vicarage remaining unfilled during the
                    life of Strype. He was never instituted or inducted, but in 1674 he was licensed
                    by the bishop of London to preach and expound the word of God, and to perform
                    the full office of priest and curate during the vacancy of the vicarage. In his
                    later years he obtained from Archbishop Tenison the sinecure of Tarring, Sussex,
                    and he discharged the duties of lecturer at Hackney till 1724. When he became
                    infirm he took up his residence with Mr Harris, an apothecary at Hackney, who
                    had married his daughter, and died there 11th December 1737, at the advanced age
                    of ninety-four.</p>
                <p>At an early period of his life Strype obtained access to the papers of Sir
                    Michael Hicks, secretary to Lord Burghley, from which he made extensive
                    transcripts; he also carried on an extensive correspondence with Archbishop Wake
                    and Bishops Burnet, Atterbury, and Nicholson. The materials thus obtained formed
                    the basis of his historical and biographical works, which relate chiefly to the
                    period of the Reformation. The greater portion of his original materials have
                    been preserved, and are included in the</p>
                <p>Lansdowne manuscripts in the British Museum. His works can scarcely be entitled
                    original compositions, his labour having consisted chiefly in the arrangement of
                    his materials, but on this very account they are of considerable value as
                    convenient books of reference, easier of access and almost as trustworthy as the
                    original documents. Besides a number of single sermons published at various
                    periods, he was the author of an edition of Lightfoot’s <hi rend="italic"
