                    (1635-1699), a con spicuous figure in the church of the Restoration, was
                    descended from the Stillingfleets of Stillingfleet, in the neighbourhood of
                    York, and was born at Cranbourne in Dorset on the 17th April 1635. There and at
                    Ringwood he received his preliminary education, and at the age of thirteen was
                    entered at St John’s College, Cambridge, as Isaac Barrow five years before and
                    at the same age had been entered at Peterhouse. He took his bachelor’s degree in
                    1652, and in the following year was elected to a fellowship. After residing as
                    tutor first in the family of Sir Roger Burgoin in Warwickshire and then with the
                    Hon. Francis Pierrepont in Nottingham, he was in 1657 presented by the former to
                    the living of Sutton in Bedfordshire. Here he brought to completion and
                    published (1659) his <hi rend="italic">Irenicum,</hi> in which he sought to give
                    expression to the prevailing weariness of faction and to find some
                    ecclesiastical compromise in which all could conscientiously unite. Schemes of
                    comprehension were then the most familiar topics of conversation. There seemed
                    every probability that a moderate Episcopacy might attract all parties; and it
                    was to be expected that a learned and able scholar fresh from the atmosphere of
                    Cambridge Platonism should desire to help present entanglements towards a
                    liberal solution. Much may still be learned from his cogent and earnest
                    exposition of the great principle that it is unwarrantable for the church to
                    make other conditions of her communion than our Saviour did of discipleship. In
                    1662 he reprinted the <hi rend="italic">Irenicum</hi> with an appendix, in which
                    he sought to prove that “the church is a distinct society from the state, and
                    has divers rights and privileges of its own,.. . resulting from its constitution
                    as a Christian society, and that these rights of the church cannot be alienated
                    to the state after their being united in a Christian country.” In the same year
                    the country gave its answer to his and all similar proposals in the Act of
                    Uniformity, which, by requiring that all clergymen should be episcopally
                    ordained and should use the revised liturgy, lost to the church of England such
                    men as Richard Baxter, John Howe, and Philip Henry. Stillingfleet’s actions were
                    as liberal as his opinions. He sheltered in his rectory at Sutton one ejected
                    minister and took for another a large house to be used as a school. But, as time
                    wore on, his liberalism degenerated and gave occasion to Howe’s remark that the
                    rector of Sutton was a very different person from the dean of St Paul’s. But,
                    though in 1680 he published his <hi rend="italic">Unreasonableness of
                    Separation,</hi> his willingness to serve on the ecclesiastical commission of
                    1689, and the interpretation he then proposed of the damnatory clauses of the
                    Athanasian creed, are proof that to the end he leaned towards toleration.
                    Another work which Stillingfleet published in 1662 won for him the confidence
                    and admiration of his church. This was his <hi rend="italic">Origines Sacrae, or
                    a Rational Account of the Christian Faith as to the Truth and Divine Authority
                    of the Scriptures and the Matters therein contained.</hi> Rendered obsolete
                    though it be by the general advance of the discussion, this apologetic made a
                    deep impression at the time, and rapid preferment followed its publication.</p>
                <p>Henchman, bishop of London, employed him to write a vindication of Laud’s answer
                    to Fisher the Jesuit. In 1665 the earl of Southampton presented him to St
                    Andrew’s, Holborn; two years later he became prebendary of St Paul’s, in 1668
                    chaplain to Charles II., in 1670 canon residentiary and in 1677 dean of St
                    Paul’s. Finally, but under different auspices, he was consecrated bishop of
                    Worcester 13th October 1689. During these years he was ceaselessly engaged in
                    controversy with Nonconformists, Romanists, Deists, and Socinians. His
                    unrivalled and various learning, his dialectical expertness, and his massive
                    judgment rendered him a formidable antagonist; but the respect entertained for
                    him by his opponents was chiefly aroused by his recognized love of truth and
                    superiority to personal considerations. He had the courage, along with the
                    saintly and noble-minded Ken and the other six bishops, to incur the anger of
                    James II. by resisting his proposed Declaration of Indulgence (1688). Strangely
                    enough, he crossed swords both with Dryden and Locke,—with Dryden in connexion
                    with the papers favourable to the authority of the Church of Rome which were
                    found in the strong box of Charles II. and were supposed to have been written by
                    him, and with Locke because the theologian considered that the philosopher’s
                    definition of substance was prejudicial to the doctrine of the Trinity. In most
                    of his writings there is a small residuum of permanent value. The range of his
                    learning is most clearly seen in his <hi rend="italic">Bishops’ Right to Vote in
                    Parliament in Cases Capital.</hi> His <hi rend="italic">Origines Britannicae, or
                    Antiquities of the British Church</hi> (1685), is a surprising mixture of
                    critical and uncritical research; and his <hi rend="italic">Discourse concerning
                    the True Reason of the Sufferings of Christ</hi> (1669), written in answer to
                    Crellius, contains a most forcible statement of the doctrine of Christ’s
                    substitution. So handsome in person as to have earned the sobriquet of “the
                    beauty of holiness,” Stillingfleet was twice married,—first to Andrea, daughter
                    of William Dobbyns of Wormington, by whom he had two daughters, who died in
                    infancy, and one son; afterwards to Elizabeth, daughter of Sir Nicholas Pedley,
                    by whom he had seven children. He died in his house at Westminster, 28th March
                    1699, and was buried in his own cathedral, where a handsome monument briefly
                    records his virtues. His library was bought by Marsh, archbishop of Armagh, to
                    form the foundation of a public library in Dublin.</p>
                <p>A collected edition of his works, with life prefixed, was published in London
                    (1710); and a most useful edition of <hi rend="italic">The Doctrines and
                    Practices of the Church of Rome Truly Represented</hi> was published in 1845 by
                    Dr Cunningham.</p>
