                <p><label type="entry">SIBYL</label>. Certain women who prophesied under the
                    inspiration of a deity were called by the Greeks Sibyls. The inspiration
                    manifested itself outwardly in distorted features, foaming mouth, and frantic
                    gestures. The notion that hysterical, convulsive, and epileptic affections are
                    proof of divine inspiration has been common all over the world (see Tylor’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Primitive Culture,</hi> ii. p. 131 <hi rend="italic">sq</hi>.) <hi
                    rend="italic">.</hi> Homer does not refer to a Sibyl, nor does Herodotus. The
                    first Greek writer, so far as we know, who does so is Heraclitus (flourished
                    about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> As to the number and native countries
                    of the Sibyls much diversity of opinion prevailed, as is evinced by the
                    contradictory statements of ancient writers. Aristophanes, Plato, and the author
                    of the θαυμάσια ακούσματα, attributed to Aristotle, appear to know of only one
                    Sibyl. Heraclides Ponticus, a pupil of Plato, seems to be the first writer who
                    distinguished several Sibyls,—the Erythraean, the Phrygian, and the
                    Hellespontine. Later writers speak of two, three, four, eight, ten, and twelve.
                    Pausanias (x. 12) enumerates four. According to him, the oldest was the
                    Libyan<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>There is a gap in
                    the text of Pausanias, and his meaning is not quite certain.</p></note> Sibyl, a
                    daughter of Zeus and Lamia. The second was Herophile, a native of Marpessus or
                    Erythrae in the Troad; she lived mostly in Samos, but visited Clarus, Delos, and
                    Delphi. She lived before the Trojan War, which she is said to have predicted.
                    The third was the Sibyl of Cumae in Italy, and the fourth was a Hebrew Sibyl
                    called Sabbe; others, however, called the last-mentioned Sibyl a Babylonian or
                    Egyptian. According to Plutarch (<hi rend="italic">De Pyth. Orac.,</hi> 9), the
                    first Sibyl was she of Delphi. Varro enumerates ten Sibyls,—the Persian, Libyan,
                    Delphic, Cimmerian, Erythraean, Samian, Cuman, Hellespontine, Phrygian, and
                    Tiburtine. The Sibyl of whom we hear most was the Sibyl of Cumae, whom Aeneas
                    consulted before his descent to Hades. She was supposed to live 1000 years. It
                    was she who sold to Tarquin the Proud the Sibylline books. She first offered him
                    nine; when he refused them, she burned three and offered him the remaining six
                    at the same price; when he again refused them, she burned three more and offered
                    him the remaining three still at the same price. Tarquin then bought them. They
                    were entrusted to a college of fifteen men (<hi rend="italic">quindecemviri
                    sacris faciundis</hi>), who preserved them and consulted them on occasions of
                    national danger. It would seem that they were consulted with a view to discover,
                    not exact predictions of definite future events, but the religious observances
                    necessary to avert extraordinary calamities and expiate prodigies. They were
                    written in hexameter verse and in Greek; hence the college of curators was
                    always assisted by two Greek interpreters. The books were kept in the temple of
                    Jupiter on the Capitol and shared the destruction of the temple by fire in 83
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> After the restoration of the temple the senate
                    sent ambassadors in 76 to Erythrae to collect the oracles afresh and they
                    brought back about 1000 verses; others were collected in Ilium, Samos, Sicily,
                    Italy, and Africa. In the year 12 Augustus sought out and burned a great many
                    spurious oracles and subjected the Sibylline books to a critical revision; they
                    were then placed by him in the temple of Apollo Patrous, where we hear of them
                    still existing in 363. They seem to have been burned by Stilicho shortly after
                    400. According to the researches of Klausen (<hi rend="italic">Aeneas und die
                    Penates,</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n27/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0922-0027-0014"/> Hamburg, 1839-40), the oldest collection of
                    Sibylline oracles appears to have been made about the time of Solon and Cyrus at
                    Gergis on Mount Ida in the Troad; it was attributed to the Sibyl of Marpessus
                    and was preserved in the temple of Apollo at Gergis. Thence it passed to
                    Erythrae, where it became famous. It was this very collection, it would appear,
                    which found its way to Cumae and from Cumae to Rome.</p>
                <p>The collection of so-called Sibylline oracles which has descended to us is
                    obviously spurious, bearing marks of Jewish and Christian origin. Ewald assigns
                    the oldest of them to about 124 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> and the latest to
                    about 668-672 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> They have been edited by Friedlieb
                    (Leipsic, 1852) and Alexandre (2d ed., Paris, 1869). For an examination of the
                    different lists of Sibyls, see E. Maass, <hi rend="italic">Be Sibyl-larum
