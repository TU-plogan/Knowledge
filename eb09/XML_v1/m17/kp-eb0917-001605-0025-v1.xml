                    (1752-1809), an eminent Swiss historian, was born on 3d January 1752 at
                    Schaffhausen, where his father was a clergyman and rector of the gymnasium. In
                    1769 he went to the university of Göttingen in order to study theology; but,
                    under the influence of Schlözer, he devoted himself chiefly to historical
                    research. Having passed his theological examination, he was made professor of
                    Greek at the Schaffhausen gymnasium in 1772; and in the same year he published
                    his first work, <hi rend="italic">Bellum</hi><hi rend="italic">Cimbricum.</hi>
                    By the advice of Bonstetten, his most intimate friend, he went in 1774 to
                    Geneva, where he acted for some time as a tutor in the house of a councillor of
                    state. At Schaffhausen he had begun to study carefully the sources of Swiss
                    history, and at Geneva he continued his investigations with increasing ardour.
                    Lectures on universal history which he delivered during this period formed the
                    basis of his <hi rend="italic">Vierundzwanzig Bücher allgemeiner
                    Geschichten,</hi> one of his most brilliant writings. In 1780 appeared the first
                    volume of his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Schweizer,</hi> a work which placed him immediately in the front rank of the
                    historical writers of his day. During a visit to Berlin he had an interview with
                    Frederick the Great, from whom he hoped to receive an appointment worthy of his
                    genius and reputation. Disappointed in this expectation, he accepted the
                    professorship of the science of statistics at Cassel, where he wrote his <hi
                    rend="italic">Reisen der Päpste.</hi> In 1786, having spent two years partly at
                    Bonstetten’s country seat and partly in Bern, he entered the service of the
                    elector of Mainz, by whom he was rapidly promoted to important offices in the
                    state. He was also ennobled and made a knight of the empire (Reichsritter). At
                    Mainz he issued several books, besides the second volume of his History of the
                    Swiss Confederation. When Mainz was occupied by the French in 1792 Müller
                    settled in Vienna, where he remained for twelve years, being connected with the
                    imperial library from 1800. Failing to receive the promotion to which he thought
                    he was entitled, and being forbidden after the appearance of the third volume of
                    his Swiss History to continue the publication of the work, he went in 1804 to
                    Berlin, where he became historiographer and a councillor of war. In Berlin he
                    finished the fourth volume of his <hi rend="italic">Geschichte der</hi><hi

                    of free institutions, but he now modified his convictions; and in 1807 he
                    accepted from Napoleon the office of secretary of state in the kingdom of
                    Westphalia. Early in 1808 he was transferred at his own request to the office of
                    director-general of public instruction. On 29th May 1809 he died at Cassel.</p>
