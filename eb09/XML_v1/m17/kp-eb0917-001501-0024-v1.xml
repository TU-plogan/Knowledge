                    >Mulhouse),</hi> the chief town of a circle and the industrial centre of Upper
                    Alsace, Germany, lies between the Ill, an affluent of the Rhine, and the
                    Rhine-Rhone Canal, about 56 miles to the south of Strasburg and 18 to the
                    north-west of Basel. The old town, surrounded by arms of the Ill, has narrow and
                    irregular streets, while to the south, on the canal, lie the handsome villas and
                    fine promenades of the new town. Most of the older buildings have had to make
                    way for manufactories, so that the town-house, dating from 1552, is an almost
                    solitary witness to the town’s mediaeval prosperity. The Roman Catholic church
                    of St Stephen, the new Protestant church, the building of the Société
                    Industrielle, and the new Musée are the most prominent modern buildings. The
                    educational institutions include a gymnasium, modern schools, technical schools
                    for the various handicrafts, and an academy in which designers are trained for
                    the textile industries of the town. The most important interest of Mülhausen
                    centres in the making of cotton and muslin goods, and calico-printing. This
                    industry was introduced in 1746, and has since steadily prospered in the hands
                    of several wealthy families which are closely connected by intermarriage and
                    lend each other a firm and powerful financial support. From 20,000 to 24,000
                    hands in the town and upwards of 60,000 in the neighbourhood are engaged in
                    textile manufactures, the products of which are exported to all parts of the
                    world. The manufactures of machinery, locomotives and railway plant, chemicals,
                    and hardware are also important. A very noteworthy feature connected with the
                    rise of the commercial prosperity of the town is the attention paid by the
                    manufacturers to the wellbeing of their workpeople. In 1853 John Dollfuss, mayor
                    of the town, founded the “workman’s quarter” to the northeast of the old town,
                    which now consists of about 1000 model buildings, with public bath-, wash-, and
                    bake-houses, <pb break="no"

                    by which the occupant becomes the owner after the payment of a certain number of
                    monthly instalments. Besides this more prominent effort, which has been the
                    model for similar attempts in many other towns, a “Société Industrielle” for the
                    encouragement of original discovery and invention among the workmen has existed
                    since 1825, and there are various benevolent societies, including a large
                    institution with 250 beds for the reception of aged workmen. Mülhausen also
                    carries on an active trade in grain, wine, colonial produce, and timber, which
                    is much facilitated by its fine river harbour. After the annexation of Alsace to
                    Germany in 1871 the French sympathies of the inhabitants were shown by the
                    extraordinary decrease in the number of its inhabitants. The population has now,
                    however, regained its full proportions, amounting in 1880 to 63,629, of whom
                    47,395 were Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p>Mentioned as early as 717, Mülhausen was raised to the rank of a free town of the
                    empire in 1198, and received very extensive privileges from Rudolph of Hapsburg
                    in 1273. It suffered considerably in the various wars of the Middle Ages, but
                    generally managed to maintain its independence. In 1446 it expelled its nobles
                    and formed an alliance with Switzerland, and this became a permanent union in
                    1515. By the peace of Westphalia (1648) it was recognized as an independent ally
                    of the Swiss League. In 1798 it sought incorporation with France from motives of
                    commercial policy, and in 1871 it passed to Germany.</p>
