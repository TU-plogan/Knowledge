                <p><label type="entry">MUIR, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1810-1882),
                    Sanskrit scholar, was born on 5th February 1810 in Glasgow, where his father,
                    William Muir, was a merchant. He was educated at the grammar school of Irvine,
                    the university of Glasgow, and the East India Company’s college at Haileybury.
                    He went to India in 1828, and served with distinction in various offices, as
                    assistant secretary to the board of revenue, Allahabad, as magistrate and
                    collector at Azimgarh, as principal of the Victoria College, Benares, and as
                    civil and session judge at Futtehpoor. He was throughout remarkable for his zeal
                    in cultivating and encouraging the study of Sanskrit, in finding methods and
                    furthering schemes for the enlightenment and amelioration of the Hindus. He was
                    persuaded that the only way in which they could escape from the tyranny of
                    caste, -with all its attendant evils, was by being made to know how they had
                    become what they were, and also how the freer and more civilized Western peoples
                    believed and lived. He worked assiduously at the organization and development of
                    the higher education of India, and endeavoured to stimulate the learned classes
                    to the study of their own most ancient literature, and of the religious and
                    philosophical literature of the West. He did while in India much work in both
                    departments, and was the occasion of still more being done both by Hindus and
                    Europeans. In 1853 he retired from the service and settled in Edinburgh, where
                    he may be said to have continued under more favourable conditions his Indian
                    labours. In 1862 he endowed the chair of Sanskrit in the university of
                    Edinburgh, and was the main agent in founding the Shaw fellowship in mental
                    philosophy. He was a D.C.I.. of Oxford, LL.D, of Edinburgh, and Ph.D. of Bonn.
                    He died 7th March 1882.</p>
                <p>In 1858 appeared vol. i. of his <hi rend="italic">Original Sanskrit Texts</hi>
                    (2d ed. 1868); it was on the origin of caste, an inquiry intended to show that
                    it did not exist in the Vedic age. Vol. ii. (1st ed. 1860, 2d 1871) was
                    concerned with the origin and racial affinities of the Hindus, exhibiting all
                    the then available evidences of their connexion, their linguistic, social, and
                    political kinship, with the other branches of the Indo-European stock. Vol. iii.
                    (1st ed. 1861, 2d 1868) was on the Vedas, a full and exhaustive inquiry as to
                    the ideas of their origin, authority, and inspiration held both by the Vedic and
                    later Indian writers. Vol. iv. (1st ed. 1863, 2d 1873) was a comparison of the
                    Vedic with the later representations of the principal Indian deities, an
                    exhibition of the process by which three gods hardly known to the Vedic hymns
                    became the deities of the former Hindu Trimurti. Vol. v. (1870) was on the Vedic
                    mythology. These texts form still our most exhaustive work on the Vedic age, and
                    show better than any others the point from which the peculiar religious and
                    political development of India started. Dr Muir was also the author of a volume
                    of <hi rend="italic">Metrical Translations from the Sanskrit,</hi> an anonymous
                    work on <hi rend="italic">Inspiration,</hi> several works in Sanskrit, and many
                    essays in the <hi rend="italic">Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society</hi> and
                    elsewhere.</p>
