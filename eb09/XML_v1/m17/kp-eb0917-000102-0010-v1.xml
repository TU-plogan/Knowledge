                <p><label type="entry">MOTHER-OF-PEARL</label>. The shells of many molluscous
                    animals display a brilliant pearly and iridescent lustre, resulting from the
                    peculiar manner in which the layers of calcareous matter of which they are
                    composed have been successively formed. Such shells, even when small in size,
                    form bright and, specially to the untutored eye, attractive ornaments, and as
                    such are used for necklaces and similar purposes. When the shells are of
                    sufficient size to cut and shape for purposes of utility, they become an article
                    of some commercial importance under the name of Mother-of-Pearl. This term,
                    though applicable to all pearly shells, is in commerce principally applied to
                    the shells of the bivalve pearl-mussel <hi rend="italic">Afeleagrina</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">margaritifera,</hi> which is <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0011-0002"/> the principal source of the commercial product.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Meleagrina</hi><hi rend="italic">margaritifera</hi> is a
                    native of tropical seas, and is found around the coasts of all the lands within
                    the tropics. The shells vary in size, the largest reaching to about the
                    dimensions of a dessert plate, with a weight of from 1 to 1∣ tt&gt;. They also
                    vary in colour to a considerable extent, some being dark and smoky round the
                    outer edge with little iridescence, others dark but possessing a rich play of
                    colours, and the greater part pearly white with varying iridescence. The
                    principal sources of supply are the islands of the East Indian archipelago, the
                    Pacific islands, the north-west Australian coast, the Persian and Red Seas, and
                    the Gulf of Panama. The largest and steadiest consumption of mother-of-pearl is
                    in the button trade, and much is also consumed by cutlers for handles of fruit
                    and dessert knives and forks, pocket-knives, &amp;c. It is also used in the
                    inlaying of Japanese and Chinese lacquers, European lacquered papier-mâché work,
                    trays, &amp;c., and as an ornamental inlay generally. In an innumerable variety
                    of small and fancy articles mother-of-pearl is also employed, its use being
                    limited only by the moderate dimensions and thickness of material obtainable,
                    and its rather brittle nature. The carving of pilgrim shells and the elaboration
                    of crucifixes and ornamental work in mother-of-pearl is a distinctive industry
                    of the monks and other inhabitants of Bethlehem. Among the South Sea Islands the
                    shell is largely fashioned into fishing-hooks, a purpose for which its brilliant
                    conspicuous appearance appears to render it suitable without the addition of any
                    bait or other lure. Among shells other than those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meleagrina</hi><hi rend="italic">margaritifera</hi> used as mother-of-pearl may
                    be mentioned the Green Ear or Ormer shell <hi rend="italic">(Haliotis
                    tubercu-latd)</hi> and several other species of Haliotis, besides various
                    species of Turbo.</p>
                <p>The pearl-shell fishery is an important industry on the north and north-west
                    coasts of Australia, producing about 800 tons yearly, valued at over £100,000,
                    the Papuan islanders of Torres Straits being employed as divers under European
                    supervision, with skilled appliances. The shell of the golden-tipped variety of
                    Avicula found here is much more valuable than the dark-edged one of the South
                    Seas. The value of the fisheries depends much more on the shell than on the
                    occasional pearls found, which indeed are sometimes, along with the “fish,” a
                    perquisite of the diver; but on the west coast, about Shark’s Bay, a smaller
                    variety of the same mollusc produces valuable pearls, their exciting cause being
                    possibly present there in greater abundance. That the pearl itself is not due to
                    disease, or to the presence of any irritating cause, seems clear from the fact
                    that the mollusc can reject it at will, and often does so when taken (for which
                    reason the diver, in seizing him, at once places his hand over the opening so as
                    to close the shell); but it is believed now that the pearl is secreted and held
                    ready to be dissolved by the powerful acid of the sac, and spread in nacreous
                    layers over the spot irritated by the borer <hi rend="italic">(Pholax sp.
                    ).</hi> Accordingly pearls are seldom found in the young “fish,” whose shells
                    are much harder outside, and not susceptible to such attacks. A mass of nacreous
                    layers formed round a point of irritation or “blister” can sometimes be cut out
                    of the shell, and might easily be mistaken for (and sold as) a pearl, but it is
                    never quite perfect all round and is always hollow. Sometimes, after having
                    secured the loose pearls, the fishermen deposit the mollusc again, unharmed, in
                    a secure and accessible locality, and repeat the process for three and four
                    years successively.</p>
