                <p><label type="entry">MUSK-OX</label>. The animal commonly known by this name,
                    though approaching in size the smaller varieties of oxen, is in structure and
                    habits closely allied to the sheep, its affinities being well expressed by the
                    generic name <hi rend="italic">Ovibos</hi> bestowed upon it by De Blain ville.
                    The specific name <hi rend="italic">Moschatus,</hi> as also the common English
                    appellatives “musk-ox,” “musk-buffalo,” or “musk-sheep” applied to it by various
                    authors, refer to the musky odour which the animal exhales. This does not appear
                    to be due to the secretion of a special gland, as in the case of the Musk-deer;
                    but it must be observed that, except as regards the osteology, very little is
                    known of the anatomy of this species.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ovibos moschatus</hi> about equals in size the small</p>
                <p>Welsh and Scotch cattle. The head is large and broad. The horns in the old males
                    have extremely broad bases, meeting in the median line, and covering the brow
                    and whole crown of the head. They are directed at first downwards by the side of
                    the face and then turn upwards and forwards, ending in the same plane as the
                    eye. Their basal halves are of a dull white colour, oval in section and coarsely
                    fibrous; their middle part smooth, shining, and round; their tips black. In the
                    females and young males the horns are smaller, and their bases are separated
                    from each other by a space in the middle of the forehead. The ears are small,
                    erect, and pointed, and nearly concealed in the hair. The space between the
                    nostrils and the upper lip is covered with short close hair, as in sheep and
                    goats, without any trace of the bare “muffle” of oxen. The greater part of the
                    animal is covered with long brown hair, thick, matted, and curly on the
                    shoulders, so as to give the appearance of a hump, but elsewhere straight and
                    hanging down,—that of the sides, back, and haunches reaching as far as the
                    middle of the legs and entirely concealing the very short tail. There is also a
                    thick woolly under-fur, shed in the summer. The hair on the lower jaw, throat,
                    and chest is long and straight, and hangs down like a beard or dewlap, though
                    there is no loose fold of skin in this situation as in oxen. The limbs are stout
                    and short, terminating in unsymmetrical hoofs, the external being rounded, the
                    internal pointed, and the sole partially covered with hair.</p>
                <p>The Musk-ox is at the present day confined to the most northern parts of North
                    America, where it ranges over the rocky barren grounds between the 60th parallel
                    and the shores of the Arctic Sea. Its southern range is gradually contracting,
                    and it appears that it is no longer met with west of the Mackenzie river, though
                    formerly abundant as far as Eschscholtz Bay. Northwards and eastwards it extends
                    through the Parry Islands and Grinnell Land to north Greenland, reaching on the
                    west coast as far south as Melville Bay; and it was also met with in abundance
                    by the German polar expedition of 1869-1870 at Sabine Island on the east coast.
                    No trace of it has been found in Spitzbergen or Franz Joseph Land. As proved by
                    the discovery of fossil remains, it ranged during the Pleistocene period over
                    northern Siberia and the plains of Germany and France, its bones occurring very
                    generally in river deposits along with those of the reindeer, mammoth, and
                    woolly rhinoceros. It has also been found in ordinary Pleistocene gravels in
                    several parts of England, as Maidenhead, Bromley, Freshfield near Bath, Barnwood
                    near Gloucester, and also in the lower brick earth of the Thames valley at
                    Crayford, Kent.</p>
                <p>It is gregarious in habit, assembling in herds of twenty or thirty head, or,
                    according to Hearne, sometimes eighty or a hundred, in which there are seldom
                    more than two or three full-grown males. They run with considerable speed,
                    notwithstanding the shortness of their legs. Major H. W. Feilden, naturalist to
                    the Arctic Expedition of 1875, says: “No person watching this animal in a state
                    of nature could fail to see how essentially ovine are its actions. When alarmed
                    they gather together like a flock of sheep herded by a collie dog, and the way
                    in which they pack closely together and follow blindly the vacillating
                    leadership of the old ram is unquestionably sheep-like. When thoroughly
                    frightened they take to the hills, ascending precipitous slopes and scaling
                    rocks with great agility.” They feed chiefly on grass, but also on moss,
                    lichens, and tender shoots of the willow and pine. The female brings forth one
                    young one in the end of May or beginning of June after a gestation of nine
                    months. According to Sir J. Richardson, “when this animal is fat its flesh is
                    well tasted, and resembles that of the caribou, but has a coarser grain. The
                    flesh of the bulls is highly flavoured, and both bulls and cows when lean smell
                    strongly of musk, their flesh at the same time being very dark and tough, and
                    certainly far inferior to that of any other ruminating animal existing in North
                    America.” The carcase of a Musk-ox weighs, exclusive of fat, above 3 cwt. On
                    this subject Major Feilden says: “The cause of the disagreeable odour which
                    frequently taints the flesh of these animals has received no elucidation from my
                    observations. It does not appear to be confined to either sex, or to any
                    particular season of the year; for a young unweaned animal, killed at its
                    mother’s side and transferred witni <hi rend="subscript"> v</hi> n an hour to
                    the stew-pans, was as rank and objectionable as any. The flesh of some of these
                    animals of which I have partaken was dark, tender, and as well flavoured as that
                    of four-year old Southdown mutton” <hi rend="italic">{Zoologist,</hi> September
