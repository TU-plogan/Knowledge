                    >Thaddeus</hi> (1746-1817), Polish patriot, was descended from an old family of
                    small proprietors in the province of Lithuania, and was born in 1746. From his
                    father he inherited a taste for music, and in the other branches of education he
                    showed such marked aptitude at the cadet school of Warsaw that along with some
                    other youths he was sent at the expense of the state to complete his education
                    at Versailles, Brest, and Paris. On his return to Poland he was appointed
                    captain of artillery, but on account of the unfortunate result of his attachment
                    to the daughter of a nobleman he in 1777 went to Paris, whence he sailed with
                    the French fleet to aid the North American States in their war of independence.
                    Under Washington he displayed great firmness and intrepidity in various trying
                    circumstances, and rose to be general of a brigade. In 1786 he returned to his
                    native country, where he lived in retirement until the reorganization of the
                    army in 1789, when he was appointed majorgeneral. In the war with Russia which
                    followed the adoption of the new constitution of 1791 he conducted himself with
                    conspicuous valour and skill, and at Dubienka, with a force of only 4000 men,
                    held an army of 20,000 Russians at bay. All his efforts were, however, rendered
                    fruitless by the pusillanimity of King Stanislaus, who in March 1792 agreed to a
                    humiliating peace, upon which Kosciusko along with several other leading
                    officers resigned his commission. A second partition of Poland was consummated
                    in August 1793, but a spirit of resistance gradually gathered force and
                    culminated in the insurrection of 1794, when Kosciusko was recalled to Cracow
                    and appointed generalissimo and dictator. With an army of 5000 he marched to
                    meet the Russians, who were advancing upon Cracow in greatly superior numbers,
                    and after a strenuous conflict of four hours’duration completely defeated them.
                    On receipt of the intelligence Warsaw rose against the Russian authorities,
                    putting 7000 persons to death; and after instituting a new government Kosciusko
                    went in pursuit of the enemy, who retired towards the Prussian frontiers. But
                    for the interposition of Prussia the emancipation of Poland would have been
                    accomplished. King Frederick William, however, advanced against Warsaw with an
                    army of 40,000 men, to which Kosciusko could oppose only 15,000. He was defeated
                    at Szezekocin, but retreated in good order upon Warsaw, which he defended with
                    stubborn persistence, until the diversion of an insurrection in Great Poland
                    caused them to raise the siege. Meantime an immense force of Russians was
                    advancing against Warsaw in two divisions, the one under Suwaroff and the other
                    under Fersen. Kosciusko resolved to attack Fersen before his junction with
                    Suwaroff, but, as he had only 4000 men to meet the 14,000 Russians, his small
                    army was in a few moments completely enveloped by superior numbers, and he
                    himself fighting desperately fell pierced with several wounds. A tradition that
                    as he fell he gave utterance to the words “Finis Poloniøe” found currency
                    several years afterwards, but when it came to his knowledge he indignantly
                    denied it. For two years he remained a prisoner at St Petersburg, but, gaining
                    his liberty after the accession of Paul I., he went to England and then to
                    America. Returning to France in 1798, he took up his residence at Fontainebleau.
                    In 1806 he refused to allow Napoleon, whose professions he rated at their proper
                    value, to use his name to incite a rising in Poland against Russia; and the
                    forged address put forth by Napoleon in his name was never accepted by his
                    countrymen as genuine, although Kosciusko was unable to disavow it until eight
                    years after it was issued. In 1814, when the Russian army entered France on the
                    fall of Napoleon, Kosciusko had a long interview with the emperor Alexander of
                    Russia, who, it is said, promised to him to restore to Poland its ancient
                    boundaries. In 1815 he settled in Switzerland, devoting himself chiefly to
                    agricultural pursuits. His death, October 17, 1817, was the result of an
                    accidental fall from his horse. If as a statesman Kosciusko was more ardent than
                    sagacious, he manifested a skill and daring as a soldier which but for the
                    overwhelming nature of his task would have gained him a place among the most
                    renowned generals of his time, while his noble and chivalrous patriotism,
                    untainted by any desire after self-glorification, has secured him the world’s
                    universal admiration and esteem.</p>
