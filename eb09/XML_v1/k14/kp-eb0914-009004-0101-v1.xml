                <p><label type="entry">KING-TIH CHIN</label>, a town near Foo-leang Heen in the
                    province of Keang-se, China, and the principal seat of the porcelain manufacture
                    in that empire. Being situated on the south bank of the river Chang, it was in
                    ancient times known as <hi rend="italic">Chang-nan Chin,</hi> or “town on the
                    south of the river Chang.” It is unwalled, and stretches along the bank of the
                    river in a somewhat straggling way. The streets are narrow, and crowded with a
                    population which is reckoned at a million, the vast majority of whom find
                    employment at the porcelain factories. Since the Ch’in dynasty (557-589) this
                    has been the great trade of the place, which was then called by its earlier
                    name. In the reign of King-tih of the Sung dynasty (1004-1007) a manufactory was
                    founded there for making vases and objects of art for the use of the emperor.
                    Hence its adoption of its present title. Since the time of the Ming dynasty a
                    magistrate has been specially appointed to superintend the factories and to
                    despatch at regulated intervals the imperial porcelain to Peking. The town is
                    situated on a vast plain surrounded by mountains, and boasts of three thousand
                    porcelain furnaces. These constantly burning fires are the causes of frequent
                    conflagrations, and at night give the city the appearance of a place on fire.
                    The people are as a rule orderly, though they have on several occasions shown a
                    hostile bearing towards foreign visitors. This is probably to be accounted for
                    by a desire to keep their art as far as possible a mystery, and is after all
                    only an extreme interpretation of the law which forbids strangers to lodge in
                    the town. This feeling appears less unreasonable when it is remembered that the
                    two kinds of earth of which the porcelain is made are not found at King-tih
                    Chin, but are brought from K’i-mun in the neighbouring province of Gan-hwuy, and
                    that there is therefore no reason why the trade should be necessarily maintained
                    at that place. The two kinds of earth are known at pih-tun-tsze, which is a fine
                    fusible quartz powder, and kaou-lin, which is not fusible, and which it is said
                    gives strength to the ware (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Kaolin).</hi> Both
                    materials are prepared in the shape of bricks at K’i-mun, and are brought down
                    the Chang to the seat of the manufacture.</p>
