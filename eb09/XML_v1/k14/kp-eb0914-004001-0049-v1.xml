                <p><label type="entry">KENT, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1763-1847),
                    American jurist, was born at Philippi in New York State, July 31, 1763. He
                    graduated at Yale College in 1781, and began to practise law at Poughkeepsie, in
                    1785 as an attorney, and in 1787 at the bar. In 1790 and 1792 Kent was chosen to
                    represent Dutchess county in the State legislature. In 1793 he removed to New
                    York, where Governor Jay, to whom the young lawyer’s Federalist sympathies were
                    a strong recommendation, appointed him a master in chancery for the city. The
                    year 1796 saw Kent again a member of the legislature and professor of law in
                    Columbia College. In 1797 he became recorder of New York, in 1798 judge of the
                    supreme court of the State, in 1804 chief justice, and in 1814 chancellor of New
                    York. In 1822 he became a member of the convention to revise the State
                    constitution. Next year, having attained the age of sixty, Chancellor Kent
                    resigned his office, and was re-elected to his former chair. Out of the lectures
                    he now delivered grew the <hi rend="italic">Commentaries on American Law</hi> (4
                    vols., 1826-30), which by their learning, range, and lucidity of style, have won
                    for him a high and permanent place in the estimation of both English and
                    American jurists. Kent rendered most essential service to American jurisprudence
                    while serving as chancellor. Chancery law had been very unpopular during the
                    colonial period, and had received down to his time but little development, and
                    no decisions had been published. His judgments of this class (see Johnson’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Chancery Reports,</hi> 7 vols., 1816-24) cover a wide range of
                    topics, and are so thoroughly considered and developed as unquestionably to form
                    the basis of American equity jurisprudence. Kent was a man of great purity of
                    character, of singular simplicity and guilelessness in his ways, and is
                    altogether a conspicuous and remarkable figure in American annals. He died in
                    New York, December 12, 1847.</p>
                <p>To Kent we owe several other works (including a <hi rend="italic">Commentary on
                    International Law)</hi> of less importance than the <hi rend="italic"
