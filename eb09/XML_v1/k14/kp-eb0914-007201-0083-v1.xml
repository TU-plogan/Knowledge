                    (1813-1855), the greatest philosophical writer that Scandinavia has produced,
                    was born at Copenhagen, May 5, 1813, and was the seventh child of a respectable
                    Jutland hosier. He was a very serious and precocious boy, weak in health, morbid
                    iu character. Of his mother, singularly enough, he has slid no word in his
                    copious autobiographical remains, although he was in his twenty-second year when
                    she died; she had been his father’s servant Kierkegaard became a student at the
                    university of Copenhagen, and took up theology as a profession, but never became
                    a priest. He lived in great retirement, deeply oppressed with melancholy and
                    physical suffering, and was at first very little known to his contemporaries. In
                    1838 he published his first volume, <hi rend="italic">Papers of a Still Living
                    Man,</hi> a very poor attempt to characterize Hans Andersen. Two years later he
                    took his degree, with a treatise <hi rend="italic">On Irony,</hi> which contains
                    the germs of his later speculations. In 1840 he engaged himself to a young lady,
                    and shortly, after broke off the engagement, an extraordinary step for which he
                    has given many extraordinary reasons. It was not until 1842 that he began the
                    composition of his greatest work, <hi rend="italic">Enten</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—Eller</hi> (“Either—Or ”), on which his reputation mainly rests; this appeared
                    in 1843, and was immediately followed by a rapid succession of philosophical
                    works, which formed at once an epoch in the history of Danish literature. From
                    1849 to 1854, however, he was silent as an author. In the last-mentioned year he
                    published a polemical tract against Bishop Martensen, and the short remainder of
                    his life was spent in a feverish agitation against the theology and practice of
                    the state church. But his health, which had always been miserable, was growing
                    worse and worse. In October 1855 he took u*p his abode in one of the chief
                    hospitals of Copenhagen, where he died, on the 11th of November, at the age of
                    forty-two. His life has been written, with great skill and brilliance, by Dr
                    Georg Brandes (1877). Kierkegaard published about thirty distinct books during
                    his life-time, and left at his death about an equal amount of MS.; a competent
                    analysis of these multifarious labours is given in Brandes’s admirable
                    biography.</p>
