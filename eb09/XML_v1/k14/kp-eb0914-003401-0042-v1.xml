                    rend="smallcaps">Kirkby-in-Kendal</hi></label>, a market-town and parliamentary
                    and municipal borough of Westmoreland, is picturesquely situated in a pleasant
                    valley on the east bank of the Kent or Ken, 44 miles south of Carlisle (50 by
                    rail), and 241 miles from London. The town, which is the largest and most
                    populous in the county, is very irregularly built, but the white-walled houses
                    with their blue-slated roofs, and the numerous trees, give it a very attractive
                    appearance. There are four leading streets, two of which together form a
                    spacious thoroughfare a mile in length. The church of the Holy Trinity, whose
                    oldest part dates from about 1200, is a Gothic edifice with five aisles and α
                    square tower 72 feet high. Kendal contains numerous other churches, a town-hall,
                    a mechanics’ institution, a literary and scientific institution, a museum, and a
                    chamber of commerce. Its charities include a hospital (founded 1870), an old
                    maids' hospital, α girls’ orphanage, almshouses, &lt;fcc. The free grammar
                    school is well endowed; and there are also in the town a well-endowed blue-coat
                    school and hospital, a large national school, a school of science and art, and
                    several Sunday schools, among which is the Greencoat Sunday school, founded in
                    1813. On an eminence to the east of the town are the ruins of Kendal Castle,
                    attributed to the first barons of Kendal. It was the birthplace of Catherine
                    Parr, Henry VIII.’s last queen. On the Castle-law-hill, an obelisk was raised in
                    1788 in memory of the revolution of 1688. The woollen manufactures of Kendal
                    have been noted since the 14th century, when Edward III. established a colony of
                    Flemish weavers in the town; and, although the coarse cloth known to Shakespeare
                    as “Kendal green” is no longer made, its place is more than supplied by active
                    manufactures of tweeds, linsey-wolsey, railway rugs, horse clothing, knitted
                    woollen caps and jackets, worsted and woollen yarns, and similar goods. Other
                    manufactures of Kendal are machine-made boots and shoes, cards for wool and
                    cotton, agricultural and other machinery, paper, and, in the neighbourhood,
                    gunpowder. There are also important marble-works. There is a large weekly market

                <p>Kendal was the head of a barony given by William the Conqueror to Ivo de Talbois.
                    It has given the title of earl to various royal and other personages of English
                    history. The town received its charter from Queen Elizabeth in 1575. A second,
                    granted by Charles I., and confirmed by Charles II., was superseded by the
                    Municipal Act of 1835, according to which the town is governed by six aidermen
                    and eighteen councillors, who select a mayor from among themselves. Quarter
                    sessions are held alternately at Appleby and Kendal. The Reform Act of 1832
                    assigned one member of parliament to Kendal.</p>
