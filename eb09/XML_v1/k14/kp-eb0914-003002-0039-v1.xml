                    (1775-1854), a younger brother of John Philip Kemble noticed below, was born at
                    Brecknock, South Wales, 25th November 1775. Like his brother be was educated at
                    Douai. After returning to England in 1792, he obtained a situation in the
                    post-office, but this he soon resigned for the stage, making his debut at
                    Sheffield as Orlando in <hi rend="italic">As You Like It.</hi> During the early
                    period of his career as an actor, chiefly on account of the great abilities of
                    his sister and brother, he made his way only slowly to public favour. For a
                    considerable time he played along with them, chiefly in secondary parts, and
                    this with a grace and finish which received scant justice from the critics.
                    Ultimately he won independent fame, especially in <hi rend="italic">comédie
                    larmoyante.</hi> His gifts had been disciplined to the utmost degree of
                    perfection of which they were capable, by his liberal mental culture and by
                    refined social intercourse; and such characters as Archer, Doricourt, Charles
                    Surface, and Ranger he played with an airy grace and polished humour that have
                    never been excelled; while he had sufficient fire and energy to give adequate
                    effect to romantic passion and pathos. In genteel comedy he was ably supported
                    by his wife Miss De Camp, whom he married in 1806. His imposing person,
                    classical countenance, and tuneful voice also enabled him to be highly
                    successful in historical drama, some of his principal parts being Alcibiades,
                    Antony, Henry V., and Orestes. The latter period of his career was clouded by
                    money embarrassments in connexion with his joint proprietorship in Covent Garden
                    Theatre. He formally retired from the stage in December 1836, but his final
                    appearance was on April 10, 1840. For some time he held the office of examiner
                    of plays. He died November 12, 1854.</p>
