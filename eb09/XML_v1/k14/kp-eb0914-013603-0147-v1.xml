                <p><label type="entry">KOLÁR, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Col ar</hi></label>, a
                    district of Mysore state, Southern India, lying between 12° 46' and 13° 36' N.
                    lat., and 78° 5' and 78° 35' E. long. It occupies that portion of the Mysore
                    table-land immediately bordering the Eastern Ghâts. The principal watershed lies
                    in the north-west, around the hill of Nandidrug (4810 feet), from which rivers
                    radiate in all directions; and the whole country is broken by numerous hill
                    ranges. The chief rivers are the Pâlâr, the South Pinâkini or Pennâr, the North
                    Pinâkini, and the Pâpaghni, which are industriously utilized for irrigation by
                    means of anicuts and tanks. The rocks of the district are mostly syenite or
                    granite, with a small admixture of mica and felspar. The soil in the valleys
                    consists of a fertile loam; and in the higher levels sand and gravel are found.
                    The hills are covered with scrub, jungle, and brushwood. The only tract where
                    the trees attain any size is in the neighbourhood of Nandidrug, where an area of
                    7 square miles has been reserved by the forest department.</p>
                <p>The population in 1871 was 618,954, spread over an area of 2577 square
                    miles—Hindus numbering 592,652; Mohammedans, 25,038; Jains, 651; and Christians,
                    613. Four towns contain upwards of 5000 inhabitants, namely, Kolar, 9924;
                    Chikballapur, 9882; Siâlghata, 7009; and Hosur, 5711. The staple agricultural
                    products are rice, <hi rend="italic">ragi,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">joar.</hi>
                    Pulses, oil-seed.«, vegetables, and tobacco are also grown on limited areas.
                    Cattle breeding has recently been fostered by the British Government, and large
                    cattle fairs are held annually. The manufactures of the district comprise sugar,
                    silk and cotton weaving, and oil-pressing. Iron ore is smelted in considerable
                    quantities. The principal exports are sugar, rice, <hi rend="italic">vagi,</hi>

                    1873-74 amounted to £119,446, of which £97,470 was derived from the land and
                    paid by 78,247 proprietors of 678 separate estates. The Government aided and
                    inspected schools in 1874 numbered 233, attended by 5547 pupils; in addition
                    there were also 102 unaided schools. The district bears a good reputation for
                    healthiness, the mean annual temperature being 76°, and the average annual
                    rainfall 29Ί7 inches.</p>
                <p>The early history of the district is enshrouded in the usual Hindu legends,
                    chiefly localized at the village of Avani, which is still a popular place of
                    pilgrimage, as containing a <hi rend="italic">linga</hi> set up l&gt;y'Γama
                    himself. The earliest authentic evidence shows that Kolar in primitive times
                    formed part of the kingdom of the Pallavas, a dynasty overthrown by the Cholâs,
                    to whom is assigned the foundation of Kolar town. After the Cholâs came the
                    Ballâla kings, who in their turn gave way to the powerful monarch of
                    Vijayanagar, in the early part of the 14th century. About this period arose the
                    Gauda family, whose chiefs appear to have submitted successively to every
                    conqueror until they were swept away by Hyder Ali. The first Mohammedans to
                    invade this tract were the Bijâpur kings, whose general was the Marhattâ Shâhji,
                    the father of Sivaji the Great. In 1639 Shahji obtained Kolar as a fief, which
                    he transmitted to his son Venkoji or Ekojf, the <pb break="no"

                    was overrun by the Mughals. In 1761 it was formally ceded by the nizam to Hyder
                    Ali, who was a native of the state, having been born at the little village of
                    Budikot; and after the fall of Tipιi in 1799 it was incorporated in the Hindu
                    state of Mysore. The chief historical interest of modern times centres round the
                    hill fort of Nandidrug (Nundydroog), which was stormed by the British in 1791,
                    after a bombardment of twenty-one days. Kolar, which with the rest of Mysore had
                    been under British administration since 1835, was restored to its native chief
                    in March 1881.</p>
