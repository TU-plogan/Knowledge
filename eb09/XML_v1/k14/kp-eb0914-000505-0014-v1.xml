                <p><label type="entry">KARNÁL</label>, a district in the lieutenant-governorship of
                    the Punjab, India, lying between 29° 9' and 30° 11' N. lat., and between 76° 13'
                    and 77° 15' 30" E. long., bounded on the N. by Umballa (Ambala) and the Patiâla
                    state, W. by Patiâla and Jind states and by Rohtâk district, S. by Delhi
                    district, and E. by the Jumna river. The area is 2351 square miles. Karnâl forms
                    a portion of the low dividing ridge which separates the watersheds of the Indus
                    and the Jumna. The district falls naturally into two divisions—the <hi
                    rend="italic">hangar,</hi> or upland plain, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >khddar,</hi> or low-lying land, which skirts the valley of the great river. The
                    banks of the larger streams are fringed with magnificent forest trees, and
                    groves of mangoes mark the neighbourhood of every temple or homestead.
                    Irrigation is afforded by the western Jumna canal. As a whole, Karnâl is better
                    supplied with trees than most of the plain country of the Punjab. The Jumna
                    itself here presents the usual characteristics of the upper part of its course.
                    Sandbanks shift from one side to the other of the main channel, and from time to
                    time the whole stream suddenly changes its bed, transferring half a dozen
                    villages together from Muzaffarnagar to Karnâl, or <hi rend="italic">vice
                    versa.</hi> The district is famous for its sport.</p>
                <p>The population in 1868 amounted to 610,927 (330,763 males and 280,164
                    females)—Hindus, 356,305; Mohammedans, 151,723; and “others,” 93,604. Jâts
                    numbered 74,840, representing the chief agricultural element; Brahmans, 52,396,
                    most of them engaged in tillage; Rajputs, 47,860, chiefly Mohammedans; Chamârs,
                    the landless labouring class, 37,053; pastoral Gujars, 20,857, about one-third
                    of them Mohammedans. Five towns have a population exceeding 5000, viz., Kamal,
                    27,022; Pânipat, 25,276; Kâithal, 14,940; Sewan, 6206; and Kunjpurah, 5163. The
                    area under cultivation is 645,120 acres, the uncultivated area 860,800 acres, of
                    which 578,027 are cultivable. The principal spring crop is wheat; the autumn
                    harvest consists of rice, cotton, and sugar-cane, besides millets and pulses for
                    home consumption. The growth of the more lucrative crops is on the increase.
                    Grain and raw materials are exported to Umballa, Hissar, and Delhi,—the return
                    trade consisting of European piece goods, salt, and refined sugar. A
                    considerable quantity of cotton is woven for local use. Sal-ammoniac is obtained
                    from the clay of Kâithal and Gιila <hi rend="italic">tαhsils</hi> to the value
                    of £3450 per annum. Karnâl town has a few blanket factories, and ornamental
                    glass-ware is made at Pânipat. The Grand Trunk Road connects Karnâl with Delhi
                    and Umballa. The district is administered by a deputy commissioner. In 1872—73
                    the revenue was £78,847, of which £67,048 was derived from the land; and
                    education was afforded by 99 schools, with 2541 pupils.</p>
                <p>No district of India can boast of a more ancient history than Karnâl, as almost
                    every town or stream is connected with the legends of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mahâbhàrata.</hi> The city of Karnâl itself is said to owe its foundation to
                    Raja Karna, the mythical champion of the Kauravas in the great war which forms
                    the theme of the national epic. Pânipat, in the south of the district, is said
                    to have been one of the pledges demanded from Duryodhana by Yudisthira as the
                    price of peace in that famous conflict. In historical times the plains of
                    Pânipat have three times proved the theatre of battles which decided the fate of
                    Upper India. It was here that Ibrâhîm Lodi and his vast host were defeated in
                    1526 by the veteran army of Baber; in 1556 Akbar reasserted the claims of his
                    family on the same battlefield against the Hindu general of the house of Sher
                    Shâh, which ha&lt;l driven the heirs of Baber from the throne for a brief
                    interval; and at Pânipat too, on the 7th of January 1761, the Marhattâ
                    confederation was defeated by Ahmed Shâh Durant. During the troublous period
                    which ensued, the Sikhs managed to introduce themselves, and in 1767 one of
                    their chieftains, Desu Sinh, appropriated the fort of Kâithal, which had been
                    built during the reign of Akbar. His descendants, the Bhâis of Kâithal, were
                    reckoned amongst the most important cis-Sutlej princes. Different portions of
                    this district have lapsed from time to time into the hands of the British. The
                    towns are not generally in a flourishing condition, but the district possesses
                    considerable commerce ami great agricultural resources.</p>

                    maintains a large studfarm. There is a brisk trade with Delhi and Umballa;
                    country cloth is manufactured for local consumption, and blankets for export,
