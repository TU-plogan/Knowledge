                    situated on the main island of the Japanese archipelago. It occupies the level
                    bottom of a valley between the ridges Hujei-zan and Higushiyama on the east, and
                    of Tenno-san on the west, and is so girt by the streams Kamogawa and Kulunagawa
                    as to have an almost insular position. With Tokio, to the north-east, it is
                    connected by two highways, the Tôkaidô, 307 miles long, and the Nakasendô, 323
                    miles long. To Ozaka on the coast a railway line was opened in 1877. Kioto is
                    regularly and compactly built on the rectangular system, the immense number of
                    Shinto and Buddhist shrines and temples being almost entirely beyond the city

                    dwarfed by the great width of the streets. Tea-houses and pleasuregardens
                    abound, and the whole air of the city is pleasant. “With its schools, hospitals,
                    lunatic asylum, prisons, dispensaries, alms-houses, fountains, public-parks, and
                    gardens, exquisitely beautiful cemeteries, and streets of almost painful

                    is, of course, the imperial palace surrounded by beautiful gardens. Formerly
                    forbidden to even most natives, it is now occupied as a museum of Japanese arts
                    and manufactures. Among the other buildings are the former residences of the
                    taikun and of the mikado’s nobility, the various normal training and other
                    schools for both sexes and all ages, the hospital, &amp;c. Under the city
                    government of Kioto there was founded in 1870 an industrial department to foster
                    the industries of the place. There are divisions for the encouragement of
                    gardening, shoe-making, silk and other weaving, paper-making, leather-making,
                    the manufacture of mineral waters, and many other branches of industry. Kioto
                    supports also a pauper colony. The silk-factories, though on a small scale, are
                    numerous. Crape, bronze goods, and porcelain (largely for the English market)
                    are also produced in the city. The population in 1870 was estimated at
                    370,000.</p>
                <p>Kiδto is much <hi rend="subscript"> A</hi> the oldest of the three great cities
                    of Japan, but both Tôkio and Ozaka have far outstripped it in importance. In the
                    reign of the emperor Kuwammu, towards the end of the 8th century, Nara was
                    superseded as the capital by Kudzuno, afterwards called Kiδto, and sometimes
                    Miako; and this last town became identified with the mikado, as Yedo was with
                    the shδgun. It was the scene of the first contests of the Taira and Minumoto
                    clans. In the 16th century Xavier preached in its streets; and in the 17th
                    Kaempfer twice visited it. In 1864 a fierce contest, followed by a
                    conflagration, resulted from an attack upon it by the Chδsiu clan and Kiheitai.
                    After the revolution in 1869 the mikado and his court migrated to Yedo,
                    thenceforth called Tokio or eastern capital. Kioto also received an alternative
                    name,—Saikio, or western capital; but it is never used. Kiδto is not a treaty
                    port; and foreigners are not allowed to reside in it unless they are in Japanese
                    employ.</p>
