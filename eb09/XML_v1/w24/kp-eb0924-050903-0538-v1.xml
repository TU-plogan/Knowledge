                    intimate knowledge of those already known. The importance of its latest
                    possession was at once recognized by the court of Spain, and, as a first move

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0539-0510"/> West Indies to profitable account, numbers of the
                    natives, for the most part a harmless and gentle people, were shipped beyond
                    seas and sold into slavery, others being employed in forced labour in the mines
                    which the Spaniards had opened throughout the archipelago, and from which large
                    returns were expected. Thus early in its history began that traffic in humanity
                    with which the West-India plantations are so widely associated, and which
                    endured for so long a time. Goaded to madness by the wrongs inflicted upon them,
                    the aborigines at last took arms against their masters, but with the result
                    which might have been expected—their almost utter extirpation. Many of the
                    survivors sought release from their sufferings in suicide, and numbers of others
                    perished in the mines, so that the native race soon almost ceased to exist.
                    Spain was not long allowed to retain an undisputed hold upon the islands:
                    British and Dutch seamen soon sought the new region, accounts concerning the
                    fabulous wealth and treasure of which stirred all Europe, and a desultory
                    warfare began to be waged amongst the various voyagers who flocked to this El
                    Dorado, in consequence of which the Spaniards found themselves gradually but
                    surely forced from many of their vantage grounds, and compelled very materially
                    to reduce the area over which they had held unchecked sway. The first care of
                    the English settlers was to find out the real agricultural capabilities of the
                    islands, and they diligently set about planting tobacco, cotton, and indigo. A
                    French West India Company was incorporated in 1625, and a settlement established
                    on the island of St Christopher, where a small English colony was already
                    engaged in clearing and cultivating the ground; these were driven out by the
                    Spaniards in 1630, but only to return and again assume possession. About this
                    time, also, the celebrated buccaneers, Dutch smugglers, and British and French
                    pirates began to infest the neighbouring seas, doing much damage to legitimate
                    traders, and causing commerce to be carried on only under force of arms, and
                    with much difficulty and danger. Indeed, it was not till the beginning of last
                    century—some time after Spain had, in 1670, given up her claim to the exclusive
                    possession of the archipelago—that these rovers were rendered comparatively
                    harmless; and piracy yet lingered off the coasts down to the early years of the
                    present century. In 1640 sugar-cane began to be systematically planted, and the
                    marvellous prosperity of the West Indies commenced; it was not from the gold and
                    precious stones, to which the Spaniards had looked for wealth and power, but
                    from the cane that the fortunes of the West Indies were to spring. The
                    successful propagation of this plant drew to the islands crowds of adventurers,
                    many of them men of considerable wealth. In Barbados alone, it is said that
                    50,000 British subjects arrived in one year about this period. The West Indies
                    were for many years used by the English Government as penal settlements, the
                    prisoners working on the plantations as slaves. In 1655 a British force made an
                    unsuccessful attack on Hayti, but a sudden descent on Jamaica was more fortunate
                    in its result, and that rich and beautiful island has since remained in the
                    possession of Great Britain. The Portuguese were the first to import Negroes as
                    slaves, and their example was followed by other nations having West-Indian
                    colonies, the traffic existing for about 300 years. In 1660 a division of the
                    islands was arranged between England and France, the remaining aborigines being
                    driven to specified localities, but this treaty did not produce the benefits
                    expected from it, and as wars raged in Europe the islands frequently changed
                    hands. Hayti, now divided into two republics, has suffered much from internal
                    broils and revolutions.</p>
                <p>The West Indies are situated in about 20° N. lat. and 75° W. long., and form a
                    broken, but upon the whole, continuous barrier, shutting out as it were the
                    Atlantic Ocean, with its contents of 34,804,000 cubic miles of water, and its
                    mean depth of 2135 fathoms, from the lesser basins of the Caribbean Sea and Gulf
                    of Mexico, containing respectively 1,675,000 cubic miles and 628,000 cubic
                    miles, and with mean depths of 1269 fathoms and 772 fathoms. These two seas are
                    separated by the island of Cuba and the isthmus of Yucatan, with the great
                    Campeche Bank surrounding three sides of the latter. Spring tides do not rise
                    above 4 feet, nor neaps above 2 J feet. Complicated currents and dangerous
                    shoals, especially in the neighbourhood of the Bahamas, necessitate the exercise
                    of considerable skill and care when navigating this region. The equatorial
                    current sweeps around Trinidad and the Antilles into the Caribbean Sea, and the
                    Gulf Stream passes from the Gulf of Mexico by way of the Florida Channel. The
                    well-known Sargasso Sea lies to the north-east of the islands.</p>
                <p>The physical features of the region are clearly shown on the accompanying map
                    (Plate XI. ), the orographical and bathymetrical data being reproduced from a
                    yet unpublished chart intended to illustrate one of the “Challenger” Reports,
                    and inserted here by permission of Dr Murray, Director of the “Challenger”
                    Expedition Commission. In the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea there are 394,850
                    square miles covered by depths of 100 fathoms and less, 363,950 square miles
                    with from 100 to 500 fathoms, 263,250 square miles by from 500 to 1000 fathoms,
                    572,950 square miles by from 1000 to 2000 fathoms, 274,850 square miles by from
                    2000 to 3000 fathoms, and 7750 square miles by over 3000 fathoms. The average
                    surface temperature of the sea in the neighbourhood of the islands is from 75°
                    to 78° F. in February, from 79° to 80° in May, and from 82° to 84* in August.
                    The mean annual temperature of the Gulf Stream in the Florida Channel is 80°
                    F.</p>
                <p>The various groups which go to form the West Indies have in some cases more than
                    one name, but the following classification is that usually adopted. To the north
                    lie the Bahamas, situated upon the Great Bahama Bank, south from which is Cuba;
                    Jamaica, again, lies to the south of the latter, and to the east of Jamaica are
                    Hayti and Porto Rico. Still farther to the east lie the Virgin Islands, south of
                    which are the Caribbee Islands, or Antilles proper, divided by mariners into the
                    Leeward and Windward groups. Trinidad lies close to the coast of South America.
                    Thus the whole archipelago stretches, in the form of a rude arc, from Florida
                    and Yucatan in North America to Venezuela in South America.</p>

                    short courses, and none of them are of much importance.</p>
                <p>The population is almost entirely of European, Negro, or East-Asiatic origin. The
                    Negroes far outnumber the others, but the Asiatics are rapidly increasing in
                    numbers.</p>
                <p>As in most tropical countries where considerable heights are met with—and here
                    over 15,500 square miles lie at an elevation of more than 1500 feet above
                    sea-level—the climate of the West Indies (in so far at least as heat and cold
                    are concerned) varies at different altitudes, and on the higher parts of many of
                    the islands a marked degree of coolness may generally be found. With the
                    exception of part of the Bahamas, all the islands lie between the isotherms of
                    77° and 82° F. The extreme heat, however, is greatly tempered by the sea
                    breezes, and by long, cool, refreshing nights. Frost is occasionally formed in
                    the cold season when hail falls, but snow is unknown. The seasons may be divided
                    as follows. The short wet season, or spring, begins in April and lasts from two
                    to six weeks, and is succeeded by the short dry season, when the thermometer
                    remains almost stationary at about 80° F. In July the heat increases to an
                    extent well nigh unbearable, and thunder is heard to rumble in the distance. No
                    change need now be looked for till after a period varying from the end of July
                    to the beginning of October, when the great rainfall of the year commences,
                    accompanied by those tremendous and destructive hurricanes, so intimately and
                    truly associated with popular ideas regarding this region, on which the annual
                    rainfall averages 63 inches— an amount of precipitation calculated to represent
                    a mass of water of 12,465,437,000,000 cubic feet. This season is locally known
                    as the “hurricane months.” Out of a total of 355 hurricanes, or, more properly,
                    cyclones, recorded during the last three hundred years, 42 have occurred in
                    July, 96 in August, 80 in September, and 69 in October. These storms commence in
                    the Atlantic and towards the east. For a day or two they follow a westerly
                    course, inclining, at the same time, one or two points towards the north, the
                    polar tendency becoming gradually more marked as the distance from the equator
                    increases. When the hurricanes reach latitude 25° N., they curve to the
                    northeast, and almost invariably wheel round on arriving at the northern portion
                    of the Gulf of Mexico, after which they follow the coast line of North America.
                    Their rate of speed varies considerably, but may be said to average 300 miles
                    per day among the islands. The usual signs of the approach of the cyclones are
                    an ugly and threatening appearance of the weather, sharp and frequent puffs of
                    wind increasing in force with each blast, accompanied with a long heavy swell
                    and confused choppy sea, coming from the direction of the approaching storm. But
                    the barometer is the true guide, which should always be consulted when a cyclone
                    is expected. If a sudden fall of the barometer is observed, or even if a marked
                    irregularity of its diurnal variations takes place, a storm may be confidently
                    looked for. In some of these hurricanes the barometer has been found to stand 2
                    inches lower in the centre of the disturbance than it did outside the limits of
                    the storm field. December marks the commencement of the long dry season, which,
                    accompanied by fresh winds and occasional hail showers, lasts till April. The
                    average temperature of the air at Barbados, which may be taken as a favourable
                    average, is, throughout the year, 80 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> F. in the
                    forenoon, and about 82° in the afternoon. The maximum is 87°, and the minimum
                    75°.</p>
                <p>The geological features of the West Indies are interesting. A calcareous
                    formation, often assuming the shape of marbles, is most common, and indeed
                    preponderates above all the other rocks to a remarkable degree. The Bahamas,
                    which are low, are composed wholly of limestone formed from coral and shells,
                    crushed into a concretionary mass, hard on the surface, but soft where not
                    exposed to atmospheric action, full of holes and indentations, and disposed in
                    nearly level beds. The lower parts of the Antilles present a like formation
                    where the land does not rise above 230 feet. Cuba shows two distinct compact
                    limestones, one a clayey sandstone and the other a gypsum. These are confined to
                    the central and western parts of the island, which has also syenitic rocks, with
                    some serpentine from which petroleum is obtained. Four-fifths of Jamaica
                    consists of limestone overlying granite and other igneous rocks. Hayti has much
                    metamorphic strata, generally greatly uptilted, and often exhibiting marked
                    folding. These rocks appear to have been limestones, shales, sandstones, and
                    conglomerates. Auriferous quartz veins occur in slates, where these are found
                    near eruptive masses; there is also some syenite, and both active and extinct
                    craters are upon this island. The western Antilles are entirely of volcanic
                    origin, and coral reefs occur along their shores; coral reefs are also presented
                    on the coasts of many of the other islands, but are most irregular in their mode
                    of occurrence, sometimes forming complete belts surrounding the land on all
                    sides, but offener appearing in the shape of unconnected masses. The fossils of
                    the West Indies are important, as from many of them clear evidence is obtained
                    to show that at no very remote geological period the islands formed part of the
                    adjoining continents. The remains of the megatherium, mylodon, and cabylara,
                    essentially South-American, are also found in North America, but only along the
                    seaboards of Georgia and Carolina. As these are also found in some of the West
                    India islands, as well as in South America, it is thus perfectly clear that at
                    one time the archipelago formed a land passage between the two great divisions
                    of the New World. These remains have also been found in conjunction with the
                    fossil human skeletons of Guadeloupe and the rude weapons associated with them.
                    We may therefore fairly conclude that in Pleistocene times the West Indies
                    formed the connecting link between the two Americas. The occurrence of tree
                    stumps <hi rend="italic">in situ</hi> several feet below high-water mark also
                    points to a comparatively late sinking of the land in some areas.</p>
                <p>The mineral wealth of the islands is not remarkable. Gold, silver, iron, copper,
                    tin, platinum, lead, coal of a poor quality, cobalt, mercury, arsenic, antimony,
                    manganese, and rock salt either have been or are worked. Of late years asphalt
                    has been worked to considerable advantage among the pitch lakes of Trinidad.
                    Opal and chalcedony are the principal precious stones.</p>
                <p>The fauna of the region is Neotropical, belonging to that region which includes
                    South and part of Central America, although great numbers of birds from the
                    North-American portion of the Holarctic realm migrate to the islands. The
                    resident birds, however, éighteen genera of which are certainly Neotropical,
                    show beyond doubt to which faunal region the islands properly belong. Mammals
                    are, as in most island groups, rare. The agouti abounds, and wild pigs and dogs
                    are sufficiently numerous to afford good sport to the hunter, as well as smaller
                    game, in the shape of armadillos, opossums, musk-rats, and raccoons. The
                    non-migrating birds include trogons, 8ugar-birds, chatterers, and many parrots
                    and humming birds. Waterfowl and various kinds of pigeons are in abundance.
                    Reptiles are numerous: snakes—both the boa and adder —are innumerable, while
                    lizards, scorpions, tarantulas, and centipedes are everywhere. Insects are in
                    great numbers, and are often very annoying. Among domestic animals mules are
                    largely reared, and where the country affords suitable pasture and forage
                    cattle-breeding is extensively engaged in. Much attention is not bestowed <pb

                    comparatively small numbers required for use in driving and riding by the
                    officials and planters. Goats abound, and large flocks of sheep are kept for the
                    sake of their flesh alone, as the climate is not adapted for wool-growing.</p>
                <p>The flora of the islands is of great variety and richness, as plants have been
                    introduced from most parts of the globe, and flourish either in a wild state or
                    under cultivation; grain, vegetables, and fruits, generally common in cool
                    climates, may be seen growing in luxuriance within a short distance of like
                    plants which only attain perfection under the influence of extreme heat, nothing
                    being here required for the successful propagation of both but a difference in
                    the height of the lands upon which they grow. The forests, which are numerous
                    and wide-spreading, produce the most valuable woods and delicious fruits. Palms
                    are in great variety, and there are several species of gum-producing trees. Some
                    locust trees have been estimated to have attained an age of 4000 years, and are
                    of immense height and bulk. <hi rend="italic">Piptadenia</hi> is, on account of
                    its almost imperishable character when in the ground, universally used as a
                    material for house building. <hi rend="italic">Xanthoxylon,</hi> the admired and

                    finds a ready market on account of its toughness; crab-wood yields a useful oil
                    and affords reliable timber; and tree ferns of various species are common.
                    Pimento is peculiar to Jamaica. But it is to the agricultural resources of the
                    islands that the greatest importance attaches. For centuries almost the whole
                    care of the planters was bestowed upon the cultivation of the sugar-cane and
                    'tobacco plant, but since the emancipation of the slaves and the fall in the
                    price of sugar attention has been turned to the production of other and more
                    varying crops. Perhaps this change has been most marked in the trade which has
                    now sprung up in fruit, which is very large, and annually increasing. Sugar,
                    however, is still the staple product, and has for some time been grown in
                    considerable quantities on the small holdings of the Negroes and other
                    labourers. Crops of tobacco, beans, pease, maize, and Guinea corn are also
                    becoming popular, and a species of rice, which requires no flooding for its
                    successful propagation, is largely produced. <hi rend="italic">Hymenachne
