                <p><label type="entry">WHIG AND TORY</label>. Parliamentary parties came into
                    existence in England as soon as parliament achieved or aimed at predominance in
                    the state. In 1641, shortly after the meeting of the Long Parliament, they were
                    divided on the question of church reform, passing, as soon as political
                    questions were involved, into Cavaliers and Roundheads. After the expulsion of
                    the Cavaliers in 1642 and 1643 the Houses were divided into a peace party and a
                    war party, and these in 1643 took the shape of Presbyterians and Independents.
                    After the Restoration there was a country party and a court party, and to these
                    the names of Whig and Tory were applied in 1679, in the heat of the struggle
                    which preceded the meeting of the first short parliament of Charles II. The
                    words were nicknames given by the opponents of each party. To call a man a Whig
                    was to compare him with the Presbyterian rebels of the west of Scotland. To call
                    a man a Tory was to compare him with the Papist outlaws of Ireland. In fact, at
                    this time the Whigs were maintainers of parliamentary power over the crown and
                    of toleration for Dissenters, the Tories maintainers of the hereditary
                    indefeasible rights of the wearer of the crown and of the refusal of toleration
                    to Dissenters. The relation between the parties was further qualified by the
                    fact that the heir to the crown was a Roman Catholic, whose claim to succeed was
                    defended by the Tories and assailed by the Whigs.</p>
                <p>The persistency of the names of the two parties is mainly owing to their
                    unmeaningness. As new questions arose, the names of the old parties were
                    retained, though the objects of contention were no longer the same. The
                    Revolution of 1688-89 made it impossible for the Tories to retain their old
                    attitude of attachment to the hereditary right of the occupant of the throne,
                    with the exception of the extreme wing of the party, which remained Jacobite.
                    They still, however, continued, though accepting the Toleration Act, to oppose
                    the offering of further favours to Dissenters. In Anne’s reign, after the war
                    with France had gone on for some time, they supported a peace policy, whilst the
                    Whigs advocated a continuance of the war. On the whole, during the last years of
                    the 17 th and the first years of the 18th century the Whigs may be regarded as
                    the party of the great landowners, and of the merchants and tradesmen, the
                    Tories as the party of the smaller landowners and the country clergy. The Whigs
                    established, through their hold upon the boroughs under the influence of the
                    great landowners, a firm government, which could keep in check, and at last
                    practically set aside, the power of the crown. The Tories, distrusting the
                    authority of the ministerial Government, and fearing a new despotism based on
                    parliamentary corruption, became, especially after Bolingbroke’s return from
                    exile, almost democratic in their views and in their demands for the
                    purification of the existing system.</p>
                <p>With the accession of George III. Toryism took a new form. The struggle about the
                    Dissenters was now a thing of the past, and the king was accepted as a leader in
                    carrying on the attack against the power of the great Whig families. The attack
                    was the easier because the Whig families had split into factions. For some time
                    the dividing line between Whigs and Tories was this: the Tories asserted that
                    the king had a right to choose his ministers and control their policy, subject
                    to the necessity of securing a majority of the House of Commons, whilst the
                    Whigs thought that the choice should lie with leading members of parliament, and
                    that the king should have no controlling power. The Whig view appears to
                    resemble that subsequently adopted; but in the middle of the 18th century the
                    corruption which prevailed rendered the analogy worthless, and the real conflict
                    was between the corrupt influence of the crown and the influence of a clique of
                    great landowners resting on their possession of electoral power through the
                    rotten boroughs. In 1770 the king had his way and established Lord North at the
                    treasury as his nominee. The Whigs, deprived of power, improved their position
                    by the loss of one great instrument of corruption; but they were weakened by the
                    establishment of two distinct currents of opinion in their own ranks. The main
                    body under Rockingham was influenced by Burke to demand practical reforms, but
                    set its face against any popular changes in the constitution. The Whigs who
                    followed Chatham wished to place parliament on a more popular basis by the
                    reform of the House of Commons. When in 1783 Chatham’s son Pitt became prime
                    minister, the Tory party took a new start. It retained the Tory principle of
                    reliance on the crown, and joined to it Chatham’s principle of reliance on the
                    people as opposed to the great Whig families. It also supported Pitt in
                    practical reforms.</p>
                <p>All this was changed by the French Revolution. In opposition to the new
                    democracy, the Tories coalesced with a section of the Whig families, the
                    representatives of which entered the ministry in 1794. From this time till 1822
                    Toryism was synonymous with a desire to retain the existing state of things,
                    however full of abuses it might be. When Canning and Peel entered the ministry
                    in 1822, a gradual change took place, and a tendency to practical reform
                    manifested itself. The refusal of Wellington to listen to any proposal for
                    altering the constitution of the House of Commons threw power once more into the
                    hands of the Whigs in 1830. Shortly afterwards the name Tory gave place to that
                    of Conservative, though of late years there has been an attempt to revert to it
                    by those Conservatives who wish to assert their power of originating a definite
                    policy, and who do not like to be branded with a purely negative appellation.
                    The name of Whig on the other hand was replaced by that of Liberal, being
                    assigned for some time to the less progressive portion of the party, and thus,
                    by becoming a term of reproach, threatening entirely to disappear.</p>
