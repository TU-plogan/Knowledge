                    (1840-1875), subject painter, was born in Marylebone, London, on May 24, 1840.
                    While very young he began to draw from the antique in the British Museum, and at
                    the age of sixteen he was placed in the office of Baker, an architect. The
                    occupation proved uncongenial; at the end of eighteen months he resumed his work
                    from the Elgin marbles at the Museum, attending art classes; and in March 1858
                    he was admitted a student of the Royal Academy. He soon turned his attention to
                    designing for the wood-engravers, and served an apprenticeship of three years
                    with J. W. Whymper. His earliest book-illustrations appeared in 1860 in <hi
                    rend="italic">Once a Week,</hi> a periodical to which he contributed largely, as
                    also to the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill Magazine,</hi> where his admirable
                    designs to the works of Thackeray and those of his daughter appeared. These
                    woodcuts are among the most spirited and artistic works of their class, and
                    entitle Walker to rank with Millais at the very head of the draughtsmen of our
                    time who have dealt with scenes of contemporary life. In the intervals of work
                    as a book-illustrator he practised painting in water-colours, his subjects being
                    frequently more considered and refined repetitions in colour of his
                    black-and-white designs. Among the more notable of his productions in
                    water-colour are Spring, a Fishmonger’s Shop, the Ferry, and Philip in Church,
                    which gained a medal in the Paris International Exhibition of 1867. He was
                    elected an associate of the Society of Painters in Water Colours in 1864, and a
                    full member in 1866; and in 1871 he became an associate of the Royal Academy.
                    His first oil picture, the Lost Path, was exhibited in the Royal Academy in
                    1863, where it was followed in 1867 by the Bathers, one of the artist’s finest
                    works, in 1868 by the Vagrants, now in the National Gallery, in 1869 by the Old
                    Gate, and in 1870 by the Plough, a powerful and impressive rendering of ruddy
                    evening light, of which the landscape was studied in Somerset. In 1871 he
                    exhibited his tragic life-sized figure of a Female Prisoner at the Bar, a
                    subject which now exists only in a finished oil study, for the painter
                    afterwards effaced the head, with which he was dissatisfied, and was prevented
                    by death from again completing the picture. The last of his fully successful
                    works was the Harbour of Refuge, shown in 1872, for the Right of Way, exhibited
                    in 1875, bears evident signs of the artist’s failing strength. In the end of
                    1873 he made a journey to Algiers for his health, but, returning in the bitter
                    English spring, he was again prostrated; and on June 5, 1875, he died of
                    consumption at St Fillan’s, Perthshire.</p>
                <p>The works of Frederick Walker are thoroughly original and individual, both in the
                    technique of their colour and execution aud in their view of nature and
                    humanity. His colour, especially in his water-colours, is pure, powerful, and
                    full of delicate gradations; he had an admirable sense of design, and the
                    figures of his peasants at their daily toil show a grace and sweeping largeness
                    of line which recalls the antique; while the sentiment of his subjects is
                    unfailingly refined and poetic.</p>
