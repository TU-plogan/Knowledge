                <p><label type="entry">WIMBLEDON</label>, a suburb of London, in the county of
                    Surrey, is situated on the London and South Western Railway, 7∣ miles south-west
                    of London. The old village of Wimbledon has been greatly extended of late years,
                    the district being now a favourite residence for the London middle classes.
                    Wimbledon Common, to the north-west of the village, was the meeting-place of the
                    Rifle Association from its foundation in 1860 till 1888. At its southwestern
                    extremity are the outlines of a British earthwork, called Caesar’s camp, having
                    an extreme diameter of 950 feet and a diameter within the vallum of 750 feet. At
                    Coombe’s Hill and elsewhere British relics have been found. The parish church of
                    St Mary is supposed to date from Saxon times; but, after it had undergone
                    various restorations and reconstructions, it was rebuilt in 1833 in the
                    Perpendicular style. There are various other churches and chapels, all modern. A
                    free library was established in 1887. The benevolent institutions include nine
                    almshouses (1838), a cottage hospital (1867), a convalescent hospital (1867),
                    and a hospital for infectious diseases (1877). The population of the urban
                    sanitary district (area 3220 acres) was 9087 in 1871 and 15,950 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Wimbledon (Wibbandune) is supposed to have been the scene of a battle in 568
                    between Ceawlin, king of Wessex, and Ethelbert, king of Kent, in which the
                    latter was defeated. At Domesday it formed part of the manor of Mortlake, held
                    by the archbishops of Canterbury. Afterwards the name was sometimes used
                    interchangeably with Mortlake, and in 1327 it is described as a grange or farm
                    belonging to Mortlake. On the impeachment of Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury,
                    in 1398, it was confiscated. In the reign of Henry VIII. Cromwell, earl of
                    Essex, held the manor of Wimbledon, with Bristow Park as an appendage. On the
                    confiscation of Cromwell’s estates in 1540 it again fell to the crown, and by
                    Henry VIII. it was settled on Catherine Parr for life. By Queen Mary it was
                    granted to Cardinal Pole. In 1574 Elizabeth bestowed the manor house, while
                    retaining the manor, on Sir Christopher Hatton, who sold it the same year to Sir
                    Thomas Cecil. In 1588 Elizabeth transferred the manor to his son Sir Edward
                    Cecil, in exchange for an estate in Lincolnshire. At the time of the Civil War
                    the manor was sold to Adam Baynes, who shortly afterwards sold it to General
                    Lambert; and at the Restoration it was granted to the queen dowager, Henrietta
                    Maria, who sold it in 1661 to George Digby, earl of Bristol. On his death in
                    1676 it was sold by his widow to the lord-treasurer Danby. Some years after
                    Danby’s death it was purchased by Sarah, duchess of Marlborough, who demised it
                    to her grandson, John Spencer. It was sold by the fifth Earl Spencer in 1877.
                    Wimbledon House, built by Sir Thomas Cecil in 1588, was destroyed by fire in
                    1785, and a new house, called Wimbledon Park House, was erected about 1801.</p>
