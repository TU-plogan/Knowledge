                <p><label type="entry">LOUIS-PHILIPPE</label>, king of the French, was born at the
                    Palais Royal, Paris, on October 6, 1773. His father was Louis-Philippe-Joseph,
                    duke of Orleans, a descendant of the younger brother of Louis X1V., and by his
                    mother he derived his origin from the Comte de Toulouse, the legitimized son of
                    Louis XIV. and Madame de Montespan. At his birth he received the title of duke
                    of Valois; and after 1785, when his father succeeded to the Orleans title, he
                    himself bore that of duke of Chartres. In 1781 Madame de Genlis was appointed
                    his “gouverneur.” From 1789 onwards he manifested sincere sympathy with the new
                    ideas then gaining currency, and in June 1791 he joined at Vendôme the regiment
                    of dragoons of which he had been colonel since 1785. In 1792 he took part in the
                    battles of Valmy and Jemmapes, holding high military rank under Kellermann and
                    Dumouriez; in the following year he was present at the bombardment of Venloo and
                    of Maestricht, and showed remarkable courage at Neer winden. Proscribed along
                    with Dumouriez, he entered upon a period of twenty-one years of exile from
                    France, spent partly in Switzerland and other European countries, partly in the
                    United States and in the Spanish American colonies. By the execution of his
                    father he became duke of Orleans in 1793; and he was married to Marie Amélie,
                    daughter of Ferdinand IV. of Naples, at Palermo, on November 25, 1809. In April
                    1814 he returned to Paris, where his old military rank and the property of his
                    father were restored to him; the “Hundred Days” in 1815 condemned him to a
                    renewed but much briefer exile; during the reign of Louis XVIII. he was regarded
                    with some jealousy by the court on account of his liberal opinions, but enjoyed
                    greater favour under Charles X.; immediately after the three days of July 1830
                    he was called to exercise the functions of “lieutenant-general of the kingdom,”
                    and on August 9 he accepted the title of king of the French. For his reign see
