                <p><label type="entry">LYNX</label>, a name now appropriated to several animals
                    forming a small section of the cats or genus <hi rend="italic">Felis.</hi> It is
                    not quite certain to which of these, if to any of them, the Greek name λυγ£ was
                    especially applied, though it was more probably the caracal than any of the
                    northern species. The so-called lynxes of Bacchus were generally represented as
                    resembling panthers rather than any of the species now-known by the name.
                    Various fabulous properties were attributed to the animal, w∙hatever it was, by
                    the ancients, that of extraordinary powers of vision, including ability to see
                    through opaque substances, being one; whence the epithet “lynx-eyed,” which has
                    survived to the present day, although having no foundation in fact.</p>
                <p>There are two forms of cats which are now called lynxes.</p>
                <p>1. The caracal or Persian lynx, <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >caracal,</hi> an animal about the size of a fox, is of slender build, with a
                    moderately long tail, reaching down to the heels. It is of a uniform vinous or
                    bright fulvous brown colour above, and is paler, sometimes almost white,
                    beneath. It is quite or almost entirely unspotted. The tail has a black tip, and
                    the ears are black externally, long and upright, pointed, and surmounted by a
                    pencil of fine black hairs. It inhabits Central and North-West India, Persia,
                    Arabia, Syria, and the greater part of Africa.</p>
                <p>2. The name lynx is given to various species or varieties of animals found in the
                    northern and temperate regions of both the Old and New World, all of moderate
                    size, that is, smaller than the lions, tigers, and leopards, and larger than the
                    true cats, with long limbs, short stumpy tail, ears tufted at the tip, and pupil
                    of the eye linear when contracted. Their fur is generally long and soft,
                    varying, however, according to season and locality, and always longish upon the
                    cheeks. Their colour is always light brown or grey, and generally more or less
                    spotted with a darker shade. The naked pads of the feet are more or less covered
                    by the hair that grows between them. The skull and skeleton does not differ
                    markedly from those of the other cats, but the small anterior upper premolar
                    tooth found in many other species is usually wanting. Their habits are exactly
                    those of the other wild cats; they are excelled by none in the untameable
                    savageness of their disposition. They capture their prey in the same manner,
                    either lying in wait, or noiselessly stealing within reach, and then making a
                    sudden rush or spring upon it. Their food consists of any mammals or birds which
                    they can overpower. In inhabited countries they commit extensive ravages upon
                    sheep, lambs, and poultry. They generally frequent rocky places and forests,
                    being active climbers, and passing much of their time among the branches of the
                    trees. Their skins are of considerable commercial value in the fur trade.</p>
                <p>Zoologists are by no means agreed at present as to the specific distinctions, if
                    any really exist, between the various modifications of this group. As many as
                    eight species are sometimes recognized, four belonging to the Old and four to
                    the New World. The former are <hi rend="italic">Felis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lynx,</hi> of Scandinavia, Russia, northern Asia, and till lately the forest
                    regions of central Europe (it has not inhabited Britain during the historic
                    period, but its remains have been found <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0125-0110"/> in cave deposits of Pleistocene age); <hi
                    rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic">cervaria,</hi> Siberia; <hi rend="italic"
                    >F</hi><hi rend="italic">pαrdina,</hi> Turkey, Greece, Sicily, Sardinia, and
                    Spain; and <hi rend="italic">F. isabellina,</hi> Tibet. The American varieties
                    are <hi rend="italic">F. canadensis,</hi> the most northern species, and <hi
                    rend="italic">F. Tufa,</hi> the</p>
                <p>American wild cat or bay lynx, extensively distributed from the Atlantic to the
                    Pacific throughout nearly the whole latitude of the United States, but replaced
                    in Texas and southern California by <hi rend="italic">F. maculata,</hi> and in
                    northern Oregon and Washington territory by <hi rend="italic">F.
                    fasciata.</hi></p>
                <p>In both cases, as might be supposed, specimens obtained from the more southern
                    climates are shorter in their fur, more brightly coloured, and more distinctly
                    spotted than those from colder regions. When only a few individuals of each most
                    markedly different form are examined the distinctions are sufficiently evident.
                    The occurrence, however, of transitional or intermediate forms makes it
                    extremely difficult to draw the line between the different varieties or species,
                    or to assign definite characters by which they can be separated. Wherefore it is
                    best at present to accept the so-called species as only provisional, and wait
                    until more abundant materials, with fuller knowledge of the localities from
                    which they are derived, and of the variations due to age, sex, season, and
                    climate, have been more carefully studied. We shall then probably come to the
                    conclusion that all the existing forms of northern lynxes, whether American or
                    Eurasian, belong to what may fairly be called a species, which is becoming by
                    degrees differentiated into several more or less strongly marked local
                    varieties. (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">h. f.)</hi></p>
