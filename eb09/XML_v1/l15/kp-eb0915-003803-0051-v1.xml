                    province, an archiépiscopal see, and the seat of a court of assize, lies 13
                    miles by rail north-east of Pisa, in 43° <hi rend="italic">50</hi><hi

                    long. Situated 50 feet above the level of the sea, in the valley of the Serchio,
                    the city looks out for the most part on a horizon of hills and mountains. The
                    fortifications—pierced by four gates—were commenced in 1504 and completed in
                    1645, and long ranked among the most remarkable in the peninsula. The city has a
                    well-built and substantial appearance, its chief attraction lying in the
                    numerous churches, which belong in the main to a well-marked basilican type, and
                    present richly decorated exteriors, fine apsidal ends, and quadrangular
                    campaniles. The cathedral or church of St Martin was begun in 1063 by Bishop
                    Anselm; but the great apse with its tall columnar arcades is probably the only
                    remnant of the early edifice. The west front, “built during the first forty
                    years of the 13th century, consists of a vast portico of three magnificent
                    arches, and above them three ranges of open galleries covered with all the
                    devices of an exuberant fancy.” The ground plan is a Latin cross, the nave being
                    273 feet in length and 84 feet in width, and the transepts 117 feet in length.
                    In the nave is a little octagonal temple or chapel built (1484) by Matteo
                    Civitali, which serves as a shrine for the most precious of the Lucchese relics,
                    a cedar-wood crucifix, carved, according to the legend, by Nicodemus, and
                    miraculously conveyed to Lucca in 782. The Sacred <pb break="no"

                    beautiful tomb of Maria Guinigi is described by Ruskin, <hi rend="italic">Modern
                    Painters,</hi> ii. The church of Saint Michael, founded in the 8th century, and
                    built of marble within and without, has a lofty and magnificent western façade
                    (1188)—an architectural screen rising much above the roof of the church. St
                    Frediano or Frigidian dates originally from the 7th century; the front (of the
                    13th century) occupies the site of the ancient apse; in one of its chapels is
                    the tomb of Santa Zita, patroness of servants and of Lucca itself. San Giovanni
                    (originally of the 12th century), San Romano (rebuilt in the 17th century, by
                    Vincenzo Buonamici), and Santa Maria Forisportam (of the 13th century) also
                    deserve to be mentioned. Among the secular buildings are the old ducal palace,
                    begun in 1578 by Ammanati, and now the residence of the prefect and seat of the
                    provincial officers and the public picture gallery; the Palazzo Pretorio, or
                    former residence of the podesth, now the seat of the civil and correctional
                    courts; the palace, erected in the 15th century by a member of the great Guinigi
                    family, and now serving as a poorhouse; and the 16th century palace of the
                    Marquis Guidiccioni, now used as a depository for the archives. The principal
                    market-place in the city <hi rend="italic">{Piazza del</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mercato)</hi> has taken possession of the arena of the ancient amphitheatre,
                    the arches of which can still be seen in the surrounding buildings. Besides the
                    academy of sciences just mentioned, which dates from 1584, there are several
                    institutions of the same kind—a royal philomathic academy, a royal academy of
                    arts, and a public library of 50,000 volumes. The silk manufacture, which was
                    introduced at Lucca about the close of the 11th century, and in the early part
                    of the 16th became for a time the means of subsistence for 30,000 of its
                    inhabitants, now gives employment (in reeling and throwing) to only about 1500.
                    The bulk of the population is engaged in agriculture. Tn 1871 the city had
                    21,286 inhabitants. The commune has increased from 61,175 in 1834 to 68,063 in
                    1881.</p>
                <p>Lucca (Latin, <hi rend="italic">Luca)</hi> is probably a place of Ligurian
                    origin. First mentioned as the place to which Sempronius retired (218 B.c.)
                    before the victorious Hannibal, it passes out of sight again till 177, when it
                    became the seat of a Roman colony. In the time of Julius Caesar it is frequently
                    heard of as a town in his province of Cisalpine Gaul and Liguria, to λvhich he
                    repaired for consultation with his political associates. By Augustus it was
                    transferred to Etruria. Though plundered and deprived of part of its territory
                    by Odoacer, Lucca appears as an important city and fortress at the time of N
                    arses, and under the Lombards it λvas the residence of a duke or marquis and had
                    the privilege of a mint. The dukes gradually extended their power over all
                    Tuscany, but after the death of the famous Matilda the city began to constitute
                    itself an independent community, and in 1160 it obtained from Welf VI., duke of
                    Bavaria and marquis of Tuscany, the lordship of all the country for 5 miles
                    round. Internal discord afforded an opportunity to Uguccione della Faggiola to
                    make himself master of Lucca in 1314; but the Lucchese expelled him two years
                    afterwards, and handed over their city to Castrudcio, under whose masterly
                    tyranny it became “for a moment the leading state of Italy.” Occupied by the
                    troops of Louis of Bavaria, sold to a rich Genovese Gherardo Spinola, seized by
                    John, king of Bohemia, pawned to the Rossi of Parma, sold to the Florentines,
                    surrendered to the Pisans, nominally liberated by the emperor Charles IV., and
                    governed by his vicar, Lucca was subjected to endless vicissitudes, but managed,
                    at first as a democracy, and after 1628 as an oligarchy, to maintain “its
                    independence alongside of Venice and Genoa, and painted the word Libertas on its
                    banner till the French Revolution.” In the beginning of the 16th century one of
                    its leading citizens, Francesco Burlamacchi, made a noble attempt to give
                    political cohesion to Italy, but perished on the scaffold (1548); his statue by
                    Ulisse Cambi was erected on the Piazza San Michele in 1863. As a principality
                    formed in 1805 by Napoleon in favour of his sister Elisa and her husband
                    Baciocchi, Lucca was for a few years wonderfully prosperous. It was occupied by
                    the Neapolitans in 1814; from 1816 to 1847 it was governed as a duchy by Maria
                    Luisa, queen of Etruria, and her son Charles Louis; and it afterwards formed one
                    of the divisions of Tuscany.</p>
                <p>The bishops of Lucca, who can be traced back to 347, gradually acquired a variety
                    of exceptional marks of distinction, such as the pallium in 1120, and the
                    archiepiscopal cross from Alexander II.; and at length in 1726 Benedict XIII.
                    raised their see to the rank of an archbishopric, without suffragans.</p>
