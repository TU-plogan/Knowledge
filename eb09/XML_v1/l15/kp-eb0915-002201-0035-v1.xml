                <p><label type="entry">LOUISVILLE</label>, the sixteenth city of the United States
                    in population, and the most important place in the State of Kentucky, is
                    situated on the south bank of the Ohio river, in 38° 3' N. lat. and 85° 30' W.
                    long. The river is here interrupted by a series of rapids which, except at high
                    water, oblige the steamboat traffic to make use of the Louisville and Portland
                    Canal (2J miles long, constructed in 1833). The city, which has an area of 13
                    square miles, and a water front of 8 miles, occupies an almost level site about
                    70 feet above low-water mark. Its plan is regular and spacious, and, in the
                    residential portions the houses, for the most part, have lawns and gardens in
                    front. Among the public buildings of importance may be mentioned the city-hall,
                    the court-house, the public library, the female high school, the industrial
                    exhibition building, the Roman Catholic cathedral, and the State school for the
                    blind.</p>
                <p>From the time of the introduction of steam navigation upon the Ohio by Fulton in
                    1812, Louisville rapidly gained in importance as a centre of river trade. Owing
                    to its <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n36/mode/1up"

                    obstruction long made necessary the transfer of goods at this point, the city
                    became an important depot of supplies for the cotton-growing States lying
                    immediately to the south. The owners of plantations in those States devoted
                    themselves wholly to the culture of cotton, and relied upon Kentucky for
                    supplies of wheat, Indian corn, oats, and the like cereals, for the hempen
                    bagging and rope used in baling the cotton, and for mules and horses, large
                    droves of which were annually driven south from Louisville. The city was also
                    for many years one of the principal points in the United States for
                    pork-packing.</p>
                <p>After the close of the civil war, the development of Kentucky, as of the South
                    generally, entered new channels. Largely increased facilities of railway
                    transportation, while bringing Louisville into more direct competition with
                    Cincinnati, St Louis, and Chicago, resulted in a marked increase of both its
                    commercial and manufacturing interests, notwithstanding the decline of the river
                    trade. The extensive tobacco crop of Kentucky, with much of that grown in
                    neighbouring States, now finds a market at Louisville, instead of at New Orleans
                    as formerly; and it has become probably the largest market in the world for leaf
                    tobacco, 68,300 hogsheads of which, of an aggregate value exceeding $5,000,000,
                    were sold here during 1881. The manufacture of whisky is also important, this,
                    with that of tobacco, paying to the Federal Government nearly $3,000,000
                    annually in revenue taxes, in the Louisville district. Pork-packing employs a
                    capital of $2,520,000, and the tanning of leather $1,704,000, this industry
                    being twenty times larger than before the war, and the product, especially of
                    sole-leather, being in high demand. The manufacture of agricultural and
                    mechanical implements employs $1,915,000 capital, the plough factories, which
                    produce 125,000 ploughs annually, being among the largest in the United States.
                    Steam-power is chiefly employed, the available water-power of the rapids having
                    been neglected. The greater part of the coal consumed by the factories is
                    brought down the Ohio from Pittsburg. The mountainous eastern portion of the
                    State, rich in vast deposits of both coal and iron, is now penetrated by several
                    railroads, and others are being constructed, whose influence in developing this
                    mineral wealth will add largely to the prosperity of the city.</p>
                <p>The reports of the United States census of 1880 give the following summary of the
                    industries of the city :—</p>

                <p>The Louisville and Nashville Railway, opened in 1859, controls, under one
                    management, nearly 4000 miles of connected lines, reaching New Orleans,
                    Pensacola, and Savannah. Various other lines contribute to make Louisville an
                    important railway centre.</p>
                <p>A bridge across the river, 5218-j feet long between abutments, with twenty-seven
                    spans, and admitting the free passage of steamboats at high water, affords
                    continuous railway transit, and connects the city with the thriving towns of New
                    Albany (population 16,423) and Jeffersonville (population 9357), situated on the
                    opposite bank of the Ohio, in the State of Indiana. A second railway bridge,
                    having waggon-ways and foot-ways in addition, is now (1882) building.</p>
                <p>Louisville is provided with adequate water-works, gasworks, Ac. The famous Dupont
                    artesian well, 2066 feet deep, has a flow of 330,000 gallons per day, with a
                    force of ten horse-power, its water resembling slightly that of the Kissengen
                    and Blue Lick (Ky.) springs. Although once regarded as unhealthy, the city has
                    now an effective system of sewerage, and is in good sanitary condition.</p>
                <p>The public school system is sustained at an annual expense of over $300,000,
                    abundant separate provision being made for coloured children. There are four
                    medical colleges, having a large attendance and reputation, and numerous private
                    seminaries and schools. Among the newspapers published at Louisville the <hi
                    rend="italic">Courier Journal</hi> deserves mention both for its early connexion
                    with George D. Prentice, and as a leading representative of the best order of
                    American journalism. There are four other dailies (two English and two German),
                    besides thirteen weekly sheets.</p>
                <p>Louisville is a port of entry for foreign imports, which aggregate annually about
                    $125,000. The city is governed by a mayor, elected every third year, with a
                    board of aldermen and a common council, the former containing one, and the
                    latter two representatives of each of the twelve wards. The population in 1830
                    was 10,341; in 1840, 21,210; in 1850, 43,196; in 1860, 68,033; in 1870, 100,753;
                    <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit15newyrich/page/n37/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0037-0024"/> and in 1880 it was 123,758. This last total
                    includes 20,905 persons of colour and 23,156 foreigners, the larger proportion
                    of the latter being Germans.</p>
                <p>It was in 1778 that Colonel George Rogers Clarke, on his way down the Ohio, left
                    a company of settlers who took possession of Corn Island (no longer existing),
                    near the Kentucky shore above the falls; and in the following year the first
                    rude cluster of cabins appeared on the site of the present city. An Act of the
                    Virginian legislature in 1780 gave the little settlement the rank of a town, and
                    called it Louisville in honour of Louis XVI. of France, then assisting the
                    American colonies in their struggle for independence. The rank of city was
                    conferred by the Kentucky legislature in 1828.</p>
