                    (1793-1847), a well-known hymn-writer, was born at Kelso, June 1, 1793, received
                    his early education in Ireland, and entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1812,
                    becoming a scholar of that college in the following year. Having entered
                    deacon’s orders in 1815, he for some time held a curacy near Wexford. He did not
                    long remain in Ireland, however, chiefly because of infirm health; and, coming
                    to England, after several changes he finally, in 1823, settled in the parish of
                    Brixham, where he laboured until fatal illness inter-rapted his work. In 1844

                    <hi rend="italic">Poems, chiefly Religious,</hi> in 1833, and in the following
                    year a little collection of psalms and hymns entitled <hi rend="italic">Tice
                    Spirit of the Psalms.</hi> These productions were drawn from various sources,
                    but many were his own; and the idea of the book was to express, in language
                    specially accordant with Christian experience, the leading thoughts contained in
                    the Psalter. Probably one of the best productions of Lyte’s pen was a finely
                    appreciative memoir of Henry Vaughan, the “Silurist,” which he prefixed to an
                    edition of his works. After his death, a volume of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Remains</hi> with a memoir was published, and the poems contained in this, with
                    those in <hi rend="italic">Poems, chiefly Religious,</hi> were afterwards issued
                    in one volume. In the region of pure poetry Lyte cannot be said to have taken
                    any special rank; refinement and pathos, rather than great imaginative power,
                    were the chief marks of his work. As a divine he was evangelical in doctrine,
                    but his ecclesiastical sympathies were with the Oxford school; as a preacher he
                    was simple, earnest, and graceful in style; but his chief claim to remembrance
                    lies in the beauty and spiritual elevation of his hymns, some of which may be
                    said to have become classical. The best known are “Abide with me! fast falls the
                    eventide”; “Jesus, I my cross have taken”; “Praise, my soul, the King of
                    Heaven”; and “Pleasant are thy courts above.”</p>
