                <p><label type="entry">LOVER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label> (1797-1868),
                    novelist, artist, songwriter, and musician, was born in Dublin in 1797. His
                    father was a member of the stock exchange. Lover began life as an artist, and
                    was elected an academician of the Royal Hibernian Society of Arts—a body of
                    which he afterwards became secretary. He acquired repute as a miniature painter;
                    and a number of the local aristocracy sat to him for their portraits. His love
                    for music showed itself at a very early age. At a dinner given to the poet Moore
                    in 1818 Lover sang one of his own songs, which elicited special praise from
                    Moore. One of his best known portraits was that of Paganini, which was exhibited
                    at the Royal Academy. He attracted attention as an author by his <hi
                    rend="italic">Legends and Stories of Ireland</hi> (1832), and was one of the
                    first writers for the <hi rend="italic">Dublin University Magazine.</hi> He went
                    to London about 1835, where, among others, he painted Lord Brougham in his robes
                    as lord chancellor. His varied gifts rendered him very popular in society; and
                    he appeared often at Lady Blessington’s evening receptions. There he sang
                    several of his songs, which were so well received that he published them <hi
                    rend="italic">{Songs and Ballads,</hi> 1839). Some of them illustrated Irish
                    superstitions, among these being “Rory O’More,” “The Angel’s Whisper,” “The May
                    Dew,” and “The Fourleaved Shamrock.” In 1837 appeared <hi rend="italic">Rory
                    O'More, a National Romance,</hi> which at once made him a great reputation as a
                    novelist; he afterwards dramatized it for the Adelphi Theatre, London. In 1842
                    was published his best known work, <hi rend="italic">Handy Andy, an Irish
                    Tale.</hi> Meanwhile his multifarious pursuits had seriously affected his
                    health; andin 1814 he gave up writing for some time, substituting instead public
                    entertainments, called by him “Irish Evenings,” illustrative of his own worksand
                    his powers as a musician and composer. These were very successful both in Great
                    Britain and in America. In addition to publishing numerous songs of his own,
                    Lover edited a collection entitled <hi rend="italic">The Lyrics of Ireland,</hi>
                    which appeared in 1858. He died on July 6, 1868. Lover was remarkable for his
                    versatility; but his fame rests mainly on his songs and novels; the latter are
                    full of sunny Irish humour, and teem with felicitous pictures of national life.
                    Besides those already mentioned he wrote <hi rend="italic">Treasure Trove</hi>
                    (1844), and <hi rend="italic">Metrical Tales and Other Poems</hi> (1860).</p>
