                <p><label type="entry">LEOPOLD I</label>. (1676-1747), duke of Anhalt-Dessau, <hi
                    rend="italic">der alte Dessauer,</hi> a famous Prussian general, was born at
                    Dessau, July 3, 1676. Possessing great physical energy and an absorbing interest
                    in military affairs, he at an early age displayed capacity for commands of high
                    responsibility. On the death of his father in 1693 he succeeded him as colonel
                    of a regiment in the service of Brandenburg, and, having rendered invaluable
                    assistance at the capture of Namur by William III of Orange in 1696, he obtained
                    the rank of major-general. Returning shortly afterwards to his principality, he
                    conceived a passionate attachment for the daughter of an apothecary, whom he
                    raised to the rank of nobility and made his wife on reaching his majority.
                    During the years that he now spent in his principality, he won the ardent
                    affection of the mass of the people, both by his considerate regard for their
                    welfare and by the influence of his strong personality. In command of a division
                    of twelve thousand men at Blenheim in 1704, Leopold so acted in a critical
                    contingency as practically to turn the scales of victory; and in Eugene’s
                    Italian campaigns he was conspicuous at the battle of Cassano in 1705, the
                    storming of Turin in 1706, and in other affairs of minor importance. After
                    serving as a volunteer at Malplaquet in 1709, he received an independent command
                    from Prussia, and rendered important assistance to Marlborough against Villars.
                    Created fieldmarshal in 1715, he gained the special confidence of Frederick
                    William I., and it was in no small degree to his instructions in military
                    tactics, and the splendid perfection to which he had brought the small army of
                    Prussia, that the great military triumphs of Frederick II. were due. His more
                    important military inventions are the iron ramrod and the equal step. As a
                    general he specially excelled in stratagems and surprises, in which he was
                    greatly aided by his daring and impetuous energy. These qualities were specially
                    displayed in the surprise and bloodless capture of Mörs castle in 1712, the
                    seizure during night of the island of Rügen in 1715, the formation in 1741 of
