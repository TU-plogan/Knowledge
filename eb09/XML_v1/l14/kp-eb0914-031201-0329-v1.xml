                <p><label type="entry">LARD</label> is the melted and strained fat of the common
                    hog. The bulk of the lard of commerce is obtained from the abdominal fat of the
                    animal; but in the preparation of inferior qualities fatty scraps of all kinds
                    which result from the preparation of pork are melted up, and occasionally entire
                    flanks of pigs are treated for the fat they yield. Ordinary lard is a pure white
                    fat of the consistency of butter, having a faint characteristic taste, and
                    scarcely any odour. It melts at between 78° to 88° Fahr., has a specific gravity
                    of 0*915, and consists of 62 per cent, of fluid fat (olein or lard oil), and 38
                    per cent, of the hard fats palmitin and stearin. If perfectly pure, it has no
                    tendency to become rancid; but there is generally sufficient impurity present to
                    develop a change in the olein, which gradually exhibits itself by a yellow
                    colour and a rancid odour and taste. Lard is an article of considerable
                    importance in commerce; it is calculated that the annual produce of the
                    substance in the United States of America alone is not less than 5,000,000 cwts.
                    Its preparation is conducted in connexion with the great pork-curing and packing
                    establishments, mostly centred in Chicago, Cincinnati, St Louis, Milwaukee,
                    Louisville, and Indianapolis,—Chicago alone now monopolizing about one-half of
                    the American trade. In these establishments the fat is “rendered” in large vats
                    heated by coils or worms of steam pipes, each charge being completely melted in
                    from ten to twelve hours. The greaves or cracklings which remain are used for
                    making “dog biscuits,” &amp;c. The finest lard is prepared from the “leaf” fat
                    of the abdominal cavity, and passes into commerce as “prime steam lard.” The
                    intestinal fat, trimmings, and refuse yield No. 2 lard, which is mostly sent to
                    the European market. The summer-killed pigs yield on an average 34 lb of lard,
                    while the winter-killed animals produce about 37 lb, but in the case of selected
                    animals these figures may rise to 45 ft) and 54 ft) respectively. The uses of
                    lard are numerous: it is largely employed by biscuit and pastry bakers and in
                    domestic cookery; it is used in the dressing and currying of leather; it is an
                    important article in pharmacy for ointments, plaisters, and suppositories; it
                    forms a principal ingredient in many pomades and preparations for the toilet;
                    and it is the source of the important lard oil and “solar stearin” noted below.
                    Lard is occasionally adulterated with water up even to 20 per cent., with
                    starch, chalk, plaster of Paris, baryta, &amp;c. Such falsifications, owing to
                    the nature of the substance, are easily detected :—the water by bringing the
                    substance gently to the melting point when it separates; starch by the
                    characteristic reaction with iodine; and mineral substance by the ash remaining
                    after the burning of the fat. The imports into the United Kingdom in 1880
                    amounted to 927,512 cwts., value £1,852,160,—the very large proportion of
                    873,100 cwts. coming from the United States, and 46,618 from British North
                    America. A large amount of native lard is also consumed in the United Kingdom,
                    this being usually put up in bladders for sale. That prepared in Wiltshire is
                    the most highly prized, and is the quality generally used in domestic
                    cookery.</p>
                <p>Lard oil is the limpid, clear, colourless oil expressed by pressure and gentle
                    heat from lard, leaving a solid, glistening, and crystalline residue, known in
                    commerce as “solar stearin,” which is useful in candle making, but is also used
                    to adulterate spermaceti. Lard oil has now <pb break="no"

                    principally employed for the oiling of wool and in lubrication. It is also a
                    good deal consumed in the falsification of more valuable oils, for which its
                    neutral properties well adapt it; and it in turn is adulterated with cotton seed
                    oil, &amp;c.</p>
