                    1150-1228), cardinal, fortyfourth archbishop of Canterbury, was born about the
                    middle of the 12th century; the place of his birth is unknown, but his family
                    almost certainly belonged to Yorkshire. He had already been made a prebendary of
                    York, most probably at an early age, when he went to France and entered the
                    university of Paris; there he soon rose to distinction alike in philosophy and
                    theology, and ultimately, it is said, became chancellor or at least attained
                    high rank in the governing body. One of his fellow students and intimate friends
                    in Paris was Lothario, the nephew of Clement HL, who when he in 1198 succeeded
                    Celestine III. as Innocent III. forthwith appointed Langton to a post in his
                    household. In 1206 he became cardinal priest of St Chrysogonus, a promotion on
                    which he received the written congratulations of his sovereign King John. It was
                    shortly after this that he first became involved in the great constitutional
                    struggles with which his name is so honourably associated. In 1205 Hubert Walter
                    of Canterbury had died, and there were urged at Rome the claims of two rival
                    candidates for the vacant see,—-Reginald the subprior of Christ Church,
                    Canterbury, who had been the sudden and unauthorized choice of a majority of the
                    monks, and John de Gray, bishop of Norwich, whom the dissenting minority had
                    subsequently elected with the royal sanction. Setting aside both claims, and
                    also the appeal of the suffragans of Canterbury with the chapter, who maintained
                    that the right of election was theirs, Innocent commanded the monks then present
                    in Rome to proceed to a new election in his presence, Langton being the
                    candidate set before them. Elected he accordingly was, and afterwards
                    consecrated by the pope himself at Viterbo in June 1207. John immediately
                    retaliated by banishing the monks of Canterbury, afterwards writing an angry and
                    threatening letter to the pope. Innocent replied with firmness, but, finding
                    John immovable, ultimately&lt;declared his resolution to enforce submission to
                    his will by laying England under an interdict, a resolution which was carried
                    into effect in March 1208. For the next few years, all negotiations for his
                    admission to his see having failed, Langton had his <pb break="no"

                    Sens in France, which thus became a principal resort of English malcontents and
                    refugees. In the summer of 1212 he accompanied the bishops of London and Ely to
                    Rome, and it was in consequence of their representations that deposition was
                    passed upon John; the same prelates were also present at the great assembly of
                    Soissons (April 1213), where a crusade against the king of England was set on
                    foot, under the leadership of Philip of France. In the following May John made
                    his peace, agreeing to recognize Langton, receive the exiled clergy, and restore
                    the property which he had confiscated. Langton did not actually reach England
                    till July, when (July 20, 1213) he performed his first episcopal act by
                    pronouncing the absolution of the excommunicated John, who swore that all the
                    laws of his grandfather Henry I. should be kept by all throughout the kingdom,
                    and that all unjust laws should be utterly abolished. This oath the king was
                    held by the archbishop to have violated almost immediately in levying war
                    irregularly against the barons who had, not illegally, deserted him at
                    Portsmouth; and at the meeting held in St Paul’s, London, on August 25,1214, it
                    was Langton who produced the old charter of Henry L, and suggested the demand
                    for its renewal, a suggestion which in the following year issued in the
                    concession of Magna Charta at Runnymede. Soon afterwards the archbishop left
                    England for Rome to attend the fourth Lateran council, but not before he had by
                    the commissioners of the pope been pronounced contumacious, and declared to be
                    suspended for his refusal to publish the excommunication of the English barons
                    who had joined in obtaining the great charter. At Rome, where the sentence of
                    his suspension was confirmed, he remained from November 1215 till May 1218: in
                    September of the latter year he presided in the council held at London, where
                    Magna Charta was solemnly confirmed; and on May 17, 1220, he officiated at the
                    re-coronation of Henry III. In the same year the “translation” of St Thomas of
                    Canterbury took place. Among the fragmentary notices we possess of the remainder
                    of Langton’s life are mentioned his demand in name of the barons for royal
                    confirmation of the charter at London in 1223. He died at Slindon on July 9,
                    1228.</p>
