                    (1715-1799), a distinguished astronomer, was born in Paris, November 23, 1715,
                    where his father combined the practice of astronomy with the profession of
                    philosophy. His first recorded observation was made before he was sixteen, and
                    the presentation of an elaborate lunar map procured for him admission to the
                    Academy, April 21, 1736, at the early age of twenty. He was chosen in the same
                    year to accompany Maupertuis and Clairaut on their geodesical expedition to
                    Lapland. In 1738, shortly after his return, he explained, in a memoir read
                    before the Academy, the striking advantages of Flamsteed’s mode of determining
                    right ascensions. Indeed his persistent recommendation of English methods and
                    instruments combined with the labours of Lacaille to effect a revolution in
                    French practical astronomy, and constituted the most eminent of his services to
                    science. He corresponded with Bradley, was the first to represent the effects of
                    nutation in the solar tables, and introduced, in 1741, the use of the
                    transit-instrument at the Paris observatory. He visited England in 1748, and in
                    company with the earl of Morton and Short the optician continued his journey to
                    Scotland, where he observed the annular eclipse of July 25. The liberality of
                    Louis XV., in whose favour he stood high, furnished him with the means of
                    procuring the best instruments, many of them by English makers, and gave him the
                    command of the royal printing establishment for the publication of his works.
                    Amongst the fruits of his industry may be mentioned a laborious investigation of
                    the disturbances of Jupiter by Saturn, the results of which were employed and
                    confirmed by Euler in his prize essay of 1748; a series of lunar observations
                    extending over fifty years; some interesting researches in terrestrial magnetism
                    and atmospheric electricity, in the latter of which he detected a regular
                    diurnal period; and the determination of the places of a great number of stars,
                    including twelve separate observations of Uranus, between 1765 and its discovery
                    as a planet. In his lectures at the Collège de France he first publicly
                    expounded the analytical theory of gravitation, and his timely patronage secured
                    the services of Lalande for astronomy. His temper was irritable, and his hasty
                    utterances exposed him to retorts which he did not readily forgive. Against
                    Lalande, his jealousy having been excited by his preference for Lacaille, he
                    closed his doors “during an entire revolution of the moon’s nodes.” His career
                    was arrested by paralysis late in 1791, and a repetition of the stroke
                    terminated his life. He died at Héril near Bayeux, May 31, 1799. By his marriage
                    with Mademoiselle de Cussy, he left three daughters, one of whom became the wife
                    of Lagrange. He was admitted in 1739 to the Royal Society, and was one of the
                    one hundred and forty-four original members of the Institute.</p>
