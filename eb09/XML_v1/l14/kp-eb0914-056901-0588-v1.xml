                <p><label type="entry">LIEGNITZ</label>, the capital of a district of the same name
                    in the Prussian province of Silesia, is picturesquely situated on the Katzbach,
                    just above its junction with the Schwarzwasser, and 40 miles west-north-west of
                    Breslau. It consists of an old town, surrounded by pleasant, shady promenades,
                    and several well-built suburbs. The most prominent building is the palace of tho
                    former dukes of Liegnitz, rebuilt after a fire in 1835, and now occupied by the
                    administrative offices of the district. The Ritter Academie, founded by the
                    emperor Joseph in 1708, for the education cf the young Silesian nobles, was
                    reconstructed as a gymnasium in 1810. The Roman Catholic church, with two flue
                    towers, contains the burial vault of the dukes. The principal Lutheran church
                    dates from the 14th century. There are also several other churches and schools,
                    and a number of benevolent institutions. The theatre, the barracks, the military
                    hospital, and the townhouse are the most noteworthy of the remaining buildings.
                    The manufactures of Liegnitz are considerable, the chief articles being cloth,
                    wool, leather, tobacco, and pianos. Its trade in grain and its cattle-markets
                    are likewise important The large market gardens in the suburbs grow vegetables
                    to the value of £20,000 per annum. Population in 1880 37,168, about one-sixth
                    being Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p>Liegnitz is first mentioned in an historical document io the year 1004. In 1164
                    it became the seat of the dukes of Liegnitz, who greatly improved and enlarged
                    it, especially in 1170 and 1175. The dukes were members of the illustrious Piast
                    family, which gave so many kings to Poland. At Wahlstatt, near Liegnitz, the
                    tide of Mongolian invasion was stemmed, in 1241, in a hard-fought battle between
                    the Tartars and the Christian chivalry under the duke of Silesia. The victory,
                    indeed, remained with the invaders, but the obstinate resistance deterred them
                    from any further attack on Germany. During the Thiιty Years’ War Liegnitz was
                    taken by the Swedes, but was soon recaptured by the Imperialists. The Saxon army
                    also defeated the imperial troops near Liegnitz in 1634. On the death of the
                    last duke of Liegnitz in 1675, the duchy came into the possession of Austria,
                    which retained it until the Prussian conquest of Silesia in 1740-45. In 1760
                    Frederick the Great gained a decisive victory near Liegnitz over the Austrians
                    under Laudon, and in 1813 the list of important battles in this neighbourhood
                    was completed by Bliicher’s defeat of the French at the battle of the Katzbach.
                    During the present century Liegnitz has been uniformly prosperous, and its
                    population has increased fivefold since 1800.</p>
