                <p><label type="entry">LACQUER, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lacker</hi></label>, in
                    general terms may be said to be coloured and frequently opaque varnishes applied
                    to certain metallic objects and to wood. The term is derived from the resin lac,
                    which substance is the basis of lacquers properly so called. Technically, among
                    Western nations, lacquering is restricted to the coating of polished metals or
                    metallic surfaces, such as brass, pewter, and tin, with prepared varnishes which
                    will give them a golden, bronzelike, or other lustre as desired. Of the numerous
                    recipes for the preparation of the various lacquers, the following for a gold
                    lacquer for brass work may be taken as a sample :—shell-lac 8 oz., sandarach 2
                    oz., turmeric 8 oz,, arnotto 2 oz., dragon’s blood ⅜ oz., dissolved in 1 gallon
                    of rectified spirit. Throughout the East Indies the lacquering of wooden
                    surfaces is universally practised, large articles of household furniture, as
                    well as small boxes, trays, toys, and papier mâché objects, being decorated with
                    bright-coloured and variegated lacquer. The lacquer used in the East is, in
                    general, variously coloured sealing-wax, applied, smoothed, and polished in a
                    heated condition; and by various devices intricate marbled, streaked, and
                    mottled designs are produced. Quite distinct from these, and from all other
                    forms of lacquer, is the lacquer work of Japan. The source and nature of the raw
                    material of Japanese lacquer has been referred to under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Japanning,</hi> and there also will be found some allusion to its extraordinary
                    durability and resistance to all ordinary solvents. Not less extraordinary is
                    the manipulative skill shown by the Japanese in this kind of work, and the
                    variety and exquisite perfection of its decorative treatment, which all go to
                    place Japanese lacquer of high quality among the rarest and most prized
                    treasures of decorative art. In the preparation of Japanese lacquer work the
                    wooden object to be treated is first coated with several layers of raw lacquer
                    mixed with brick dust, &amp;c., which, when hardened, are smoothed with gritty
                    stone. A few layers of common or inferior varnish of the colour desired in the
                    finished object are then successively added. After each coating the objects are
                    placed to dry in an enclosed box, the sides of which are kept moist with water,
                    so that hardening takes place in a dark damp atmosphere. The final coating is
                    composed of the best quality of lacquer, and it is smoothed with great care and
                    polished with powdered dfeer horn. The brilliant smooth polish of plain black
                    lacquer is brought up by repeated thin rubbings over with uncoloured lacquer and
                    polishings with deer horn. Such are the elaborate processes used for entirely
                    unornamented lacquer; but most Japanese work is enriched with decorations which
                    introduce an endless variety of treatment and much more complex, tedious, and
                    costly processes of operation. Flat work, variously coloured and speckled,
                    ornamented with gilt patterns, is among the simplest of the artistic lacquer
                    productions of Japan. Relief or raised lacquer work, on the other hand, is a
                    most elaborate and costly production, the labour of months and even years being
                    expended on the preparation of fine high-relief examples. The raised designs are
                    produced with a mixture of red oxide of iron and lacquer repeatedly applied till
                    the desired elevation is attained, the form of the raised surface being
                    carefully modelled and controlled between successive applications by rubbing and
                    grinding with charcoal powder. Metallic powders—gold, silver, bronze,
                    &amp;c.—are applied with the final coat while the work is still in a viscous
                    condition, and these sinking into the lacquer produce a strongly adherent
                    surface with a fine subdued metallic lustre. Other methods of ornamental
                    treatment consist of inlaying and incrusting the lacquer with mother of pearl,
                    ivory, gold, bronze, or tinfoil. A great variety of decorative effect may be
                    thus produced, but lacquers so treated are not held in the same high esteem as
                    the raised or even the flat varieties. Thin sections of the substance to be
                    inlaid are placed on the surface of a freshly coated and yet “tacky” object, and
                    imbedded by the repeated applications of additional coatings; the surface is
                    then rubbed and reduced till the inlay and lacquer form one smooth continuous
                    surface. Relief incrustations are managed in an analogous manner, the lacquer
                    being smoothed and polished around the incrusted object or pattern. Lacquer is
                    also ornamented by carving, a style mostly applied to red lacquer, although it
                    is also occasionally done in black and other dark colours. This method of
                    treatment has been introduced from China, where red carved lac or Peking lac is
                    a characteristic ornamental substance.</p>
