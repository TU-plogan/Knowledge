                <p><label type="entry">LOBO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ieronimo</hi></label> (1593-1678),
                    a Jesuit missionary, was born in Lisbon in 1593, and entered the Order of Jesus
                    at the age of sixteen. In 1621 he was ordered to repair as a missionary to
                    India, and in 1622 he arrived at Goa. With the intention of proceeding to
                    Abyssinia as a missionary, he left India in 1624, but after disembarking on the
                    coast of Mombas, and attempting to reach his destination by land, through the
                    Galla country, was forced to return. Repeating the attempt in the ensuing year,
                    in concert with Mendez, the newly-appointed patriarch of Ethiopia, and eight
                    missionaries, Lobo landed on the coast of the Red Sea, and settled down in
                    Abyssinia as superintendent of the missions in the state of Tigre, travelling
                    about a good deal over the country, and thus obtaining much valuable information
                    on its geography and people. He remained at his post for some years, until death
                    deprived the Catholics of their protector, the emperor Segued. Forced by
                    persecution to leave the kingdom, in 1634 Lobo fell, along with his companions,
                    into the hands of the Turks at Massowah, and was sent by them to India to
                    procure a ransom for his imprisoned fellow-missionaries. This object he gained,
                    and at the same time he endeavoured, though without avail, to persuade the
                    Portuguese viceroy to send an armament against Abyssinia. Intent upon
                    accomplishing this cherished project, he embarked for Portugal, and after he had
                    been shipwrecked on the coast of Natal, and captured by pirates, arrived at
                    Lisbon. Neither at this city, however, nor at Madrid and Rome, was any
                    countenance given to Lobo’s plan for Christianizing Abyssinia by the aid of
                    arms. He accordingly returned to India in 1640, and was elected rector, and
                    afterwards provincial, of the Jesuits at Goa. After some years he returned to
                    his native city, and died there January 29, 1678.</p>
                <p>Lobo wrote an account of his travels in Portuguese, which appeal s never to have
                    been printed, but is deposited in the monastery of St Roque, Lisbon. Balthezar
                    Telles made large use of the information therein in his <hi rend="italic"

                    (Coimbra, 1660), which is often erroneously attributed to Lobo (see Machado’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca</hi><hi rend="italic">Lusitana).</hi> Lobo’s own
                    narrative was translated from a MS. copy into French, under the title of <hi

                    Abissinie,</hi> by the Abbé Legrand, Paris, 1728. In 1669 a translation by Sir
                    Peter Wyche of several passages from a MS. account of Lobo’s travels was
                    published by the Royal Society, and this was translated into Thenevot’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Relation des Voyages</hi> in 1673. An English abridgment of
                    Legrand’s edition by Dr Johnson was published in 1735, and reprinted in 1789. In
