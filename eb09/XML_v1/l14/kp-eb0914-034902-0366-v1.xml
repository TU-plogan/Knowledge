                <p><label type="entry">LAURENS, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1756-1782),
                    an American revolutionary officer of distinguished bravery, son of Henry Laurens
                    noticed above, was born at Charleston, South Carolina, in 1756. He was educated
                    in England, and on his return to America in 1777, in the height of the
                    revolutionary struggle, he joined Washington’s staff. He soon gained his
                    commander’s confidence, which he reciprocated with the most devoted attachment,
                    and was entrusted with the delicate duties of a confidential secretary, which he
                    performed with much tact and skill. He was present in all Washington's battles,
                    from that of the Brandywine to Yorktown, and his gallantry on every occasion has
                    gained him the title of “the Bayard of the Revolution.” Laurens displayed
                    bravery even to rashness in the storming of the Chew mansion at Germantown; at
                    Monmouth, where he saved Washington’s life by rushing between him and danger,
                    and was himself severely wounded; and at Coosahatchie, where, with a handful of
                    men, he defended a pass against a large English force under General Prevost, and
                    where he was again wounded. In command of a body of light infantry at the
                    storming of Savannah, he was among the first to penetrate the English lines, and
                    again distinguished himself at the siege of Charleston in 1780. After the
                    capture of Charleston by the English, he rejoined Washington, and was selected
                    by him as a special envoy to appeal to the king of France for supplies for the
                    relief of the American armies, which had been brought by prolonged service and
                    scanty pay to the verge of dissolution. The more active co-operation of the
                    French fleets with the land forces in Virginia, which was one result of his
                    mission, brought about the unexpected overwhelming of Cornwallis at Yorktown.
                    Laurens lost no time in rejoining the army, and at Yorktown was at the head of
                    the American storming party which captured the first redoubt, and received the
                    sword of Colonel Campbell, its commander. Laurens was designated with Count de
                    Noailles to arrange the terms of a surrender, which occurred October 19,1781,
                    and virtually ended the war, although desultory skirmishing, especially in the
                    south, attended the months of delay before peace was formally concluded. In one
                    of these trifling affairs in July 1782, on the Combahee Ferry, Laurens exposed
                    himself needlessly and was killed. Washington lamented deeply the death of
                    Laurens, then in his twenty-seventh year, saying of him, “He had not a fault
                    that I could discover, unless it were intrepidity bordering upon rashness.”</p>
