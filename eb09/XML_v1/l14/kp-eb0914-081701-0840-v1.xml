                    Vasilievich</hi></label> (1711-1765), was born in the year 1711, in the village
                    of Denisovka (which in later times has had its name changed in honour of the
                    poet), situated on an island not far from Kholmogori, in the government of
                    Archangel. His father, a fisherman, took the boy as soon as he was ten years of
                    age to assist him in the labours of his calling; but his eagerness for knowledge
                    was unbounded. The few books accessible to him he almost learned by heart; and,
                    seeing that there was no chance of his stock of knowledge being enlarged under
                    the arctic skies of his native place, he resolved to betake himself to Moscow in
                    the best way he could. An opportunity occurred when he was seventeen years of
                    age, and by the intervention of friends he obtained admission into the
                    Zaikonospasski school. There his progress was very rapid, especially in Latin,
                    and in 1734 he was sent from Moscow together with other promising students to St
                    Petersburg. There again his proficiency, especially in physical science, was
                    remarked by all, and he was one of the young Russians chosen to complete their
                    education in foreign countries. He accordingly commenced the study of metallurgy
                    at Marburg; but, not content with his work under the professors, he now began to
                    write poetry, imitating German authors, among whom he is said to have especially
                    admired Günther. His <hi rend="italic">Ode on the Taking of Khotin from the
                    Turks</hi> was composed in 1739, and attracted a great deal of attention at St
                    Petersburg. During his residence in Germany Lomonésoff married a native of the
                    country, and found it difficult to maintain his increasing family on the scanty
                    allowance granted to him by the St Petersburg Academy, which, moreover, was
                    irregularly sent. His circumstances became embarrassed, and he resolved to leave
                    the country secretly, and to return home. On his arrival in Russia, after an
                    adventure with a Prussian recruiting officer which at one time threatened
                    serious consequences, he rapidly rose to distinction, and was made professor of
                    chemistry in the university of St Petersburg; he ultimately became rector, and
                    in 1764 secretary of state. He died in 1765.</p>
                <p>The most valuable of the works of Lomonôsoff are those relating to physical
                    science, and he wrote upon many branches of it. He everywhere shows himself a
                    man of the most varied learning. He compiled a Russian grammar, which long
                    enjoyed popularity, and did much to improve the rhythm of Russian verse. Many of
                    his poems are good, but they do not constitute his chief claim to be remembered.
                    The school upon which he formed himself as a poet was a bad one. We must
                    remember that these were the days of falsely-conceived classicism, and the
                    French taste upon which all the literature of Europe was moulded. His great
                    merit is that he belongs to the glorious band of patriots, which includes such
                    men among Slavs as Dositei Obradovich, Raich, and Primus Trüber,— men whose
                    object was to elevate and give dignity to their country,— earnest toilers in the
                    field of national education.</p>
