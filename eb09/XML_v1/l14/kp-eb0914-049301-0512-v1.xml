                    (1775 -1818),often referred to as “Monk” Lewis, was born in London on July 9,
                    1775. He was educated for a diplomatic career at Westminster School and at
                    Christ Church, Oxford, spending most of his vacations abroad in the study of
                    modern languages; and in 1794 he proceeded to the Hague as attaché to the
                    British embassy. His stay there lasted only a few months, but was marked by the
                    composition, in ten weeks, of <hi rend="italic">Ambrosio, or the Monk,</hi>
                    which was published in the summer of the following year. It immediately achieved
                    extensive celebrity; but some passages it contained were of such a nature that
                    about a year after its appearance an injunction to restrain its sale was moved
                    for and a rule <hi rend="italic">nisi</hi> obtained. Lewis published a second
                    edition from which he had expunged, as he thought, all the objectionable
                    passages, but the work still remains of such a character as almost to justify
                    the severe language in which the author of <hi rend="italic">English Bards and
                    Scotch Reviewers</hi> addresses—</p>
                <p>“Wonder-working Lewis, Monk or Bard,</p>
                <p>Who fain would’st make Parnassus a churchyard; Even Satan’s self with thee might
                    dread to dwell, And in thy skull discern a deeper hell.”</p>
                <p>Whatever its demerits, ethical or aesthetic, may have been, <hi rend="italic">The
                    Monk</hi> did not interfere with the reception of Lewis into the best English
                    society; he was favourably noticed at court, and almost as soon as he came of
                    age he obtained a seat in the House of Commons as member for Hindon, Wilts.
                    After some years, however, during which he never ventured to address the House,
                    he finally withdrew from a parliamentary career. His tastes lay wholly in the
                    direction of literature, and <hi rend="italic">The Castle Spectre</hi> (1796, a
