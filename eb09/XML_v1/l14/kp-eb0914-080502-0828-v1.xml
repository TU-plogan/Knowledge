                <p><label type="entry">LOGWOOD</label> is a valuable dye-wood, the product of a
                    leguminous tree, <hi rend="italic">Hxmatoxylon campechianum,</hi> native of
                    Central America, and grown also in the West Indian Islands. The tree attains a
                    height not exceeding 40 feet, and is said to be ready for felling when about ten
                    years old. The wood, deprived of its bark and the sap-wood, is sent into the
                    market in the form of large blocks and billets. It is very hard and dense, and
                    externally has a dark brownish-red colour; but it is less deeply coloured
                    within. The best qualities come from Campeachy, but it is obtained there only in
                    small quantity. A large export trade in logwood of good quality is carried on
                    from Honduras and Jamaica, and inferior qualities are exported from St Domingo,
                    Martinique, Guadaloupe, &amp;c. The wood was introduced into Europe as a dyeing
                    substance soon after the discovery of America, but for many years (from 1581 to
                    1662) its use iu England was prohibited by legislative enactment on account of
                    the inferior dyes which at first were produced by its employment.</p>
                <p>The colouring principle of logwood exists iu the timber in the form of a
                    glucoside, from which it is liberated as haematoxylin or haematin by
                    fermentation. Haematoxylin was first isolated by Chevreul in 1810, and its
                    constitution was subsequently investigated by Erdmann, who found it to have the
                    formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 16</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 14</hi> O <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 6</hi>. It forms two crystalline hydrates, the principal
                    combination being with three molecules of water. This hydrate, C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> u</hi> Oθ +3H <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O, is a colourless body very sparingly soluble in cold
                    water, but dissolving freely in hot water and in alcohol. By exposure to the
                    air, especially in alkaline solutions, haematoxylin is rapidly oxidized into
                    haematein, with the development of a fine purple colour. The reaction consists
                    in the elimination of two atoms of hydrogen, thus haematoxylin hydrate (C <hi

                    haematoxylin is exceedingly rapid and delicate, rendering that body a valuable
                    laboratory test for alkalies. It is remarkable that the difference of two atoms
                    of hydrogen between colourless haematoxylin and coloured haematein is precisely
                    that which exists between the white and the blue forms of indigo. By the action
                    of hydrogen and sulphurous acid, haematein is easily reduced to
                    haematoxylin.</p>

                <p>Logwood is prepared for use by dyers, &amp;c., in the form of chips and raspings,
                    and as a solid brittle black extract. Chipped logwood is moistened with water
                    and spread in thin layers till a gentle fermentation sets up, whereby, under the
                    influence of liberated ammonia, haematoxylin is formed from the glucoside. By
                    exposure to the air, through repeated turnings of the mass, haematein is
                    developed from the haematoxylin, and the chips gradually become coated with the
                    brilliant metallic green crystals of haematein. Logwood extract, largely used in
                    calico printing, is obtained from oxidized chips and raspings by lixiviation,
                    the solution being concentrated at as low a temperature as possible.</p>
                <p>The principal use of logwood is for dyeing wool and woollen goods, on which it
                    produces, with various mordants, shades of blue from a light lavender to a dense
                    blue-black, according to the amount of logwood used. It is more employed in
                    combination with other dye-stuff's than as the sole tinctorial agent, the best
                    and most permanent blacks on wool, known as woaded blacks, being first dyed blue
                    in the indigo vat, and finished black with logwood and bichromate of potash. In
                    calico-printing logwood is used to produce steam purples, for the production of
                    which the calico is mordanted with stannate of soda, and printed with a strong
                    solution of logwood extract thickened with starch. By steaming, the haematein of
                    the logwood combines with binoxide of tin precipitated in the fibre, and thus
                    develops a bright purple colour. Logwood blacks, which are a standard product of
                    print works, are produced by mordanting with iron liquor, passing the calico
                    through a logwood solution, and developing and fixing the colour by treatment
                    with a weak solution of bichromate of potash.* Logwood blacks assume a bright
                    red tint by the action of dilute acids, a test by which they can readily be
                    distinguished from aniline and other fast blacks. Logwood is also largely used
                    in the preparation of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ink (⅛.v.),</hi> and to a small
                    extent in medicine. The imports of logwood into the United Kingdom during the
                    year 1880 amounted to 69,280 tons, the estimated value of which was
                    &lt;£192,392.</p>
