                <p><label type="entry">LANZI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Luigi</hi></label> (1732-1810), a
                    writer on Etruscan antiquities and on the history of Italian painting, was born
                    in 1732, and educated as a priest. In 1773 he was appointed keeper of the
                    galleries of Florence, from which time his attention seems to have been divided
                    between the study of Italian painting and the study of Etruscan antiquities and
                    language. In the one field his labours are represented by his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Storia</hi><hi rend="italic">Pittorica della Italia,</hi> the first portion of
                    which, containing the Florentine, Sienese, Roman, and Neapolitan schools,
                    appeared in 1792, the rest in 1796. The work is translated by Roscoe. In
                    archaeology his great achievement was the work entitled <hi rend="italic">Saggio
                    di lingua</hi><hi rend="italic">Etrusca,</hi> 1789, followed by <hi
                    rend="italic">Saggio</hi><hi rend="italic">delle</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lingue</hi><hi rend="italic">Ital. Antiche,</hi> 1806. In his memoir on the
                    so-called Etruscan vases <hi rend="italic">(Dei vasi antichi dipinti volgarmeηte
                    chiamati Etruschi,</hi> 1806) Lanzi rightly perceived their Greek origin and
                    characters. What was true of the antiquities would be true also, he argued, of
                    the Etruscan language, and the object of the <hi rend="italic">Saggio di
                    lingua</hi><hi rend="italic">Etrusca</hi> was to prove that this language must
                    be related to that of the neighbouring peoples—Romans, Umbrians, Oscans, and
                    Greeks. It is admitted that he was wanting in critical method after a certain
                    point, though at the same time much of the impulse he gave to study arose from
                    his general method of inquiry. It is a sign of the recognition he received that
                    he was allied with E. Q. Visconti in his great but never accomplished plan of
                    illustrating antiquity altogether from existing literature and monuments. His
                    notices of ancient sculpture and its various styles appeared as an appendix to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Saggio di lingua</hi><hi rend="italic">Etrusca,</hi> and
                    arose out of his careful and minute study of the treasures then added to the
                    Florentine collection from the Villa Medici. The abuse he has often met with
                    from modern writers in the Etruscan language led Corssen <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sprache der Etrusker,</hi> i. p. vi.) to protest in the name of his real
                    services to philology and archaeology. Among his latest productions may be
                    mentioned his edition of Hesiod’s <hi rend="italic">Works and Days,</hi> with
                    valuable notes, and a translation in <hi rend="italic">terza rima.</hi> It had
                    been begun as far back as 1785, but was recast and completed in 1808. The list
                    of his works closes with his <hi rend="italic">Opere</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sacre,</hi> a series of treatises on spiritual subjects. Lanzi died of
                    apoplexy, March 30, 1810, in the seventy-eighth year of his age. He was buried
                    in the church of the Santa Croce at Florence, by the side of Michelangelo.</p>
