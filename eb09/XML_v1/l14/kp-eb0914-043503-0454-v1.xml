                    yellowish-brown, marked with spots of dark brown and black. It has a short,

                    with five claws, those of the fore feet strongest, and fitted for scratching and
                    digging. The usual dwelling place of the lemmings is in the high lands or fells
                    of the great central mountain chain of Norway and Sweden, from the southern
                    branches of the Langfjeldene in Christiansand stift to the North Cape and the

                    under a tussock of grass or a stone, and constructed of short dry straws, and
                    usually lined with hair. The number of young in each nest is generally five,
                    sometimes only three, occasionally seven or eight, and at least two broods are
                    produced annually. Their food is entirely vegetable, especially grass roots and
                    stalks, shoots of the dwarf birch, reindeer lichens, and mosses, in search of
                    which they form, in winter, long galleries through the turf or under the snow.
                    They are restless, courageous, and pugnacious little animals. When suddenly
                    disturbed, instead of trying to escape they will sit upright, with their back
                    against a stone or other coign of vantage, hissing and showing fight in a very
                    determined manner.</p>
                <p>The circumstance which has given more popular interest to the lemming than to a
                    host of other species of the same order of animals, and has justified its
                    treatment in a separate article in this work, is that certain districts of the
                    cultivated lands of Norway and Sweden, where in ordinary circumstances they are
                    quite unknown, are occasionally and at very uncertain intervals varying from
                    five to twenty or more years, literally overrun by an army of these little
                    creatures, which steadily and slowly advance, always in the same direction, and
                    regardless of all obstacles, swimming across streams and even lakes of several
                    miles in breadth, and committing considerable devastation on their line of march
                    by the quantity of food they consume. In their turn they are pursued and
                    harassed by crowds of beasts and birds of prey, as bears, wolves, foxes, dogs,
                    wild cats, stoats, weasels, eagles, hawks, and owls, and never spared by man;
                    even the domestic animals not usually predaceous, as cattle, goats, and
                    reindeer, are said to join in the destruction, stamping them to the ground with
                    their feet, and even eating their bodies. Numbers also die from diseases
                    produced apparently from overcrowding. None ever return by the course by which
                    they came, and the onward march of the survivors never ceases until they reach
                    the sea, into which they plunge, and swimming onwards in the same direction as
                    before perish in the waves. These extraordinary and sudden appearances of vast
                    bodies of lemmings, and their singular habit of persistently pursuing the same
                    onward course of migration, have given rise to various speculations, from the
                    ancient belief of the Norwegian peasants, shared in by Olaus Magnus, that they
                    fall down from the clouds, to the almost equally untenable hypothesis,
                    ingeniously maintained by the late Mr W. D. Crotch, that they are acting in
                    these migrations in obedience to an instinct inherited from vastly ancient
                    times, and are still seeking the congenial home in the submerged Atlantis, to
                    which their ancestors of the Miocene period were wont to resort when driven from
                    their ordinary dwelling places by crowding or scarcity of food. The principal
                    really ascertained facts regarding these migrations, as stated by Mr R. Collett
                    <hi rend="italic">{Proceedings of the Linnean Society,</hi> vol. χiii. p. 327,
                    1878), seem to be as follows. When any combination of circumstances has
                    occasioned an increase of the numbers of the lemmings in their ordinary dwelling
                    places, impelled by the restless or migratory instinct possessed in a less
                    developed degree by so many of their congeners, a movement takes place at the
                    edge of the elevated plateau, and a migration towards the lower-lying land
                    begins. The whole body moves forward slowly, always advancing in the same
                    general direction in which they originally started, but following more or less
                    the course of the great valleys. They only travel by night; and, staying in
                    congenial places for considerable periods, with unaccustomed abundance of
                    provender, notwithstanding all the destructive influences to which they are
                    exposed, they multiply excessively during their journey, having still more
                    numerous families and more frequently than in their usual homes. The progress
                    may last from one to three years, according to the route taken, and the distance
                    to be traversed until the sea-coast is reached, which in a country so surrounded
                    by water as the Scandinavian peninsula must be the ultimate goal of such a
                    journey. This may be either the Atlantic or the Gulf of Bothnia, according as
                    the migration has commenced from the west or the east side of the central
                    elevated plateau. Those that finally perish in the sea, committing what appears
                    to be a voluntary suicide, are only acting under the same blind impulse which
                    has led them previously to cross smaller pieces of water with safety. Further
                    information about the migrations of the lemming will be found in Mr Collett’s
                    paper referred to above, and also in those of Mr Crotch in the same volume. (w.
