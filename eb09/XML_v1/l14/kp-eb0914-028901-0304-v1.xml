                <p><label type="entry">LANNES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean</hi></label> (1769-1809),
                    marshal of France, was born at Lectoure, 11th April 1769. He was the son of a
                    livery stables keeper, and was himself in early life apprenticed to a dyer. He
                    had had but little education, but notwithstanding this his great strength and
                    proficiency in all manly sports caused him in 1792 to be elected sergeant-major
                    of the battalion of volunteers of Gers, which he had joined on the breaking out
                    of the war between Spain and the French republic. He served through the
                    campaigns in the Pyrenees in 1793 and 1794, and in the latter year was elected
                    chef de brigade. However, in 1795, on the reform of the army introduced by the
                    Thermidorians, he was dismissed from his rank. Not discouraged by this check, he
                    re-enlisted as a simple volunteer in the army of Italy. In the famous campaign
                    of 1796 he again fought his way up to high rank, being eventually made once more
                    chef de brigade by Bonaparte. He was distinguished in every battle, and was
                    wounded at Arcola. He was chosen by Bonaparte to accompany him to Egypt as
                    general of one of Kléber’s brigades, in which capacity he greatly distinguished
                    himself, especially on the retreat from Syria. He went with Bonaparte to France,
                    assisted at the 18th Brumaire, and was appointed general of division, and
                    commandant of the consular guard. He commanded the advanced guard in the
                    crossing of the Alps in 1800, was instrumental in winning the battle of
                    Montebello, from which he afterwards took his title, and bore the brunt of the
                    battle of Marengo. In 1801 Napoleon tried his favourite general as a
                    diplomatist, and sent him as ambassador to Portugal. Opinions differ as to his
                    merits in this capacity, but it may be presumed that Napoleon did not believe in
                    them, as he never made such use of him again. On the establishment of the empire
                    he was created a marshal of France, and commanded once more the advanced guard
                    of a great French army in the campaign of Austerlitz. At Austerlitz he commanded
                    the left, at Jena the centre, and at Friedland the centre of the French army,
                    showing himself a general of division of the greatest merit, carrying out the
                    orders given him to the letter, and never thinking them impossible. He was now
                    to be tried as a commanderin-chief, for Napoleon took him to Spain in 1808, and
                    gave him a corps d’armée, with which he won a victory over Castanos on November
                    22. In January 1809 he was sent to attempt the capture of Saragossa, and by
                    February 21 was in possession of the place. Napoleon then created him Due de
                    Montebello, and once more, for the last time, gave him the command of the
                    advanced guard of an army of invasion. At Aspern he was ordered with two
                    divisions to cut the Austrian army under the archduke Charles in half; he
                    succeeded entirely, though under a heavy fire, but finding himself unsupported
                    by Napoleon, who had been thrown into confusion by the news that his bridges
                    over the Danube had been broken, he had to retreat. During the retreat he
                    exposed himself as usual to the hottest fire, and received a mortal wound. As he
                    was being carried from the field to die at Vienna, he is said to have met and
                    reproached his old general for his ambition; but this, to say the least, is a
                    contested statement. Napoleon said of him that “he had found him a pigmy, and
                    made him a giant”; and there can be no doubt of his marvellous ability on the
                    field, and his extraordinary courage. His eldest son was made a peer of France
                    by Louis XVIII.</p>
