                    (c.1466-1523), one of the introducers of a knowledge of the Greek language into
                    England, was born at Odiham, in or about the year 1466. He entered the
                    university of Oxford in 1484, became a demy of Magdalen in 1486, and after
                    taking his first degree in arts went on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On his return
                    he put in at Rhodes, which was still occupied by the Knights, under whose
                    protection many Greeks had taken refuge after the taking of Constantinople by
                    the Turks. Here he laid the foundation of a knowledge of the Greek language. We
                    next hear of him in Italy, following the lectures of John Sulpitius and
                    Pomponius Laetus at Rome. From this he passed on to Venice, from which place he
                    writes to his friend and patron Thomas Starkey, that “he is assiduously
                    attending the lectures of Egnatius in Latin, but that he finds no one in Venice
                    who can assist him in the study of Greek. He reads, however, Greek by himself,
                    and has <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n665/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0914-0665-0644"/> read seven plays of Sophocles, five of Euripides,
                    three of Aristophanes, besides extracts from Xenophon and Plutarch, by himself
                    without a teacher.” After his return he settled in London, as a private teacher
                    of grammar, and is believed to have been the first who taught Greek in that
                    city. In 1510 Colet, dean of St Paul’s, who was then founding the school which
                    afterwards became famous, appointed Lilye the first highmaster. He held this
                    office only twelve years, dying of the plague in February 1523.</p>
                <p>Lilye’s name deserves commemoration, not only as one of the pioneers of Greek
                    learning, but as one of the joint authors of a book, familiar to many
                    generations of students, down to the present century, the old Eton Latin
                    grammar. The <hi rend="italic">Brevissima Institutio,</hi> a sketch by Colet,
                    corrected by Erasmus, and worked upon by Lilye, contains two portions, the
                    authorship of which is indisputably Lilye’s. These are the lines on the genders
                    of nouns, beginning “Propria quae maribus,” and those on the conjugation of
                    verbs, beginning “As in praesenti.” The “Carmen de moribus” bears Lilye’s name
                    in the early editions: but Hearne asserts that it was written by Leland, who was
                    one of his scholars, and that Lilye only adopted it. Besides the <hi
                    rend="italic">Brevissima Institutio,</hi> Lilye wrote a variety of Latin pieces
                    both in prose and verse. Some of the latter are printed along with the Latin
                    verses of Sir Thomas More in <hi rend="italic">Progymηasmata Thomee Mori</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Gulielmi Lylii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sodalium,</hi> Basel, 1518. Another volume of Latin verse directed against a
                    rival schoolmaster and grammarian, Whittington, whose grammar that of Lilye
                    superseded, is entitled <hi rend="italic">Antibossicon ad Gulielmum Horrnαηnum
                    *1521.</hi></p>
                <p>The only authority for the few facts which make up the above life of Lilye is a
                    short sketch furnished by his son George to Paulus Jovius, who was collecting
                    for his history the lives of the learned men of Great Britain. All the other
                    names, such as Bale, Pits, Fuller, Wood, which figure in the dictionaries as
                    authorities, are only transcripts of George Lilye. To these scanty memoranda the
                    present article adds an extract from three letters of Lilye’s preserved in the
                    British Museum, Cotton. Nero, B. vi. fol. 157, now printed for the first
                    time.</p>
