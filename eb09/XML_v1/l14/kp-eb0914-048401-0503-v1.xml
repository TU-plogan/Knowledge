                    way that they cannot be opened without breaking the seal, and which were
                    originally always addressed to individuals, in contradistinction to <hi
                    rend="italic">lettres patentes,</hi> or letters patent, beginning “know all men
                    by these presents.” Lettres closes interfering with the administration of
                    justice or the liberty of the subject were forbidden by numerous edicts in the
                    14th, 15th, and 16th centuries, and the term lettres de cachet, as synonymous
                    with lettres closes, is first found in the ordinance of Orleans in 1560. The
                    convenience of such a means to consign one’s enemies to prison was seen by
                    Richelieu and Mazarin, who followed the Guise Government in using them
                    frequently, despite numerous protestations on the part of the parlements, of
                    which the most notable was when in 1648 an ordinance was registered that no man
                    should be kept in prison three days without interrogation. When once Louis XIV.
                    had begun to rule, he made frequent use of lettres de cachet both for state
                    purposes and to control and disorganize his nobility, and he boldly justified
                    their use in an edict of 1705. But the most marked justification is to be found
                    in the circular letter addressed to the parlements of France in reply to
                    protests against arbitrary imprisonment in 1759, in which the king says that “he
                    reserves arbitrary orders—in other words, lettres de cachet —for occasions
                    wherein they may be necessary for the public good and the interests of
                    families.” In this remark he distinguishes between the two purposes for which
                    such letters were granted. He first alleges state reasons why he should have
                    power to arrest arbitrarily—a power no one would deny to the executive on
                    occasions of emergency, if used under proper restrictions. Secondly, he says
                    that they are issued in the interest of families, and here he touches the great
                    source of their injustice and unpopularity. It was the custom for the king to
                    sign a number of blank lettres de cachet which his ministers gave away to
                    whoever they pleased. Thus they often fell into hands of people who used them to
                    gratify private hate; fathers obtained them and inserted the names of their
                    sons, wives inserted the names of their husbands, opera dancers those of lovers
                    who had spurned them. The evil grew to such a height that Turgot and Lamoignon
                    de Malesherbes refused to enter the ministry of Louis XVI. unless they might see
                    the contents of the orders they countersigned, and see the causes for which men
                    were to be imprisoned. It is needless to say that when the cahiers of the
                    primary assemblies were prepared, to instruct the deputies to the states-general
                    in the wishes of their constituents, abolition of lettres de cachet was demanded
                    in almost all the cahiers of the noblesse and tiers état. The subject was
                    mentioned in the early debates of the Constituent Assembly, but lettres de
                    cachet were not formally abolished till January 15, 1790, and on March 13 of the
                    same year all imprisoned under them were ordered to be set at liberty. The great
                    authority for the history and injustice of lettres de cachet is Mirabeau’s <hi

                    Vincennes into which his father had thrown him by a lettre de cachet. It is one
                    of the ablest and most eloquent of his works, had an immense circulation, and
                    was translated into English with a dedication to the duke of Norfolk in 1788.
