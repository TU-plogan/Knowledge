                    Society,</hi> 1878, pp. 155-211), admits forty-nine species of them, which he
                    places in five genera instead of the many which some prior investigators had
                    sought to establish. Of the genera recognized by him, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pagophila</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhodostethia</hi> have but one species
                    each, <hi rend="italic">Rissa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Xema</hi> two, while
                    the rest belong to <hi rend="italic">Larus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pagophila</hi> is the so-called Ivory-Gull, <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">eburnea,</hi> names which hardly do justice to the extreme
                    whiteness of its plumage, to which its jet-black legs offer a strong contrast.
                    The young, however, are spotted with black. An inhabitant of the most northern
                    seas, examples, most commonly young birds of the year, find their way in winter
                    to more temperate shores. Its breeding-place has seldom been discovered, and the
                    first of its eggs ever seen by ornithologists was brought home by Sir L.
                    M*Clintock in 1853 from Cape Krabbe <hi rend="italic">(Jourη. R. Dubl.
                    Society,</hi> i. p. 60, pl. 1); others were subsequently obtained by Dr Malmgren
                    in Spitsbergen. Of the species of <hi rend="italic">Rissa,</hi> one is the
                    abundant and well-known Kittiwake, <hi rend="italic">R. tridactyla,</hi> of
                    circumpolar range, breeding, however, also in comparatively low latitudes, as on
                    the coasts of Britain, and in winter frequenting southern waters. The other is
                    <hi rend="italic">R. brevirostris,</hi> limited to the North Pacific, between
                    Alaska and Kamchatka. The singular fact requires to be noticed that in both
                    these species the hind toe is generally deficient, but that examples of each are
                    occasionally found in which this functionless member has not wholly disappeared.
                    We have then the genus <hi rend="italic">Larus,</hi> w hich ornithologists have
                    hitherto attempted most unsuccessfully to subdivide. It contains the largest as
                    well as the smallest of Gulls. In some species the adults assume a dark-coloured
                    head every breeding-season, in others any trace of dark colour is the mark of
                    immaturity. The larger species prey fiercely on other kinds of birds, while the
                    smaller content themselves with a diet of insects and worms. But however diverse
                    be the appearance, structure, or habits of the extremities of the series of
                    species, they are so closely connected by intermediate forms that it is hard to
                    find a gap between them that would justify a generic division. Of the
                    forty-three species of this genus recognized by Mr Saunders it would be
                    impossible within the limits of this article to attempt to point out the
                    peculiarities. About fifteen belong to Europe and fourteen to North America, of
                    which (excluding stragglers) some five only are common to both countries. Our
                    knowledge of the geographical distribution of several of them is still
                    incomplete. Some have a very wide range, others very much the reverse, as
                    witness <hi rend="italic">L. ftdiginosus,</hi> believed to be confined to the
                    Galapagos, and <hi rend="italic">L. scopulinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L.
                    bulleri</hi> to New Zealand,—the last indeed perhaps only to the South Island.
                    The largest species of the group are the Glaucous and Greater Black-backed
                    Gulls, <hi rend="italic">L. glaucus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">L. marinus,</hi>
                    of which the former is circumpolar, and the latter nearly so— not being hitherto
                    found between Labrador and Japan. The smallest species is the European <hi
                    rend="italic">L. minutus,</hi> though the North-American <hi rend="italic">L.
                    Philadelphia</hi> does not much exceed it in size. Many of the Gulls congregate
                    in vast numbers to breed, whether on rocky cliffs of the sea-coast or on heathy
                    islands in inland waters. Some of the settlements of the Black-headed or
                    “Peewit” Gull, <hi rend="italic">L. ridibundus,</hi> are a source of no small
                    profit to their proprietors,—the eggs, which are rightly accounted a great
                    delicacy, being taken on an orderly system up to a certain day, and the birds
                    carefully protected. Ross’s or the Roseate Gull, <hi rend="italic">Rhodostethia
                    rosea,</hi> forms a well-marked genus, distinguished not so much by the pink
                    tint of its plumage (for that is found in other species) but by its small
                    Dove-like bill and wedge-shaped tail. It is an exceedingly scarce bird, little
                    more than a dozen examples being known to exist in collections. Beyond its
                    having an Arctic habitat, little has yet been ascertained about it. More rare
                    still is one of the species of <hi rend="italic">Xema, X. furcatum,</hi> of
                    which only two specimens, both believed to have come from the Galapagos, have
                    been seen. Its smaller congener Sabine’s Gull, <hi rend="italic">X.
                    sabiηii,</hi> is more common, and has been found breeding both in Arctic America
                    and <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n288/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0288-0275"/> in Siberia, and several examples, chiefly
                    immature birds, have been obtained in the British Islands. Both species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Xema</hi> are readily distinguished from all other Gulls by their
                    forked tails. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
