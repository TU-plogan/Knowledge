                    (1701-1759), a celebrated composer, was born May 7, 1701, at Wahrenbrück in
                    Saxony, the youngest of three brothers, all more or less musical. His father
                    held a small post under Government, but he gave his children a careful
                    education. Graun’s <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n74/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0074-0065"/> beautiful soprano voice was noticed at the school
                    where he was educated, and soon secured him an appointment in the choir of the
                    city of Dresden. His masters were Grundig and Petzold, and at an early age he
                    composed a number of sacred cantatas and other pieces for the church service. He
                    completed his studies under Schmidt, and profited much by the Italian operas
                    which were performed at Dresden under Lotti, the celebrated composer. After his
                    voice had changed to a tenor, he made his début at the opera of Brunswick, in a
                    work by Schurmann, an inferior composer of the day; but not being satisfied with
                    the arias assigned him he re-wrote them, so much to the satisfaction of the
                    court that he was commissioned to write an opera for the next season. This work,
                    <hi rend="italic">Pollidoro</hi> (1726), and five other operas written for
                    Brunswick, spread his fame all over Germany. Other works, mostly of a sacred
                    character, including two settings of the <hi rend="italic">Passion,</hi> also
                    belong to the Brunswick period. It was there that Frederick the Great, at that
                    time crown prince of Prussia, heard the singer, and immediately engaged him for
                    his private chapel at Castle Reinsberg. There Graun remained for five years, and
                    wrote a number of cantatas, mostly to words written by Frederick himself in
                    French, and translated into Italian by Boltarelli. On his accession to the
                    throne in 1740, Frederick sent Graun to Italy to engage singers for a new opera
                    to be established at Berlin. Graun remained a year on his travels, earning
                    universal applause as a singer in the chief cities of Italy. After his return to
                    Berlin he was appointed royal chapel-master, with a salary of 2000 thalers
                    (£300). In this capacity he wrote twenty-eight operas, all to Italian words, of
                    which the last, <hi rend="italic">Merope</hi> (1756), is perhaps the most
                    perfect. But of infinitely greater importance than these is his oratorio the <hi
                    rend="italic">Death of Jesus,</hi> which is still annually performed at Berlin.
                    It is here that Graun shows his skill as a contrapuntist, and his originality of
                    melodious invention. In the Italian operas he imitates the florid style of his
                    time, but there also considerable dramatic power is occasionally shown in the
                    recitatives. Graun died on the 8th of August 1759, at Berlin, in the same house
                    in which, thirty-two years later, Meyerbeer wa3 born.</p>
