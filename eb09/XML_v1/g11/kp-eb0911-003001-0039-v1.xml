                    the coast of South Italy, while the people were called Italiotes (Ίταλιώται).
                    Like most Greek colonies, they were established first as trading stations, which
                    grew into independent cities. At a very early time a trade in copper was carried
                    on between Greece and the Terinaean Gulf (Homer, <hi rend="italic">OL,</hi> i.
                    181). The trade for long lay chiefly in the hands of the Eubceans; and Cyme in
                    Campania was founded far back in the pre-historic time, when the Euboean Cyme
                    was still a great oity. To strengthen the connexion with the far off Cyme, the
                    Chalcidians, who became early the leaders of Euboean enterprise, established
                    Rhegium (about 730 B.c.). After this the energy of Chalcis went onward to
                    Sicily, and the states of the Corinthian Gulf carried out the colonization of
                    Italy. Sybaris (720) and Crotona (710) were Achaean settlements; Locri
                    Epizephyrii (about 710) was settled by Ozolian Locrians, and when (about 708)
                    the Spartans wished to get rid of a band of unruly citizens, the connexion
                    formed by the trade in purple that was common to the shores of Laconia and
                    Tarentum directed their colony thither. Ionian Greeks fleeing from foreign
                    invasion founded Siris and, much later, Elea (540).</p>
                <p>The Italian colonies were planted among friendly, almost kindred, races (comp,
                    the legend in Herod., vii. 183), and grew much more rapidly than the Sicilian
                    Greek states, which had to contend against the power of Carthage. After the
                    Achaean cities had combined to destroy the Ionic Siris, and had founded
                    Metapontum as a counterpoise to the Dorian Tarentum, there seems to have been
                    little strife among the Italiotes. An amphictyonie league, meeting in common
                    rites at the temple of Hera on the Lacinian promontory, fostered a feeling of
                    unity among them. In the 7th and 6th centuries B.c, they reached such a pitch of
                    wealth and power as to justify the name Great Greece in contrast to the poor and
                    weak mother country. The Pythagorean and Eleatic systems of philosophy had their
                    chief seat in Magna Graecia. Other departments of literature do not seem to have
                    been so much cultivated among them. The poet Ibycus, though a native of Rhegium,
                    led a very wandering life. They maintained some social intercourse with Greece
                    proper (Herod., iii. 131) and sent competitors to the Olympic games (among them
                    the famous Milo); but politically they appear to have generally kept themselves
                    separate. One ship of Crotona, however, fought at Salamis, though it is not
                    recorded that Greece asked the Italiotes for help when it sent ambassadors to
                    Gelon of <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n40/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0911-0040-0031"/> Syracuse. Mutual discord first sapped the
                    prosperity of Magna Graecia. Iu 510 Crotona, having defeated the Sybarites in a
                    great battle, totally destroyed their city. Crotona maintained alone the leading
                    position which had belonged jointly to the Achaean cities (Diod., xiv. 103); but
                    from that time Magna Graecia steadily declined. Foreign enemies pressed heavily
                    on it. The Lucanians and Bruttians on the north captured one town after another.
                    Dionysius of Syracuse attacked them from the south; and after he defeated the
                    Crotoniate league (389 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> Tarentum remained the
                    only powerful city. Henceforth the history of Magna Graecia is only a record of
                    the vicissitudes of Tarentum (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tarentum).</hi> Repeated
                    expeditions from Sparta and Epirus tried in vain to prop up the decaying Greek
                    states against the Lucanians and Bruttians; and when in 282 the Romans appeared
                    in the Tarentine Gulf the end was close at hand. The aid which Pyrrhus brought
                    did little good to the Tarentines, and his final departure in 274 left them
                    defenceless. During these constant wars the Greek cities had been steadily
                    decaying; and in the second Punic war, when most of them seized the opportunity
                    of revolting from Rome, their very existence was in some cases annihilated.
                    Malaria, which never affects a well-peopled city, increased in strength as the
                    population diminished. We are told by Cicero <hi rend="italic">{De Am.,</hi> 4),
                    “Magna Graecia nunc quidem deleta est.” Many of the cities completely
                    disappeared; some, like Tarentum, maintained a feeble existence into modern
                    times.</p>
