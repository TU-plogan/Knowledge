                    (1808-1875), an English general, brother of the preceding, and fifth and
                    youngest son of Francis Grant of Kilgraston, Perthshire, was born July 22, 1808.
                    He entered the army in 1826 as cornet in the 9th Lancers, and became lieutenant
                    in 1828 and captain in 1835. In 1842 he acted as brigade-major to Lord Saltoun
                    in the Chinese War, and specially distinguished himself at the capture of
                    Chin-Keang, after which he received the rank of major and was nominated
                    companion of the bath. In the first Sikh War of 1845—46 he took part in the
                    battle of Sobraon; and in the Punjab campaign of 1848-49 he held command of his
                    old regiment the 9th Lancers, and won high reputation in the battles of
                    Chillianwalla and Gujrat. In 1854 he became brevet-colonel, and in 1856
                    brigadier of cavalry. He took a leading part in the suppression of the Indian
                    mutiny of 1857, holding for some time the command of the cavalry division, and
                    afterwards of a movable column of horse and foot. After rendering valuable
                    service in the operations before Delhi and in the final assault on the city, he
                    directed the victorious march of the cavalry and horse artillery despatched in
                    the direction of Cawnpore to open up communication with the commander-in-chief
                    Sir Colin Campbell, whom he met near the Alumbagh, and who raised him to the
                    rank of brigadier-general, and placed the whole force under his command during
                    what remained of the perilous march to Lucknow for the relief of the residency.
                    After the retirement towards Cawnpore he greatly aided in effecting there the
                    total rout of the rebel troops, by making a detour which threatened their rear;
                    and following in pursuit with a flying column, he defeated them with the loss of
                    nearly all their guns at Serai Ghat. He also took part in the operations
                    connected with the recapture of Lucknow, shortly after which he was promoted to
                    the rank of major-general, and appointed to the command of the force employed
                    for the final pacification of India, a position in which his unwearied energy,
                    and his vigilance and caution united to high personal daring, rendered very
                    valuable service. Before the work of pacification was quite completed he was
                    created K.C.B. In 1859 he was appointed to the command of the British land
                    forces in the united French and British expedition against China, whose object
                    was accomplished three months subsequent to the landing of the forces at
                    Peh-tang, 1st August 1860, Pekin having surrendered at discretion after the
                    Chinese army had thrice suffered defeat in the open and the Taku forts had been
                    carried by assault. For his conduct in this, which has been called “most
                    successful and the best carried out of England’s little wars,” he received the
                    thanks of parliament, and was gazetted G.C.B. In 1861 he was made
                    lieutenant-general and appointed commander-in-chief of the army of Madras; on
                    liis return to England in 1865 he was made quartermaster-general at
                    headquarters; and in 1872 he was transferred to the command of the camp at
                    Aldershot. In the same year he was gazetted general. He died at London, March 7,
                    1875.</p>
