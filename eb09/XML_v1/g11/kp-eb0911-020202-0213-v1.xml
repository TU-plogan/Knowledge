                <p><label type="entry">GRIMSBY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Great</hi></label>, a municipal
                    and parliamentary borough and seaport town of England, county of Lincoln, is
                    situated on the south side of the estuary of the Humber nearly opposite Spurn
                    Head, and 17 miles E.S.E. of Hull. Since the opening in 1852, under the auspices
                    of the Manchester, Sheffield, and Lincolnshire Railway Company, of extensive
                    docks occupying a space of 140 acres reclaimed from the sea, the shipping trade
                    of Grimsby has largely increased. A new dock connecting the royal dock with the
                    old dock was opened by the Prince of Wales July 22, 1879. A dock of 26 acres in
                    extent for the accommodation of the coal and timber trade is in course of
                    construction; and it is proposed still to supply additional dock accommodation
                    by reclaiming 200 more acres from the Humber. In 1877 the number of British
                    vessels that entered the port was 2837, with a tonnage of 355,218; of foreign
                    vessels 847, with a tonnage of 258,243; the number of British vessels that
                    cleared 2642, with a tonnage of 342,727; of foreign vessels 743, with a tonnage
                    of 235,486. Steamers ply regularly between Grimsby and the more important Baltic
                    ports. Until 1858 no fishing trawlers had their headquarters at Grimsby, but
                    since that period they have so increased that in 1877 the fishing craft numbered
                    505, with a tonnage of 29,924; and Grimsby has now become one of the largest
                    fishing ports in the kingdom. For the use of the fishing vessels a special dock
                    of 12 acres in extent was constructed; and another of 11 acres has lately been
                    finished, as well as a graving dock capable of holding ten smacks at a time. Ice
                    companies have also been established, with steamers of their own for conveying
                    ice from Norway for the use of the fisheries. Further particulars regarding the
                    fishing trade of Grimsby will be found under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fisheries,</hi> vol. ix. pp. 249, 250. The principal other industries are
                    shipbuilding, iron and brass founding, brewing, and tanning. The chief
                    buildings, besides the large warehouses extending along the docks, are the fine
                    old parish church restored in 1859, the free grammar school, the custom-house,
                    the mechanics’ institute, the hospital, the corn exchange, and the townhall. A
                    statue of the Prince Consort was unveiled 22d July 1879. The population of the
                    municipal borough in 1861 was 11,067, and of the parliamentary borough 15,060;
                    in 1871 the numbers were 20,244 and 26,982. The area of the former is 1737, and
                    of the latter 16,330 acres.</p>
                <p>Grimsby is supposed to have been the spot where the Danes landed on their first
                    invasion of Britain. It is a borough by prescription, and one of the most
                    ancient in the kingdom. In the reign of Edward III. it was a considerable
                    seaport, and in 1346 it furnished that monarch with 11 ships and 170 mariners
                    for the siege of Calais. After that period its trade fell into decay through the
                    gradual blocking up of the harbour by the accumulation of mud and sand, until
                    the erection of new docks about the beginning of the present century. By the Act
                    of 23d Edward I. the town obtained the privilege of returning two members to
                    parliament, but since the Reform Act of 1832 it has returned only one.</p>
