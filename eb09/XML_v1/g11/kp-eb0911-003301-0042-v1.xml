                    author of <hi rend="italic">The Sabbath</hi> and other poems, was born at
                    Glasgow, April 22, 1765. His father was a successful lawyer, and, by a very
                    common error, he conceived that no other profession could be so suitable or so
                    advantageous for his son. James, dutiful, and shrinking from opposition, as he
                    did all through life, obeyed the parental wish, and after completing his
                    literary course at the university of his native city, went in 1784 to Edinburgh
                    where he studied law, first to qualify himself for the business of writer to the
                    signet, and subsequently for the" Scottish bar, of which he was elected a member
                    in 1795. His inclinations, however, were all for retirement and literature; and
                    finally, when he had reached the mature age of forty-four, he took orders in the
                    English Church, and became curate first at Shipton, Gloucestershire, and then at
                    Sedgefield in the county of Durham. He did not long enjoy an office which he
                    adorned by his pious and eloquent ministrations. Ill health compelled him to try
                    the renovating effects of his native air, but he died shortly after his return,
                    September 14, 1811. The works of Grahame .consist of a dramatic poem <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">The Birds of Scotland</hi> (1806), and <hi rend="italic">Poems
                    on the Abolition of the Slave Trade</hi> (1810). His principal work is <hi
                    rend="italic">The Sabbath—</hi> a sacred and descriptive poem in blank verse,
                    characterized by a fine vein of tender and devotional feeling, and by the happy
                    delineation of Scottish scenery. He is the Cowper of Scotland, but wants
                    Cowper’s mastery of versification and easy idiomatic vigour of style. The blank
                    verse of Grahame is often hard and constrained, though at times it swells out
                    into periods of striking imagery and prophet-like earnestness. His description
                    of the solemn stillness and unbroken calm of “the hallowed day” in the rural
                    districts of Scotland, and of the Scottish Sabbath preachings among the hills in
                    times of persecution, when</p>
                <p>“The scattered few would meet in some deep dell</p>
                <p>By rocks o’er-canopied,”</p>
                <p>are finished pictures that will never fade from our poetry. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Georgies</hi> he tried the wider field of rural occupations and
                    manners, and produced some pleasing daguerreotypes of nature,—for he was a
                    careful as well as loving student,—· but descended too much into minute and
                    undignified detail. In the notes to his poems he expresses manly and enlightened
                    views on popular education, the criminal law, and other public questions. He was
                    emphatically a friend of humanity—a philanthropist as well as a poet.</p>
