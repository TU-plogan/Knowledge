                <p><label type="entry">GRANADA</label>, a modern province of Spain, consisting of
                    the central portion of the old kingdom of the same name, is bounded on the N.
                    and N.E. by Jaen, Albacete, and Murcia, on the E. by Almeria, on the S. by the
                    Mediterranean, and on the W. by Malaga and Cordova, having an area of 4937
                    English square miles and an estimated population (1870) of 485,346. It includes,
                    and indeed chiefly consists of, the western and loftier portion of the Sierra
                    Nevada, which in the peaks Cerro de Mulhacen and Picacho de la Veleta,
                    overlooking the town of Granada, attains the heights of 11,781 and 11,597 feet
                    respectively. From the central chain of this Sierra all the principal rivers of
                    the province take their rise:—theGuadianamenor which, flowing past Guadix in a
                    northerly direction, falls into the Guadalquivir in the neighbourhood of Ubeda;
                    the Genii which, after traversing the vega of Granada, leaves the province a
                    little to the westward of Loja, and joins the Guadalquivir betwixt Cordova and
                    Seville; and the Rio Grande which falls into the Mediterranean at Motril. The
                    climate in the lower valleys and the narrow fringe along the coast is warm, but
                    on the higher grounds of the interior is somewhat severe; and the vegetation
                    varies accordingly from the subtropical to the alpine. The soil of the plains is
                    very productive, and that of the vega of Granada is considered the richest in
                    the whole peninsula; from the days of the Moors it has been subjected to most
                    careful and systematic irrigation, and it continues to yield in great abundance
                    and in good quality wheat, barley, maize, wine, oil, sugar, flax, cotton, silk,
                    and almost every variety of fruit. There are productive mines of lead, silver,
                    copper, zinc, and manganese, which in 1866 gave employment to 1099 persons;
                    mining indeed, with various agricultural and horticultural operations, including
                    bee-farming, constitutes the staple industry of the province. In the mountains
                    immediately surrounding the city of Granada occur many kinds of alabaster, some
                    of which are very fine; there are also quantities of jasper and other precious
                    stones in considerable variety. Mineral waters, chiefly chalybeate and
                    sulphurous, are abundant, the most important springs being those of Alhama,
                    which have a temperature of 118° Fahr. The chief centres of population are,
                    besides Granada, the capital, Mobril, Alhama, Loja, Guadix, and Huescar. Apart
                    from the great highways traversing the province, which are ex cellent, the means
                    of communication are few, and on the whole bad. The only railway is that which
                    connects Granada with Bobadilla on the Malaga and Cordova line.</p>
                <p>During the Roman period, Granada from the time of Augustus formed an
                    undistinguished portion of the province of Baetica, of which the four <hi
                    rend="italic">conventus juridici</hi> were Cadiz, Cordova, Ecija, and Seville.
                    Along with the rest of Andalucia, as a result of the great invasion from the
                    north in the 5th century, it fell to the lot of the Vandals. Under the caliphs
                    of Cordova, onwards from the 8th century, the town of Granada rapidly gained in
                    importance, and ultimately became the seat of a provincial government, which,
                    after the fall of the 0mmiades (1038), ranked with Seville, Jaen, and others as
                    an independent principality. By the conquests of St Ferdinand in the first half
                    of the 13th century, Granada was left the sole representative of the Mahometan
                    power in Spain; and even it was compelled to pay tribute to the sovereigns of
                    Castile. The limits of the kingdom at that time were nearly identical with those
                    of the province prior to 1833, the modern provinces of Malaga and Almeria being
                    until that date included. It is said to have contained a population of 3,000,
                    C00, and to have had considerable commerce, especially with Italy in silk. On
                    the capitulation of Boabdil in January 1492, Granada was united to the crown of
                    Castile, but with special privileges which were afterwards treacherously
                    withdrawn.</p>
