                <p><label type="entry">GRÜN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hans Baldung</hi></label> (c.
                    1470-1545), commonly called Grün, a painter of the age of Dürer, was born about
                    1470 at Gmünd in Swabia, and spent the greater part of his life at Strasburg and
                    Freiburg in Breisgau. The earliest pictures assigned to him are altarpieces with
                    the monogram H. B. interlaced, and the date of 1496, in the monastery chapel of
                    Lichtenthal near Baden. Another early work is a portrait of the emperor
                    Maximilian, drawn in 1501 on a leaf of a sketch-book now in the print-room at
                    Carlsruhe. The Martyrdom of St Sebastian and the Epiphany (Berlin Museum),
                    fruits of his labour in 1507, were painted for the market-church of Halle in
                    Saxony. In 1509 Grün purchased the freedom of the city of Strasburg, and resided
                    there till 1513, when he moved to Freiburg in Breisgau. There he began a series
                    of large compositions, which he finished in 1516, and placed on the high altar
                    of the Freiburg cathedral. He purchased anew the freedom of Strasburg in 1517,
                    resided in that city as his domicile, and died a member of its great town
                    council 1545.</p>
                <p>Though nothing is known of Grün’s youth and education, it may be inferred from
                    his style that he was no stranger to the school of which Dürer was the chief.
                    Gmünd is but 50 miles distant on either side from Augsburg and Nuremberg. Grün’s
                    prints were often mistaken for those of Dürer; and Dürer himself was well
                    acquainted with Grün’s woodcuts and copper-plate3, in which he traded during his
                    trip to the Netherlands (1520). But Grün’s prints, though Düreresque, are far
                    below Dürer, and his paintings are below his prints. Without absolute
                    correctness as a draughtsman, his conception of human form is often very
                    unpleasant, whilst a questionable taste is shown in ornament equally profuse and
                    “baroque.” Nothing is more remarkable in his pictures than the pug-like shape of
                    the faces, unless we except the coarseness of the extremities. No trace is
                    apparent of any feeling for atmosphere or light and shade, Though Grün has been
                    commonly called the Correggio of the north, his compositions are a curious
                    medley of glaring and heterogeneous colours, in which pure black is contrasted
                    with pale yellow, dirty grey, impure red, and glowing green. Flesh is a mere
                    glaze under which the features are indicated by lines. No wonder that English
                    collectors should have neglected him. There is not one of his pictures in the
                    whole of Great Britain, unless we accept as genuine a“Youth and Old Age” in the
                    Liverpool Institution, bought by Roscoe as a masterpiece of Antonello da
                    Messina. Even Germans express but slight esteem for Grün; and if his works have
                    any claims to attention at all, it is merely because of the wild and fantastic
                    strength which some of them display. We may pass lightly over the Epiphany of
                    1507, the Crucifixion of 1512, or the Stoning of Stephen of 1522, in the Berlin
                    Museum. There is some force in the Dance of Death of 1517, in the museum of
                    Basel, or the Madonna of 1530, in the Lichtenstein Gallery at Vienna. Grün’s
                    best effort is the altarpiece of Freiburg, where the Coronation of the Virgin,
                    and the Twelve Apostles, the Annunciation, Visitation, Nativity, and Flight into
                    Egypt, and the Crucifixion, with portraits of donors, are executed with some of
                    that fanciful power which Martin Schön bequeathed to the Swabian school. As a
                    portrait painter he is well known. He drew the likeness of Charles V., as well
                    as that of Maximilian; and his bust of Margrave Philip in the Munich Gallery
                    tells us that he was connected with the reigning family of Baden as <pb

                    from Margrave Christopher of Baden, Ottilia his wife, and all their children,
                    and the picture containing these portraits is Btill in the grand-ducal gallery
                    at Carlsruhe. Like Dürer and Cranach, Grün became a hearty supporter of the
                    Reformation. He was present at the diet of Augsburg in 1518, and one of his
                    woodcuts represents Luther under the protection of the Holy Ghost, which hovers
                    over him in the shape of a dove.</p>
