                <p><label type="entry">GYGES</label>, founder of the third dynasty, called Mermnad,
                    of Lydian kings, reigned about 687-654 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(v.</hi> Gelzer in <hi rend="italic">Rhein.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mus.,</hi> xxx.). The kindred name Gygaea, applied by Homer (Z∕., ii. 684) to
                    the Maconian lake, mother of the Maconian leaders, supports the statement of
                    ancient historians that he belonged to an old Lydian family. In the reign of
                    Candaules, Gyges, perhaps after banishment, attempted during the troubles caused
                    by the Cimmerian invasions into Asia Minor, to gain the royal power. He was
                    aided by foreign, especially Carian, mercenaries, but was strenuously resisted
                    by the native population. At last it was agreed to refer the decision between
                    the old Heraclid dynasty and the new claimant to the national god Heracles; but,
                    to ensure impartiality, they appealed to him under his Greek form of Apollo. The
                    Delphic oracle gave its answer in favour of Gyges, and the presents with which
                    his gratitude enriched the shrine were seen and described by Herodotus. This
                    story points to familiar and friendly intercourse between Lydia and the Greek
                    states; and that the circumstance impressed itself on the Hellenic mind is shown
                    by many romantic tales current about the fortunes of Gyges (Plato, <hi
                    rend="italic">Rep.,</hi> ii. p. 369; Herod., i. 8). The contemporary poet
                    Archilochus speaks of the riches of Gyges. Under the Heraclid dynasty Ionian
                    settlers had occupied the whole coast of Lydia, and in friendly relation with
                    the country had rapidly prospered. But the warrior king who now began to rule
                    was not content to leave the sea-coast in the undisturbed possession of
                    foreigners. He and his successors maintained almost constant war with the Ionian
                    cities. Gyges captured Magnesia and the lower city of Colophon; but the inroads
                    of the Cimmerians diverted his attention from conquest to the defence of his own
                    capital. At one time he was so hard pressed that he applied to Assyria for help
                    (about 660 B.c.), and paid tribute to Assurbanipal in return for protection
                    against these barbarians. But he afterwards threw off allegiance and assisted
                    Psammetichus, who had revolted in Egypt against the Assyrian rule. It is
                    mentioned in an inscription of Assurbanipal that Gyges was slain in battle by
                    the Cimmerians, and that his son Ardys renewed the tribute.</p>
