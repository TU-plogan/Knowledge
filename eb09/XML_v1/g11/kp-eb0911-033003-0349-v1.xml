                    was of Welsh extraction, but was born in Hertfordshire in 1581. He was educated
                    on the royal foundation at Westminster school, and in 1599 was elected a student
                    of Christ Church, Oxford. After graduating bachelor and master of arts at the
                    regular times, he took orders, became a preacher in 1614, and in November 1615
                    proceeded to the degree of bachelor in divinity. Mathematics, however, which had
                    been his favourite study in youth, continued to engross his attention, and on
                    6th March 1619 he was appointed to the professorship of astronomy in Gresham
                    College, London. This post he held till his death, which took place on 10th
                    December 1626. With Gunter’s name are associated several useful inventions,
                    descriptions of which are given in his treatises on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sector, Cross-staff, Bow, Quadrant, and other Instruments.</hi> He had
                    contrived his sector about the year 1606, and written a description of it in
                    Latin. Many copies were transcribed and dispersed, but it was more than sixteen
                    years afterwards ere he allowed the book to appear in English. In 1620 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi rend="italic">Triangulorum,</hi> a
                    table of logarithmic sines and tangents (extended to 7 decimal places) for every
                    degree and minute of the quadrant. In later editions an account of the general
                    use of the canon is prefixed, and Briggs’s logarithms of the first 1000 numbers
                    are appended. There is reason to believe that Gunter was the first to discover
                    (in 1622 or 1625) that the magnetic needle does not retain the same declination
                    in the same place at all times. By desire of James I. he published in 1624 <hi

                    Garden,</hi> the only one of his works which has not been reprinted. He
                    introduced the words co-sine and co-tangent for sine and tangent of the
                    complement, and he suggested to Briggs, his friend and colleague, the use of the
                    arithmetical complement (see Briggs’s <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Logarithmica,</hi> cap. xv.). His practical inventions are briefly
                    noticed below.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Gunter's Chain,</hi> the chain in common use for measuring
                    land, is 22 yards long and is divided into 100 links. Its usefulness arises from
                    its decimal or centesimal division, and the fact that 10 square chains make an
                    acre.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gunter's Line,</hi> a logarithmic line, usually laid down upon
                    scales, sectors, &amp;c. It is also called <hi rend="italic">the line of
                    lines</hi> and <hi rend="italic">the line of numbers,</hi> being only the
                    logarithms graduated upon a ruler, which therefore serves to solve problems
                    instrumentally in the same manner as logarithms do arithmetically.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gunter's Quadrant,</hi> an instrument made of wood, brass, or.
                    other substance, containing a kind of stereographic projection of the sphere on
                    the plane of the equinoctial, the eye being supposed to be placed in one of the
                    poles, so that the tropic, ecliptic, and horizon form the arcs of circles, but
                    the hour circles are other curves, drawn by means of several altitudes of the
                    sun for some particular latitude every year. This instrument is used to find the
                    hour of the day, the sun’s azimuth, &amp;c., and other common problems of the
                    sphere or globe, and also to take the altitude of an object in degrees.</p>

                    1¾ inches broad, and engraved with various lines of numbers. On one side are
                    placed the natural lines (as the line of chords, the line of sines, tangents,
                    rhumbs, &amp;c. ), and on the other side the corresponding artificial or
                    logarithmic ones. By means of this instrument questions in navigation,
                    trigonometry, &amp;c., are solved with the aid of a pair of compasses.</p>
