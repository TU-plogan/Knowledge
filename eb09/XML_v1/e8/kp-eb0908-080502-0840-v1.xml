                    Viscount</hi></label> (1757-1833), an English admiral, was descended from a
                    family which came originally from Normandy, but had for many centuries been
                    settled in the west of Cornwall. He was born at Dover, April 19, 1757. At the
                    age of thirteen he entered the navy, and even then his smartness and activity,
                    his feats of daring, and his spirit of resolute independence awakened remark,
                    and pointed him out as one specially fitted to distinguish hin13elf in his
                    profession. He had, however, no opportunity of active service till 1776, when,
                    at the battle of Lake Champlain, his gallantry, promptitude, and skill, not only
                    saved the “Carleton”—whose command had devolved upon him during the progress of
                    the battle— from imminent danger, but enabled her to take a prominent part in
                    sinking two of the enemy’s ships. For his services on this occasion he obtained
                    a lieutenant’s commission, and the command of the schooner in which he had so
                    bravely done his duty. The following year, in command of a brigade of seamen, he
                    shared in the hardships and perils of the American campaign of General Burgoyne.
                    In 1782, in command of the “Pelican,” he attacked three French privateers inside
                    the Isle of Bass, and compelled them to run themselves on shore—a feat for which
                    he was rewarded by the rank of post-captain. On the outbreak of the French war
                    in 1793, he was appointed to the “Nymphe,” a frigate of 36 guns; and,
                    notwithstanding that for the sake of expedition she was manned chiefly by
                    Cornish miners, he captured, after a desperate conflict, the French frigate “La
                    Cléopâtre,” a vessel of superior size to his own and better armed. For this act
                    he obtained the honour of knighthood. In 1794 he received the command of the
                    “Arethusa,” and in a fight with the French fleet off the Isle of Bass he
                    compelled the “Pomona” to surrender. The same year the western squadron was
                    increased and its command divided, the second squadron being given to Sir Edward
                    Pellew. While in command of this squadron he, on several occasions, performed
                    acts of great personal daring; and for his bravery in boarding the wrecked
                    transport “Dutton,” and his promptitude and resolution in adopting measures so
                    as to save the lives of all on board, he was in 1796 created a baronet. In 1798
                    he joined the channel fleet, and in command of the “Impétueux,” took part in
                    several actions with great distinction. In 1802 Sir Edward Pellew was elected
                    member of parliament for Dunstable, and during the time that he sat in the
                    Common he was a strenuous supporter of Pitt. In <pb break="no"

                    appointed commander-in-chief in India, where, by his vigilance and rapidity of
                    movement, he entirely cleared the seas of French cruisers, and secured complete
                    protection to English commerce. He returned to England in 1809, and in 1810 was
                    appointed commander-in-chief in the North Sea, and in 1811 commander-in-chief in
                    the Mediterranean. In 1814 he was created Baron Exmouth of Canonteign, and in
                    the following year was made K.C.B., and a little later G.C.B. When the dey of
                    Algiers, in 1816, violated the treaty for the abolition of slavery, Exmouth was
                    directed to attack the town. Accordingly, on the 26th August, he engaged the
                    Algerine battery and fleet, and after a severe action of nine hours’ duration,
                    he set on fire the arsenal and every vessel of the enemy’s fleet, itnd shattered
                    her sea defences into ruins. At the close of the action the dey apologized for
                    his conduct, and agreed to a renewal of the treaty, at the same time delivering
                    up 1800 persons of various nations who had been Algerine slaves. For this
                    splendid victory Exmouth was advanced to the dignity of Viscount. Shortly before
                    his death, which took place 23d January 1833, he was made vice-admiral. A Life
                    of Exmouth, by Edward Osler, was published in 1835.</p>
