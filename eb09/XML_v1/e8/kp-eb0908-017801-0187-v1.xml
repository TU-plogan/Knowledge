                <p><label type="entry">EMMET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label> (1778-1803),
                    brother of the subject of the next article, was born in Dublin in 1778. He was a
                    school-fellow of the poet Thomas Moore, and his senior by a year at Trinity
                    College, Dublin. Both were members of the Historical Society, and the great
                    champions of the popular side. In 1798 Emmet was expelled from the university,
                    on the ground of being connected with-the association of United Irishmen. He
                    shortly afterwards went to the Continent, and remained there till 1802, when he
                    returned secretly to Dublin, and endeavoured to plan a general Irish revolution.
                    On 23d July 1803, deeming that the time had come to execute his scheme, he made
                    an attempt to seize the arsenal and castle of Dublin; but the mob which he
                    headed scarcely achieved so much as a serious riot, for they dispersed at the
                    first military volley. Emmet fled to the Wicklow mountains, and perceiving that
                    success was now impossible, resolved to escape to the Continent; but, contrary
                    to the advice of his friends, he determined to have a last interview with the
                    lady to whom he was attached, a daughter of Curran, the celebrated barrister.
                    The delay proved fatal to him. He was apprehended, and committed for trial on
                    the charge of high treason. He defended himself in a speech of remarkable
                    eloquence, but was condemned to death, and on September 20, 1803, was executed
                    in St Thomas Street, Dublin. Moore, in one of the most pathetic of his Irish
                    melodies, “O breathe not his name,” commemorates Emmet’s fate; and that of Miss
                    Curran, who died in Sicily soon after him, is the subject of another, “She is
                    far from the land where her young hero sleeps.” Although it must be allowed that
                    the conduct of Emmet in his revolutionary attempt was rash and mistaken, the
                    high purity and unselfishness of his intentions have never been questioned.</p>
                <p>A life of Emmet was written by the Countess of Haussonville, and was translated
                    into English by John P. Leonard. See also Life of Curran, London, 1819; Curran
                    and his Contemporaries, by C. Phillips, 1818; Life of Robert Emmet, by R.
                    Madden, 1847; and Robert Emmet, Cause of his Rebellion, London, 1871.</p>
