                    (1695-1768), an eminent writer on the law of Scotland and professor in the
                    university of Edinburgh, was born in 1695. His father, LieutenantColonel<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0548-0529"/> John Erskine, son of Henry, second Lord Cardross,
                    was a noted Whig and zealous Presbyterian, who made himself conspicuous at the
                    Revolution by refusing to take the oath of abjuration notwithstanding his strong
                    attachment to King William. John Erskine the younger was admitted a member of
                    the faculty of advocates in 1719. Although he never enjoyed much practice at the
                    bar, he acquired a high reputation as a sound and learned lawyer. In 1737 he was
                    appointed professor of Scots law in the university of Edinburgh—a position which
                    he proved to be peculiarly well fitted to adorn. In 1754 he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of the Law of Scotland.</hi> He retired from his chair
                    in 1765; and during the remainder of his uneventful life he occupied himself
                    with the preparation of his great work, the <hi rend="italic">Institute of the
                    Law of Scotland,</hi> which he did not live to publish. He died at Cardross on
                    the 1st March 1768.</p>
                <p>Erskine’s <hi rend="italic">Institute,</hi> although it does not exhibit the
                    grasp of principle which distinguished his great predecessor Lord Stair, is so
                    conspicuous for learning, accuracy, and sound good sense, that it has always
                    been esteemed of the highest authority on the law of Scotland. On one important
                    branch indeed—commercial law—it is very defective, even when compared with Lord
                    Stair’s much earlier work; but at the time when Erskine wrote commerce had
                    declined in Scotland, while the forfeitures consequent on the rebellions of 1715
                    and 1745 had given a great impetus to feudal conveyancing; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Institute</hi> naturally reflects this state of society. Nor does
                    it profess to give a very extended exposition of criminal law; but on all the
                    other branches of Scottish jurisprudence it is, even at the present day, the
                    most trustworthy guide which the student can find. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles,</hi> although published first, is substantially an abridgment of
                    the larger work, and is in some respects superior to it. More concise and
                    direct, it gives an admirable exposition of the main principles of the law in a
                    perspicuous and interesting manner. It was designed to supersede Sir George
                    Mackenzie’s <hi rend="italic">Institutions</hi> as the class text-book; and it
                    is a conclusive proof of its excellence that it still retains this place in the
                    university.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Institute</hi> first appeared in 1773, and has repeatedly
                    been republished. The best edition is the last (1871), by Mr Badenach Nicolson,
                    who has preserved the valuable and authoritative notes of Lord Ivory’s edition
                    (1824-28). The last (15th) edition of the <hi rend="italic">Principles</hi> is
                    admirably edited by Mr Guthrie (1874).</p>
