                    rend="italic">sons</hi> or <hi rend="italic">descendants,</hi> but applied more
                    particularly to certain mythical chiefs who fought against Thebes. After the
                    terrible catastrophe which brought about the death of Iokaste (Jocasta) and the
                    blinding of Oedipus, Eteocles and Polynices, the sons of this ill fated pair,
                    incurred the wrath of their father, whom they cast out from his home to fight
                    with poverty as well as blindness. The curse of the aged king worked in the
                    dissensions of the two brothers , and Polynices, driven into exile, made his way
                    to Argos, where Adrastus took up his cause. The result was the enterprise which
                    Attic tradition spoke of as the expedition of the Seven Argive Chiefs against
                    Thebes, but which, according to the poets of the Thebais, involved as large a
                    gathering as that of the chieftains who assembled to hunt the Calydonian boar or
                    to recover the Goldeu Fleece. This strife was fatal, as the prophecies of Melam
                    pous had declared it must be, to all the chiefs engaged in it with the exception
                    of Adrastus, the seer Amphiaraus being saved from death only by the opening of
                    the earth, which received him alive with his chariot into her bosom. Thus ended
                    the first assault of the Argives against Thebes, au assault which answers
                    closely to the first ineffectual attempts of the Heraclids to recover their
                    paternal inheritance in the Peloponnesus. As in the other tradition, with which
                    the Theban story was parallel, it was followed by a second attack in the
                    struggle known as the war of the Epigoni, or the children of the discomfited
                    chiefs of the former expedition. The doom of Thebes was now come, and the
                    Epigoni appeared, like the Heraclids, when their period of enforced idleness is
                    ai an end. The Thebans are utterly routed by the Argives under Alcmaeon, the son
                    of Amphiaraus; and the prophet Tiresias declares that there is no longer any
                    hope, as the gods have abandoned them. The city is therefore surrendered, and
                    Thersandrus, the son of Polynices, is seated on the throne of Cadmus. How far
                    the poets of the Thebais, which treated of these wars, may have imparted to
                    their subject the charm of our <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Odyssey,</hi> the scanty fragments of the poem, which alone we possess, make it
                    impossible to say; but there can be no doubt that there were incidents in the
                    struggle which might be so treated as to win for it a title to the high praise
                    bestowed upon it by Pausanias (ix. 9, 3).</p>
