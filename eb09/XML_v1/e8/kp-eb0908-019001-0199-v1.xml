                    Franz</hi></label>(1791-1.865), a celebrated astronomer, was born at Hamburg on
                    the 23d September 1791. He received his early education from his father, who was
                    a clergyman, and he afterwards studied at the university of Göttingen, devoting
                    himself specially to astronomy under the instruction of Professor Gauss. Tn
                    1813-14 he served in the Hanseatic legion in the war with Napoleon, and in 1815
                    he became a lieutenant of artillery in the Prussian service. When peace was
                    concluded he resumed his astronomical studies at Göttingen until 1817, when he
                    was appointed by Lindenau the Saxon minister of state to a post in the
                    Observatory of Seeberg, near Gotha. In 1822-3 he published at Gotha two volumes,
                    entitled Die Entfernung der Sonne, in which the various observations of the
                    transits of Venus in 1761 and 1769 were carefully reconsidered, and the
                    calculations verified and corrected. One of the earliest subjects to which his
                    attention was directed was the determination of the orbit of the comet observed
                    by Pons at Marseilles in November 1818. He calculated the period of its
                    recurrence at about three and a quarter years, and conjectured it to be the same
                    comet that nad appeared in 1786, 1795, and 1805. Upon the data he possessed he
                    was able to predict its reappearance in 1822, and he stated also that it would
                    probably be invisible in Europe. His prediction was almost exactly verified, the
                    comet being observed in New South Wales on the 3d June 1822, and the time of its
                    perihelion passage being within three hours of that which lie had computed. From
                    the elements supplied by this observation he was able to foretell more
                    accurately its recurrences in 1825 and 1828, and after the latter of these he
                    determined its exact orbit. After the observation of 1832 he determined the
                    period of its revolution as 3 ’ 29 years, with a gradual acceleration which he
                    ascribed to the existence of a resisting medium. The comet is known as Encke’s
                    comet. In 1825 Encke was appointed to succeed Bode as director of the Royal
                    Observatory at Berlin, a situation which he filled with great ability until
                    within a year of his death. In 1830 he became editor of the Berlin
