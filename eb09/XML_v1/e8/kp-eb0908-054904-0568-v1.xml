                <p><label type="entry">ESQUIROS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henri Alphonse</hi></label>
                    (1814-1876), a French poet, novelist, and politician, was born at Paris in 1814.
                    His first work, a volume of poetry entitled <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Hirondelles,</hi> was published in 1834, but though it gained the commendation
                    of Victor Hugo, it attracted little other attention, and obtained only a small
                    sale. In 1837 he published a novel entitled <hi rend="italic">Le Magicien,</hi>
                    and in 1840 a historical romance, <hi rend="italic">Charlotte Corday.</hi> In
                    the same year appeared <hi rend="italic">H Evangile</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >du</hi><hi rend="italic">Peuple,</hi> an exposition of the life and character
                    of Jesus, which represents the founder of Christianity as a democratic reformer.
                    For this publication Esquiros was condemned to eight months’ imprisonment, and
                    he beguiled his term of captivity by writing a volume of poetry, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Chants eV</hi><hi rend="italic">un Prisonnier,</hi> consisting
                    chiefly of descriptions of circumstances connected with his infancy and youth.
                    Shortly after regaining his freedom he published three socialist tħιcts,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Les Vierges martyres, Les Vierges folles,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">les Vierges sages.</hi> In 1847 appeared <hi rend="italic"
                    >Paris ou les sciences, les institutions, et les moeurs au XIX' siècle,</hi> 2
                    vols. In the same year he published <hi rend="italic">Histoire des
                    Montagnards,</hi> and in 1851 <hi rend="italic">Histoire des Martyrs de la
                    Liberté,</hi> two works which obtained a large circulation among the lower
                    classes, and gained for their author such popularity that in 1849 he was elected
                    a representative of the legislative assembly. In 1851, on account of his
                    extremely radical opinions, and his strong opposition to the empire, he was
                    expelled from France. He proceeded first to Holland, and thence, in 1855, to
                    England, where he was for some time professor of l·rench literature at Woolwich.
                    Here he wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi rend="italic">des Deux
                    Mondes</hi> a number of essays on English life and character, which were
                    afterwards translated and published in London, under the title of the <hi
                    rend="italic">English at Home</hi> (1st scries, 1862, 2d, 1863). He also
                    published in 1859 <hi rend="italic">La Xeerlande</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">la vie hollandaise.</hi> His works both on England and
                    on Holland are remarkable for fulness of information and sympathetic
                    appreciation of foreign characteristics. In 1869 he was chosen a member of the
                    legislative assembly for the fourth circonscription of the department of the
                    Bouches du Rhone, and took his seat among the democratic opposition. In
                    September 1870 he was made superior administrator of the department, but on
                    account of his imprudent political prosecutions he was compelled to resign his
                    office in the November following, after which he became editor of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Egalité</hi> of Marseilles. In 1871 he was chosen a member of the
                    legislative assembly, and sat again on the extreme left. He died at Versailles,
                    May 13, 1876. Esquiros was too much of a partisan to be properly ranked as a
                    statesman, and though he was a brilliant and facile writer, most of his
                    political works are somewhat superficial and declamatory.</p>
