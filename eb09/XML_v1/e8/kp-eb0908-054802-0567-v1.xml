                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean Jacques Duval d’</hi> (1746-1794), was born in 1746 at
                    Pondicherry, of which colony his father was at that time a member of the general
                    council. He returned to France with his father in 1750, and after completing his
                    studies for the legal profession became king’s advocate at Châtelet, and shortly
                    afterwards councillor of the <hi rend="italic">parlement</hi> of Paris. He was
                    an enthusiastic defender of the rights of the <hi rend="italic">parlements</hi>
                    against the edicts of Louis XVI.; and having procured from the printers a copy
                    of the edicts of May 1788, establishing bailiwicks, and re-establishing the <hi
                    rend="italic">cour plénière</hi> for the trial of those officers of the <hi
                    rend="italic">parlements</hi> who refused to register the edicts, he revealed
                    this <hi rend="italic">coup Tétai</hi> to an extraordinary assembly of all the
                    chambers, and by a speech of great eloquence induced the magistrates to protest
                    against what they considered the threatened violation of their rights. For this
                    he was arrested, after an exciting scene, while occupying his place in the
                    assembly. The president refused to point him out to the officer charged with his
                    arrest, and each of the other members declared himself to be M. d'Esprémesnil;
                    but at last Esprémesnil, while protesting against the violation of justice
                    implied in his arrest, voluntarily delivered himself up. He was banished to the
                    island of St Margaret, but when a change took place in the ministry a few months
                    afterwards, he was recalled to Paris. Shortly after his return he was elected a
                    deputy to the States-general, where he soon became as strenuous in his support
                    of the privileges of the king as he had previously been of the privileges of the
                    <hi rend="italic">parlements;</hi> and after combating, often with a
                    passionateness amounting to violence, the various decrees restraining the royal
                    authority, he at the close of the assembly in 1791 formally protested against
                    the new constitution. In 1792 he was recognized by the revolutionary mob at the
                    Tuileries, and would have suffered summary execution had he not been rescued
                    half dead from the hands of his tormentors by a patrol of the national guard. He
                    obtained temporary refuge in the monastery of St Germains, and soon afterwards
                    went to Havre, where he lived apparently forgotten till toward the end of 1793,
                    when he was arrested and brought to Paris. He was tried before the revolutionary
                    tribunal, and, being condemned to death, was executed 23d April 1794. (See the
                    histories of the time.)</p>
