                <p><label type="entry">ELIZABETH PETROVNA</label> (1709-1 762), empress of Russia,
                    daughter of Peter the Great and of Catherine I., was born on the 5th September
                    1709. In consequence of a law of her father, by which the sovereign had the
                    power to choose his successor, she had no legal claim to the throne. The empress
                    Anna Ivanova died in 1740. She had appointed Ivan, son of her niece Anne duchess
                    of Brunswick, a child only a few months old, to the throne, with Biron, her
                    favourite, regent. Elizabeth was quite contented with this arrangement. She
                    declared that love was the supreme good, and that she had no desire for the
                    cares and honours of a crown. But the prestige of her father’s name, and the
                    favour in which she stood with the Russian people, rendered her an object of
                    jealousy to the regent and to the mother of the presumptive heir; and on her
                    refusing a proposal of marriage with the duke of Brunswick, brother-in-law of
                    Anne, it was hinted to her that she should take the veil. She might not even
                    then have listened to the suggestions of those who counselled a conspiracy, had
                    she not been persuaded by Lestocq, her physician and favourite, that the
                    suspicions of the Government were so much aroused that to go back or to delay
                    was no longer compatible with safety. Yielding to those representations, she
                    resolved to make the venture, and on the 6th December 1741 entered the barracks
                    of the Preobrajensky guards and endeavoured to induce them to swear allegiance
                    to her. Notwithstanding her powerful appeal and the promise of high rewards, all
                    hesitated with the exception of a single company—old soldiers of Peter the
                    Great; but placing herself at the head of this small band, she entered the
                    imperial palace and made prisoners of the regent and of Anne and her son. She
                    possessed already the affections of the people, and at once her authority was
                    firmly established. Her administration was successful both at home and abroad.
                    Although she was ruled by worthless favourites, who followed each other in rapid
                    succession, her reign was very popular with the people, who surnamed her the
                    Clement.</p>
                <p>She was indolent and sensual, but she possessed considerable abilities, and an
                    energetic will when it was roused to exertion. She had some taste for literature
                    and the fine arts, and founded the university of Mos cow, and the Academy for
                    the Fine Arts of St Petersburg. In 1743 she brought the war with Sweden to a
                    close by an advantageous treaty. She successfully assisted Maria Theresa against
                    Frederick the Great, and in this way contributed to the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle
                    in 1748. After this, irritated, it is said, by a reported witty remark of
                    Frederick, she took part in the Seven Years’ War, and by successive victories
                    reduced that monarch to great straits, from which he was only delivered by her
                    death (Jan. 5, 1762).</p>
