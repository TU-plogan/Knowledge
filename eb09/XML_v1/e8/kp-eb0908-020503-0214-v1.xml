                <p><label type="entry">ENDOWED SCHOOLS ACTS</label>. Since the beginning of the
                    present reign a number of statutes have been passed dealing with the endowed
                    grammar schools of England. The Act 3 and 4 Vict. c. 77, which notices in the
                    preamble the great number of grammar schools in England, both of royal and
                    private foundation, and remarks that the term “grammar” had been construed to
                    mean Greek and Latin, and that the governers and trustees of such schools were
                    unable to establish any other education than that expressly provided for by the
                    foundation, empowered courts of equity to make decrees or orders extending the
                    systems of instruction and the right of admission to any school, and to
                    establish schemes for the application of its revenues, having due regard to the
                    intentions of the founder. The Act 23 Vict. c. 11 enabled and required the
                    trustees and governors of endowed schools to make such order as, without
                    interfering with the religious teaching of the other scholars or authorizing any
                    new religious teaching, should admit children of other denominations than that
                    to which the foundation belongs, except where the foundation expressly requires
                    the children to be instructed according to the formularies of such denomination.
                    The most important public schools—Eton, Harrow, Westminster, Ac.—were expressly
                    exempted from the operation of both of these Acts. The Act 31 and 32 Vict. c. 23
                    annexed certain conditions to the appointment of officers in endowed schools.
                    The most important Act of the series was the 32 and 33 Vict. c. 56 (The Endowed
                    Schools Act 1869) which authorized the appointment of commissioners, with power
                    “in such manner as may render any educational endowment most conducive to the
                    advancement of the education of boys and girls, and either of them, to alter and
                    add to any existing, and to make new trusts, directions, and provisions in lieu
                    of any existing trusts, directions, and provisions which affect such endowment
                    and the education promoted thereby.” The powers of the commissioners extend to
                    all school endowments other than those specified in section 8 of the Act, which,
                    inter alia, excludes schools under the Public Schools Act 1868, voluntary
                    schools, schools aided by parliamentary grant, endowments not necessarily
                    educational, &amp;c. The 36 and 37 Vict. c. 87 continues and amends in various
                    particulars the Act of 1869. The 37 and 38 Vict. c. 87 transfers the powers of
                    the Endowed Schools Commissioners to the Charity Commissioners (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Charities).</hi> The Public Schools Act 1868, above referred
                    to, deals with the following schools only —Eton, Winchester, Westminster,
