                <p><label type="entry">ETAH</label>, a district and town of British India, in the
                    lieutenant-governorship of the north-western provinces, and included in the
                    division of Agra. Etah District stretches along the eastern edge of the DuAb or
                    alluvial plain enclosed by the Ganges and the Jumna, and lies between 27° 20'
                    30" and 28° Γ N. lat., and between 78° 29' and 79° 19' 30" E. long. It is
                    bounded on the N. by the Ganges, on the W. by the districts of Agra and Aligarh,
                    on the S. by the district of Mainpuri, and on the E. by that of FarrakhAbAd. The
                    total area of the districtis 1512 square miles, of which 970 are cultivated. The
                    total population, according to the census of 1872, amounts to 703,527 souls,
                    comprising 636,149 Hindus, and 67,278 Mahometans. The males number 382,746, the
                    females 320,739, the [,roportion of males to the total population being 54√5 per
                    cent. The principal tribes and castes in point of number are:—(1) BrAhmans,
                    60,691; (2) RAjputs, 57,025; (3) Baniyas or traders, 13,056; (4) ChAmArs or
                    manual labourers, 86,635; (5) Ahirs, 76,754; besides numerous minor clans. The
                    density of population is 465 persons to the square mile. The district consists
                    for the most part of an elevated alluvial plateau, dipping down on its eastern
                    slope into the valley of the Ganges. The uplands, however, are not so fertile as
                    in most of the neighbouring districts, owing to the insufficiency of the water
                    supply; while patches of a barren saline efflorescence occasionally interrupt
                    the cultivated expanse. Between the modern bed of the Ganges and its ancient
                    channel lies a belt of fertile land, covered with a rich deposit of silt, and
                    abundantly supplied with natural moisture. A long line of swamps and hollows
                    still marks the former course of the river; and above it rises abruptly the
                    original cliff which now forms the terrace of the upland plain. The KAli Nadi, a
                    small stream flowing in a deep and narrow gorge, passes through the centre of
                    the district, and affords an outlet for the surface drainage. The tract of
                    country to the west of this river is irrigated by the Cawnpur and EtAwah
                    branches of the Ganges canal; and another work, now in progress, will supply
                    abundant water in future to the dry plateau on the east.</p>
                <p>No railway passes through the district, but good metalled roads connect the chief
                    towns, and the Ganges affords a means of transport for heavy goods. The
                    principal agricultural products comprise wheat, barley, pulses, millets, cotton,
                    sugar-cane, indigo, and opium. Two harvests a year can be taken off the land, in
                    the spring and the autumn. Etah exports large quantities of food-grains and
                    other produce to neighbouring districts. Indigo is manufactured in 200
                    factories, some of which are conducted by English capital. Eight towns in 1872
                    contained a population exceeding 5000 :—Etah, 8044; MArahra, 9214; Soron,
                    11,182; SahAwar, 5156; Sakit, 5415; DundwAraganj, 5414; Aliganj, 7912; KAsganj,
                    15,764. In 1870 the total revenue of Etah district from all sources amounted to
                    =£119,399, of which £78,852 was due to the land-tax. The five municipalities of
                    KAsganj, Etah, Soron, MArahra, and Aliganj possess a joint income of £4878. The
                    climate is dry and healthy, but sand and dust storms frequently occur.</p>
                <p>Etah was at an early date the seat of a primitive Aryan civilization, and the
                    surrounding country is mentioned by Hiouen Thsang, the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim
                    of the 7th century <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> as rich in temples and
                    monasteries. But after the bloody repression of Buddhism before the 8th century,
                    the district seems to have fallen once more into the hands of aboriginal tribes,
                    from whom it was wrested a second time by the RAjputs during the course of their
                    great migration eastward. With the rest of Upper India, it· passed under the
                    sway of Mahmud of Ghazni in 1017, and thenceforth followed the fortunes of the
                    Mahometan empire. At the end of the last century it formed part of the territory
                    over which the vazir of Oudh had made himself ruler, and it came into the
                    possession of the British Government in 1801, under the treaty of Lucknow.
                    During the mutiny of 1857 it was the scene of serious disturbances, coupled with
                    the usual anarchic quarrels among the native princes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Etah Town,</hi> the capital of the district, stands on the
                    Graud Trunk Road, in 27° 33' 50" N. lat., and 78° 42' 25" E. long. The
                    population in 1872 numbered 8044 souls, comprising 5884 Hindus, 2150 Mahometans,
                    and 10 Christians. Before the period of British rule the town had little
                    importance, and at present it is chiefly noticeable as the administrative
                    headquarters for the district. It contains a handsome temple and large tank,
                    with the usual public offices of a district capital. The muncipality had an
                    income in 1874-75 of £1183, of which £845 was raised by an octroi duty. The
                    incidence of taxation was at the rate of 2s. per head of the population.</p>
