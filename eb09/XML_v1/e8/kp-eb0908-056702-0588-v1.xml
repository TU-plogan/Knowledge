                    king of Kent, ascended the throne in 560. In 568 he was defeated by the West
                    Saxons, and his authority limited to Kent, but ultimately he conquered the
                    Saxons of Middlesex and Essex, and about 590 he was acknowledged as over-lord as
                    far north as the Humber. About 575 he married Bertha or Bercta, daughter of the
                    Frankish king Charibert. The Franks had already been converted to Christianity,
                    and when Pope Gregory the Great heard that a Frankish princess was married to
                    the king of Kent, he seized the opportunity to send Augustine to attempt the
                    conversion of the Anglo-Saxons. In 597 Augustine and his companions landed in
                    the Isle of Thanet, and on learning of their arrival Ethelbert, prompted
                    doubtless by Bertha, at once invited them to an interview. Not being certain
                    whether they might not use enchantments against him, he received them, for
                    greater security, in the open air; and after listening to a long sermon from
                    Augustine, he was so far impressed, that although not prepared at once to
                    forsake his old religion, he granted liberty to the monks to preach to his
                    people. According to the accounts that have been handed down their success was
                    almost unprecedented, and as many as 10,000 baptisms are said to have taken
                    place in a single day. Very shortly afterwards Ethelbert gave in his adhesion to
                    Christianity, and immediately all the inhabitants of Kent followed his example.
                    He gave up his palace for the monks to live in, and adjoining it he built a
                    church, on the site of which was afterwards erected the cathedral of Canterbury.
                    He died in 616, and was canonized, his day being the 24 th February. The
                    earliest code of Anglo-Saxon laws now extant was issued by Ethelbert in 600.
                    With the exception of a provision for the protection of the property of God and
                    the church, it consists chiefly of enactments against crimes—the various kinds
                    of which, with the penalties attaching to commission of them, are stated in
                    minute detail.</p>
