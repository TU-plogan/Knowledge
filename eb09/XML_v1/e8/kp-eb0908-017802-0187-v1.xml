                    (1764-1827), a lawyer and politician, was born in Cork the 24th April 1764. He
                    was the second son of Dr Robert Emmet, who latterly was statephysician in
                    Dublin. After attending the school of Mr Kerr in Cork, Thomas in 1778 entered
                    Trinity College, Dublin. In 1783 he went to study medicine at the university of
                    Edinburgh, where he continued four years. He then visited the chief medical
                    schools of the Continent, and after travelling through Germany, France, and
                    Italy, returned in 1788 to Ireland. Owing, he himself says, to the advice of Sir
                    James Mackintosh, he now resolved to forsake medicine for law; and with the view
                    of preparing himself for the Irish bar, he studied two years at the Temple,
                    London. He was admitted a member of the Dublin bar in 1790. In the earlier years
                    of his practice he was often engaged as counsel for those of the United Irishmen
                    who were accused of political offences; but after he became more closely
                    connected with the association, it was deemed prudent that, while privately
                    acting as their legal adviser in all matters, he should no longer be engaged in
                    the public defence of any of their number. In 1797 he became one of the
                    directory of the association, and on the arrest of O’Connor about the middle of
                    the same year, he succeeded him as chief leader. On the 12th March 1798 he and
                    other leaders were arrested, and after being examined at the castle were
                    committed to Newgate. He was examined before a secret committee of the House of
                    Lords, and afterwards before a secret committee of the House of Commons; and on
                    the 9th April 1799 he was conveyed as a prisoner to Fort-George, Scotland, where
                    he remained till June 1802. He then received his liberty, but only on condition
                    that he spent the remainder of his life on a foreign soil, his return to British
                    territory being forbidden by severe penalties. After being conveyed to Cuxhaven,
                    he proceeded to Hamburg, and finally to Brussels, where he passed the winter. In
                    the beginning of 1803 he went to France, and had an interview with Napoleon; but
                    having little faith in Napoleon’s designs of invading England, he in the end of
                    the year embarked for America. Here he rose to considerable eminence at the New
                    York bar, and in 1812 held for a short time the office of attorney-general of
                    the State of New York. He died suddenly, 14th November 1827, while conducting a
                    case in the United States circuit court.</p>
