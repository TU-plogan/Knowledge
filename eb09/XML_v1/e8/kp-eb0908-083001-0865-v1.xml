                    <hi rend="italic">Esdras),</hi> the famous scribe, was a priest of the line of
                    Zadok. According to the genealogy given in Ezra vii. 1-5, his father’s name was
                    Seraiah. If we identify this Seraiah with the person mentioned in Ezra ii. 2,
                    Neh. xii. 1, then the Ezra who is the subject of the present article may -well
                    be identified, as has been done by Michaelis and others, with the Ezra named in
                    the last-quoted texts; and in this case he must have been a very old man even at
                    the beginning of that public work with which his name is chiefly associated. But
                    a careful comparison of the genealogy in 1 Ch. vi. 4-15 with that in Ezra vii.
                    leads rather to the conclusion that the latter has most probably been abridged,
                    so far as the more immediate and less eminent ancestors of our Ezra are
                    concerned. They are omitted probably because, though closely connected with
                    Joshua, the son of Josadak, they did not avail themselves of the permission,
                    granted by Cyrus, to return to Jerusalem in 536. They do not seem on that
                    account, however, to have lost much, if any, of the social influence to which
                    their high rank in the priesthood entitled them. Josephus tells us, somewhat
                    mysteriously, that Ezra himself was high-priest of the Jews who were left in
                    Babylon. Be this as it may, we know that when he first appears in history, in
                    the seventh year of Artaxerxes Longimanus (458 B.c.), he is already a man of
                    great learning, zeal, and authority, enjoying the confidence, not only of his
                    own compatriots, but also of the Persian king. It is to be regretted that we
                    should so imperfectly know what was the true condition of the Jews in Babylon
                    during the years that immediately followed the close of the “exile.” We have
                    various indications, however, that many of them devoted themselves to the study
                    of the written law, kept up friendly intercourse with their compatriots in
                    Jerusalem, regularly sent free-will offerings to the temple there (Philo, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ad Caium,</hi> 1013), and made occasional pilgrimages thither
                    (Zech. vi. 9). In Judea, on the other hand, the fifty-eight years between 516
                    and 458, which are passed over in silence in the history, do not seem to have
                    been more prosperous than the twenty preceding years of which the record has
                    been preserved. Whether influenced by unfavourable reports of the condition of
                    affairs at Jerusalem, or proceeding upon knowledge personally obtained in some
                    previous visit, Ezra, who had “been directing his heart to seek the law of the
                    Lord, and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments,” asked and
                    received in the above-mentioned year the royal authority to make an official
                    visit to Judea. From the terms of his commission, which are given in Ezra vii.
                    12-26, we learn that very considerable powers and privileges were at that time
                    conferred upon him. On the first day of the first month of the Jewish year he
                    set out on his westward journey, carrying with him many valuable offerings, and
                    accompanied by some 1500 of his fellow-countrymen. The first considerable halt
                    was made at “the river of Aliava,” a locality which has not been identified as

                    and here it was found that no Levites had joined the expedition. A message was
                    accordingly sent to a place (now unknown) called Casiphia, where a large colony
                    of them had settled, inviting their assistance. A considerable number of Levites
                    were thus induced to join the party. A fast was thereafter appointed, the sacred
                    treasures were solemnly entrusted to the keeping of twelve priests and twelve
                    Levites (see Bertheau on Ezra viii. 24), and, deliberately dispensing with the
                    usual military escort, the caravan set out on the twelfth day of the first
                    month, arriving in Jerusalem on the first of the fifth. Here, in the course of
                    the investigation which he had been commissioned to make, Ezra very soon found a
                    field for his reforming activities. He learned that the population generally,
                    priests, Levites, and rulers not excepted, had been intermarrying with the
                    surrounding peoples to an extent which seemed to threaten the subversion of the
                    true religion, and the obliteration of the Jewish nationality. The unexpected
                    discovery filled him with amazement and shame. Soon a large number of the
                    inhabitants came to him, and, with Shechaniah for spokesman, assured him that
                    the people at large were willing to dismiss their foreign wives with their
                    children, if only he would take in hand the direction of the matter. With all
                    convenient speed a solemn assembly of all Judah and Jerusalem was then convened,
                    at which, after Ezra had pointed out to the people their transgressions, it was
                    agreed, with only a few dissentient voices (Ezra x. 15, where for “were employed
                    in” read “stood up against ”), to appoint a committee to inquire into and decide
                    on all the cases of mixed marriage. This committee had finished its work by the
                    beginning of the following year, when a complete list was drawn up of those who
                    had “taken strange wives” and now pledged themselves to put them away. Thus far
                    the Scripture narrative has carried us; but at this point, after detailing the
                    events of precisely one year of Ezra’s public life, it abruptly breaks off: nor
                    do we read of him again for the next thirteen years. Modern writers are by no
                    means at one in the conjectures they make as to what occurred during the
                    interval. Ewald thinks that he remained in Jerusalem during all the intervening
                    time; others (such as Kuenen) are of the opinion that he very soon left the
                    city, and that during his absence occurred those relapses and disasters which
                    were the occasion of his subsequent activities, and also of those of Nehemiah
                    Hitzig thinks that he never reappeared at all, and corrects Nehemiah
                    accordingly. According to the existing text, in the twentieth (twenty-first 1)
                    year of Artaxerxes, on the first day of the seventh month, we find him “in the
                    open space that was before the watergate,” solemnly reading, by public request,
                    in the hearing of all the people, the “book of the law of Moses.” One of the
                    immediate effects of this fresh publication of the Mosaic law was that
                    straightway the feast of tabernacles was observed as it had not been “since the
                    days of Joshua the son of Nun ;” and very soon afterwards a solemn fast was
                    proclaimed, during which a written covenant was drawn up and confirmed by all
                    the people, with Nehemiah at their head, by which they became bound “to walk in
                    God’s law which was given by Moses the servant of God,” special prominence being
                    given to the following points,—separation from the people of the land, strict
                    observance of the Sabbath day and the sabbatic year, punctual payment of the
                    third part of a shekel for the service of the temple, of the first fruits for
                    the priests, and of the tithes for the Levites. And now, once more, after a
                    second period of public activity, which in this case seems to have lasted for
                    little more than a month, the name of Ezra abruptly disappears from the
                    Scripture narrative. We have no authentic information from any source as to the
                    events of his subsequent life, or as to the time, place, and manner of his
                    death. According to Josephus, “he died an old man, and was buried in a
                    magnificent manner at Jerusalem ;” but several palpable blunders with reference
                    to Ezra in other parts of this historian’s narrative warn us to be cautious in
                    receiving this statement. Other traditions relate that he died in Babylon, or at
                    Zamzumu on the Tigris, while on a journey from Jerusalem to Susa. According to
                    the best texts of the Apocryphal work known to English readers as 2 Esdras, he
                    did not die at all, but was translated (xiv. 49).</p>
                <p>Tradition is somewhat inconsistent with itself also in the account it gives of
                    Ezra’s relation to the Pentateuch. At one time it speaks of him as a mere
                    copyist or transcriber; at another time it speaks of him as a voluminous author,
                    a prophet, an independent legislator. Modern criticism in like manner has not as
                    yet reached a unanimous finding on the position occupied by him with reference
                    to previous oral and written enactments. While Ewald, on the one hand, maintains
                    that the last editor of the Pentateuch lived when the kingdom of Judah was still
                    standing, Graf and Kuenen, on the other hand, assign to Ezra a very large share
                    in the production of that law-book as we now have it. Between the two extremes
                    there is room for an intermediate view, akin to that of ecclesiastical
                    tradition, which, without determining the extent of Ezra’s work, admits that,
                    having before him an earlier work, he added and perhaps also altered some things
                    in an editorial capacity.</p>
                <p>It cannot be doubted that Ezra was successful in at least giving to the law as
                    written a prominence and an influence which it had never before possessed. Under
                    him it became the exclusive rule of public and private life in a way that had
                    never before been known. The rise of the order of “scribes,” that is, of those
                    whose business it was to know the law, to interpret it, and “make a hedge” round
                    it, can be traced directly to him. If he thus was in a sense the founder of that
                    pharisaism which in lateι ’ ages degenerated into the well-known forms which
                    were so abhorrent to Christ and to the spirit of Christianity, it ought to be
                    remembered, on the other hand, that the synagogue services,—those assemblies
                    throughout the towns and villages of the land in which the written word was w
                    eekly read and expounded with praise and prayer,—are most probably to be traced
                    to his influence. The synagogue worship passed directly over from Judaism into
                    the Christian church; and in this way Ezra, so far as he originated it, has
                    exercised an incalculable influence on the religious culture of the race.</p>
