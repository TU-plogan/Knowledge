                    Chamber</hi></label>. The name <hi rend="italic">scaccarium,</hi> from which the
                    word “exchequer” is derived, was used under the Norman kings of England to
                    signify the treasury. Madox, in his learned <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Exchequer,</hi> exhausts the possible definitions of the word. According to
                    some, it is connected with <hi rend="italic">scaccus</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >scaccum,</hi> a chess-board, and the exchequer of England “was in all
                    probability, called scaccarium because a chequered cloth (figured with squares
                    like a chess-board) was anciently wont to be laid on the table in the court or
                    place of that name.” “From the Latin,” continues Madox, “cometh the French
                    eschequier or exchequier, and the English name from the French. Or if any one
                    thinks more likely that the French word was the ancienter, and the Latin one
                    formed from it, I do not oppose him,—nay, I incline to believe it was so.”
                    Another and less probable explanation is, that the original word was statarium,
                    “from its stability, as it was the firm support of the crown or kingdom.” But
                    Madox points out that from the early times of the Conquest onwards it was always
                    called scaccarium and never statarium.</p>
                <p>At the present day, exchequer means two very different and independent
                    institutions, the historical origin of which is oue and the same. It is a court
                    of law—one of the three superior courts at Westminster. It is also the treasury.
                    The connexion between the treasury and the court is still kept up in one or two
                    points. The chancellor of the exchequer still takes his seat in the
                    Exchequer-Court on certain formal occasions, and the Exchequer Court (or, as it
                    is now called, the Exchequer Division) is still the appropriate tribunal for
                    cases connected with the revenue.</p>
                <p>The Exchequer makes its appearance among English institutions in close connexion
                    with the King’s Court <hi rend="italic">(curia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >regis)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the germ from which so large a portion of
                    the English constitution has sprung. In the language of later times it might be
                    called a committee of that court specially charged with the management of the
                    revenue. The King’s Exchequer, says Theodore, “was anciently a member of his
                    court, and was wont to be held in his palace. It was a sort of subaltern court,
                    partly resembling in its model that which was properly called the <hi
                    rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic">regis,</hi> for in it the king’s
                    barons and great men who used to be in his palace near his royal person
                    ordinarily presided, but sometimes the king himself; in it the king’s
                    chief-justiciar, his chancellor, his treasurer, his constable, his marshal, and
                    his chamberlain performed some part of their several offices.” And just as the
                    <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi rend="italic">regis</hi> was not a pure court of
                    law, so the Exchequer was not merely a financial council but a court of law. Its
                    principal business, says Madox, related to the revenue, and although the
                    justices on circuit had cognizance of revenue matters, such matters, as they
                    arose, were certified or sent into the Exchequer “to which place the affairs of
                    the royal revenue tended as to their centre.” Madox divides the business of the
                    Exchequer, during the period between the Conquest and the reign of King John,
                    under the head of revenues, causes, non-litigious business, and matters of
                    public policy.</p>
                <p>From the reign of Henry III. the Exchequer was recognized as a separate court,
                    the others being the King’s Bench and the Common Pleas <hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.).</hi> Mr Stubbs thinks that a separate staff of judges was not assigned
                    to each court until the end of the reign of Henry. The special business of the
                    Exchequer was as before the decision of revenue cases, but from a very early
                    time, and in spite of repeated prohibitions, the lawyers of the Exchequer
                    competed for the ordinary litigious business—the common pleas—of the country.
                    They finally succeeded by means of the well-known fiction which allowed one of
                    the litigants to own that he was indebted to the king, and forbade his opponent
                    to traverse the averment. The organization of the court seems to have been
                    somewhat later in point of time than that of the Common Pleasand the King’s
                    Bench. The barons of the Exchequer were not at first recognized as judges. They
                    are not mentioned in the statutes of Nisi Prius (13 Edward I. c. 30, and 14
                    Edward III. c. 16). In the reign of Elizabeth the Exchequer was definitely
                    recognized a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction with the Common Pleas and the
                    King’s Bench.</p>
                <p>The Exchequer was further distinguished from the two other courts by possessing
                    an equitable as well as a common law jurisdiction. “The Court of Equity,” says
                    Blackstone, “is held before the lord treasurer, the chancellor of the exchequer,
                    the chief baron, and the three <hi rend="italic">puisne</hi> ones,” whereas the
                    common law jurisdiction is exercised by the barons onlyof the exchequer, and not
                    the treasurer or chancellor. Tliis equity jurisdiction was abolished in 1841,
                    when two additional vice-chancellors were appointed in the Court of
                    Chancery.</p>
                <p>Bv the Judicature Act of 1873 the Court of Exchequer <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n832/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0908-0832-0797"/> was abolished as a separate court, and its
                    jurisdiction was transferred to the new High Court of Justice. The Exchequer
                    still survives, however, as one of the divisions of the High Court, and still
                    retains under its new name its old exclusive jurisdiction.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Court of Exchequer Chamber</hi> was, until the passing of
                    the Act just referred to, the court of appeal from the three courts of common
                    law. Appeals from any one of these were heard before judges of the other two. It
                    was originally intended (by statute 31 Edward III. c. 12) to determine causes by
                    writs of error from the common law side of the Court of Exchequer, the judges
                    being the lord chancellor, lord treasurer, and the justices of the King’s Bench
                    and Common Pleas. A statute of 27 Elizabeth (c. 8) made similar arrangements for
                    writs of error from the King’s Bench. The jurisdiction of the Exchequer Chamber
                    is transferred by the Judicature Act to the new Court of Appeal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chancellor of the exchequer</hi> is the second commissioner
                    of the treasury, the first lord being the premier. Occasionally both offices are
                    held by the same person. It is the duty of the chancellor to prepare and lay
                    before the House of Commons the “budget” for the year, and therefore he must be
                    a commoner. The chancellor takes his seat in the Court of Exchequer once a
                    year—at the nomination of persons to serve as sheriffs. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e.
