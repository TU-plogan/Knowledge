                    >Mediolanum,</hi> and afterwards <hi rend="italic">Eburovices),</hi> a town of
                    Frauce, capital of the department of Eure, is situated on the Iton, an affluent
                    of the Eure, 67 miles W.N.W. of Paris by railway. The town is generally well
                    built, and still contains many antique timber-framed houses. It is the seat of a
                    bishop, and its cathedral is one of the most ancient and curious in France. It
                    dates from the 11th century, and is a very imposing cruciform structure, though
                    not uniform in style. The north transept and the portal are in the flamboyant
                    Gothic, elaborately ornamented; the west front is in the Italian style. The
                    beautiful rose window in the south transept, and the wooden screens of the side
                    chapels round the choir, showing the flamboyant Gothic style modified by the
                    reviving Italian, also merit notice. The lady chapel is of elegant architecture,
                    with painted glass equally remarkable for its fine execution and perfect
                    preservation. At the intersection of the nave and transepts rises an octagonal
                    tower supported on four pillars, and surmounted by a pyramidal spire of open
                    stonework. The church of St Taurin also displays various styles of architecture,
                    and contains the shrine of St Taurin, a work of the 13th century. The episcopal
                    palace, which dates from the 15 th century, is a beautiful structure. Among the
                    other objects of interest are the clock-tower built in the 15th century, the
                    abbey of St Saviour, the ancient Séminaire des Eudistes now used as a prison and
                    assize buildings, the museum of antiquities, the town-hall, the prefect’s
                    residence, the theatre, the public library, the botanic garden, and the
                    promenades. Evreux is famed for its manufacture of tools, and for stocking
                    making; brewing, distilling, dyeing, taiming, and papermaking are its other
                    principal industries. At Vieil Evreux the remains of a Roman theatre, a palace,
                    baths, and an aqueduct have been discovered, and various relics which are now
                    deposited in the Musée d’Antiquités.</p>
                <p>Evreux existed at a very early period. About the end of the 10th century Richard
                    I. of Normandy gave it to his son Robert; and early in the 12th century it came
                    by inheritance into the house of Montfort, from whom it was bought by Philip
                    Augustus of France. Philip II. gave it to his brother Prince Louis, who in 1316
                    was created Count of Evreux. Count Philip of Evreux acquired by marriage the
                    kingdom of Navarre, and Charles III. of Navarre sold it to Charles VI. of
