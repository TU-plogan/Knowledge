                    the founder of the Spanish drama, was born in 1468 or 1469, either in the city
                    of Salamanca or more probably in the neighbouring village of Encinas. After
                    studying at the university of Salamanca under the patronage of the chancellor
                    Don Gutierre de Toledo, brother of Don Garcia, count of Alva, he proceeded to
                    Madrid, and became, when about twenty-five years of age, a member of the
                    household of Don Fadrique de Toledo and Dona Isabel Pimental, the first duke and
                    duchess of Alva. In or about the year 1492— the year, that is, in which Columbus
                    added the new world to the dominions of Spain—the poet began to entertain his
                    patrons by the representation of comedies of his own composition, in which he
                    sometimes played the part of the Gracioso, or buffoon. In 1496, under the title
                    of Cancionero, he published a collection of nine dramatic and numerous lyrical
                    poems, divided into four parts, dedicated respectively to their Catholic
                    majesties, to the prince Don Juan, to the dukes of Alva, and to Don Garcia de
                    Toledo. Some years afterwards he went to Rome, joined the clerical order,
                    attracted the attention of Leo X. by his skill in music, and was appointed his
                    maestro di capella. Great praise was bestowed by his contemporaries on a farce,
                    Placidae Victoriano, published by him in 1514; but of the justness of their
                    criticism we have no means of judging, since, owing in all probability to its
                    insertion in the Index ∑xpurgatorius, all copies of it have perished. In 1519
                    the poet went to Jerusalem in company with the marquis of Tarifa, Don Fadrique
                    Enriquez Afan de Riberon; but he was again in Rome about the middle of 1520, and
                    in the following year published his Trabagia o Via Sacra de Hierusalem, a
                    versified account of his journey, which has since been several times reprinted

                    Zambardo; Saragossa, 1512 and 1516), is preceded by a prose treatise, among the
