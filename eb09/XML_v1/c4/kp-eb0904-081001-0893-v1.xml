                    born at Brompton, near London, on the 14th December 1812. He was educated at
                    Christ Church, Oxford, where he graduated B. A. in 1833, as first class in
                    classics and second class in mathematics. In 1836 he entered Parliament, being
                    returned as member for the town of Warwick in the Conservative interest. He did
                    not, however, sit long in the House of Commons; for, on the death of his mother
                    in 1837, he succeeded to the peerage which had been conferred on her with
                    remainder to her only surviving son, and as Viscount Canning took his seat in
                    the House of Lords. His first official appointment was that of Under-Secretary
                    of State for Foreign Affairs, in the administration formed by Sir Robert Peel in
                    1841,—his chief being the earl of Aberdeen. This post he held till January 1846;
                    and from January to July of that year, when the Peel administration was broken
                    up, Lord Canning filled the post of Commissioner of Woods and Forests. He
                    declined to accept office under the earl of Derby; but on the formation of the
                    Coalition Ministry under the earl of Aberdeen in January 1853, he received the
                    appointment of Postmaster-General. In this office he showed not only a large
                    capacity for hard work, but also general administrative ability, and much zeal
                    for the improvement of the service. He retained his post under Lord Palmerston’s
                    ministry until July 1855, when, in consequence of the death of Lord Dalhousie,
                    and a vacancy in the governor-generalship of India, he was selected by Lord
                    Palmerston to succeed to that great position. This appointment appears to have
                    been made rather on the ground of his father’s great services than from any
                    proof as yet given of special personal fitness on the part of Lord Canning. The
                    new governor sailed from England in December 1855, and entered upon the duties
                    of his office in India at the close of February 1856. His strong common sense
                    and sound practical judgment led him to adopt a policy of conciliation towards
                    the native princes, and to promote measures tending to the betterment of the
                    condition of the people.</p>
                <p>In the year following his accession to office the deep-seated discontent of the
                    people broke out in the mutiny which grew into the Sepoy War. Fears Were
                    entertained, and even the friends of the viceroy to some extent shared them,
                    that he was not equal to the crisis. But the fears proved groundless. He had a
                    clear eye for the gravity of the situation, a calm judgment, and a prompt, swift
                    hand to do what was really necessary. By the union of great moral qualities with
                    high, though not the highest, intellectual faculties, he carried the Indian
                    empire safely through the stress of the storm, and, what was perhaps a harder
                    task still, he dealt wisely with the enormous difficulties arising at the close
                    of such a war, established a more liberal policy and a sounder financial system,
                    and left the people more contented than they were before While rebellion was
                    raging in Oude, he issued a proclamation declaring the lands of the province
                    forfeited; and this step gave rise to much angry controversy. A “secret
                    despatch,” couched in arrogant and offensive terms, was addressed to the viceroy
                    by Lord Ellenborough, then a member of the Derby administration, which would
                    have iustified the viceroy in immediately resigning But from a strong sense of
                    duty he continued at his post; and ere long the general condemnation of the
                    despatch was so strong that the writer felt it necessary to retire from office.
                    Lord Canning replied to the despatch, calmly and in a statesman-like manner
                    explaining and vindicating his censured policy. In April 1859 he received the
                    thanks of both Houses of Parliament for his great services during the mutiny. He
                    was also made an Extra Civil Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath; and in May of
                    the same year he was raised to the dignity of an earl. ' By the strain of
                    anxiety and hard worκ his health and strength were seriously impaired; and in
                    the hope that rest in his native land might restore him, he left India, reaching
                    England in April 1862. But it was too late. He died in London on the 17th of
                    June following. About a month before his death he was created K.G. As he died
                    without issue the title became extinct.</p>
