                    the capital of an arrondissement in the department of Calvados in France. It
                    stands about 80 or 90 feet above the level of the sea, in an extensive valley,
                    on the left bank of the Orne, at the influx of the Odon, 9 miles from the
                    English Channel, and 122 west of Paris, in 49° 1Γ 14" N. lat., 0° 2Γ 15" W.
                    long. The town is handsome and well built; the streets, of which the most
                    important is the Rue St Jean, are generally wide, straight, and clean; and the
                    houses, being of freestone, have a very good appearance. Hardly any remains of
                    its once extensive ramparts and towers are now to be seen; but the castle,
                    founded by William the Conqueror and completed by Henry I., is still employed as
                    barracks, though in a greatly altered condition. The city contains several
                    ancient churches and other buildings, affording fine specimens of the Norman
                    style of architecture. Among these are the church of St Pierre, dating from the
                    14th century and surmounted by a handsome stone spire, the finest in Normandy,
                    242 feet in height; the magnificent churches of the Abbaye Aux Hommes, or St
                    ntienne, and the Abbaye Aux Dames, or Trinity, both founded in 1066,— the former
                    by William the Conqueror, where a plain grey marble slab in the pavement now
                    marks his long since desecrated tomb, and the latter by his queen Matilda, who
                    was interred there. The old convent of the Capuchins is now occupied by the
                    society of Le Bon Sauveur, which, founded by two poor girls about 1730, has
                    grown into a most important institution, and maintains an asylum for the insane
                    of both sexes, a charitable dispensary, a school for the education and
                    industrial training of deaf and dumb children, and various minor establishments.
                    Caen is the seat of a high court of appeal for the departments of Calvados,
                    Manche, and Orne, and has tribunals of primary instance and commerce, a chamber
                    of commerce, a <hi rend="italic">conseil de prud’hommes,</hi> a university
                    (founded in 1431 by Henry VI. of England), a royal college, a school of
                    hydrography, a public library of 45,000 volumes, an extensive botanic garden, a
                    museum belonging to the society of Norman antiquaries, and a theatre. There is a
                    local <hi rend="italic">Academie</hi><hi rend="italic">des sciences,
                    arts,</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">belles-lettres,</hi> which
                    has published a series of <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> since 1754. The
                    commerce of Caen is considerable. It exports barley, flour, potatoes, wine,
                    brandy, fruit, cattle, hardware; and imports timber from Norway, coal, pig-iron,
                    o.ats, wheat, and oil-seeds. Its manufactures are of comparatively small
                    importance with the exception of rape and colza oil, though there is a certain
                    turn-out of caps, table-linen, cotton fabrics, leather, earthenware, and
                    cutlery; breweries, dye-works, and ship-building yards are also in operation.
                    The manufacture of lace, formerly of great extent, has very much declined. A
                    fine kind of oolitic stone, in great favour as a building material, is quarried
                    in the neighbourhood. Several large fairs are held annually. At high water,
                    vessels of 150 or 160 tons can come up to the harbour, which consists of a part
                    of the river bed and a basin 1896 feet in length by 164 in breadth, and has
                    communication with the sea not only by the river, but also by a canal debouching
                    at Ouistreham. A canal to connect it with the sea is in course of construction,
                    which will render it accessible to large vessels. The town is situated on the
                    main line of railway from Pans to Cherbourg, and is connected by branch lines
                    with Courseulles on the coast, and with Laval inland.</p>
                <p>Though Caen is not a town of great antiquity, the date of its foundation is
                    unknown. It existed as early as <pb break="no"

                    was~ceded to the Normans by Charles the Simple, it was a large and important
                    city. Under the dukes of Normandy, and particularly under William the Conqueror,
                    it rapidly increased. It became the capital of Lower Normandy, and in 1346 was
                    besieged and taken by Edward III. of England. It was again taken by the English
                    in 1417, and was retained by them till 1459, when it capitulated to the French,
                    in whose possession it has since continued. In 1793 the. city was the focus of
                    the Girondist movement against the Convention. Among the numerous celebrities to
                    whom Caen has given birth may be mentioned Malherbe, Boisrobert, Huet bishop of
                    Avranches, and Tannegui Lefebvre. Population in 1872, 39,415 in the city, and
                    41,210 in the commune.</p>
