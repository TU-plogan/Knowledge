                    Mythology, usually identified with the Dioscuri (Castor and Pollux), in common
                    with whom they were styled <hi rend="italic">μεγάλοι</hi> Θεοί <hi rend="italic"
                    >(υιagni</hi><hi rend="italic">Dii),</hi> and had the power of protecting life
                    against storms at sea, the symbol of their presence being the St Elmo fire. The
                    worship of the Cabiri was local and peculiar to the islands of Lemnos, Imbros,
                    and Samothrace, extending also to the neighbouring coast of Troy, in which
                    places it appears to have been inherited from a primitive Pelasgic population.
                    It was, however, in Samothrace that this worship attained its chief importance,
                    coming first into notice apparently after the Persian war, and from that time
                    extending its influence down into the Roman period. The point of attraction was
                    in the religious Mysteries, initiation into which was sought for, not only by
                    large numbers of pilgrims, but also by such persons of distinction as Philip and
                    Olympias—the parents of Alexander, his successor Lysimachus, Arsinoë, and those
                    Roman commanders whose duties led them to that quarter.</p>

                <p>What the rites were in which the Mysteries consisted is unknown, and it is
                    therefore impossible to say how far they may have been organized on the model of
                    the Mysteries of Eleusis, though it is clear that Athens took a considerable
                    part in being the first to extend the influence of the Samothracian Mysteries.
                    Initiation included also an asylum or refuge, if required, within the strong
                    walls of Samothrace, for which purpose it was used among others by Arsinoë, who
                    afterwards caused to be erected there (276-247 B.c.), to record her gratitude, a
                    monument, the ruins of which were explored in 1874 by an Austrian archaeological
                    expedition (<hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen auf</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>In Lemnos an annual festival was held, lasting nine days, during which all the
                    fires in the island were extinguished and fresh fire brought from Delos. From
                    this and from the statement of Strabo (x. 437), that the father of the Cabiri
                    was Camillus, a son of the god Hephaestus, it has been thought that the Cabiri
                    must have been, like the Curetes, Corybantes, and Dactyls, daemons of volcanic
                    fire. But this is very uncertain. In Lemnos they fostered the growth of the vine
                    and fruits of the field, and from their connection with Hermes in Samothrace, it
                    would seem that they had also aided the fertility of cattle. Both the names and
                    the number of the Cabiri are doubtful. On late authority they are given as <hi
                    rend="italic">Axieros, Axiokersa,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">A xiokersos,</hi>
                    with a fourth called <hi rend="italic">Kadmilos</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Kasmilos;</hi> but in the usual tradition they were <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dardanos,</hi><hi rend="italic">Jasion,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Harmonia.</hi> Jasion, who was a favourite of the goddess Demeter, instituted
                    the Mysteries. Harmonia married Cadmus of Thebes, whose name is to be recognized
                    in Kadmilos, one of the Cabiri. On the other hand it has been argued that there
                    were only two Cabiri, Dardanus and Jasion, corresponding as deities to the Greek
                    Poseidon and Apollo, or Uranus and Gaea, t.c., sky and earth. On these points,
                    the statements of ancient writers are not only few but generally irreconcilable
                    with each other. On Etruscan bronze mirrors representations of what are called
                    the Cabiri frequently occur, consisting of two youthful figures, sometimes with
                    the addition of a female figure, apparently their sister; sometimes there are
                    three brothers. This subject is dealt with in detail by Gerhard in his <hi
