                <p><label type="entry">CABET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Etienne</hi></label> (1788-1856),
                    an active French Communist, was born, the son of a cooper, at Dijon in 1788. He
                    chose the profession of advocate without succeeding in it, but erelong became
                    notable as the persevering apostle of republicanism and communism. He assisted
                    in a secondary way in the Revolution of 1830, and obtained a legal appointment
                    in Corsica under the Government of Louis Philippe; but, being dissatisfied with
                    the moderation of the new rule, he began to attack it even in public, and was
                    dismissed. Elected, notwithstanding, to the Chamber of Deputies, he was
                    prosecuted for his bitter criticism of the Government, and obliged to go into
                    exile in England. On the amnesty of 1839, he returned to France, and attracted
                    some notice by the publication of a badly-written and fiercely democratic
                    history of the Revolution of 1789 (4 vols., 1840), and of a social romance, <hi
                    rend="italic">Voyage</hi><hi rend="italic">en Icarie,</hi> in which he set forth
                    his peculiar views. These works met with some success among the radical
                    working-men of Paris. An opportunity at length occurred of realizing his
                    schemes. Pressed by his friends, he made arrangements for an experiment in
                    communism on American soil. In his journal, <hi rend="italic">Le Populaire,</hi>
                    he announced the purchase of a considerable tract of land on the Red River,
                    Texas, and a treaty by which Cabet was made the dictator of an intending colony,
                    and the depositary of all the funds, community of property being the distinctive
                    principle of the society. Accordingly, in 1848, an expedition of 150 sailed to
                    America; but unexpected difficulties arose and the complaints of the
                    disenchanted settlers soon reached Europe. Cabet, who had remained in France,
                    had more than one judicial investigation to undergo in consequence, but was
                    honourably acquitted. In 1849 he went out in person to America, but on his
                    arrival, finding that the Mormons had been expelled from their city Nauvoo, in
                    Illinois, he transferred his settlement thither. There, with the exception of a
                    journey to France, where he returned to defend himself successfully before the
                    tribunals, he remained, the dictator of his little society. In 1856, however, he
                    was expelled, and died the same year at St Louis. He had not the advantages of
                    either birth or eloquence, or even of ability. The little success he obtained
                    was due entirely to the singularity of his opinions, and the straightforward
                    persistency with which he advocated them.</p>
