                <p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Caesareä Palestina,</hi> now Kaisaryah, the Roman
                    metropolis of Palestine, 30 miles north of Joppa, and about the same distance
                    north-west of Jerusalem. It was built about 22 B.c. by Herod, on the site of an
                    earlier town called Turris Stratonis. Vast sums of money were spent in the
                    erection of its more important buildings, among which were a temple dedicated to
                    Caesar, a theatre, and an amphitheatre. The most stupendous work, however, was
                    the semicircular mole, constructed of immense blocks of stone brought from a
                    great distance, and sunk to the depth of twenty fathoms in the sea. It protected
                    the port on the south and west, leaving only a sufficient opening for vessels to
                    enter from the north, so that within the enclosed space (which, according to
                    Lieutenant Conder, measures 300 yards across) a fleet might ride in all weathers
                    in perfect security. The site of the city is how marked by an extensive mass of
                    mins, among which may still be traced the substructions of all the
                    above-mentioned buildings, as well as those of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n711/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0711-0640"/> the cathedral built by the Crusaders, an old
                    fortress on the site, it is supposed, of Herod’s “Drusus tower,” two aqueducts,
                    and a variety of minor structures. The line of the walls of the mediaeval town
                    can still be made out, and in some parts that of the more extensive Roman works.
                    The southern part of the mole is also intact. Caesarea was made the seat of a
                    colony by Vespasian, and took for a time the title of Flavia, but its earlier
                    name was maintained to the time of its complete decay. In the 4th century it was
                    the see of Eusebius, the church historian, and during the crusading period was
                    one of the chief posts of the invaders.</p>
                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Caesarea Philippi,</hi> 95 miles north of Jerusalem, and
                    about 35 south-west of Damascus, situated at the southern base of Mount Hermon,
                    near one of the sources of the Jordan. It has been identified with Baalgad or
                    Beth-Rehob. and was certainly known for a long time as Panium or Panias, the
                    cave at the foot of the mountain being dedicated to Pan. Herod erected a temple
                    to Augustus in the neighbourhood; and the town was much enlarged and beautified
                    by Philip the Tetrarch, who named it Caesarea in honour of Tiberius the emperor,
                    adding the cognomen of Philippi to distinguish it from the town last noticed. It
                    continued to be a place of some importance till after the time of the Crusades,
                    and was successively the seat of a Greek and a Latin bishopric. Its site is
                    occupied by the modern Bâniâs or Panias, a paltry and insignificant village,
                    with numerous ruins in the vicinity. On the top of a conical hill above the
                    village stands the castle of Subeibeh, which possibly dates from the time of the
                    Phoenicians, and has been one of the most remarkable fortresses in Palestine
                    from that day to this.</p>
