                <p><label type="entry">SEINE</label>, the department of France which has Paris as
                    its chief town, was formed in 1790 of part of the province of Île-de-France. It
                    lies between 48° 44' and 48° 58' N. lat. and 2° 10' and 2° 34' E. long. and is
                    entirely surrounded by the department of Seine-et-Oise, from which it is
                    separated at certain parts by the Seine, the Marne, and the Bièvre. The area of
                    the department is only 118,306</p>
                <p>acres, and of this surface a seventh or a sixth is occupied by Paris; the
                    suburban villages also are close together and very populous. In actual
                    population (2,799,329 in 1881) as well as in density (23·7 persons per acre) it
                    holds the first place. Flowing from south-east to north-west through the
                    department, the Seine forms three links: on the right it receives above Paris
                    the Marne, and below Paris the Rouillon, and on the left hand the Bièvre within
                    the precincts of the city. The left bank of the Seine is in general higher than
                    the right and consists of the Villejuif and Chatillon plateaus separated by the
                    Bièvre; the highest point (568 feet) is above Chatillon and the lowest (105) at
                    the exit of the Seine. Below Paris the river flows between the plain of
                    Gennevilliers and Nanterre (commanded by Mont Valérien) on the left and the
                    plain of St Denis on the right. On the right side, to the east of Paris, are the
                    heights of Avron and Vincennes commanding the course of the Marne. Communication
                    is further facilitated by various canals (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paris).</hi></p>
                <p>Market gardens occupy about 3700 acres within and without the city, and by means
                    of irrigation and manuring are made to yield from ten to eleven crops per annum
                    (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Paris).</hi> Some districts are specially
                    celebrated,—Montreuil for its peaches, Fontenay-aux-Roses for its strawberries
                    and roses, and other places for flowers and nurseries. The department produced
                    in 1883 326,326 bushels of wheat, 4042 of meslin, 75,003 of rye, 3415 of barley,
                    337,837 of oats, 1,656,009 of potatoes, 14,650 of pulse, and 15,400 tons of
                    beetroot. Altogether, 60,000 persons are engaged in agriculture. The live stock
                    in 1881 comprised 95,796 horses (70,296 in Paris), 4174 cattle, 280 calves, 8159
                    sheep, 3626 pigs, and 660 goats. Vineyards, producing 366,748 gallons of wine
                    annually, cover 2460 acres. The principal woods (Boulogne and Vincennes) belong
                    to Paris. It is partly owing to the number of quarries in the district that
                    Paris owes its origin: Chatillon and Montrouge in the south yield freestone, and
                    Bagneux and Clamait in the south and Montreuil and Romainville in the east
                    possess the richest plaster quarries in France. Within the circuit of Paris are
                    certain old quarries now forming the catacombs. Most of the industrial
                    establishments in the department are situated in Paris or at St Denis. Pantin
                    (17,857 inhabitants in 1881) on the Ourcq Canal is the seat of a national
                    factory of tobacco, and also of glass-works, and Aubervilliers (19,437) on the
                    St Denis Canal is the seat of great chemical works. Along the Seine, below
                    Paris, Boulogne (25,615) is partly occupied by laundry establishments; Puteaux
                    (15,586) manufactures woollen goods, and has dyeworks, printing works,
                    cloth-dressing works, and engineering works of considerable importance; Clichy
                    (24,320) manufactures crystal and has a large gaswork, &amp;c. Above Paris, Ivry
                    (18,442) has iron-works and engineering works; Choisy-le-Roi (6978) has
                    factories for the making of porcelain, glass, soda, chemicals, morocco, and
                    waxcloth; Montreuil (18,693), near Vincennes, makes patent leather, porcelain,
                    &amp;c. The department is of course traversed by all the railway lines which
                    converge in Paris, and also contains the inner circuit railway and part of the
                    outer circuit,—making a total of 122 miles of railway, to which are to be added
                    numerous tramways, 72 miles of national roads, and 458 of other roads. There are
                    3 arrondissements (Paris, St Denis, and Sceaux), 28 cantons (20 in Paris), and
                    72 communes. The department forms the archiepiscopal diocese of Paris, falls
                    within the jurisdiction of the Paris court of appeal, and is divided between the
                    four <hi rend="italic">corps d’armée</hi> of Amiens, Rouen, Le Mans, and
                    Orleans. Among the important institutions in the department are the lyceums of
                    Vanves and Sceaux, the lunatic asylum at Charenton, the veterinary college of
                    Maisons-Alfort, and the great Bicêtre hospital at Gentilly.</p>
