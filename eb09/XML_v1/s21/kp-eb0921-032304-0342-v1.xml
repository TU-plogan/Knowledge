                <p><label type="entry">SAUROPSIDA</label>. This name was introduced by Huxley in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Classification of Animals,</hi> 1869, to
                    designate a province of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> formed by the
                    union of the <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reptilia.</hi> In his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Comparative Anatomy,</hi>
                    1864, he had used the term “Sauroids” for the same province. The five divisions
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata—Pisces, Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> —are all distinctly definable, but their
                    relations to one another differ considerably in degree. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphibia</hi> are more similar to the <hi rend="italic">Pisces</hi> than to any
                    of the other divisions, and the <hi rend="italic">Aves</hi> are closely allied
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Reptilia,</hi> and thus three provinces— <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichthyopsida, Sauropsida,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mammalia—</hi> are formed.</p>
                <p>The characters which distinguish the <hi rend="italic">Sauropsida,</hi> that is,
                    which are common to birds and reptiles, and not found combined in the other
                    classes, have been thus summarized by Huxley :—no branchiae at any period of
                    existence; a well-developed amnion and allantois present in the embryo; a
                    mandible composed of many bones and articulated to the skull by a quadrate bone;
                    nucleated blood-corpuscles; no separate parasphenoid bone in the skull; and a
                    single occipital condyle. In addition to these principal characters, others
                    exist which are found in all birds and reptiles, but are not exclusively
                    confined to them. The oviduct is always a Mullerian duct separate from the ovary
                    and opening from the body cavity. The adult kidney is a metanephros with
                    separate ureter; the mesonephros and mesonephric duct become in the adult male,
                    the efferent duct of the testis. The intestine and the reproductive and urinary
                    ducts open into a common cloaca. There is usually an exoskeleton in the form of
                    scales; in the birds the scales take the form of feathers. There are two aortic
                    arches in reptiles, in birds only one,—the right. The heart is usually
                    trilocular, becoming quadrilocular in crocodiles and birds. In all the eggs are
                    meroblastic and large, possessing a large quantity of yolk; in all the egg is
                    provided in the oviduct with a layer of albumen and outside this with a horny or
                    calcareous shell. In a few cases the egg is hatched in the oviduct, but in these
                    cases there is no intimate connexion between the embryo and the walls of the
                    duct. Fertilization takes place internally, occurring at the upper end of the
                    oviduct previously to the deposition of the albuminous layer and egg shell.</p>
                <p>Comparative anatomy clearly shows that birds are reptiles which have become
                    specialized in adaptation to the function of flight. This conclusion has been
                    confirmed in the most surprisingly complete manner by the discovery of fossil
                    forms intermediate between birds and reptiles. Two points of specialization in
                    addition to the transformation of the fore limbs into wings are conspicuous in
                    birds,—the reduction of the tail and the absence of teeth. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Archaeopteryx</hi> is a flying feathered animal with a long reptilian tail. In
                    the Rocky Mountain region numerous toothed birds have been recently discovered,
                    and have been studied and described in a masterly fashion by Prof. O. C. Marsh.
                    These forms belong to the Mesozoic period. For further details see <hi
