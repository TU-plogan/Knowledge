                <p><label type="entry">SENNA</label> (Arab. <hi rend="italic">saná),</hi> a popular
                    purgative, consisting of the leaves of two species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cassia,</hi> viz., <hi rend="italic">C. acutifolia,</hi> Del., and <hi
                    rend="italic">C. angustifolia,</hi> Vahl. <hi rend="italic">C. acutifolia</hi>
                    is a native of many districts of Nubia, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> Dongola,
                    Berber, Kordofan, and Senaar, but is grown also in Timbuctoo and Sokoto. The
                    leaflets are collected twice a year by the natives, the principal crop being
                    gathered in September after the rainy season and a smaller quantity in April.
                    The leaves are dried in the simplest manner by cutting down the shrubs and
                    exposing them on the rocks to the burning sun until quite dry. The leaflets then
                    readily fall off and are packed in large bags made of palm leaves, and holding
                    about a quintal each. These packages are conveyed by camels to Assouan and Darao
                    and thence to Cairo and Alexandria, or by ship by way of Massowah and Suakim.
                    The leaflets form the Alexandrian senna of commerce. Formerly this variety of
                    senna was much adulterated with the leaves of <hi rend="italic">Solenostemma
                    Argei,</hi> Hayne, which, however, are readily distinguishable by their minutely
                    wrinkled surface. Of late years Alexandrian senna has been shipped of much
                    better quality. Occasionally a few leaves of <hi rend="italic">C. obovata,</hi>
                    Coll., may be found mixed with it. <hi rend="italic">C. angustifolia</hi>
                    affords the Bombay, East Indian, Arabian, or Mecca senna of commerce. This plant
                    grows wild in the neighbourhood of Yemen and Hadramaut in the south of Arabia,
                    in Somali Land, and in Sind and the Punjab in India. The leaves are chiefly
                    shipped from Mocha, Aden, Jeddah, and other Red Sea ports to Bombay and thence
                    to Europe, the average imports into Bombay amounting to about 250 tons annually,
                    of which one-half is re-exported. Bombay senna is very inferior in appearance to
                    the Alexandrian, as it frequently contains many brown and decayed leaflets and
                    is mixed with leaf-stalks, &amp;c. <hi rend="italic">C. angustifolia</hi> is
                    also cultivated in the extreme south of India, and there affords larger leaves,
                    which are known in commerce as Tinnevelly senna. This variety is carefully
                    collected, and consists almost exclusively of leaves of a fine green colour,
                    without any admixture of stalks. It is exported from Tuticorin.</p>
                <p>Senna appears to have been introduced into Europe about the 9th century by
                    Arabian physicians, by whom, however, the pods seem to have been preferred to
                    the leaves. The medicinal activity of senna leaves appears to be due to a very
                    unstable colloid glucoside to which the name of cathartic acid has been given.
                    It is readily decomposed by a temperature much below 100° Fahr. <hi

                    preparations of senna are the most active. In the free state it is soluble in
                    dilute alcohol and in water, forming a brown solution, but is almost insoluble
                    in strong alcohol and entirely so in ether and chloroform. Combined with ammonia
                    it forms an active purgative. Two bitter principles named sennacrol and
                    senna-picrin have been extracted from senna by Ludwig; the former is soluble and
                    the latter insoluble in ether. A yellow colouring matter has also been obtained
                    from senna, but it appears probable that it is only a decomposition product of
                    cathartic acid. Senna must be included among the irritant purgatives, since
                    cathartic acid has no aperient effect when injected into the<pb break="no"

                    absorbed with difficulty, and its action is thus exerted throughout the greater
                    part of the intestinal canal.</p>
