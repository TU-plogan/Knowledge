                <p><label type="entry">SCILLY ISLES</label>, a group of islands, about forty in
                    number, in the county of Cornwall (see vol. vi. plate IX.), England, are
                    situated about 25 miles west by south of Land’s End and 40 west from Lizard
                    Point, in 50° N. lat. and 6° W. long. They are composed wholly of granite,—
                    outliers of the granite highlands of Cornwall. There are some metalliferous
                    veins or lodes, but none that could ever have yielded much iron. On account of
                    the mild climate the vegetation is remarkably luxuriant. The mean average
                    temperature in winter is about 45° and in summer about 58°. Fuchsias, geraniums,
                    and myrtles attain an immense size, and aloes, cactus, and the prickly pear grow
                    in the open air. The inhabitants devote their attention principally to the
                    cultivation of early potatoes for the London market. Asparagus and other early
                    vegetables, as well as flowers, are also largely cultivated. Lobsters are caught
                    and sent to London, but the fishing industry is of comparatively minor
                    importance.</p>
                <p>The total area of the islands is 3560 acres, with a population in 1871 of 2090,
                    and in 1881 of 2320, including 276 persons on board vessels. The inhabited
                    islands are St Mary’s (area about 1500 acres), Tresco (700), St Martin’s (550),
                    St Agnes (350), and Bryher (300). The principal town, Hugh Town in St Mary’s,
                    occupies a sandy peninsula crowned by the height called the Garrison, with Star
                    Castle, erected in the time of Elizabeth. It possesses a harbour and pier with a
                    roadstead affording anchorage for large vessels. The coast-line is wild and
                    picturesque, with precipitous headlands and many extensive caves. On Tresco
                    there are remains of an abbey; and St Agnes has a lighthouse 72 feet in height.
                    On the islands there are numerous rude pillars and circles of stones, similar to
                    those in Cornwall.</p>
                <p>The Scilly Isles are probably the <hi rend="italic">Cassiterides</hi> or “Tin
                    Islands” of the Greeks (see vol. xviii. p. 806). The islands were granted in 936
                    by Athelstan to the monks settled at Tresco, but on the endowment of the abbey
                    of Tavistock the greater portion of them were included amongst its possessions.
                    In the reign of Elizabeth they were divided amongst several proprietors. During
                    the Civil War Hugh Town held out for the king, and in 1645 afforded shelter for
                    a time to Prince Charles until he escaped to Jersey. In 1649 they were taken
                    possession of by Sir John Grenville, a Royalist, who made use of them as a
                    convenient shelter, whence he issued to sweep the neighbouring seas, until in
                    1651 he was forced to surrender to a fleet under Blake and Sir John Ayscue. In
                    ancient times a frequent haunt of pirates, the islands were afterwards notorious
                    for smuggling. On the suppression of smuggling Mr Augustus J. Smith did much to
                    introduce order and encourage habits of industry amongst the inhabitants.</p>
