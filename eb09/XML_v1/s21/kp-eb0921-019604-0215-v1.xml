                <p><label type="entry">ST QUENTIN</label>, a manufacturing town of France, the
                    chef-lieu of an arrondissement and in population (45,697 in 1881) the largest
                    town in the department of Aisne, stands on the right bank of the Somme, at the
                    junction of the Somme Canal with the St Quentin Canal (which unites the Somme
                    Canal with the Scheldt), 95½ miles northeast of Paris by the railway to Brussels
                    and Cologne, with branch lines to Guise (on the Oise) and Epéhy on the Flanders
                    and Picardy railway. Built on a slope, with a southern exposure, the town is
                    crowned by the collegiate church of St Quentin, one of the finest Gothic
                    buildings of the north of France, w’hich was erected between 1114 and 1477, and
                    has, like some English cathedrals, the somewhat rare peculiarity of double
                    transepts. The length of the church is 436 feet and the height of the nave 131.
                    The magnificent clerestory windows are supported by a very elegant triforium.
                    The baptismal chapel contains a fine stone retable. The choir has a great
                    resemblance to that of Rheims, and, like the chapels of the apse, has been
                    decorated with polychromic paintings. Under the choir is a crypt occupying the
                    site of an older crypt constructed in the 9th century, of which only the three
                    vaults with the tombs of St Quentin and his fellow-martyrs remain. The
                    town-house of St Quentin is a splendid building of the 15th and 16th centuries,
                    with a flamboyant façade, adorned with curious sculptures. Behind the central
                    gable rises a bell-tower with chimes. The council-room is a fine hall with a
                    double wooden ceiling and a huge chimneypiece half Gothic half Renaissance. The
                    old buildings of the Bernardines of Fervaques now provide accommodation for the
                    courts, the learned societies, the school of design, the museum, and the
                    library, and contain a large hall for public meetings. St Quentin is the centre

                <p>St Quentin, the <hi rend="italic">Augusta Veromanduorwm</hi> of the Romans, stood
                    at the meeting-place of five roads of military importance. In the 3d century it
                    was the scene of the martyrdom of Caius Quintinus, who had come as a preacher of
                    Christianity, and in the reign of Dagobert the martyr’s tomb became under the
                    influence of St Éloi a place of pilgrimage. After it had been thrice ravaged by
                    the Normans the town was surrounded by walls in 883. It became under Pippin,
                    grandson of Charlemagne, one of the principal domains of the county of
                    Vermandois, and in 1103 was constituted a commune. In 1195 it was incorporated
                    with the royal domain and about the same time received an increase of its
                    privileges. From 1420 to 1471 St Quentin was occupied by the Burgundians. Its
                    capture by the Spaniards on the day of St Lawrence, 1557, was the success which
                    Pliilip II. of Spain commemorated by building the Escorial. Two years later the
                    town was restored to the French, and in 1560 it was assigned as the dowry of
                    Alary Stuart. The fortifications erected under Louis XIV. were demolished
                    between 1810 and 1820. During the Franco-Prussian War St Quentin repulsed the
                    German attacks of 8th October 1870; and on 19th January 1871 it was the centre
                    of the great battle fought by General Faidherbe, one of the last episodes of the
                    campaign.</p>
