                <p><label type="entry">SANAA <hi rend="smallcaps">(San'á)</hi></label>, the capital
                    of Yemen in Arabia, and seat of the Turkish governor of that province, is
                    situated in 15° 22' N. lat. and 44° 31' E. long., in a well-watered upland
                    valley, 4000 feet above the sea and six to nine miles broad, running north and
                    south between two tablelands. The western table-land, over which lies the road
                    to the port of Hodaida on the Red Sea, rises 1200 feet above the town, the
                    eastern (J. Noḳom) is some 300 feet higher, and crowned by the ruins of the
                    fortress Birásh, which local tradition connects with the name of Shem, son of
                    Noah, to whom the foundation of the city is attributed by Hamdání, <hi
                    rend="italic">Jazírat,</hi> p. 55. Under Mount Noḳom in the valley is the hill
                    Ghomdán with the citadel, which Halévy in 1870 found in ruins. The ancient
                    fortress of Ghomdán, which is often referred to by poets, and is described in
                    extravagant terms by later writers, is said to have been destroyed by the caliph
                    'Othmán. The city proper, which is walled, extends from the citadel on the east
                    to the garden and ruined palace of the imám Motawakkil on the west. Beyond this
                    is the quarter known as Bîr al-'Azab, where the imáms had their pleasure
                    gardens, adjoining which, to the south, is the ancient Jewish settlement (Ḳá'
                    al-Yáhúd). In Niebuhr’s time (1763) the two last were open suburbs, but they
                    have since been walled in. Though Sanaa is a very old town, the earliest
                    buildings now standing are perhaps those which date from the Turkish occupation
                    (1570-1630)—some mosques, parts of the fortifications, the aqueduct. In last
                    century, under the independent imáms of Yemen, as the capital of the coffee
                    country and the most fertile region of Arabia, it was, with its palaces and
                    gardens, its mosques, caravanserais, and good private houses, by much the first
                    city of the peninsula. The Wahhabi movement and Turko-Egyptian intervention in
                    the affairs of Yemen shook the power of<pb break="no"

                    capital, but Cruttenden in 1836 still estimated the population at 40,000, or,
                    with the three neighbouring towns of Rauda, Jiráf, and Wady Dahr, at not less
                    than 70,000. In 1870, when the imamate had been extinct for twenty years, and
                    the town was governed by an elected sheikh and had lost its provinces, Halévy
                    found it much decayed, with many of the palaces and public buildings demolished
                    or used as quarries, but still presenting a comely aspect, with good streets,
                    houses, and mosques. In 1872, having been hard pressed by the Bedouins for
                    several years, Sanaa opened its gates to the Turks, who were then engaged in the
                    reconquest of Yemen. In the following year Millingen estimated the population at
                    only 20,000.</p>
                <p>The climate is good, though the extreme dryness of the air is trying. Rain
                    usually falls in January and June, and more copiously in the end of July; the
                    markets are well supplied with grain and fruit; vineyards were formerly
                    numerous, but were largely given up after an attack of vine disease some thirty
                    years ago.</p>
                <p>Arabic writers give many discordant and fabulous traditions about the oldest
                    history of Sanaa and its connexion with the ancient kingdom of Himyar. But most
                    agree that its oldest name was Azál, which seems to be the same word with Uzal
                    in Gen. x. 27. A Himyarite nation of Auzalites occurs in a Syriac writer of the
                    6th century. The better-informed Arab writers knew also that the later name is
                    due to the Abyssinian conquerors of Yemen, and that it meant in their language
                    “fortified” (Bakrí, p. 606; Nöldeke, <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. Pers. u.
                    Arab.,</hi> p. 187). Sanaa became the capital of the Abyssinian Abraha (<hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi>. 530 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.)</hi> who built here the
                    famous church (<hi rend="italic">Ḳalís),</hi> of whose splendour the Arabs give
                    exaggerated pictures, and which was destroyed two centuries later by order of
                    the caliph Mansur (Azraḳí, p. 91).</p>
