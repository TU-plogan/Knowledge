                <p><label type="entry">SARATOFF</label>, capital of the above government, situated
                    on the right bank of the Volga, 532 miles by rail to the south-east of Moscow,
                    has become one of the most important cities of eastern Russia, and ranks among
                    the very few Russian cities which have more than 100,000 inhabitants. It is
                    picturesquely situated on the side of hills which come close down to the Volga.
                    One of these, the Sokolova Hill (560 feet) is liable to frequent landslips,
                    which are a continual source of danger to the houses of poorer inhabitants at
                    its base. The terrace on 'which Saratoff is built being intersected by two
                    ravines, the city is divided into three parts; the outer two may be considered
                    as suburbs. A large village, Pokrovskaya, with about 20,000 inhabitants,
                    situated on the opposite bank of the Volga, though in the government of Samara,
                    is in reality a suburb of Saratoff. Apart from this suburb, Saratoff had in 1882
                    a population of 112,430 (49,660 in 1830, and 69,660 in 1859). It is better built
                    than many towns of central Russia. Its old cathedral (1697) is a very plain
                    structure, but the new one, completed in 1825, is fine, and has a striking
                    campanile. The theatre and the railway station are also fine buildings. The
                    streets are wide and regular, and there are several broad squares. A new
                    fine-art gallery was erected in 1884 by the Russian painter Bogoluboff, who has
                    bequeathed to the city his collection of modern pictures and of various objects
                    of art. A school of drawing and the public library are in the same building,
                    which has received the name of “Radistcheff’s Museum” (in memory of Radistcheff,
                    the author prosecuted by Catherine IL).</p>
                <p>Agriculture and gardening are still the support of a section of the population,
                    who rent land in the neighbourhood of the city. The culture of the sunflower
                    deserves special mention. The local manufacturing establishments do not keep
                    pace with the rapidly increasing trade, and their aggregate production cannot be
                    estimated at more than £450,000. The distilleries are first in importance; next
                    come the manufactures of liqueurs (£160,000), flourmills (about £10,000),
                    oil-works (£56,000), and tobacco-factories (about £40,000). The city has not
                    only a trade in corn, oil, hides, tallow, woollen cloth, wool, fruits, and
                    various raw produce exported from Samara, but also a trade in salt from Crimea
                    and Astrakhan, which is in the hands of the Samara merchants, and in iron from
                    the Urals and wooden wares from the upper Volga governments. Saratoff also
                    supplies south-eastern Russia with manufactured articles and grocery wares
                    imported from central Russia. The traffic of the port was estimated at about
                    5,700,000 roubles in 1882. The shallowness of the Volga opposite the town, and
                    the immense shoals along its right bank are, however, a great drawback. Vast
                    sand-banks, which formerly lay above the city, have gradually shifted their
                    position, and it is supposed that in a<pb break="no"

                    about 1 mile wide. In 1882 and 1883 steamers were compelled to discharge cargoes
                    50 miles below Saratoff or at the Pokrovskaya suburb on the left bank,—so that a
                    branch railway for conveying the cargoes of the steamers has now been
                    constructed south of the city.</p>
                <p>The town of Saratoff was founded at the end of the 16th century, on the left bank
                    of the Volga, some seven miles above the present site, to which it was removed
                    about 1605. The place it now occupies (Sarytau, or Yellow Mountain) has been
                    inhabited from a remote antiquity. Although founded for the maintenance of order
                    in the Volga region, Saratoff, which was not fortified, was several times
                    pillaged in the 17th and 18th centuries. Razin took it, and his followers kept
                    it until 1671; the insurgent Cossacks of the Don under Bulavin and Nekrasoff
                    pillaged it in 1708 and Pugatcheff in 1774. After being placed under Kazan and
                    later under Astrakhan, it became the chief town of the Saratoff government in
                    1797.</p>
