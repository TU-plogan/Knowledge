                    (1811-1878), one of the most successful ecclesiastical architects of the 19th
                    century, was born in 1811 at Gawcott near Buckingham, where his father was
                    rector; his grandfather was Thomas Scott (1747-1821), the well-known commentator
                    on the Bible. In 1827 young Scott was apprenticed for four years to an architect
                    in London named Edmeston, and at the end of his pupildom acted as clerk of the
                    works at the new Fishmongers’ Hall and other buildings in order to acquire a
                    knowledge of the practical details of his profession. In Edmeston’s office he
                    became acquainted with a fellowpupil, named Moffat, a man who possessed
                    considerable talents for the purely business part of an architect’s work, and
                    the two entered into partnership. In 1834 they were appointed architects to the
                    union workhouses of Buckinghamshire, and for four years were busily occupied in
                    building a number of cheap and ugly unions, both there and in Northamptonshire
                    and Lincolnshire. In 1838 Scott built at Lincoln his first church, won in an
                    open competition, and this was quickly followed by six others, all very poor
                    buildings without chancels; that was a period when church building in England
                    had reached its very lowest point both in style and in poverty of construction.
                    About 1839 his enthusiasm was aroused by some of the eloquent writings of Pugin
                    on mediaeval architecture, and by the various papers on ecclesiastical subjects
                    published by the Camden Society. These opened a new world to Scott, and he
                    thenceforth studied and imitated the architectural styles and principles of the
                    Middle Ages with the utmost zeal and patient care. The first result of this new
                    study was his design for the Martyrs’ Memorial at Oxford, erected in 1840, a
                    clever adaptation of the late 13th-century crosses in honour of Queen Eleanor.
                    From that time Scott became the chief ecclesiastical architect in<pb break="no"

                    completed an almost incredibly large number of new churches and “restorations,”
                    the fever for which was fomented by the Ecclesiological Society and the growth
                    of ecclesiastical feeling in England.</p>
                <p>In 1844 Scott won the first premium in the competition for the new Lutheran
                    church at Hamburg, a noble building with a very lofty spire, designed strictly
                    in the style of the 13th century. In the following year his partnership with
                    Moffat was dissolved, and in 1847 Scott was employed to renovate and refit Ely
                    cathedral, the first of a long series of English cathedral and abbey churches
                    which passed through his hands. In 1851 Scott visited and studied the
                    architecture of the chief towns in northern Italy, and in 1855 won the
                    competition for the town-house at Hamburg, designed after the model of similar
                    buildings in north Germany. In spite of his having won the first prize, another
                    architect was selected to construct the building, after a very inferior design.
                    In 1856 a competition was held for designs of the new Government offices in
                    London; Scott obtained the third place in this, but the work was afterwards
                    given to him on the condition (insisted on by Lord Palmerston) that he should
                    make a new design, not Gothic, but Classic or Renaissance in style. This Scott
                    very unwillingly consented to do, as he had little sympathy with any styles but
                    those of England or France from the 13th to the 15th century. In 1862-63 he was
                    employed to design and construct the Albert Memorial, a very costly and
                    elaborate work, in the style of a magnified 13th-century reliquary or ciborium,
                    adorned with many statues and reliefs in bronze and marble. On the partial
                    completion of this he received the honour of knighthood. In 1866 he competed for
                    the new London law-courts, but the prize was adjudged to his old pupil, G. E.
                    Street. In 1873, owing to illness caused by overwork, Scott spent some time in
                    Rome and other parts of Italy. The mosaic pavement which he designed for Durham
                    cathedral soon afterwards was the result of his study of the 13th-century
                    mosaics in the old basilicas of Rome. On his return to England he resumed his
                    professional labours, and continued to work almost without intermission till his
                    short illness and death in 1878. He was buried in the nave of Westminster Abbey,
                    and an engraved brass, designed by G. E. Street, was placed over his grave. In
                    1838 Scott married his cousin, Caroline Oldrid, who died in 1870; they had five
                    sons, two of whom have taken up their father’s profession.</p>
                <p>Scott’s architectural works were more numerous than those of any other architect
                    of the century; unfortunately for his fame, he undertook far more than it was
                    possible for him really to design or supervise with thought and care. He carried
                    out extensive works of repair, refurnishing, and restoration in the following
                    buildings: —the cathedrals of Ely, Hereford, Lichfield, Salisbury, Chichester,
                    Durham, St David’s, Bangor, St Asaph, Chester, Gloucester, Ripon, Worcester,
                    Exeter, Rochester, the abbeys of Westminster, St Albans, Tewkesbury, and
                    countless minor churches. He also built the new Government offices (India,
                    Foreign, Home, and Colonial), the Midland Railway terminus and hotel, and a
                    large number of private houses and other buildings. His style was (with the one
                    exception of the Government offices) a careful copy of architectural periods of
                    the Middle Ages, used with a profound knowledge of detail, but without much real
                    inventive power, and consequently rather dull and uninteresting in effect. As a
                    “restorer” of ancient buildings he was guilty of an immense amount of the most
                    irreparable destruction, but any other architect of his generation would
                    probably have done as much or even more harm. While a member of the Royal
                    Academy Scott held for many years the post of professor of architecture, and
                    gave a long series of able lectures on mediaeval styles, which were published in
                    1879. He wrote a work on <hi rend="italic">Domestic Architecture,</hi> and a
                    volume of <hi rend="italic">Personell and Professional Recollections,</hi>
                    which, edited by his eldest son, was published in 1879, and also a large number
                    of articles and reports on many of the ancient buildings with which he had to
                    deal. Owing to his numerous pupils, among whom have been many leading
                    architects, his influence was for some time very widely spread; but it is now
                    rapidly passing away, mainly owing to the growing reaction against the somewhat
                    narrow mediaevalism of which he, both in theory and practice, was the chief
                    exponent.</p>
