                <p><label type="entry">SCHWARZBURG-RUDOLSTADT</label>, a small Thuringian
                    principality and an independent member of the German empire, shares with
                    Schwarzburg-Sondershausen the possessions of the old house of Schwarzburg,
                    consisting of the upper barony (Oberherrschaft) in Thuringia, on the Gera, Ilm,
                    and Saale, and the lower barony (Unterherrschaft), an isolated district on the
                    Wipper and Helbe, about 25 miles to the north, surrounded by the Prussian
                    province of Saxony. See plate V. As the dignity of prince is held in virtue of
                    the Oberherrschaft alone, a share of both baronies was given to each sub-line of
                    the main house. The total area of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is 363 square miles, of
                    which 283 are in the upper and 80 in the lower barony; the chief towns in the
                    former district are Rudolstadt (8747 inhabitants), the capital, and Blankenburg
                    (1889), and in the latter Frankenhausen (4985). Both baronies are hilly, but no
                    great height is anywhere attained. The scenery of the Thuringian portion of
                    Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt attracts many visitors annually, the most beautiful spots
                    being the gorge of the Schwarza and the lovely circular valley in which the
                    village of Schwarzburg nestles at the foot of a curiously isolated hill, crowned
                    by the ancient castle of the princely line. Cattle-rearing and fruit-growing
                    flourish in the lower barony, while the upper barony is finely wooded. Of the
                    whole country 44 per cent. is under forest (mainly coniferous trees), and 41 per
                    cent. is devoted to agriculture. The chief grain crops are rye, oats, and
                    barley, but in 1883 thrice as much ground was occupied by potatoes as by all
                    these three together. The live-stock returns in 1883 showed 19,831 cattle,
                    39,024 sheep, 19,544 pigs, 14,420 goats, and 2813 horses. Agriculture and
                    forestry support about 35 per cent. of the population, and mining and cognate
                    industries about 10 per cent. Trade and manufactures are insignificant; iron,
                    lignite, cobalt, alum, and vitriol are among the mineral productions. In 1880
                    the population was 80,296 (an increase of 1779 since 1875), or about 221 to the
                    square mile. Of these 79,832 were Protestants.</p>
                <p>Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is a limited hereditary sovereignty, its constitution
                    resting on laws of 1854 and 1870, though a diet has met at intervals since 1816.
                    The present diet consists of sixteen members elected for six years, four chosen
                    by the highest taxpayers, the others by general election. The diet must be
                    summoned every three years. The budget for 1885-87 estimated revenue and
                    expenditure each at £101,210; £57,670 was the estimated income from the public
                    lands and forests. The public debt was £230,350. The troops of
                    Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt have been incorporated with the Prussian army since the
                    convention of 1867. The principality has one vote in the Reichstag and one in
                    the federal council.</p>
                <p>Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt is the cadet branch of the family. In 1710 the count was
                    made a prince, in spite of the remonstrances of the elector of Saxony, although
                    he was prevented from taking his seat in the imperial college until 1754. The
                    principality entered the Confederation of the Rhine in 1807 and the German
                    League in 1815. In 1819 it redeemed the Prussian claims of superiority by
                    surrendering portions of its territory.</p>
