                <p><label type="entry">CARCASSONNE</label>, the chief town of the department of
                    Aude, in France, is situated on both sides of the River Aude, and in the
                    immediate neighbourhood of the Canal du Sud, about 55 miles S.E. of Toulouse, on
                    the railway between that city and Narbonne, in 43’ 12' 54" N. lat. and 2° 20' 55
                    E. long. On an abrupt elevation on the right bank of the river stands the old
                    city, enclosed by a double line of ramparts and towers, and retaining the aspect
                    of a mediaeval fortress. A portion of the inner line is attributed to the
                    Visigoths; the rest, including the castle, seems to belong to the 11th or 12th
                    century, while the outer circuit has been referred mainly to the end of the
                    13th. The old cathedral of St Nazaire, which partly dates from the 11th century,
                    and contains magnificent stained-glass windows of the Renaissance period, has
                    been restored under the superintendence of Μ. Viollet-le-Duc. On the left bank
                    of the river, but connected with the city by a bridge of twelve arches, lies the
                    new town, clean, well-built, and flourishing, with streets intersecting each
                    other at right angles. It is surrounded by boulevards occupying the site of its
                    ramparts, and has a large esplanade <pb break="no"

                    fountains and planted walks. As chief town of a department, and the seat of a
                    bishop, Carcassonne contains court-houses and various public offices, an
                    episcopal palace, and a theological seminary; and among its other public
                    buildings and insti tutions may be mentioned the new cathedral of St Michael,
                    the town-hall, the library with upwards of 15,000 volumes, the exchange, the
                    theatre, the barracks, the hospitals, the college, the school of design, the
                    museum, the chamber of commerce, and the agricultural society. Of the various
                    industrial establishments the most important are the woollen factories,—not less
                    than 2000 people being engaged in the manufacture of cloth, which is chiefly
                    exported to the Levant, Barbary, and South America. Wadding, paper, leather,
                    pottery, and iron wares are also produced; and there is a trade in wine, brandy,
                    and fruit. A large fair is held in November and another on Whit-Tuesday.

                <p>Carcassonne occupies the site of <hi rend="italic">Carcaso,</hi> an ancient city
                    of Gallia Narbonensis, which belonged to the Volcae Tectosages. It was a place
                    of some importance at the time of Caesar’s invasion, but makes almost no
                    appearance in Roman history. On the disintegration of the empire, it fell into
                    the hands of the Visigoths, who, in spite of the attacks of the Franks,
                    especially in 585, retained possession till 724, λvhen they were expelled by the
                    Saracens, destined in turn to yield before long to Charles Martel. From the 9th
                    to the beginning of the 13th century Carcassonne formed a separate countship,
                    which was brought to ruin by the attachment of Count Raymond Roger to the cause
                    of the Albigenses. The city, in spite of a noble defence, was taken by the
                    Crusaders of Simon de Montfort in 1209, and the unfortunate count perished in
                    captivity. In 1224, his son, Raymond Trencavel Il., recovered his estates, but
                    in 1247 he was forced to yield all his rights to Philip Augustus. A revolt of
                    the city against the royal authority was severely punished in 1262, by the
                    expulsion of its principal inhabitants, who were, however, peπnitted to take up
                    their quarters on the other side of the river. This was the origin of the new
                    town, which was fortified in 1347. During the religious wars Carcassonne several
                    times changed lιands, and it did not recognise Henry IV. till 1596.</p>
