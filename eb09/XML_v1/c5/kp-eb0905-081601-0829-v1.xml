                    rend="smallcaps">Caecu¾,</hi> a Roman patrician and author of the 4th century
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> In 312 B.c. he was elected censor without having
                    passed through the office of consul. His censorship was remarkable for the
                    actual or attempted achievement of several great constitutional changes. He
                    filled vacancies in the senate with men of low birth; and when his list was
                    rejected, and C. Plautius, his colleague, resigned, he continued, in defiance of
                    custom, to hold the office alone. He also retained it for five years, despite
                    the Aemilian law, which limited the duration of its tenure to a year and a half.
                    He transferred the charge of the public worship of Hercules in the Forum Boarium
                    from the hands of the Politian gens to that of public slaves. He distributed the
                    <hi rend="italic">libertini</hi> among all the tribes; and he further invaded
                    the exclusive rights of the patricians by directing his secretary Cneius Flavius
                    (whom, though a freedman, he made a senator) to publish the <hi rend="italic"
                    >legis actiones</hi> and the list of <hi rend="italic">dies fasti</hi> (or days
                    on which legal business could be transacted). And lastly, he gained enduring
                    fame by the construction of a road and an aqueduct, which—a thing unheard of
                    before—he called by his own name. In the year after his resignation of the
                    censorship (307) he was elected consul. In 298 he was made interrex; and in 296,
                    as consul, he led the army in Samnium, and the armies of the two consuls gained
                    a victory over the Etruscans and Samnites; but he never triumphed, nor does his
                    military career appear to have been at all distinguished. Next year he was
                    praetor, and he was once dictator. To the Ogulnian law admitting the plebeians
                    to the offices of augur and pontifex he was strongly opposed; and his advocacy
                    of the cause of the democracy seems to have ended with his censorship. His
                    ambition and his pride of race were, however, accompanied by a passionate love
                    of Rome.</p>
                <p>He was already blind and tottering with age when Cineas, the minister of Pyrrhus
                    visited him, but so vigorously did he oppose every concession that all the
                    eloquence of Cineas was in vain, and the Romans forgot past misfortunes'in the
                    inspiration of his patriotism. The story of his blindness, however, may be
                    merely a method of accounting for his cognomen.</p>
                <p>Appius Claudius Caecus is also remarkable as the first of the Roman writers, both
                    in verse and prose, of whom we know anything. He wrote a poem which is mentioned
                    by Cicero, but of which the remaining fragments are of the smallest, and a legal
                    work entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Usurpationibus.</hi>
                    Itis very likely also that he was concerned in the drawing up of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Legis Actiones</hi> published by Flavius. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sententioe,</hi> which include the famous dictum “Every one is the architect of
                    his own fortunes,” were read by Panaetius, but are now lost.</p>
