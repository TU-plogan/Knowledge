                <p><label type="entry">CHARLES I</label>., the Bald (823-877), king of France and
                    emperor of the Romans, was son of Louis le Débonnaire, by his second wife
                    Judith. To furnish him with a kingdom, his father deprived his elder brothers of
                    some of the territory he had previously assigned to them, and war ensued, at the
                    end of which, after many failures and successes, Charles was left in possession
                    of a great kingdom in the west of the empire. On the death of his father in 840,
                    Charles sought to succeed as emperor, and allied himself with his brother, Louis
                    the German. In 841, in a battle at Fontenai, remarkable for the number of the
                    slain and the fierceness with which it was contested, Charles’s rival and eldest
                    brother Lothaire was defeated; but such had been the loss even of the victor
                    that it was impossible to follow up the victory. The alliance between Louis and
                    Charles was renewed, the former taking his oath in words which form one of the
                    earliest specimens of the Romance language; and in 843 the treaty of Verdun
                    confirmed to Charles the possession of his kingdom, which comprised France to
                    the west of the Meuse, Saône, and Rhone, and Spain from the Ebro to the
                    Pyrenees. The weakness of Charles’s government was, however, extreme. The
                    Normans, sailing up the rivers in small companies of a few hundreds, pillaged
                    the country almost without resistance; at length in 858 the people in despair,
                    calling in the aid of his brother Louis, drove the king from the country for a
                    time. Charles was entirely under the control of the bishops, and his submission
                    did not go without reward; in 875 he was crowned emperor by the Pope. But Louis
                    attacked him with great success; and his power was far from stable when, having
                    been summoned into Italy by the Pope against the Saracens, he died in 877 near
                    Mont Cenis. The last and perhaps most important act of his reign was the decree
                    of Chiersi, by which the tenure of the counties was made hereditary.</p>
