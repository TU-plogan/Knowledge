                    (1522-1586), probably the ablest Lutheran theologian of the period immediately
                    succeeding that of Luther himself, was born at Treuenbritzen in the mark of
                    Brandenburg, on the 9th November 1522. His father, though of noble rank, was in
                    somewhat straitened circumstances, and Martin’s education was frequently
                    interrupted owing to pecuniary difficulties. In his fourteenth year he was sent
                    to school at Wittenberg, where he had frequent opportunities of hearing Luther
                    preach. He studied at the universities of Magdeburg (1539-42),
                    Frankfort-on-the-Oder (1543), and Wittenberg (1545), devoting himself specially
                    at the last of these, under the advice of Melanchthon, to mathematics and
                    astrology. In 1547 he removed to Königsberg, where hé was appointed in the
                    following year rector of the cathedral school, and two years later (1550)
                    librarian to Duke Albert of Prussia, whose patronage he had gained through his
                    acquaintance with astrology. It was during his residence in Königsberg that
                    Chemnitz first turned his attention seriously to theology, and that he first had
                    an opportunity, in the celebrated controversy with Osiander on the doctrine of
                    justification by faith, of displaying the polemical ability in which he was
                    scarcely surpassed by the greatest of the Reformers. Osiander, who assailed the
                    forensic and objective element in the Lutheran doctrine, was favoured by Duke
                    Albert, and, as the controversy increased in intensity, Chemnitz judged it
                    expedient to resign his post of librarian and leave Königsberg. In 1553 he
                    returned to Wittenberg, and immediately commenced to deliver lectures at the
                    university on the <hi rend="italic">Loci Communes</hi> of Melanchthon. These
                    formed the basis of his <hi rend="italic">Loci</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologici</hi> (Frankfort, 1591), a work which furnishes one of the best
                    existing expositions of the Lutheran theology, as formulated and modified by
                    Melanchthon. His audience was from the first exceptionally large, and a career
                    of great influence seemed open to him at the university, when he was induced to
                    make another change by accepting the office of pastor to the church in
                    Brunswick, to which he removed in J 554. In this position he spent the remainder
                    of his life, though he received numerous offers of important offices from
                    various Protestant princes of Germany. He was unusually active in the duties of
                    his charge, and he also took a leading part in the theological controversies of
                    the time, always representing and defending strictly Lutheran views. In fact, it
                    is in no small degree to his personal influence, exerted as it was at the
                    critical period of its history, that the Lutheran Church owed the purity of its
                    doctrine and the compactness of its organization. Against the Crypto-Calvinists
                    he maintained the Lutheran doctrine of the Lord’s Supper in a treatise <hi

                    German 1561). Against the Jesuits, on the other hand, he wrote some works of
                    great power, which probably did a good deal to. check the reaction from
                    Lutheranism that seemed to be setting in. Chief of these were the <hi

                    rend="italic">Capita</hi> (1562), a very incisive attack on the principles of
                    the order, and his <hi rend="italic">Examen Concilii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tridentini,</hi> in four parts, published at intervals (1565, 1566, 1572, and
                    1573). The latter is undoubtedly Chemnitz’s greatest work. Roman Catholics
                    themselves have not been slow to acknowledge its ability, and it may be
                    questioned whether to this day anti-Tridentine literature can show anything more
                    thorough or more acute. In conjunction with Mörlin, Chemnitz compiled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Doctrinoe Prutenicum</hi> (1567), a doctrinal work, which
                    at once acquired great authority. Perhaps his chief service to the organization
                    of the church was rendered when, in conjunction with Andrea and Selnecker, he
                    induced the Lutherans of Saxony and Swabia to adopt the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Formula</hi><hi rend="italic">Concordiae,</hi> and so become one body. In the
                    protracted negotiations which led to this result his learning and tact were of
                    the greatest value.</p>
