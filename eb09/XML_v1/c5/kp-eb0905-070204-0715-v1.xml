                <p><label type="entry">CHRISTINA</label> (1626-1689), queen of Sweden, was the
                    second daughter of Gustavus Adolphus and Mary Eleanor of Brandenburg.
                    Disappointed in his hopes of male offspring, her great father reared her in
                    virile fashion, and left her, on his departure for Germany (1630), in the hands
                    of Axel Oxenstiern, the famous chancellor, and of Johannes Matthiae, his own
                    almoner, who was to ground her in sciences and in Latin and Greek.</p>
                <p>The battle of Lützen placed Christina on the throne in her sixth year. She was
                    proclaimed queen without delay, but the government was vested in a council of
                    regency, composed of the five chief dignitaries of the kingdom, with Oxenstiern
                    at their head. Placed under the care of her aunt Catharine, the
                    countess-palatine, the little queen made rapid progress in the direction
                    indicated by Gustavus. At ten years old she dressed usually in boy’s clothes,
                    and was wont to hunt and to go long journeys on foot and on horseback; and she
                    found means, in the midst of these occupations, to acquire several sciences and
                    modern languages, in addition to the classical tongues. In 1636 Oxenstiern
                    returned from Germany, and again assumed the direction of affairs; and from him,
                    her father’s friend and minister, Christina received the ablest lessons in
                    state-craft and the art of government that the age could furnish. At sixteen,
                    the confidence reposed in her was such, that she was generally solicited to
                    enter on the exercise of her functions as queen regnant. This proposal she
                    declined, however, nor would she listen to any renewal of it till two years
                    later (1644), when the conduct of the state was placed in her hands. For a time
                    all went well. The members of the council of regency were confirmed in their
                    places; the kingdom was flourishing within and without; the war with Denmark and
                    Germany promised to bear good fruits. Christina, however, had determined on
                    peace, in this she was opposed by Oxenstiern; but during the following year a
                    treaty was signed with Denmark exceedingly advantageous to Sweden. Germany was

                    to form a secret conspiracy against her own ministers; and by her efforts, ably
                    seconded by those of Adler Salvius, a young diplomatist to whom she had
                    entrusted the affair, the peace of Westphalia was concluded (1648), and the
                    Thirty Years’ War was brought to an end.</p>
                <p>The eyes of Europe were now fixed on the young queen. Offers of alliance came to
                    her from aU quarters—from Holland and Spain, from England and France. She
                    continued for some time to deserve the esteem with which she was regarded,
                    reforming abuses, filling the treasury, and encouraging arts and commerce to the
                    utmost in her power. It was the general wish that she should marry, and many
                    suitors were proposed. Christina excused herself in an epigram; and to rid
                    herself of further importunities she named her cousin Charles Gustavus her
                    successor, presenting him in that capacity to the assembled estates in 1649, and
                    in 1650 she solemnly took to herself the title of king.</p>
                <p>At this time the change would seem to have come upon Christina’s conduct that was
                    to determine so much of her subsequent career, induced apparently by the maxims
                    of a certain Bourdelot, a French physician in her employ. The practice of a
                    cynical epicureanism became her only occupation. The reign of favourites began;
                    and with it the welfare of the kingdom commenced to decline. Honours, dignities,
                    and treasure were lavished on the most worthless of men; and discontent grew
                    rife everywhere beyond the palace. Christina was alarmed, and had thoughts of
                    abdication (1651); but her designs were vigorously opposed by Oxenstiern, and
                    for a while she yielded to the pressure brought to bear on her by the chancellor
                    and his party. The favourites (among whom were Whitelock, Cromwell’s envoy,
                    Pimentelli, the Spanish ambassador, and Chanut, the representative of France)
                    were kept in the background, and Bourdelot, the master cynic, was sent out of
                    Sweden. Christina encouraged the presence of artists and men of science;
                    Descartes, an exile from his native Iand, was received by her with great
                    consideration; she made large purchases for the Swedish museums; she
                    corresponded with Vossius and Salmasius, with Puffendorf and Grotius, with Naudé
                    and Bochard; she did her best to rule and to be respectable. But she was weary
                    of the roughness and coarseness of the land of her birth; she longed for freedom
                    and change; she was conscious, moreover, of her own gradual degradation in the
                    eyes of the subjects she despised. The conspiracy of Messenius, the chiefs of
                    which perished on the scaffold, gave her an excuse and the opportunity she had
                    long desired. In 1654 the estates were convoked at Upsala, and she resigned the
                    crown to her cousin Charles Gustavus.</p>
                <p>She had reserved to herself her own independence, an absolute authority over such
                    of her subjects as should accompany her, and the revenues of Pomerania and
                    Mecklenburg, with those of several Swedish provinces. Quitting the habit of her
                    sex, and taking the words <hi rend="italic">Fata</hi><hi rend="italic">viam
                    invenient</hi> as a device, she left her kingdom, traversed Denmark and Germany,
                    and established herself at Brussels. Here she remained for nearly a year,
                    signalizing her sojourn by the private renunciation of Lutheranism, which she
                    afterwards solemnly and publicly abjured at Innsbruck. From Innsbruck she went
                    to Italy. She entered Rome on horseback, was received, confirmed, and baptized
                    Alexandra by Alexander VII., and was lodged in the Palazzo Farnese, where she
                    surrounded herself with artists and amorists, with philosophers and scientific
                    mountebanks. In 1656, having quarrelled with some of the College of Cardinals,
                    she made her first trip to France, where she had much success as a spectacle,
                    called on the king at Compiègne, was lodged at Fontainebleau, and stayed for
                    some time in Paris. She was most gracious with the men of letters and science,
                    but she outraged all the women by her expressions of contempt for their sex and
                    themselves (which called forth many illiberal remarks concerning her spare
                    figure and humped shoulder), and declared that Ninon de ΓEnclos was the only one
                    of them worth her regard. She also attempted to instil a few of her own
                    political theories into the bosom of Mazarin; but that subtle diplomatist
                    resisted, and when in the following year, after a journey to Italy, she
                    attempted to renew her visit, he found means to have her detained at
                    Fontainebleau. It was here that, after writing to Cromwell, who would none of
                    her, she caused her favourite Monaldeschi, in revenge for the betrayal of her
                    secrets, to be put to death by the captain of her guard. The public indignation
                    was great, and she was ordered to leave France. Leibnitz, however, apologized
                    for the crime, and she took no notice of her expulsion till 1658, consoling
                    herself meanwhile with the society of a kindred spirit, Madame de la Suze. In
                    that year she returned to Rome; and the Swedish revenues coming slowly in,
                    Alexander allowed her a pension. In 1660 Charles Gustavus died, and Christina
                    returned to Sweden, to claim the throne she had quitted so lightly and regretted
                    so bitterly. But the Swedes had lost their old reverence for the daughter of
                    Gustavus; her new religion and her treatment of Monaldeschi had made them wary
                    of her; and she was compelled to sign another and more binding deed of
                    abdication, and once more to retreat to Rome. She reappeared in Sweden some six
                    years afterwards; but the exercise of her faith was denied her, and she withdrew
                    to Hamburg, where she begged in vain the empty crown of Poland, and whence she
                    made for Rome once more. In that city she lived for some twenty years,
                    quarrelling, intriguing, and collecting, corresponding with men of letters and
                    founding academies, active in the Molinist controversy and in the cause of the
                    Venetians besieged by the Turks, consumed by the desire of that political power
                    which she had thrown away, and endeavouring to assert her vanished influence to
                    the last. She died, with great composure, in 1689, and was buried, under a
                    sonorous epitaph, in St Peter’s. Her magnificent library was purchased by
                    Alexander VIII., her collection of antiques and part of her paintings by
                    Odescalchi, a nephew of the Pope, and the remainder of her pictures by the
                    regent Orléans.</p>
                <p>Christina left many MSS., which were collected and published by Archenholtz,
                    librarian to the landgrave of Hesse Cassel, in his memoirs of her life, 4 vols.
                    4to, 1751. Her life was also written by Jacques Lacombe, a translation of whose
                    work, said to be superior to the original, appeared in London in 1776. See also
