                    (1740-1824), known as <hi rend="smallcaps">Major Cartwright,</hi> one of the
                    earliest and most honourable of English parliamentary reformers, was born at
                    Marnham in Nottinghamshire, September 28, 1740. He received bis education at
                    Newark grammar school, and at Heath Academy in Yorkshire, and at the age of
                    eighteen entered the navy. He was present, in his first year of service, at the
                    capture of Cherbourg, and served in the following year in the action between Sir
                    Edward Hawke and Admiral Conflans. Engaged afterwards under Sir Hugh Palliser
                    and Admiral Byron on the Newfoundland station, he was appointed to act as chief
                    magistrate of the settlement; and the duties of this post he discharged with
                    singular uprightness and efficiency for five years. During this period he
                    explored the interior of the island and discovered Lieutenant’s Lake. Ill health
                    necessitated his retirement from active service for a time in 1771. When the
                    disputes with the American colonies began, he saw clearly that the colonists had
                    right on their side, and warmly supported their cause. At the beginning of the
                    war he was offered the appointment of first lieutenant to the duke of
                    Cumberland, which would have put him on the path of certain promotion. But he
                    declined to fight against the cause which he felt to be just, and thus nobly
                    renounced the prospects of advancement in his profession. In 1774 he published
                    his first plea on behalf of the colonists, entitled <hi rend="italic">American
                    Independence the Glory and Interest of Great Britain.</hi> In the following
                    year, when the Nottinghamshire Militia was first raised, he was appointed major,
                    and in this capacity he served for seventeen years. He was at last illegally
                    superseded, because of his political opinions. In 1776 appeared his first work
                    on reform in Parhament, which, with the exception of Earl Stanhope’s pamphlets
                    (1774), appears to have been the earliest publication on the subject. It was
                    entitled, <hi rend="italic">Take your Choice,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a
                    second edition appearing under the new title of <hi rend="italic">The
                    Legislative Rights of the Commonalty vindicated.</hi> The task of his life was
                    thenceforth chiefly the attainment of universal suffrage and annual Parliaments.
                    In 1778 he was an unsuccessful candidate for the representation of
                    Nottinghamshire; and the same year he conceived the project of a political
                    association, which took shape in 1780 as the “Society for Constitutional
                    Information,” and which included among its members some of the most
                    distinguished men of the day. From this society sprang the more famous
                    “Corresponding Society.” Major Cartwright, working unweariedly for the promotion
                    of reform, published many pamphlets which it is needless to enumerate here,
                    carried on a very extensive correspondence, and attended a great number of
                    public meetings. He was one of the witnesses on the trial of his friends, Horne
                    Tooke, Thelwall, and Hardy, in 1794, and was himself indicted for conspiracy in
                    1819. He was found guilty in the following year, and was condemned to pay a fine
                    of £100. He married in 1780, and his wife survived him. He had no children. He
                    took up his abode in London in 1810, settled in Burton Crescent in 1819, ajιd
                    there spent his last years. He was warmly loved by all who knew him personally;
                    for, while the world looked chiefly at his inflexibility of political principle,
                    his family and friends saw his unswerving integrity, his gentle-heartedness, his
                    warm affections, his unvarying courtesy and rare simplicity of life. His health
                    began to fail in 1823; and his spirits were greatly depressed at the same time
                    both by public and private sorrows. The reverses in Spain and the execution of
                    Riego touched him deeply, and more closely still the illness of a sister and the
                    death of his brother, noticed above. He died in London, on the 23d September
                    1824. Tn 1826 appeared, in two volumes, <hi rend="italic">The Life and
                    Correspondence of Major Cartwright,</hi> edited by his niece, F. D. Cartwright.
                    A complete list of his writings is included in this work. In 1831 a monument was
                    erected to him in Burton Crescent, from a design by Macdowell.</p>
