                    rend="italic">Cidιorium</hi><hi rend="italic">Intybus</hi> (natural order, <hi
                    rend="italic">Compositae),</hi> in its wild state is a native of Great Britain,
                    occurring most frequently in dry chalky soils, and by road-sides. It has a long
                    fleshy taproot, a rigid branching hairy stem rising to a height of 2 to 3
                    feet,—the leaves around the base being lobed and toothed, not unlike those of
                    the dandelion. The flower heads are of a bright blue colour, few in number, and
                    measure nearly an inch and a half across. Chicory is cultivated much more
                    extensively on the Continent—in Holland, Belgium, France, and Germany,—than in
                    Great Britain; and as a cultivated plant it has three distinct applications. Its
                    roots roasted and ground are used as a substitute for, adulterant of, or
                    addition to coffee; both <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0626-0615"/> roots and leaves are employed as salads; and the
                    plant is .grown as a fodder or herbage crop which is greedily consumed by
                    cattle. In Great Britain it is chiefly in its first capacity, in connection with
                    coffee, that chicory is employed. A large proportion of the chicory root used
                    for this purpose is obtained from Belgium and other neighbouring Continental
                    countries; but a considerable quantity is now cultivated in England, chiefly in
                    Yorkshire. For the preparation of chicory the older stout white roots are
                    selected, and after washing they are sliced up into small pieces and kiln-dried.
                    In this condition the material is sold to the chicory roaster, by whom it is
                    roasted till it assumes a deep brown colour; afterwards when ground it is in
                    external characteristics very like coffee, but is destitute of its pleasing
                    aromatic odour. Neither does the roasted chicory possess any trace of the
                    alkaloid caffeine which gives their peculiar virtues to coffee, tea, and other
                    diet drinks. The fact, however, that for a hundred years it has been
                    successfully used as a substitute for or recognized addition to coffee, while in
                    the meantime innumerable other substances have been tried for the same purpose
                    and abandoned, indicates that it is agreeable or beneficial to some
                    constitutions. It gives the coffee additional colour, bitterness, and body, and

                    blanched, constitute a valued salad, and are also sometimes cooked fresh. It was
                    cultivated and esteemed by the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans.</p>
