                <p><label type="entry">CARRIAGE</label>, a term which in its widest signification
                    includes all structures employed for the purposes of transport of merchandize
                    and movable goods and of human beings. Such vehicles are generally mounted on
                    wheels, but the sledge and the litter are types of the exception to this rule.
                    Carriages, according to the definition above given, includes in these days a
                    vast variety of forms, ranging from the humble wheel-barrow and rude farm-cart
                    up to the luxuriously appointed sleeping-cars of railways, and the state
                    carriages of royal personages. A narrower application, however, limits the term
                    to such vehicles as are used for the conveyance of persons, and it is in this
                    restricted sense that the term is here used. Cars or carriages for use on
                    railways or tramways are also excluded, and will be dealt with in other
                    connections.</p>
                <p>Although, doubtless, the primitive means of transport was by riding on the back
                    of the horse, camel, elephant, or other animal, there is evidence that the use
                    of certain kinds of carriages dates from a very remote antiquity. When Pharaoh
                    advanced Joseph to the second place in Egypt “he made him to ride in the second
                    chariot which he had;” and later, Joseph, by command of the king, sent waggons
                    out of the land of Egypt to convey Jacob and his whole family to the land of his
                    adoption. Thus at this early period there were two distinct types of carriage in
                    use among the civilized inhabitants of Egypt,—a country which from its level
                    character presented facilities for the development of this species of
                    conveyance. The use of chariots in Egypt and among early nations generally was
                    reserved for rulers and warlike leaders.</p>
                <p>It was among the Romans that the use of carriages as a private means of
                    conveyance was first established, and with that people carriages attained great
                    variety of form as well as richness of ornamentation. In all times the
                    employment of carriages depended greatly on the condition of the roads over
                    which they had to be driven, and the establishment of good roads, such as the
                    Appian Way, constructed 331 B.c., and others, greatly facilitated the
                    development of carriage travelling among the Romans. In Rome itself, and
                    probably also in other large towns, it was necessary to restrict travelling in
                    carriages to a few persons of high rank, owing to the narrowness and crowded
                    state of the streets. For the same reason the transport of goods along the
                    streets was forbidden during the ten hours between sunrise and sunset. For long
                    journeys and to convey large parties the <hi rend="italic">reda</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">carruca</hi> appear to have been mostly used, but what their
                    construction and arrangements were is not known. During the empire the carriage
                    which appears in representations of public ceremonials is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >carpentum.</hi> It is very slight, with two wheels, sometimes covered, and
                    generally drawn by two horses. If a carriage had four horses they were yoked
                    abreast, among the Greeks and Romans, not in two pairs as now. From the <hi
                    rend="italic">carruca</hi> are traced the modern European names,—the English <hi
                    rend="italic">carriage,</hi> the French <hi rend="italic">carrosse,</hi> and the
                    Italian <hi rend="italic">carrozza.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">sirpea</hi> was a
                    very ancient form of vehicle, the body of which was of osier basket-work. It
                    originated with the Gauls, by whom it was named <hi rend="italic">benna,</hi>
                    and by them it was employed for the conveyance of persons and goods in time of
                    peace, and baggage during war. With its name are connected the modern French <hi
                    rend="italic">banne, hanneton, vannerie,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >panier,—</hi> all indicating basket-work. The <hi rend="italic">essedum</hi>
                    was a two-wheeled carriage, the form of which the Romans copied from the war
                    cars of the Belgae.</p>
                <p>These various vehicles were sometimes very splendidly ornamented with gold and
                    precious stones; and covered <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0146-0135"/> carriages seem more and more to have become
                    appendages of Roman pomp and magnificence. Sumptuary laws were enacted on
                    account of the public extravagance, but they were little regarded, and were
                    altogether abrogated by the emperor Severus. Suetonius states that Nero took
                    with him on his travels no less than a thousand carriages.</p>
                <p>On the introduction of the feudal system the use of carriages was for some time
                    prohibited, as tending to render the vassals less fit for military service. Men
                    of all grades and professions rode on horses or mules, and sometimes the monks
                    and women on she-asses. Horseback was the general mode of travelling; and hence
                    the members of the council, who at the diet and on other occasions were employed
                    as ambassadors, were called <hi rend="italic">rittmeister.</hi> In this manner
                    also great lords made their public entry into cities.</p>
                <p>Covered carriages were known in the beginning of the 16th century, but their use
                    was confined to ladies of the first rank; and as it was accounted a reproach for
                    men to ride in them, the electors and princes sometimes excused their
                    non-attendance at meetings of the state by the plea that their health would not
                    permit them to ride on horseback. Covered carriages were for a long time
                    forbidden even to women; but about the end of the 15 th century they began to be
                    employed by the emperor, kings, and princes, in journeys, and afterwards on
                    state occasions. In 1474 the Emperor Frederick III. visited Frankfort in a close
                    carriage, and again in the following year in a very magnificent covered
                    carriage. Shortly afterwards carriages began to be splendidly decorated; that,
                    for instance, of the electress of Brandenburg at the tournament held at Ruppin
                    in 1509 was gilded all over, and that of the duchess of Mecklenburg was hung
                    with red satin. When Cardinal Dietrich-stein made his entrance into Vienna in
                    1611, forty carriages went to meet him; and in the same year the consort of the
                    Emperor Matthias made her public entrance on her marriage in a carriage covered
                    with perfumed leather. The wedding carriage of the first wife of the Emperor
                    Leopold, who was a Spanish princess, cost, together with the harness, 38,000
                    florins. Those of the emperor are thus described: “In the imperial coaches no
                    great magnificence was to be seen; they were covered over with red cloth and
                    black nails. The harness was black, and in the whole work there was no gold. The
                    panels were of glass, and on this account they were called the imperial glass
                    coaches. On festivals the harness was ornamented with red silk fringes. The
                    imperial coaches were distinguished only by their having leather traces; but the
                    ladies in the imperial suite were obliged to be contented with carriages the
                    traces of which were made of ropes.” At the magnificent court of Duke Ernest
                    Augustus at Hanover, in 1681, there were fifty gilt coaches with six horses
                    each. The first time that ambassadors appeared in coaches on a public solemnity
                    was at the imperial commission held at Erfurt in 1613. Soon after this time
                    coaches became common all over Germany, notwithstanding various orders and
                    admonitions to deter vassals from using them. These vehicles appear to have been
                    of very rude construction. Beckmann describes a view he had seen of Bremen,
                    painted by John Landwehr in 1661, in which was represented a long quadrangular
                    carriage, apparently not suspended by straps, and covered with a canopy
                    supported by four pillars, but without curtains. In the side was a small door,
                    and in front a low seat or box; the coachman sat upon the horses; and the dress
                    of the persons within proved them to be burgomasters. At Paris in the 14th,
                    15th, and even 16th centuries, the French monarchs rode commonly on horses, the
                    servants of the court on mules, and the princesses and principal ladies
                    sometimes on asses. Persons even of the highest rank sometimes sat behind their
                    equerry on the same horse. Carriages, however, were used at a verv earlv neriod
                    in France: for there is still extant an ordinance of Philip the Fair, issued in
                    1294, by which citizens’ wives are prohibited from using them. It appears,
                    however, that about 1550 there were only three carriages at Paris,—one belonging
                    to the queen, another to Diana of Poitiers, and the third to René de Laval, a
                    very corpulent nobleman who was unable to ride on horseback. The coaches used in
                    the time of Henry IV. were not suspended by straps (an improvement referred to
                    the time of Louis XIV.), though they were provided with a canopy supported by
                    four ornamental pillars, and with curtains of stuff or leather.</p>
                <p>Occasional allusion is made to the use of some kinds of vehicles in England
                    during the Middle Ages. In <hi rend="italic">The Squyr of Low Degree,</hi> a
                    poem of a period anterior to Chaucer, a description of a sumptuous carriage
                    occurs:</p>
                <p>“To-morrow ye shall on hunting fare And ride, my daughter, in a chare. It shall
                    be cover’d with velvet red, And cloth of fine gold all about your head, With
                    damask white and azure blue Well diaper’d with lilies new.”</p>
                <p>Chaucer himself describes a chare as</p>
                <p>“With gold wrought and pierrie.”</p>
                <p>When Richard II. of England, towards the end of the 14th century, was obliged to
                    fly before his rebellious subjects, he and all his followers were on horseback,
                    while his mother alone used a carriage. The oldest carriages used in England
                    were known as chares, cars, chariots, caroches, and whirlicotes; but these
                    became less fashionable when Ann, the wife of Richard IL, showed the English
                    ladies how gracefully she could ride on the side-saddle, Stow, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Survey of London,</hi> remarking, “so was riding in those
                    whirlicotes and chariots forsaken except at coronations and such like
                    spectacles.” The same writer states that in the year 1564 Guilliam Boonen, a
                    Dutchman, became the queen’s coachman, and was the first that brought the use of
                    coaches into England. Although Stow is incorrect in thus attributing the
                    introduction of coaches to the time of Elizabeth, there is no doubt that at the
                    period he indicates, the use of wheeled vehicles began to be so common that it
                    then became a prominent public fact. “Little by little,” he again states, “they
                    became usual among the nobilitie and others of sort, and within twenty years
                    became a great trade of coachmaking.” By the beginning of the 17th century the
                    use of coaches had become so prevalent that in 1601 the attention of Parliament
                    was drawn to the subject, and a Bill “to restrain the excessive use of coaches”
                    was introduced, which, however, was rejected on the second reading. Their use
                    told severely on the occupation of the Thames watermen, and Taylor the poet and
                    waterman complained bitterly both in prose and verse against the new-fangled
                    practice :—</p>
                <p>“Carroach.es, coaches, jades, and Flanders mares Doe rob us of our shares, our
                    wares, our fares. Against the ground we stand and knock our heels, Wnilest all
                    our profit runs away on wheeles.”</p>
                <p>The sneers of wits and watermen notwithstanding, coaches became so common, that
                    in the early part of the 17th century they were estimated to number more than
                    6000 in London and its surrounding country.</p>
                <p>Vehicles plying for public convenience, we have seen, were in existence during
                    the period of the Roman empire, and concurrently with the renewal of carriage
                    locomotion in the 16th century, public carriages were again reestablished.
                    Hackney coaches were first introduced in France during the minority of Louis
                    XIV. by one Nicolas Sauvage, who lived at the sign of Saint Fiacre in the Rue St
                    Martin, and hence hired carriages came to be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >fiacres,</hi> though eventually the name was restricted to such.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n147/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0147-0136"/>
                <p>as were stationed for hire in the streets. In 1650 Charles Villerme obtained the
                    exclusive privilege of hiring out <hi rend="italic">fiacres</hi> in Paris for a
                    payment of 5000 livres. The prototype of the modern omnibus first commenced
                    plying in the streets of Paris on the 18th March 1662, going at fixed hours, at
                    a stated fare of five sous. Soldiers, lackeys, pages, and livery servants were
                    forbidden to enter such conveyances, which were announced to be <hi
                    rend="italic">pour la plus grand</hi><hi rend="italic">commodité et liberté des
                    personnes de</hi><hi rend="italic">merite.</hi> In the time of Charles X. the
                    omnibus system in reality was established; for no exclusion of any class or
                    condition of person who tendered the proper fare was permitted in the vehicles
                    then put on various routes, and the fact of the carriages being thus at the
                    service of all gave rise to the present name.</p>
                <p>Hackney coaches were first established in London in 1625. Writing in 1634 to Lord
                    Stafford, Mr Garrard says,— “Here is one Captain Bailey; he hath been a sea
                    captain, but now lives on the land, about this city, where he tries experiments.
                    He hath erected, according to his ability, some four hackney-coaches, put his
                    men in livery, and appointed them to stand at the May-pole in the Strand, giving
                    them instructions at what rate to carry men into several parts of the town,
                    where all day they may be had. Other hackney-men seeing this way, they flocked
                    to the same place, and perform their journeys at the same rate, so that
                    sometimes there is twenty of them together.”</p>
                <p>In 1637 there were in London and Westminster no f ewer than 50 such coaches; in
                    1652 they had increased to 200, and in 1654 to 300, employing 600 horses. In
                    1694 the number of hackney coaches was limited to 700, and in 1715 to 800. Thus,
                    notwithstanding the competition of sedan chairs, the hackney-coach held its
                    place and grew in importance till it was, about 1820, supplanted by the <hi
                    rend="italic">cabriolet de place,</hi> now shortened into “cab,” which had
                    previously held a most important place in Paris. In that city the cabriolet came
                    into great public favour about the middle of the 18th century, and in the year
                    1813 there were 1150 such vehicles plying in the Parisian streets. The original
                    cabriolet was a kind of hooded gig, inside which the driver sat, besides whom
                    there was only room left for a single passenger. Mr Hansom, the inventor whose
                    name attaches to the London two-wheeled vehicle to the present day, patented his
                    cab first in the year 1834. It consisted originally of a square body hung in the
                    centre of a square frame, the two wheels being about 7 feet 6 inches in
                    diameter, the same height as the vehicle. On this very numerous improvements
                    were quickly made, and in 1836, after a fresh patent had been obtained in name
                    of Messrs Gillett and Chapman, a company was formed for establishing hansom cabs
                    essentially the same as now in use.</p>
                <p>Of coaches possessing a history the two best known in the United Kingdom are Her
                    Majesty’s state coach, and that of the Lord Mayor of London. The latter is the
                    oldest, having been built, or at least first used, for the procession of Sir
                    Charles Asgil, Lord Mayor elect, in November 1757. The body of this wonderful
                    vehicle is not supported by springs, but hung on leather straps; and the whole
                    structure is very richly loaded with ornamental carving, gilding, and paintwork.
                    The different panels and the doors contain various allegorical groups of figures
                    representing suitable subjects and heraldic devices painted in a spirited
                    manner. The royal state coach, which is described as “the most superb carriage
                    ever built,” was designed by Sir William Chambers, the paintings on it were
                    executed by Cipriani, and the work was completed in 1761. The following is an
                    official description of it :—</p>
                <p>“The whole of the carriage and body is richly ornamented with laurel and carved
                    work, beautifully gilt. The length, 24 feet; width, 8 feet 3 inches; height, 12
                    feot; length of pole, 12 feet 4 inches; weight, 4 tons. The carriage and body of
                    the coach is composed as follows :—Of four large Tritons, who support the body
                    by four braces, covered with red morocco leather, and ornamented with gilt
                    buckles, the two figures placed in front of the carriage bear the driver, and
                    are represented in the action of drawing by cables extending round their
                    shoulders, and the cranes and sounding shells to announce the approach of the
                    monarch of the Ocean; and those at the back cany the imperial fasces, topped
                    with tridents. The driver’s foot-board is a large scallop shell, ornamented with
                    bunches of reeds and other marine plants. The pole represents a bundle of
                    lances; the splinter bar is composed of a rich moulding, issuing from beneath a
                    voîuted shell, and each end terminating in the head of a dolphin; and the wheels
                    are imitated from those of the ancient triumphal chariot. The body of the coach
                    is composed of eight palm-trees, which, branching out at the top, sustain the
                    roof; and four angular trees are loaded with trophies allusive to the victories
                    obtained by Great Britain, during the late glorious war, supported by four
                    lions’ heads. On the centre of the roof stand three boys, representing the genii
                    of England, Scotland, and Ireland, supporting the imperial crown of Great
                    Britain, and holding in their hands the sceptre, sword of state, and ensigns of

                    thence towards the four corners. The panels and doors are painted with

                    carriages as now built are so numerous as almost to defy classification, and
                    they altogether baffle detailed description. The climate, conditions of life,
                    and various other circumstances of different countries have originated modified
                    forms of carriage in each of them, some of which have come into general use,
                    while others are seldom seen out of the land of their origin. Mr G. N. Hooper,

                <p>In addition to this list there are numberless forms of fancy carriage, and the
                    misdirected ingenuity of coach-builders is frequently exercised in the attempt
                    to combine the features and advantages of several vehicles in one structure, <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit05newyrich/page/n148/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0905-0148-0137"/> generally with the result of rendering it unfit
                    to be used with comfort or safety in any form.</p>
                <p>In comparing the carriages of the present day with those of earher periods it
                    should be borne in mind that many circumstances apart from the skill and
                    invention of the coach-builder have combined to modify, or to necessitate the
                    modification, of such structures. The condition of streets and roads was such,
                    at no very remote date, as to permit of only the most cautious traffic within
                    limited areas in vehicles of great strength, solidity, and weight. The paving of
                    streets and macadamization of highways gave designers of carriages facilities
                    for planning vehicles of a light, airy type on more elegant lines, of which
                    opportunities they were not slow to take advantage. Again, previous to the
                    introduction of railways, not only public coaches but private carriages had to
                    be built with a view to afford accommodation for undertaking long journeys,
                    which are now entirely performed by railway, and that circumstance also now
                    enables the coach-builder to give primary attention to the comfort,
                    gracefulness, and elegance of the vehicles he constructs. But after allowance is
                    made for all such circumstances, there remains to coach-builders, and especially
                    to those of Great Britain, a very large share of credit, for the inventive skill
                    and ingenuity which has brought the modern carriage to that perfection of
                    workmanship and artistic finish which it everywhere displays. To enumerate the
                    improvements in coach-building, which have been effected chiefly in the present
                    century, would demand a much greater space than can be devoted to this subject.
                    It must suffice simply to point to the Collinge axle invented in 1792, now
                    universally adopted, by means of which wheels require oiling only once in
                    several months. The elliptic springs, upon which nearly all carriages are
                    now-mounted, were patented by Obadiah Elliott in 1804. A great many ingenious
                    devices have also been adopted for facilitating the opening and closing of the
                    head of landaus or such carriages as are made to be open or close at pleasure.
                    And generally coach-building has enjoyed a full share of the advantages flowing
                    from the improved mechanical devices and processes of modern times.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Coachmakvng.</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> Coachmaking is a
                    combination of crafts rarely united in one trade, embracing, as it does, work in
                    such diverse materials as wood, iron, steel, brass, cloth, leather, ivory, hair,
                    &amp;c. A great division of labour and numerous highly skilled artizans are
                    consequently employed in the various stages in the construction of a high-class
                    carriage. The workmen include body-makers, who build up the part in which
                    persons sit; carriage makers, who make or fit together all the under parts of
                    the vehicle on which the body rests; wheel-wrights, joiners, and fitters;
                    trimmers, who fit up the inside of the carriage; and several classes of smiths
                    for special work connected with the iron framing, axles, springs, &amp;c.
                    Painting is an important part of the business, those professing it being divided
                    into body, carriage, and heraldry or ornamental painters; and after the painter
                    comes the polisher who gives the final brilliant polish to the outside of the
                    whole structure.</p>
                <p>A very great deal in the coach-making business depends on the selection of
                    materials. Ash is the kind of wood commonly used in the framework both of body
                    and carriage; and the quality best suited for body-wood is that of a mild and
                    free nature, while for the carriage the wood cannot be too strong or robust.
                    Full-grown wood, of course, is best suited for both purposes^ and the planks
                    must be allowed to lie until they are properly seasoned, as is indeed most
                    essential with all the wood used in the building of a carriage. After the
                    framework is made, the lower part of the body is panelled up with the softest
                    bay mahogany, plain and free from grain. The kinds of wood generally applied to
                    coach-wheel making are elm or fustic for the naves, oak for the spokes, and ash
                    for the felloes; but beech felloes are often used, and it has been found by
                    experience that beech, when the felloes are cut from the log shortly after it is
                    felled, and kept until they become dry before being put upon wheels, answers
                    admirably for this purpose. American hickory is also one of the best available
                    woods for spokes as well as carriage poles; and a large trade is now conducted
                    between Great Britain and the United States in the importation of American
                    machine-made hickory wheels. Canadian black walnut has also come into use as a
                    substitute for mahogany in panelling, and many other woods are available for
                    special portions of carriages.</p>
                <p>Formerly, in the making of coach-springs, nothing was used but German steel,
                    which from its hardness was more apt to snap than the English steel now employed
                    for that purpose. The latter combines with superior elasticity a strength that
                    enables the spring-maker to fabricate his springs at least one-third lighter,
                    while they stand equal fatigue. The iron mounting of coach-work requires the
                    skill of experienced smiths; for, besides solidity, some degree of taste is
                    requisite to form the shapes and sets of the different parts. No branch of
                    coach-making contributes more to the elegance of the vehicle than that of the
                    painter His colours must be of the best quality in order to stand exposure in
                    all weathers. The varnish used is copal, of which there are two kinds,—the
                    finest for finishing the body, and the second for finishing the carriage.
                    Between paints of different qualities and varnish, a well-finished carriage gets
                    from twenty to twenty-four separate coats before it is finished. Between each
                    coating of varnish colour and varnish the work is carefully rubbed smooth and
                    flat with pumice or fine glass paper, and the final polish is attained by
                    rubbing with the palm of the hand.</p>
                <p>The growth and development of railway travelling, instead of checking the use of
                    horse-drawn vehicles, or injuring the art of the coach-builder, has had a very
                    powerful influence in the opposite direction. Railway travelling has caused an
                    enormous increase in the use of cabs and other public vehicles, while increasing
                    wealth has multiplied luxurious private carriages. The revival of the driving of
                    four-horse drags, in imitation of the old stage coaches, between London and
                    various suburban towns (one going to Brighton), which has taken place of late
                    years, is deserving of note. These coaches were put on the road by members of
                    several aristocratic clubs, not with a view to profit; their success, however,
                    has been very great.</p>
                <p>As a coach-making and coaching country, England has long held the foremost place.
                    “The road,” its coaches, and their drivers figure largely in the popular
                    literature of the country, and the perfection of coach equipment has been an
                    unfailing source of national pride. British coachbuilders still continue to
                    hold, almost without dispute, the highest position in their craft; and that
                    expensive luxury— a first-class London-built carriage—cannot, for honest
                    workmanship, handsome lines, and beautiful finish, be excelled by any product of
                    industry. (j. <hi rend="smallcaps">pa.)</hi></p>
