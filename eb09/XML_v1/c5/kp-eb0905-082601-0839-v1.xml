                <p><label type="entry">CLEOPATRA</label> (Κλεοπάτρα), the name of several Egyptian
                    princesses of the house of the Ptolemies. The best known was the daughter of
                    Ptolemy Auletes, born 69 B.c. Her father left her, at the age of seventeen, heir
                    to his kingdom jointly with her younger brother Ptolemy, whose wife, in
                    accordance with Egyptian custom, she was to become. A few years afterwards her
                    brother, or rather her guardians, deprived her of all royal authority. She
                    withdrew into Syria, and there made preparation to recover her rights by force
                    of arms. It was at this juncture that Julius Caesar followed Pompey into Egypt,
                    resolved to settle there, if possible, the existing dispute as to the throne.
                    The personal fascinations of Cleopatra, which she was not slow in bringing to
                    bear upon him, soon won him entirely to her side; and as Ptolemy and his
                    advisers still refused to admit her to a share in the kingdom, Caesar undertook
                    a war on her behalf, in which Ptolemy lost his life, and she was replaced on the
                    throne in conjunction with a younger brother, to whom she was also contracted in
                    marriage. Her relations with Caesar were matter of public notoriety, and soon
                    after his return to Rome she joined him there, in company with her boy-husband
                    (of whom, however, she soon rid herself by poison), but living openly with her
                    Roman lover, somewhat to the scandal of his fellow·citizens. After Caesar’s
                    assassination, aware of her unpopularity, she returned at once to her native
                    country. But subsequently, during the civil troubles at Rome, she took the part
                    of Antony, on whom she is said to have already made some impression in her
                    earlier years, when he was campaigning in Egypt. When he was in Cilicia, she
                    made a purpose journey to visit him, sailing up the Cydnus in a
                    gorgeously-decked galley, arrayed in all the attractive splendour which Eastern
                    magnificence could bring in aid of her personal charms. Antonybecame from that
                    time forth her infatuated slave, followed her to Egypt, and lived with her there
                    for some time in the most profuse and wanton luxury. They called themselves
                    “Osiris” and “Isis,” and claimed to be regarded as divinities. His marriage with
                    Octavia broke this connection for a while, but it was soon renewed, and
                    Cleopatra assisted him in his future campaigns both with money and supplies.
                    This infatuation of his rival with a personage already so unpopular at Rome as
                    Cleopatra, was taken advantage of by Octavianus Caesar (Augustus), who declared
                    war against her personally. In the famous sea-fight at Actium, between the
                    fleets of Octavianus and Antony, Cleopatra, who had accompanied him into action
                    with an Egyptian squadron, took to flight while the issue was yet doubtful, and
                    though hotly pursued by the enemy succeeded in escaping to Alexandria, where she
                    was soon joined by her devoted lover. When the cause of Antony was irretrievably
                    ruined, and all her attempts to strengthen herself against the Roman conqueror
                    by means of foreign alliances had failed, she made overtures of submission.
                    Octavianus suggested to her, as a way to his favour, the assassination of his
                    enemy Antony. She seems to have entertained the base proposal,—enticing him to
                    join her in a mausoleum which she had built, in order that “they might die
                    together,” and where he fulfilled his part of the compact by committing suicide,
                    in the belief that she had already done so. The charms which had succeeded so
                    easily with Julius and with Antony failed to move the younger Caesar, though he
                    at once granted her an interview; and rather than submit to be carried by him as
                    a prisoner to Rome, she put an end to her life—by applying an asp to her bosom,
                    according to the common version of the story— in the thirty-ninth year of her
                    age. With her ended the dynasty of the Ptolemies in Egypt. Besides her
                    remarkable charms of person, she had very considerable abilities, and unusual
                    literary tastes. She is said to have been able to converse in seven languages.
                    She had three children by Antony, and, as some say, a son, called Caesarion, by
                    Julius Caesar. (w. L. c.)</p>
