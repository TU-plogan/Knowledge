                <p><label type="entry">CASHEL</label>, an inland city of Ireland, in the county of
                    Tipperary, 108 miles south-west from Dublin, and within 5 miles of the Great
                    Southern and Western Railway. The town, which lies at the base of the Rock of
                    Cashel, consists for the most part of a wide and well-built main street, and
                    contains several public buildings, such as a court-house, a market-house, a
                    fever hospital, barracks, and an infirmary. There are also the new cathedral,
                    the deanery house (once the bishop’s palace), and a Roman Catholic church, while
                    immediately outside the town there is the union workhouse. Formerly an
                    archiépiscopal see, Cashel was reduced in 1833 to a bishopric, but the bishop
                    does not now reside there. The town’s revenue is derived from landed estates in
                    the neighbourhood, the gift of Bishop Maurianus. It formerly returned one member
                    to Parliament, but was disfranchised in 1870. Population in 1851, 4798, and in
                    1871, 4562.</p>
                <p>The Rock of Cashel is the object of chief interest in the place. This elevation
                    of limestone formation rises abruptly from the plain to a height of about 300
                    feet, and is a commanding object for many miles around. Its summit is occupied
                    by the most interesting assemblage of ruins in Ireland, consisting of the
                    remains of St Patrick’s Cathedral, a round tower, Cormack’s Chapel, and an
                    ancient cross. The chapel, which is said to have been erected by King Cormack
                    Μ‘Car thy in the 12th century, is considered to be the oldest stone edifice in
                    the country. In its style it combines the high stone roof with the richest
                    Norman decoration. The cathedral is cruciform in its design, and contains many
                    interesting sculptures and tombs. In the adjoining cemetery there stands, on a
                    rude pedestal, the “Cross of Cashel,” with an effigy of St Patrick sculptured on
                    its side. The round tower, situated at the north-east angle of the cathedral,
                    rises about 90 feet, with a circumference of 58 feet, and unlike the
                    neighbouring ruins has been built not of the limestone of the “Rock” but of
                    freestone.</p>
                <p>The history of Cashel belongs to the early period of Irish chronology. A
                    stronghold in the time of Brian Boroimhe it afterwards became noteworthy as the
                    place where Henry II. received the homage of O’Brien, king of Limerick, and
                    still later, where Edward Bruce held his Irish parliament. The cathedral was
                    burnt in 1495 by the earl of Kildare. Two other interesting ruins exist at the
                    base of the Rock, viz., Horn Abbey, founded in the 13th century, and the
                    Dominican Priory, belonging to the same period.</p>
