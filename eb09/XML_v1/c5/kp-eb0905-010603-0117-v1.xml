                    or <hi rend="italic">Kamthen),</hi> a duchy, and since 1849 a crown-land of
                    Austria, is bounded on the E. by Styria, on the N. by Styria and Salzburg, on
                    the W. by Tyrol, and on the S. by Italy, Görtz, and Carniola. It has an area of
                    4006 English square miles, and the population in 1869 amounted to 336,400. The
                    surface is for the most part mountainous, being occupied in the north by part of
                    the Norian Alps, and in the south oy those named the Carinthian Mountains, or
                    the Karawanken. The principal river is the Drave, which flows from W. to E.
                    through the length of the duchy, and receives in its course the waters of all
                    the other streams, except the Fella, which reaches the Adriatic by junction with
                    the Tagliamento. In its eastern half, the valley opens out into a considerable
                    plain, which cpntains the important lakes of the Wörthersee and the
                    Ossiachersee. According to official statistics, 337,246 acres of arable land
                    were in cultivation in 1870; 280,581 acres were occupied by gardens and meadows,
                    593,040 by pasture, and 1,033,807 were under wood. In the same year there were
                    in the duchy 22,979 horses, 232,791 head of cattle, 176,832 sheep, and 36,630
                    goats, while the bee-stocks amounted to 62,615. The mineral produce consisted of
                    145,940 tons of iron ore, 5,047 of lead ore, 71,264 of coal, 4,220 of zinc ore,
                    and nearly 26 of graphite. The duchy is divided into the seven districts of
                    Hermagor, Klagenfurt, Spittal, St Veit, Villach, Völkermarkt, and Wolfsberg,—the
                    capital Klagenfurt forming an independent and eighth division. There are in all
                    ten towns, twenty-eight market villages, and 2,911 hamlets,—the most populous
                    places, besides the chief towns of the districts, being Bleiberg, Friesach, and
                    Feldkirchen. With the exception of 19,000 Lutherans, the inhabitants are Roman
                    Catholics; and more than two-thirds of them are of German race. The rest are of
                    Slavonic origin, and for the most part occupy the districts conterminous with
                    Carniola and Styria, though a considerable Slavonic enclave is situated in the
                    heart of the German area between Malborget and Tarvis. German is used in 255 of
                    the village schools, and Slavonic in 24, while both are employed in 70. The
                    Carinthian diet consists, according to the law of 1861, of thirty-seven members,
                    including, besides the bishop of Gurk, ten appointed by the landed proprietors,
                    seven by the towns, fourteen by the rural communes, and three by the commercial
                    authorities at Klagenfurt. Five members are sent to the imperial diet.</p>
                <p>Carinthia is so called from the Carni, a Celtic people who have perhaps also left
                    their name to the neighbouring district of Carniola; and in the time of Augustus
                    it formed part of Noricum. After the fall of the Roman empire, it was the
                    nucleus of the kingdom of Carentania, which was founded by Sarno, a Frankish
                    adventurer, but soon fell to pieces after his death. Under Charlemagne it
                    constituted a margravate, which in 843 passed into the hands of Louis the
                    German, whose grandson Amulf was the first to bear the title of Duke of
                    Carinthia. The duchy was held by various families during the llth, 12th, and
                    13th centuries, and at length in 1335 was bestowed by Louis the Bavarian on the
                    Dukes of Austria. It was divided into Upper or Western Carinthia and Lower or
                    Eastern; of these the former fell to France in 1809, but was reconquered in
                    1813, and joined in 1814 to the kingdom of Illyria. See <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>C ARI PE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Caribe,</hi> a town of Venezuela, in the state
                    of Cumana, and about 40 miles from the city of that name, in 10° 10' 14'' N.
                    lat. and 28° 33' 54" W. long. It is the chief station of the mission to the
                    Chayma Indians, and is famous for the extensive system of caves in the limestone
                    rock in the neighbourhood, which have been described by Humboldt. These extend
                    inwards a distance of 2800 feet, and have a height of 70 or 80 feet. They are
                    frequented by a species of night hawk, which builds in the recesses of the
                    rocks. The young are killed in great numbers for the sake of their oil. The
                    population of the town and valley is estimated at 5000.</p>
