                    celebrated American politician, born near Richmond, in Virginia, on the 12th
                    April 1777, was the son of a Baptist minister, who died when Henry was only five
                    years old. His youth was consequently spent in some hardship, and for a time he
                    worked on a farm; but at the age of fifteen he obtained a situation in the
                    office of the clerk of the Court of Chancery. Having gained some influential
                    friends, he began in 1796 to study law under Robert Brooke, the
                    attorney-general. In 1797 he was admitted to the bar, and in the end of that

                    power of influencing a jury soon brought him a flourishing practice; and having
                    taken a prominent part in the discussions as to the constitution which was drawn
                    up for the State of Kentucky, he was in 1803 chosen member of the Legislature of
                    that State. Three years later he became for a few months member of the Senate of
                    the United States. In the next year he again took his seat in the Legislature of
                    Kentucky, of which in 1808 he was appointed speaker. It was during this session
                    that he challenged a fellow-member, who had attacked him warmly in debate. The
                    meeting took place; two shots were fired, and both parties were slightly
                    wounded. In 1811 he became at once member for the first time and speaker of the
                    House of Congress, and he subsequently held the latter position four times. All
                    his energies were now devoted to bringing about a declaration of war with Great
                    Britain, and maintaining the contest with all the vigour possible. At the end of
                    the war (1814) he was appointed one of the commissioners who was sent to Ghent
                    to conclude the treaty of peace, and it was he who caused the erasure of the
                    clause allowing Great Britain to navigate the Mississippi. During his visit to
                    Europe he spent two months at Paris, enjoying the society of which Mme. de Staël
                    was the queen. On his return to America he was again made speaker of Congress.
                    In 1824 he allowed himself to be nominated for the office of president; but the
                    election did not give to any one the required majority, and the decision between
                    the three who had obtained the greatest number of votes had to be made by
                    Congress. Clay, who had been fourth on the list, gave his support to Quincy
                    Adams, whence arose his second duel, that with John Randolph, in which neither
                    was hurt Under Adams Clay accepted the post of secretary of state. In 1832 he
                    was again candidate for the presidency, and again unsuccessfully; and in 1844 ho
                    was nominated for the third time with a similar result. He now retired from
                    public life; but in 1848 he was again called into the Senate; and in 1850 he
                    carried a bill, which sought to avert the great battle on the slavery question.
                    In 1851, however, the weakness of his health prevented him from taking any part
                    in public life; and on the 29th July of the next year he died. On receiving the
                    news of his death Congress adjourned; next day orations in his praise were
                    delivered in both houses; and the day of his funeral was observed in New York
                    and in all the chief towns of the State to which he belonged.</p>
                <p>Henry Clay commenced his political career in 1799 by attempting to persuade the
                    State of Virginia to abolish slavery. He never, however, made any attempt to
                    free the whole country from the system; indeed the effect of his policy (and the
                    most important of his measures were those concerning slavery) was to maintain
                    it. His name is connected with the “Missouri Compromise,” which, while
                    abolishing slavery in all other States north of lat. 36° 30', permitted it in
                    Missouri, and with several other measures sanctioning slavery in the slave
                    States. His bill of 1850, nicknamed the “omnibus bill,” provided that New Mexico
                    and Utah, the States newly acquired from Mexico, should be left to their own
                    discretion as to slavery, and that California should be received into the Union
                    as a slave State; while, on the other hand, slavery should be prohibited in
                    Columbia. Another most important feature of Clay’s policy was the desire to free
                    America from European control, which led him to advocate, in some of lιis most
                    powerful speeches, the recognition of the independence of the South American
                    republics which had revolted from Spain. The part he took in the war with
                    England has been already noticed. His action with regard to the tariff was not
                    uniform; in 1832 he proposed to reduce gradually a large number of duties, but
                    afterwards he more than once sought to make it more protective. Though first
                    opposed to the establishment of a national bank, he subsequently spoke
                    vigorously in its favour. For some time he was president of the Colonization
                    Society. See the edition of his speeches and writings, with a life by Calvin
                    Colton (1857 and 1864).</p>
