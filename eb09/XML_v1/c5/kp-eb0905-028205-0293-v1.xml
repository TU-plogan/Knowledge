                    Salisbury</hi></label> (1550-1612), was the son of Lord Burghley, whose
                    character and ability he inherited, and by whom he was carefully educated for
                    political life. After residing at Cambridge and representing Westminster in
                    parliament, he received a post in the French embassy, and was next made
                    Secretary of State under Walsingham. He was also appointed Chancellor of the
                    Duchy of Lancaster, and Lord Privy Seal, and he succeeded his father as Master
                    of the Court of Wards and Walsingham as chief Secretary of State. It is
                    noteworthy that, though his health was delicate and his person deformed, he
                    served as a volunteer against the Armada. His career was simply a continuation
                    of his father’s. He toiled as laboriously and as carefully, and carried out the
                    same system of espionage with equal success. The interest which he took in the
                    domestic affairs of the country and in the state of <pb break="no"

                    foreign diplomacy was the same,—to prevent Spain from gaining a mastery which
                    would be fatal to England. But he followed the wisdom of his father too well;
                    his policy was wanting in originality and depth of insight; and he has left no
                    mark upon history.</p>
                <p>During the reign of the queen he had entered into correspondence with James, upon
                    whose accession he was reappointed to the post of Secretary of State and was
                    raised, in successive years, to the dignities of baron of Essenden, Viscount
                    Cranborne, and earl of Salisbury. In 1608, on the death of the earl of Dorset,
                    he added the office of Lord High Treasurer to that of Secretary. Thus he was now
                    at once chief adviser of the king as to home and foreign affairs, mediator
                    between him and the parliament, and also the responsible manager of the finances
                    of the kingdom. In the last capacity his work was by no means easy. It was vain
                    to hope to moderate the royal extravagance; his attempt to obtain from the
                    Commons an increase of £200,000 to the royal income was unsuccessful; and the
                    chief financial measure which he carried out was an addition to the duties on
                    imports. As Secretary, Cecil followed his father’s example with regard to the
                    Catholics, and wrote a <hi rend="italic">Treatise against the Papists.</hi> His
                    opposition to the growth of Spanish power was consistent, though he accepted a
                    pension from the Spanish king, and refused to unite with France and the United
                    Provinces to effect its utter overthrow.</p>
                <p>Cecil has been much blamed for his conduct towards three of the greatest of his
                    contemporaries. Of his cousin, Francis Bacon, he appears to have been jealous;
                    in the noble qualities of the earl of Essex he saw nothing but a dangerous
                    hotheadedness; and probably his opinion was similar about Raleigh, who, though
                    more of a politician, was usually as little inclined to be cautious or
                    conciliatory. But all this argues no extraordinary baseness; he was merely
                    wanting, by nature and through education, in breadth of sympathy. The assertion
                    that he was the sole cause of all Raleigh’s troubles is unfounded, and is,
                    indeed, contradicted by two facts :—first, that on his trial Cecil more than
                    once insisted that he should meet with all consideration, and should be allowed
                    to urge all he could in his own defence; and, secondly, that it was after
                    Cecil’s death that the bitterest feeling against him was displayed, and that he
                    was offered as a sacrifice to Spain. Besides his <hi rend="italic">Treatise
                    against the Papists,</hi> Cecil published an interesting work on <hi
                    rend="italic">The State and Dignity of a Secretary of State.</hi> His
                    correspondence with James I. was published by Lord Hailes in 1766.</p>
