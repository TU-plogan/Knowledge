                    <hi rend="italic">Holomauc),</hi> the second city and the ecclesiastical
                    metropolis of Moravia, and one of the strongest fortresses in the Austrian
                    empire, is situated on the March, about 110 miles to the north of Vienna. Like
                    most Slavonic towns, it contains several large squares, the chief of which is
                    adorned with a trinity column, 115 feet high. The most prominent church is the
                    cathedral, a Gothic building of the 14th century, containing the tomb of King
                    Wenceslaus III., who was murdered here in 1306. The principal secular buildings
                    are the archbishop’s palace, the town-house, the arsenal, the barracks, and the
                    various schools, convents, and hospitals. The old university is now represented
                    by a theological faculty attended by about a hundred students. Its library
                    formerly possessed an important collection of Slavonic works, which was carried
                    off by the Swedes during the Thirty Years’ War. There is also an industrial
                    museum. The manufactures of Olmütz itself are comparatively insignificant, but
                    it is important as the emporium of a busy mining and industrial district and as
                    a mart for Russian and Moldavian cattle. The population in 1880 was 20,176,
                    besides which there is a garrison of about 6000 men. German is the predominant
                    language. The chief part of the fortifications, which were originally
                    constructed in the time of the wars with Frederick the Great, consists of a
                    girdle of about twenty outlying forts. In case of attack the adjacent district
                    can be flooded with the water of the March.</p>
                <p>Olmütz is said to occupy the site of a Roman fort founded in the imperial period,
                    the original name of which, <hi rend="italic">Mons</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Julii,</hi> has been gradually corrupted to the present form. At a later period
                    Olmütz was long the capital of the Slavonic kingdom of Moravia, but it ceded
                    that position to Brünn in 1640. During the Thirty Years’ War it was occupied by
                    the Swedes for eight years, and in 1758 it successfully resisted Frederick the
                    Great during a siege of seven weeks. In 1848 Olmütz was the scene of the emperor
