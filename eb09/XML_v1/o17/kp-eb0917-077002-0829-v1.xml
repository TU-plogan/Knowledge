                <p><label type="entry">OLYMPUS</label>, the name of many mountains in Greece and
                    Asia Minor, and of the fabled home of the gods, and also a city name and a
                    personal name.</p>
                <p>I. Of the mountains bearing the name the most famous is the lofty ridge on the
                    borders of Thessaly and Macedonia. The river Peneus, which drains Thessaly,
                    finds its way to the sea through the great gorge of Tempe, which is close below
                    the south-eastern end of Olympus and separates it from Mount Ossa. The highest
                    peak of Olympus is over 9000 feet high; it is covered with snow for great part
                    of the year. Olympus is a mountain of massive appearance, in many places rising
                    in tremendous precipices broken by vast ravines, above which is the broad
                    summit. The lower parts are densely wooded; the summit is naked rock. Homer
                    calls the mountain &lt;xγcivvt&lt;∕&gt;os, ∕xακp0s, τroλυδeιpαs; the epithets
                    vιφoeis, ττoλυδevδpos, <hi rend="italic">frondosus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >opacus</hi> are used by other poets. The modern name is Ελυ∕χτro, a dialectic
                    form of the ancient word.</p>
                <p>The peak of Mount Lycaeus in the south-west of Arcadia was called Olympus. East
                    of Olympia, on the north bank of the Alpheus, was a hill bearing this name;
                    beside Sellasia in Laconia another. The name was even commoner in Asia Minor: a
                    lofty chain in Mysia (Keshish Dagh), a ridge east of Smyrna (Nif Dagh), other
                    mountains in Lycia, in Galatia, in Cilicia, in Cyprus, &lt;kc., were all called
                    Olympus.</p>
                <p>II. A lofty peak, rising high above the clouds of the lower atmosphere into the
                    clear ether, seemed to be the chosen seat of the deity. Homer distinguishes
                    between Olympus, which is the mountain, and the heaven or ether; but later poets
                    use the terms as practically equivalent. In the elaborate mythology of Greek
                    literature Olympus was the common home of the multitude of gods. Each deity had
                    his special haunts, but all had a residence at the court of Zeus on Olympus;
                    here were held the assemblies and the common feasts of the gods.</p>
                <p>III. There was a city in Lycia named Olympus; it was a bishopric in the Byzantine
                    time.</p>
                <p>IV. A semi-historical musician, named Olympus, was connected with the development
                    of flute music about 700 B.c. It is probable that he introduced the double
                    flute, and increased the number of holes in the instrument and the tones of
                    which it was capable: on the right flute were three holes for the low notes, on
                    the left four for the high notes. He also brought into use compositions for the
                    flute without words (κpoυ∕χατα). It is said that he was an elegiac poet, but
                    this is apparently a misconception. It is difficult to say whether Olympus is an
                    actual historical person, or whether he merely represents in an individualized
                    form the influence which Phrygian music, used in the Phrygian religion, began to
                    exert on the Ionian cities about 700 B.c. The growth of intercourse between
                    Phrygia and Ionia at this time is certain (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
