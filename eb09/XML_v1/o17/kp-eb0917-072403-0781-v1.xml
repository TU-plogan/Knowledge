                    Slavonic, <hi rend="italic">Vjodr),</hi> one of the principal rivers of Germany,
                    rises on the Odergebirge in the Moravian tableland, in 49° 43' N. lat. and 17°
                    35' E. long., at a height of 1950 feet above the sea, and 14 miles to the east
                    of Olmiitz. It is 550 miles long from its source to its mouth in the Baltic Sea,
                    and drains an area of about 50,000 square miles. The first 45 miles of its
                    course lie within Moravia; for the next 15 it forms the frontier between
                    Prussian and Austrian Silesia; while the remaining 490 miles belong to Prussia,
                    where it traverses the provinces of Silesia, Brandenburg, and Pomerania. It
                    flows at first towards the south-east, but on quitting Austria turns towards the
                    north-west, maintaining this direction as far as Frankfort, beyond which its
                    general course is nearly due north. As far as the frontier the Oder flows
                    through a well-defined valley, but, after passing through the gap between the
                    Moravian mountains and the Carpathians and entering the Silesian plain, its
                    valley is wide and shallow and its banks generally low. In its lower course it
                    is divided into numerous branches, forming a large quantity of islands. The main
                    channel follows the left side of the valley and finally expands into the
                    Pommersche or Stettiner Haff, which is connected with the sea by three arms, the
                    Peene, the Swine, and the Dievenow, forming the islands of Usedom and Wollin.
                    The Swine, in the middle, is the main channel for navigation. The chief
                    tributaries of the Oder on the left bank are the Oppa, Glatz Neisse, Katzbach,
                    Bober, and Lausitz Neisse; on the right bank the Malapane, Bartsch, Faule Obra,
                    and Warthe. Of these the only one of importance for navigation is the Warthe,
                    which through the Netze is brought into communication with the Vistula. The Oder
                    is also connected by canals with the Havel and the Spree. The most important
                    towns on its banks are Ratibor, Oppeln, Brieg, Breslau, Glogau, Frankfort,
                    Cüstrin, and Stettin, with the seaport of Swinemünde at its mouth. Glogau and
                    Cüstrin are strongly fortified, and Swinemünde is also defended by a few
                    forts.</p>
                <p>The navigation of the Oder is rendered somewhat difficult by the rapid fall of
                    its upper course, amounting above Brieg to 2 feet per mile, and by the enormous
                    quantities of débris brought into it by its numerous mountain tributaries. The
                    German authorities, however, have been unwearied in their efforts to improve the
                    channel, and have now succeeded in securing a minimum depth of 3 feet at low
                    water throughout almost the whole of the Prussian part of the river. Their most
                    important undertaking was the diversion of the river into a new and straight
                    channel in the Oderbruch below Frankfort, by which an extensive detour was cut
                    off and a large tract of swampy country brought under cultivation. The Oder at
                    present begins to be navigable for barges at Ratibor, where it is about 100 feet
                    wide, but the navigable channel will probably soon extend upwards to Oderberg.
                    Sea-going vessels cannot go beyond Stettin. A second Oder-Spree canal, leaving
                    the Oder opposite the mouth of the Warthe and joining the Spree near Berlin, has
                    been determined on; and a canal connecting the Oder and the Danube has also been
                    planned. The traffic on the Oder, which is steadily increasing, is mainly
                    concerned with agricultural produce and timber. Some idea of its extent may be
                    gathered from the fact that 280 riversteamers and 2800 other vessels passed
                    through the Oderbruch (up and down) in 1881 with cargoes amounting in all to
                    166,500 tons. The river is here about 750 feet wide and 8 feet deep. The fishing
                    is important, particularly in the neighbourhood of Stettin.</p>
