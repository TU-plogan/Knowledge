                <p><label type="entry">VORONEZH</label>, a government of southern Russia, is bounded
                    by Tamboff on the N., Saratoff and the Don Cossacks on the E., Kharkoff on the
                    S., and Kursk and Orel on the W., and has an area of 25,448 square miles. It
                    occupies the southern slopes of the Middle-Russian plateau, and its average
                    elevation is from 450 to 700 feet above sea-level. The surface is hilly, and
                    broken by ravines in the west (where two ranges of chalk hills separated by a
                    broad valley run north and south), but flat and low to the east of the Don.
                    Devonian sandstones crop out in the north, but farther south these are covered
                    with chalk. Glacial clays with northern erratics spread as far south as
                    Voronezh, and extensive areas are covered with Lacustrine clays and sands. The
                    soil is very fertile, owing to the large prevalence of the black earth; it
                    becomes, however, sandy towards the east. Voronezh lies on the border between
                    the forest and meadow-region of Middle Russia and the southern steppes; the
                    forests rapidly disappear as one advances south, and those which in the time of
                    Peter the Great still covered the upper parts of the tributaries of the Don, and
                    were used for shipbuilding, are now almost entirely destroyed. Less <pb

                    and both timber and firewood have to be imported.</p>
                <p>The Don traverses Voronezh from north to south-east, watering it for more than
                    400 miles; it is an important channel for the export of corn, tallow, and other
                    raw produce, as well as for the import of wood, floated from the north. Its
                    tributary the Voronezh is also navigated, and another large tributary, the
                    Vorona, flows through the eastern part of the government. Many other small
                    streams flowing into the Don intersect the territory, but the influence of the
                    dry steppes begins to make itself felt; there are no lakes, and marshes persist
                    only in the valleys. The climate is therefore continental, and, although the
                    mean temperature at Voronezh is 42°∙7 F., that of January is as low as 8° ∙3 and
                    that of July as high as 74° ∙2.</p>
                <p>The population is steadily increasing, and reached 2,532,840 in 1883 as against
                    1,974,400 in 1860. It is Little Russian in the south-west (from 35 to 40 per
                    cent., according to different estimates), and Great Russian elsewhere. There are
                    also a few German colonies with some 3500 inhabitants, and a few Poles
                    (2000).</p>
                <p>Agriculture is the chief occupation, and corn is exported to a considerable
                    amount. The average crops from 1883 to 1885 reached 3,467,800 quarters of rye,
                    901,600 of wheat, 958,000 of oats, 1,680,000 of various grains, and 960,100 of
                    potatoes. 17,000 acres were under beet (176,000 cwts. in 1885); tobacco is also
                    largely cultivated, and the crop of 1885 yielded 1,723,000 1b. The sunflower has
                    also been much cultivated of late for oil. The Voronezh horses enjoy a high
                    reputation in Russia, as also do its cattle, and cattle-breeding has advanced
                    during the last thirty years. In 1883 there were 535,500 horses, 649,100 cattle,
                    and 1,348,100 sheep. Bees are kept in many villages, and honey is gathered to
                    the annual amount of more than 10,000 cwts. Market-gardening and fishing are
                    also of importance. The manufactures are of recent growth; the production
                    reached £2,066,000 in 1884, the chief products being spirits, oil, sugar,
                    woollens, and tallow. Wheat and other grains, flour, flax, tallow and hides,
                    wool, and cattle are the chief items of export.</p>
                <p>Voronezh is divided into twelve districts, the chief towns of which are Voronezh
                    (56,185 inhabitants in 1885), Biryutch (4435), Bobroff (3660), Bogutchary
                    (4230), Korotoyak (1840), Nijne-Dyevitsk (2635), Novokhopersk (8015),
                    Ostrogozhsk (8610), Pavlovsk (8390), Valuiki (4425), Zadonsk, with a great
                    monastery (9940), and Zem-lyansk (3870). These are mostly mere administrative
                    centres; and several villages, such as Buturlinovka (21,700), Kałatch (13,000),
                    and Vorontsovka (12,000), have larger populations and more commerce.</p>
