                <p><label type="entry">VANINI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Lucilio</hi></label>
                    (1585-1619), philosopher, was born at Taurisano, near Naples, in 1585. He
                    studied philosophy and theology at Rome, and after his return to Naples applied
                    himself to the physical studies which had come into vogue with the Renaissance.
                    Though unmethodically cultivated and destitute of definite results, physical
                    science powerfully affected men’s imaginations in this transition period between
                    the break-up of scholasticism and the rise of modern thought, and exercised an
                    important influence upon philosophy. Giordano Bruno is perhaps the most striking
                    instance of this, and Vanini in some respects resembles Bruno, though much his
                    inferior both intellectually and morally. Both represent the spirit of revolt
                    against the old, the ferment and unrest of the 16th century. Vanini resembles
                    Bruno, not only in his wandering life, but also in his anti-Christian bias, and
                    in the tragic death which he suffered at the hands of the constituted
                    authorities. From Naples Vanini proceeded to Padua, where he came under the
                    influence of Pomponatius, whom he styles his divine master. Pomponatius belonged
                    to the Alexandrist school of Aristotelians, and denied the immortality of the
                    soul. Vanini speaks of Aristotle as “the god of philosophers, the dictator of
                    human nature, and the sovereign pontiff of the sages,” but gives the same
                    naturalistic turn to the Aristotelian doctrine. At Padua, where he appears to
                    have remained for several years, Vanini added law to his other acquirements, and
                    he is at pains to print himself in his books as <hi rend="italic">doctor
                    utriusque juris.</hi> He was also ordained priest; but, on leaving Padua, he led
                    a roving life in France, Switzerland, and the Low Countries, supporting himself
                    by giving lessons and using the opportunity, it would seem, for the
                    dissemination of anti-religious views. He was obliged to flee from Lyons to
                    England in 1614, but was imprisoned in London for some reason for forty-nine
                    days. Being set at liberty, he returned to Italy and made an attempt to teach in
                    Genoa, but the same complaints being made against him drove him once more to
                    France. Here he made a valiant effort to clear himself of suspicion by
                    publishing a book against atheists,— <hi rend="italic">Amphitheatrum Aeternae
                    Providentiae Divino-Magicum, necnon Astrologo-Catholicum, adversus Veteres
                    Philosophos, Atheos, Epicureos, Peripateticos, et Stoicos</hi> (1615). It has
                    been said that by the weakness of his answers he designedly gives his opponents
                    the victory under pretence of refuting them; but, though the definitions of God
                    are somewhat pantheistic, the book is sufficiently orthodox. Yet it cannot be
                    taken as expounding his own views. Vanini expressly tells us so in his second
                    (and only other published) work, and the tone of that work would be sufficient
                    proof without this assurance. Though certified by two doctors of the Sorbonne,
                    the second book undoubtedly preaches a pantheism nearly akin to atheism, and a
                    sensualistic ethics strongly tinged with immorality. The title <hi rend="italic"
                    >(De Admirandis Naturae Reginae. Deaeque Mortalium Arcanis)</hi> correctly
                    indicates its general tenor. It was published at Paris in 1616, and was soon
                    afterwards re-examined by the Sorbonne and condemned to the flames. This was the
                    occasion of Vanini’s leaving Paris, where he had been staying as chaplain to
                    Marshal de Bassompierre, to whom the book is dedicated. He began to teach in
                    Toulouse, but soon roused the clergy and magistrates against him. He was
                    arrested in November 1618, and after a prolonged trial was condemned, as an
                    atheist, to have his tongue cut out, and to be strangled at the stake, his body
                    to be afterwards burned to ashes. This savage sentence was executed on 9th
                    February 1619. During his imprisonment, it is said, he professed the most
                    orthodox Catholicism, but as soon as all hope was gone gave vent to his true
                    feelings in ribald impieties. He appears to have met his fate with courage,
                    mingled perhaps <pb break="no"

                    vicious, and his writings show him to have been a man of inordinate vanity.
                    Though he possessed unquestionable gifts, neither originality nor profundity can
                    be claimed for him as a thinker. His fate, however, has given him a species of
                    fame.</p>
