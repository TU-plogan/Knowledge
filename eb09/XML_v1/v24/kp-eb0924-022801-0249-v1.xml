                    of</hi></label> (1653- 1734), French general, was born at Moulins on 8th May
                    1653. After spending some time at the college of Juilly, he became a page of the
                    <hi rend="italic">grand écurie,</hi> and then entered the army as a volunteer.
                    He first saw service in Holland under Louis XIV. and later under Condé, Turenne,
                    and Luxembourg in Germany, where in 1674 he obtained the command of a troop of
                    horse. Hostilities being brought to a close by the peace of Nimeguen in 1678, he
                    was sent as ambassador to the courts of Vienna and Munich, in which capacity he
                    greatly distinguished himself. In 1702 he received the command of an army in
                    order to succour the elector of Bavaria, who had espoused the cause of France in
                    the War of Succession. On 14th October he routed at Friedlingen Louis of Baden,
                    the Austrian commander. In the beginning of the following year he captured Kehl
                    and effected a junction with the army of the elector. He then conceived the
                    daring project of marching on Vienna. The united forces defeated the Austrians
                    under Count Styrum at Hochstädt, but his skilfully-conceived project, which had
                    every prospect of success owing to the scattered state of the Austrian forces,
                    had to be abandoned on account of the pusillanimous conduct of the elector.
                    Villars was next sent to subdue the Camisards, the Protestants of the Cevennes,
                    a task which he completed by a judicious combination of military skill and
                    clemency. In 1705 the north-eastern frontier, which was threatened by
                    Marlborough, was defended by Villars with such skill and ability that
                    Marlborough was completely baffled in his attempts to penetrate into France, and
                    even compelled to retreat. Villars took advantage of this opportunity to march
                    into Alsace, where he captured several towns along with great quantities of war
                    materials belonging to Marlborough and Prince Eugene. These advantages were,
                    however, counterbalanced by Villeroy’s defeat at Ramillies. After two short
                    campaigns in 1707-8 Villars was sent (in 1709) to Flanders to oppose Marlborough
                    and Prince Eugene. He was, however, defeated at Malplaquet and severely wounded.
                    The weak state of his health, the consequence of his wound, prevented him during
                    the next two years from engaging in active service. In 1712 Villars, at the head
                    of an army raised with great difficulty by the French, defeated the Austrians
                    under Albemarle in a brilliant action at Denain, compelled Prince Eugene to
                    raise the siege of Landrecies, and took several fortresses and towns. This
                    brilliant campaign raised again the almost desperate fortunes of France and led
                    to the treaty of Utrecht (1713) and the peace of Rastadt (1714). For many years
                    after this Villars exerted great influence at court, until he was finally
                    supplanted by Fleury. In 1733 the war with Austria again broke out, and in the
                    following year Villars, although over eighty years of age, was sent to take
                    command in Italy. But after some successes he demanded his recall, either in
                    consequence of his increasing infirmities or of disgust at the conduct of his
                    ally, the king of Sardinia; he died on his way back to France, at Turin, on 17th
                    June 1734.</p>
