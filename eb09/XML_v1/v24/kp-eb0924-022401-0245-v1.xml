                    Fontenay-le-Comte, in Poitou. According to F. Ritter’s investigations,<note

                    brought up as a Catholic, and died in the same creed; but there can be no doubt
                    that he belonged to the Huguenots for several years. On the completion of his
                    studies in law at Poitiers Vieta began his career as an advocate in his native
                    town. This he left about 1567, and somewhat later we find him at Rennes as a
                    councillor of the parlement of Brittany. The religious troubles drove him
                    thence, and Rohan, the well-known chief of the Huguenots, took him under his
                    special protection. He recommended him in 1580 as a “maître des requêtes”
                    (master of requests); and Henry of Navarre, at the instance of Rohan, addressed
                    two letters to Henry III. of France on 3d March and 26th April 1585, to obtain
                    Vieta’s restoration to his former office, but without result. After the
                    accession of Henry of Navarre to the throne of France Vieta filled in 1589 the
                    position of councillor of the parlement at Tours. He afterwards became a royal
                    privy councillor, and remained so till his death, which took place suddenly at
                    Paris in February 1603, but in what manner we do not know; Anderson, the editor
                    of his scientific remains, speaks only of a “praeceps et immaturum autoris
                    fatum.”</p>
                <p>We know of one important service rendered by Vieta as a royal officer. While at
                    Tours he discovered the key to a Spanish cipher, consisting of more than 500
                    characters, and thenceforward all the dispatches in that language which fell
                    into the hands of the French could be easily read. His fame now rests, however,
                    entirely upon his achievements in mathematics. Being a man of wealth, he printed
                    at his own expense the numerous papers which he wrote on various branches of
                    this science, and communicated them to scholars in almost every country of
                    Europe. An evidence of the good use he made of his means, as well as of the
                    kindliness of his character, is furnished by the fact that he entertained as a
                    guest for a whole month a scientific adversary, Adriaan van Roomen, and then
                    paid the expenses of his journey home. Vieta’s writings thus became very quickly
                    known; but, when Franciscus van Schooten issued a general edition of his works
                    in 1646, he failed to make a complete collection, although probably nothing of
                    very great value has perished.</p>
                <p>The form of Vieta’s writings is what we may call their weak side. He indulged
                    freely in flourishes; and in devising technical terms derived from the Greek he
                    seems to have aimed at making them as unintelligible as possible. None of them,
                    in point of fact, has held its ground, and even his proposal to denote unknown
                    quantities by the vowels A, E, I, O, U, Y,—the consonants <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b, c, &amp;c.,</hi> being reserved for general known quantities, has not been
                    taken up. In this denotation he followed, perhaps, some older contemporaries, as
                    Ramus, who designated the points in geometrical figures by vowels, making use of
                    consonants, <hi rend="smallcaps">r,</hi> S, <hi rend="smallcaps">t,
                    &amp;c.,</hi> only when those were exhausted. Vieta is wont to be called the
                    father of modern algebra. This does not mean, what is often alleged, that nobody
                    before him had ever thought of choosing symbols different from numerals, such as
                    the letters of the alphabet, to denote the quantities of arithmetic, but that he
                    made a general custom of what until his time had been only an exceptional
                    attempt. All that is wanting in his writings, especially in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Isagoge in artem analyticam</hi> (1591), in order to make them
                    look like a modern school algebra, is merely the sign of equality,—a want which
                    is the more striking because Robert Recorde had made use of our present symbol
                    for this purpose since 1557 and Xylander had employed vertical parallel lines
                    since 1575. On the other hand, Vieta was well skilled in most modern artifices,
                    aiming at a simplification of equations by the substitution of new quantities
                    having a certain connexion with the primitive unknown quantities. Another of his
                    works, <hi rend="italic">Recensio canonica effectionum geometricarum,</hi> bears
                    a stamp not less modern, being What we now call an algebraic geometry,—in other
                    words, a collection of precepts how to construct algebraic expressions with the
                    use of rule and compass only. While these writings were generally intelligible,
                    and therefore of the greatest didactic importance, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >principle of homogeneity,</hi> first enunciated by Vieta, was so far in advance
                    of his times that most readers seem to have passed it over without adverting to
                    its value. That principle had been made use of by the Greek authors of the
                    classic age; but of later mathematicians only Hero, Diophantus, &amp;c.,
                    ventured to regard lines and surfaces as mere numbers that could be joined to
                    give a new number, their sum. It may be that the study of such sums, which he
                    found in the works of Diophantus, prompted him to lay it down as a principle
                    that quantities occurring in an equation ought to be homogeneous, all of them
                    lines, or surfaces, or solids, or supersolids,—an equation between mere numbers
                    being inadmissible. During the three centuries that have elapsed between Vieta’s
                    days and our own several changes of opinion have taken place on this subject,
                    till the principle has at last proved so far victorious that modern
                    mathematicians like to make homogeneous such equations as are not so from the
                    beginning, in order to get values of a symmetrical shape. Vieta himself, of
                    course, did not see so far as that; nevertheless the merit cannot be denied him
                    of having indirectly suggested the thought. Nor are his writings lacking in
                    actual inventions. He conceived methods for the general resolution of equations
                    of the second, third, and fourth degrees different from those of Ferro and
                    Ferrari, with which, however, it is difficult to believe him to have been
                    unacquainted. He devised an approximate numerical solution of equations of the
                    second and third degrees, wherein Leonardo of Pisa must have preceded him, but
                    by a method every vestige of which is completely lost. He knew the connexion
                    existing between the positive roots of an equation (which, by the way, were
                    alone thought of as roots) aud the coefficients of the different powers of the
                    unknown quantity. He found out the formula for deriving the sine of a multiple
                    angle, knowing that of the simple angle with due regard to the periodicity of
                    sines. This formula must have been known to Vieta in 1593. . In that year
                    Adriaan van Roomen gave out as a problem to all mathematicians an equation of
                    the 45th degree, which, being recognized by Vieta as depending on the equation
                    between sin <hi rend="italic">φ</hi> and sin was 4b resolved by him at once, all
                    the twenty-three positive roots of which the said equation was capable being
                    given at the same time. Such was the first encounter of the two scholars. A
                    second took place when Vieta pointed to Apollonius’s problem of taction as not
                    yet being mastered, and Adriaan van Roomen gave a solution by the hyperbola.
                    Vieta, however, did not accept it, as there existed a solution by means of the
                    rale and the compass only, which he published himself in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Apollonius Gallus</hi> (1600). In this paper Vieta made use of the centre of
                    similitude of two circles. Lastly, he gave an infinite product for the number
                    <hi rend="italic">π</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Squaring the Circle,</hi>
                    vol. xxii. p. 434).</p>
