                <p><label type="entry">VALENCIA</label>, a province of Spain, one of the three into
                    which the former “kingdom” of Valencia is now divided, has an area of 4352
                    square miles and a population (1877) of 679,030, being thus, next to Barcelona,
                    the most populous province in the kingdom. It is bounded on the N. by Teruel and
                    Castellon de la Plana, on the E. by the Mediterranean, on the S. by Alicante,
                    and on the W. by Albacete and Cuenca. The surface is very much diversified;
                    along the coast it is for the most part low and level, the fertile “vegas” of
                    Valencia, Játiva, and Gandia in many places rising very little above sea-level;
                    to the west of these is a series of tablelands of a mean elevation of about 1000
                    feet, which in turn rise into the mountains that form the eastern boundary of
                    the tableland of New Castile, and attain within the province a maximum elevation
                    of nearly 4000 feet. The principal rivers are the Guadalaviar or Turia and the
                    Jucar. The former enters the province in the extreme north-west, flows
                    south-east, and falls into the sea below the town of Valencia; it receives
                    numerous tributaries of little importance, and it dispenses fertility by
                    numerous “acequias,” mostly of Moorish origin, throughout the whole of the lower
                    part of its course. The Jucar is joined on the left at Cofrentes (“Confluentes”)
                    by the Cabriel, a stream nearly as considerable as itself, and lower down by the
                    Magro; its chief right-hand tributary is the Albayda. Both the Jucar and the
                    Albayda, like the Turia, supply an extensive irrigation. Almost every kind of
                    geological formation from the Silurian to the Quaternary is represented in
                    Valencia: the vegas are Quaternary; nearly three-fourths of the entire province
                    belong to the Cretaceous; large areas, especially to the west, in the district
                    of Requena and Utiel, are of the Tertiary period; in the north the Jurassic is
                    prominent; and Triassic is found along many of the river-valleys. The coast is
                    skirted by considerable stretches of sand dune, and by a series of these the
                    lagoon of Albufera (21,000 acres) is separated from the Mediterranean. The vegas
                    enjoy an exceptionally fine, almost sub-tropical climate. In their low-lying
                    portions rice is the favourite crop; elsewhere wheat, maize, and all kinds of
                    fruit are abundantly grown; the mulberry is cultivated for silk; and wine and
                    oil are produced. Esparto grass is grown in the less fertile areas. The
                    tablelands produce according to their elevation and exposure figs, almonds,
                    olives, and vines. The pastures of the higher grounds sustain numerous sheep and
                    goats; but cattle and horses are relatively few in Valencia. The hillsides are
                    somewhat bare of timber. The mineral resources of the province are little
                    developed. The fishing industry on the coast is considerable. The manufactures
                    include those of silk, glass, pottery, and leather; there are also iron
                    foundries, distilleries, and soap manufactories. The coast railway from
                    Tarragona to Encina passes through Valencia, whence another line has been
                    carried along the Cuenca road as far as to Utiel (54½ miles). The province is
                    divided into twenty-one partidos judiciales and has 275 ayuntamientos. There are
                    six “cities”—Valencia (see below), Gandia (7604 inhabitants in 1877), Játiva
                    (14,534), Requena (13,527), Sagunto (6287), and Alcira (16,146).</p>
