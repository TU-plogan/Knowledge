                    de</hi></label> (1590-1626), more commonly called both in his own time and since
                    simply <hi rend="smallcaps">Théophile,</hi> a poet of unfortunate life and of
                    great but misused powers, was born at Clairac near Agen in 1590. He went to the
                    capital in his twentieth year and ingratiated himself with at least one patron,
                    the ill-fated duke of Montmorency, who was always constant to him. He also
                    became acquainted with most of the literary men of the time, and in 1617
                    composed and produced with success the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Pyrame et
                    Thisbe.</hi> This piece, written in the extravagant Spanish-Italian manner which
                    was fashionable in the interval between the Pléiade model and the innovations of
                    Corneille, was later the subject of much ridicule, especially directed to the
                    passage in which a sword, reddened with the blood of its master, is said to
                    “blush for its treason,” no very unpardonable conceit in eyes less pedantic than
                    Boileau’s. Théophile’s prosperity was not lasting. Only two years after the
                    success of <hi rend="italic">Pyrame</hi> he was accused of blasphemous and
                    indecent writings, and was exiled to England. Returning in 1621 and joining the
                    Roman Church (he had been a Huguenot), he served in two campaigns. But he was,
                    rightly or wrongly, associated with the publication of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parnasse Satirique,</hi> a collection of poems of the same character as those
                    which had formerly got him into trouble, and in 1623 was tried, condemned in his
                    absence to death, arrested, and imprisoned in the conciergerie. At length the
                    sentence of death which hung over him was reduced to banishment, and the
                    influence of Montmorency enabled him to hide himself in Paris till his death on
                    25th September 1626.</p>
                <p>For his singular persecution, which, even if the charges had been much better
                    established than they are, would have been surprising enough in an age of
                    unusually loose conduct and writing, the machinations of the Jesuits are
                    sometimes held responsible. But if Théophile had bitter enemies he had warm
                    friends. Six years after his death Georges de Scudéry edited his work with a <hi
                    rend="italic">Tombeau</hi> (copy of obituary verses), and a challenge in the
                    preface to any one who might be offended by the editor’s eulogy of the poet This
                    was in 1632; the year before had appeared a tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ρasi-phaé,</hi> where the awkwardness of the subject is not redeemed by any
                    merit of treatment; but it is by no means certainly or even probably<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0924-0228-0209"/> Théophile’s, and is not included in his works,
                    the standard modern edition of which is that of Alleaume in the Bibliothèque
                    Elzévirienne (Paris, 2 vols., 1856). These works may surprise the reader who
                    only knows Théophile’s mishaps and ill-fame; for, though varied enough, they
                    contain in the certainly authentic part of them nothing discreditable. Besides
                    <hi rend="italic">Pyrame et Thisbé,</hi> the chief in point of bulk is a
                    paraphrase, half verse half prose, after the odd fashion of the time, of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Phaedo.</hi> There are numerous French and Latin letters, a
                    vigorous <hi rend="italic">Apologie</hi> rebutting the accusations against him,
                    a promising fragment of comic prose narrative, and a large collection of
                    occasional verses, odes, elegies, stanzas, &amp;c. These latter, besides being
                    very unequal, are distinguished by the faults of taste and the inelegance of
                    language which marked the first quarter of the century. But there are
                    occasionally bursts of real poetry; and on the whole Théophile is the superior
                    of all his contemporaries between Regnier and Corneille. In addition to
                    Alleaume’s edition, a delightful article in Gautier’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grotesques</hi> should be consulted respecting him.</p>
