                    (1751-1826), German poet, archaeologist, and translator, was born at Sommersdorf
                    in Mecklenburg on the 20th February 1751. In the same year his father, a farmer,
                    removed from Sommersdorf to Penzlin. From 1766 to 1769 Voss attended school at
                    Neubrandenburg. In the latter year, in consequence of misfortunes which had
                    overtaken his father, he was obliged to accept a tutorship in the family of a
                    private gentleman near Penzlin. He went to Göttingen in 1772, in response to the
                    invitation of Boie, whose attention he had attracted by poems contributed to the
                    Göttingen <hi rend="italic">Musenalmanach.</hi> At Göttingen he studied with
                    enthusiasm ancient and modern literature, and became one of the leading members
                    of the famous “Dichterbund.” In 1775 Boie made over to him the editing of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Musenalmanach,</hi> which he continued to issue for many
                    years. He married Boie’s sister, Ernestine, in 1777, and in the following year
                    he accepted the position of rector at Ottendorf in Hanover. As the climate of
                    Ottendorf did not suit his health, he resigned this office in 1782, and went as
                    rector to Eutin, where he remained until 1802. He then lived for some time in
                    Jena, but in 1805 he accepted a call to a professorship at Heidelberg. He died
                    at Heidelberg on March 29, 1826.</p>
                <p>Voss was a man of a remarkably independent and vigorous character, and he
                    achieved distinction in several kinds of literary activity. In 1785-95 he
                    published in two volumes a collection of original poems, to which he afterwards
                    made many additions. The best of these works is his idyllic poem “Luise,” in
                    which he sought, with much success, to apply the style and methods of classical
                    poetry to the expression of modern German thought and sentiment. In his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mythologische Briefe</hi> (2 vols., 1794), in which he attacked
                    the ideas of Heyne, in his <hi rend="italic">Antisymbolik</hi> (2 vols.,
                    1824-26), written in opposition to Creuzer, and in other writings he made
                    important contributions to the study of mythology. He was also prominent as an
                    advocate of the right of free judgment in religion, and at the time when some
                    members of the Romantic school were being converted to the Roman Church he
                    produced a strong impression by a powerful article, in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sophronizon,</hi> on his friend Friedrich von Stolberg’s repudiation of
                    Protestantism. It is, however, to his work as a translator that Voss chiefly
                    owes his place in German literature. All his renderings of the works of ancient
                    writers indi cate not only sound scholarship but a thorough mastery of the laws
                    of German diction and rhythm. The most famous of his translations are those of
                    Homer, which were published together, in 4 volumes, in 1793. Of these the one
                    generally preferred is the translation of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> as
                    originally issued in 1781. He also translated Hesiod, Theocritus, Bion and
                    Moschus, Virgil, Horace, Tibullus, Propertius, and other classical poets, and he
                    prepared a critical edition of Tibullus. In 1818-29 was published, in 9 volumes,
                    a translation of Shakespeare’s plays, which he completed with the help of his
                    sons Heinrich and Abraham, both of whom were scholars and writers of
                    considerable ability.</p>
