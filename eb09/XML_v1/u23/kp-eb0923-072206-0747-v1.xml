                    fanciful· article carried by ladies as a sun-shade. But primarily the umbrella

                    >umbra,</hi> shade) was a sun-shade alone,—its original home having been in hot
                    brilliant climates. In Eastern countries from the earliest times the umbrella
                    was one of the insignia of royalty and power. On the sculptured remains of
                    ancient Nineveh and Egypt there are representations of kings and sometimes of
                    lesser potentates going in procession with an umbrella carried over their heads;
                    and throughout Asia the umbrella had, and still has, something of the same
                    significance. The Mahratta princes of India had among their titles “lord of <pb

                    addressing the governor-general of India termed himself “the monarch who reigns
                    over the great umbrella-wearing chiefs of the Eastern countries.” The baldachins
                    erected over ecclesiastical chairs, altars, and portals, and the canopies of
                    thrones and pulpits, &amp;c., are in their origin closely related to umbrellas,
                    and have the same symbolic significance. In each of the basilican churches of
                    Rome there still hangs a large umbrella.</p>
                <p>Among the Greeks and Romans the umbrella <hi rend="italic">(σκιάς,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">σκιd8eιoν,</hi><hi rend="italic">umbraculum, umbella)</hi> was
                    used by ladies, while the carrying of it by men was regarded as a sign of
                    effeminacy. Probably in these southern climes it never went out of use, and we
                    find from allusions by Montaigne that in his day its employment as a sun-shade
                    was quite common in Italy. The umbrella was not unknown in England in the 17th
                    century, and was already used as a rain protector. Michael Drayton, writing
                    about the beginning of the 17th century, says, speaking of doves :—</p>
                <p>“And, like umbrellas, with their feathers Shield you in all sorts of
                    weathers.”</p>
                <p>Although it was the practice to keep an umbrella in the coffee-houses early in
                    the 18th century, its use cannot have been very familiar, for in 1752 Colonel
                    Wolfe, writing from Paris, mentions the carrying of them there as a defence
                    against both rain and sun, and wonders that they are not introduced into
                    England. The traveller Jonas Hanway, who died in 1786, is credited with having
                    been the first Englishman who habitually carried an umbrella. That practice he
                    began thirty years before his death; at first he was singular, and his habit was
                    derided, but he lived to see his example commonly followed.</p>
                <p>The umbrella as at first used, based on its Eastern prototype, was a heavy
                    ungainly article which did not hold well together, and no little ingenuity has
                    been exercised to bring it into the elegant, compact, and strong form which is
                    now quite common. The early umbrella had a long handle, with ribs of whalebone
                    or cane, very rarely of metal, and stretchers of cane. The jointing of the ribs
                    and stretchers to the stick and to each other was very rough and imperfect. The
                    covering material consisted of oiled silk or cotton, heavy in substance, and
                    liable to stick together in the folds. Gingham soon came to be substituted for
                    the oiled cloth, and in 1848 William Sangster patented the use of alpaca as an
                    umbrella covering material. One of the most notable inventions for combining
                    lightness, strength, and elasticity in the ribs of umbrellas was the “Paragon”
                    rib patented by Samuel Fox in 1852. It is formed of a thin strip of steel rolled
                    into a U or trough section, a form which gives great strength for the weight of
                    metal. The use of such ribs, combined with the notched rings and runners which
                    give a separate hinge and joint to each rib and stretcher, and with the thin but
                    tough covering materials now in use, has principally contributed to the
                    strength, lightness, and elegance which ordinary umbrellas now present. Umbrella
                    silk is principally made at Lyons and Crefeld; but much of it is so loaded in
                    dyeing that it cuts readily at the folds. Textures of pure silk or of silk and
                    alpaca mixed have better wear-resisting properties.</p>
