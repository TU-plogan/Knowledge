                    form of the body and iu the shortness of the limbs. There are, according to Gray
                    <hi rend="italic">(British Museum Catalogue,</hi> 1869), 22 species of
                    ichneumons, the great majority of which are confined to the African continent,
                    the remainder occurring in Persia, India, and the Malay archipelago, and one,
                    the Andalusian ichneumon <hi rend="italic">(H. Widdringtonii,</hi> Gray), in the
                    Sierra Morena of Spain, the last probably an African straggler. The Egyptian and
                    Indian ichneumons are the forms best known. The former <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Herpestes ichneumon,</hi> L.) is an inhabitant of Egypt and the north of
                    Africa, where it is known to foreign residents as “Pharaoh’s rat.” When full
                    grown it is about the size of the domestic cat. It is covered with a fur of long
                    harsh hairs of a tawny grey colour, darker on the head and along the middle of
                    the back, its legs reddish and its feet and tail black. It feeds on rats and
                    mice, birds and reptiles, and for this reason is occasionally domesticated. Its
                    fondness for eggs leads it to search for those of the crocodile, buried as these
                    usually are beneath a thin covering of sand on the river banks; and its services
                    in thus checking the multiplication of those reptiles were so appreciated bythe
                    ancient Egyptians that they regarded the ichneumon as a sacred animal, and when
                    it died buried it, says Herodotus, “in holy repositories.” It is, however,
                    equally fond of poultry and their eggs, and its depredations among fowls
                    considerably detract from its undoubted merits as a vermin-killer. During the
                    inundations of the.Nile it is said to approach the habitations of man, but at
                    other seasons it keeps to the fields and to the banks of the
                    crocodile-frequented river. The Indian ichneumon or mungoos <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Heτpestes</hi><hi rend="italic">griseus,</hi> Desm.) is considerably smaller
                    than the Egyptian form; its fur is of a pale grey colour, the hairs being
                    largely white-ringed, while the cheeks and throat are more or less reddish. Like
                    the preceding species, it is frequently domesticated, and is then put to a
                    similar use. It is especially serviceable in India as a serpent killer,
                    destroying not only the eggs and young of these creatures, but attacking without
                    hesitation and killing the most venomous adult snakes. The fact that it
                    invariably survives those encounters has led to the belief that it either enjoys
                    immunity from the effects of snake poison, or that after being bitten it has
                    recourse, as the Hindoos have always maintained, to the root of a plant as an
                    antidote. Neither of these suppositions has stood the test of scientific
                    examination, for it has been found that when actually bitten it falls a victim
                    to the poison as rapidly as other mammals, while there is no trustworthy
                    evidence of its seeking a vegetable antidote. The truth seems to be that the
                    mungoos by its exceeding agility and quickness of eye avoids the fangs of the
                    snake while fixing its own teeth in the back of the reptile’s neck. The whole
                    Thanatophidia of India stand in awe of this tiny but tenacious mammal, and seek
                    to escape from its presence. The mungoos, on the other hand, never hesitates to
                    attack; the moment he sees his enemy, “his whole nature,” says a recent
                    spectator of one of those fights, “appears to be changed. His fur stands on end,
                    and he presents the incarnation of intense rage. The snake invariably attempts
                    to escape, but, finding it impossible to evade the rapid onslaught of the
                    mungoos, he raises his crest and lashes out fiercely at his little persecutor,
                    who seems to delight in dodging out of the way just in time. This goes on until
                    the mungoos sees his opportunity, when like lightning he rushes in and seizes
                    the snake with his teeth by the back of the neck close to the head, shaking him
                    as a terrier does a rat. These tactics are repeated until the snake is killed.”
                    The mungoos is equally dexterous in killing rats and other four-footed
                    vermin.</p>
