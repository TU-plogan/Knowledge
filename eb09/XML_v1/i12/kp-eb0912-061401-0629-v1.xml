                <p><label type="entry">ICEBERG</label>, a floating mass of ice, which has broken off
                    from such ice-sheets as cover Greenland, Spitzbergen, and other polar lands,
                    constituting vast glacier systems ever creeping out and down from the central
                    heights to the shores. As the glacier is pushed out to sea, the lower margin is
                    exposed to the destructive action of the waves, and breaks up into fragments of
                    endless variety of form. These severed blocks, many of which are hundreds of
                    millions of tons in mass, drift to lower latitudes under the influence of polar
                    currents, and gradually melt away in the warmer water. Such is the natural
                    history of icebergs, which, in their freshwater origin, are to be distinguished
                    from the ice-fields, ice-floes, pack ice, and ice-hummocks, so familiar to the
                    polar voyager. The iceberg, as it drifts along, melts most rapidly under water;
                    and this unequal wasting must be accompanied by a change in the position of the
                    centre of mass and a consequent shifting of the iceberg into its new position of
                    equilibrium. Undermining and fracture also result; so that at length the mass of
                    ice, however square-shaped or symmetrical it may have been originally, assumes a
                    form irregular and fantastic in the extreme. The densities of ice and sea-water
                    are nearly ∙92 and 1Ό3 respectively, so that only <hi rend="subscript">

                    iceberg is above water and visible. An iceberg observed by Sir John Ross and
                    Lieutenant Parry was 2j miles long, 2⅜ miles broad, and 153 feet high. Assuming
                    the form to have been approximately a cone erected upon an elliptic base, the
                    mass above water would be roughly 150 million tons—giving a total mass of nearly
                    15 hundred million tons. This iceberg, however, was by no means of extraordinary
                    dimensions. In the southern seas, great fleets of icebergs have been observed as
                    far north as the latitude of Cape Horn; and some of these ice masses have
                    towered to a height of 700 or 800 feet. The limiting latitude to which icebergs
                    drift is lower in the southern than in the northern hemisphere, probably because
                    of the comparative scarcity of land in the south polar regions. Thus, icebergs
                    have been observed off the Cape of Good Hope in 34° 8. lat., while none has been
                    noticed in the northern hemisphere lower than the 36th parallel. Generally
                    speaking, the limiting latitudes may be fixed at 40° N. lat. and 35° S. lat. In
                    the North Atlantic the distribution of icebergs is very remarkable, and
                    indicates, in its peculiar way, the general set of ocean currents. Icebergs, of
                    course, can only drift along with some polar current,—such, for example, as the
                    Labrador current, which flows in a generally southerly direction round the
                    coasts of Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. To the east of this track, in which
                    icebergs abound during the early summer months, lies the region which is warmed
                    by the waters of the Gulf Stream as it flows to the Scandinavian coast, and here
                    floating ice is rarely seen. The same considerations regarding prevailing
                    currents determine the distribution and limit of icebergs in the southern
                    oceans, the great antarctic current that cools the coasts of Chili and Peru

                    ice-cliffs of South Victoria. The climatic effect of an iceberg is sometimes
                    very marked; and not unfrequently the lowering of the temperature indicates to
                    the mariner the presence of floating ice even before it is near enough to be
                    visible. Geologically considered, icebergs, like glaciers, are great
                    transporting agents, bearing away to the deep sea rocks, boulders, and stones,
                    which are strewn along the ocean bed i?,s the ice gradually melts. By this
                    cause, rather than by the glacier in its integrity, some erratic blocks may
                    doubtless have been transported at a time when the land was under water and
                    exposed to ice-drift.</p>
