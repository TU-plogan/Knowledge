                    Roumania, situated on the left bank of the Danube, about 9 miles south of Galatz
                    and 102 miles from the Sulina mouth of the river. It has a railway station
                    within a quarter of a mile to the north-west on the Bucharest and Galatz line—a
                    branch line coming down to the harbour; and it is the seat of a chamber of
                    commerce, a tribunal of commerce, and an agency of the Danube Navigation
                    Company. Most of the town lies about 45 or 50 feet above the level of the sea,
                    there being only a very narrow strip of low-lying ground (some 60 or 100 feet)
                    between the edge of the river and the steep and lofty bank by which at this part
                    its course is defined. Ibraila is one of the most regular places in Roumania,
                    standing, indeed, in this respect, next after Bucharest itself. Few of the
                    houses, however, are more than two stories high. Towards the land it has the
                    shape of a crescent, the curve of the outer streets being controlled by the
                    direction of the old fortifications, which were dismantled in 1828. A wide and
                    tree-planted boulevard—the Strada Bulivardului—separates the town proper from
                    the suburban portion. There is a public garden along the brow of the bank
                    towards the river. Besides the cathedral of St <pb break="no"

                    church, a Jewish synagogue, and a church belonging to the strange Russian sect
                    of the Lipovani or Skoptsi. Ibraila has long had a large share in the trade of
                    the Danube. In 1836 it was visited by 382 ships. In 1870 there entered 4936
                    vessels and 6697 cleared, with a respective total burden of 867,189 tons and
                    821,274 tons. In 1877 the exports included 87,002 quarters of wheat, 87,314 of
                    maize, 80,938 of barley, 11,964 of rye, besides a large quantity of grain which
                    appears under the returns for Galatz. The railway between Ibraila and Galatz
                    takes a wide circuit, instead of following the direct line of the river. The

                <p>In the latter part of the 18th century Ibraila was several times taken by the
                    Russians, and on one occasion (1770) it was burned. By the peace of Bucharest
                    (1812) the Turks retained the right of garrisoning the fortress. In 1828 it was
                    gallantly defended by Soliman Pasha, who, after holding out from the middle of
                    May till the end of June, was allowed to march out with the honours of war. At
                    the peace of Adrianople the place was definitively assigned to Wallachia. It was
                    the spot chosen by Gortschakoff for crossing the Danube with his division in
                    1854.</p>
