                    rend="smallcaps">der</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(</hi>? -1482), a painter of
                    considerable celebrity at Ghent, was known to Vasari, as he is known to us, by a
                    single picture in a Florentine monastery. At a period when the family of the
                    Medici had not yet risen from the rank of a great mercantile firm to that of a
                    reigning dynasty, it employed as an agent at the port of Bruges Tommaso
                    Portinari, a lineal descendant, it was said, of Folco, the father of Dante’s
                    Beatrix. Tommaso, at that time patron of a chapel in the hospital of Santa Maria
                    Nuova at Florence, ordered an altar-piece of Hugo van der Goes, and commanded
                    him to illustrate the sacred theme of <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Quem genuit</hi><hi rend="italic">adoravitf'</hi> In the centre of a vast
                    triptych, comprising numerous figures of life size, Hugo represented the Virgin
                    kneeling in adoration before the new-born Christ attended by Shepherds and
                    Angels. On the wings he portrayed Tommaso and his two sons in prayer under the
                    protection of Saint Anthony and St Matthew, and Tommaso’s wife and two daughters
                    supported by St Margaret and St Mary Magdalen. The triptych was sent to
                    Florence, and placed on the altar upon which it still remains. Van der Goes,
                    like Hubert Van Eyck and Jodocus of Ghent, has bequeathed but this one picture
                    to posterity; but it is a picture which shows that he was an artist of whom
                    Ghent might be proud, as Bruges was proud of John Van Eyck and Brussels of Roger
                    van der Weyden. Unhappily the triptych of Santa Maria Nuova suffered so much
                    from decay and restoring that the defects peculiar to the Flemings became unduly
                    prominent as time and neglect effaced the brilliancy and harmony of the
                    principal colours. We can only discern at the present day that the art of Van
                    der Goes is a variety of that which characterizes Van Eyck and Van der Weyden.
                    Less finished and less coloured than the work of the first, it is less subtle
                    and expressive than that of the second. It lacks depth of religious feeling, and
                    hardly rises above the common level of the school in respect of feeling or
                    execution. It is a cold and stiff art, marked by hardness of surface, dryness of
                    contour, angularity of drapery, overladen ornament, and ill-balanced light and
                    shade. Imposing because composed of figures of unusual size, the altar-piece is
                    more remarkable for portrait character than for charms of ideal beauty. There
                    are small pieces in public galleries which claim to have been executed by Van
                    der Goes, but none that are certified as the work of his hands. One of these
                    pictures in the National Gallery in London is more nearly allied to the school
                    of Mending than the triptych of Santa Maria Nuova; another, a small and very
                    beautiful John the Baptist, at the Pinakothek of Munich, is really by Mending;
                    <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> whilst numerous fragments of an altar-piece in
                    the Belvedere at Vienna, though assigned to Hugo, are by his more gifted
                    countryman of Bruges. Any one who visits Continental collections will see that
                    the name of Van der Goes was given to pictures of which he could not have been
                    the author. None of the compositions mentioned by historians have survived
                    except the altar-piece of Florence. But Van der Goes was not habitually a
                    painter of easel pieces. He made his reputation at Bruges by producing coloured
                    hangings in distemper. After he settled at Ghent, and became a master of his
                    guild in 1465, he designed cartoons for glass windows. He also made decorations
                    for the wedding of Charles the Bold and Margaret of York in 1468, for the
                    festivals of the Rhetoricians and papal jubilees on repeated occasions, for the
                    solemn entry of Charles the Bold into Ghent in 1470-1, and for the funeral of
                    Philip the Good in 1474. The labour which he expended on these occasions might
                    well add to his fame without being the less ephemeral. About the year 1475 he
                    retired to the monastery of Rouge Cloître near Ghent, where he took the cowl.
                    There, though he still clung to his profession, he seems to have taken to
                    drinking, and at one time to have shown decided symptoms of insanity. But his
                    superiors gradually cured him of his intemperance, and he died in the odour of
                    sanctity in 1482.</p>
