                <p><label type="entry">GAUDEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1605-1662),
                    the reputed author of the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike,</hi> was born in
                    1605 at Mayfield in Essex, of which parish his father was vicar. He was educated
                    at Bury St Edmunds, and afterwards at St John’s College, Cambridge. He obtained
                    about 1630 the vicarage of Chippenham in Cambridgeshire, and the rectory of
                    Brightwell in Berkshire. At the breaking out of the civil war he was domestic
                    chaplain to Robert Rich, second earl of Warwick, one of the parliamentary
                    leaders, and, being selected to preach before the House of Commons in 1640, was
                    presented with a silver tankard for his discourse. In 1641 he was appointed by
                    the parliament to the deanery of Bocking, in Essex. He became master of the
                    Temple in 1659, in succession to Dr Ralph Brownrigg, bishop of Exeter, and after
                    the Restoration in November 1660 was appointed to the same diocese. Between
                    1642, the date of his first printed work, and 1660 he published some thirteen or
                    more books, of which number, however, only one appeared prior to the execution
                    of the king. Soon after his appointment to the see of Exeter, he privately laid
                    claim to the authorship of the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike,</hi> a work
                    commonly attributed at the time to Charles I. This claim Gauden put forth in a
                    correspondence with the Lord Chancellor Hyde, earl of Clarendon, and the earl of
                    Bristol, from 21st December 1660 to 31st March 1662. The letters of Gauden among
                    them have been published in Dr Maty’s <hi rend="italic">Review</hi> in 1782, and
                    again in the Appendix to vol. iii. of the <hi rend="italic">Clarendon
                    Papers.</hi> In the year 1693 a Mr Arthur North of London, who had married a
                    sister of Dr Gauden’s daughter-in-law, published a series of letters which he
                    had found among his sister-in-law’s papers, and which added materially to the
                    strength of the bishop’s claim. They consisted of the other side of the
                    correspondence referred to above, viz., a letter from Secretary Sir Edward
                    Nicholas to Gaudenin January 1660-1, two from the bishop to Chancellor Hyde in
                    December 1661 and the duke of York in January 1661—2, and onefrom Hyde to the
                    bishop in March 1661-2. These letters, however, have been regarded with
                    considerable suspicion by late writers on the subject, and have even been
                    pronounced to be forgeries by some, who have pointed out that the two letters
                    written by Gauden himself to Clarendon and the duke of York were found in the
                    bishop’s house, not among the papers of the persons to whom they were directed.
                    The letter also from Clarendon to Gauden, though written nine months after his
                    obtaining his earldom, is signed Edward Hyde, a blundering anachronism which
                    points to the unskilful hand of a forger. The whole question of the claims of
                    Charles I. and Dr Gauden was discussed at great length and with considerable
                    ability and ingenuity from 1824 to 1829 by Dr Christopher Wordsworth, master of
                    Trinity College, Cambridge, on behalf of the king, and the Rev. H. J. Todd on
                    the side of Dr Gauden. Fresh evidence, however, has lately turned up in the
                    shape of letters and papers of Charles II. and his ministers, written soon after
                    the execution of the king, which go far to invalidate if not entirely destroy
                    the claim of Dr Gauden, and prove that those persons to whom he most confidently
                    appealed in support of his pretensions were the strongest upholders of the
                    king’s authorship at the time immediately subsequent to the appearance of the
                    work. In 1662, on the death of Brian Duppa, bishop of Winchester, Dr Gauden
                    applied to be translated from Exeter to that see, but his claims were set aside
                    in favour of George Morley, bishop of Worcester, and the vacancy thus created
                    was filled by the bishop of Exeter. He only lived four months after this last
                    promotion, and dying on 20th September 1662, was buried in Worcester Cathedral.
                    His will is preserved in the Prerogative Office of Canterbury.</p>
                <p>He left a widow, the daughter of Sir William Russell of Chippenham, who after her
                    husband’s death wrote a letter to her son John on the subject of the king’s
                    book, and enclosed in it a narrative of the whole claim. This was published with
                    the correspondence mentioned above by Mr North in 1693. She also erected a
                    monument to the bishop’s memory in Worcester Cathedral, representing him with
                    the <hi rend="italic">Eikon Basilike</hi> in his hand.</p>
