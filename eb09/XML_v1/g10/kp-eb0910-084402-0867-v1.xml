                <p><label type="entry">GOTHA</label> (originally <hi rend="italic">Coteyewe,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Got awe,</hi> and later <hi rend="italic">Gotaha,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Gοthau),</hi> a town of Germany, formerly capital of the old duchy
                    of Gotha, and now, alternately with Coburg, the residence of the duke of
                    Saxe-Coburg. Gotha is situated on a canal of the Leina, and on the Thuringian
                    railway, about 6 miles north of the Thuringian Forest. It consists of the town
                    proper and four suburbs, which are grouped in the shape of a half-moon to the
                    north, west, and east of the hill on which, at the height of 1086 feet, stands
                    the castle of Friedenstein. With the exception of those in the older portion of
                    the town, the streets are handsome and spacious, and the beautiful gardens and
                    promenades between the suburbs and the castle add greatly to the town’s
                    attractiveness. On the other side of the castle there is an extensive and finely
                    adorned park. To the north-west of the town the Gulberg hill,—on which there is
                    a public pleasure garden,—and to the south-west the Leeberg hill, rise to a
                    height of over 1300 feet, and afford extensive views of a beautiful panorama.
                    The castle, begun by Ernest the Pious in 1643 and completed in 1654, occupies
                    the site of the old fortress of Grimmenstein. It is a huge square building
                    flanked with two wings, having towers rising to the height of about 140 feet. It
                    contains the ducal coin cabinet, and the ducal library of nearly 200,000
                    volumes, among which are several rare editions, and about 6900 manuscripts. The
                    picture gallery, the cabinet of engravings, the natural history museum, the
                    Chinese museum, and the cabinet of art, which includes a collection of Egyptian,
                    Etruscan, Roman, and German antiquities, are now included in a new building,
                    completed in 1878, which stands on the southern terrace of the castle. The
                    principal other public buildings are the Margaret church,—with a beautiful
                    portal and a lofty tower,—founded in the 12th century, twice burnt down, and
                    rebuilt in its present form in 1652; the Augustines or Cloister church, with an
                    altar-piece by the painter Jacobs; the theatre; the fire insurance bank and the
                    life insurance bank; the ducal palace, in the Italian villa style, with a winter
                    garden and picture gallery; the buildings of the legislature of the duchy; the
                    hospital; the old town-house, dating from the 11th century; the old
                    dwelling-house of the painter Lucas Cranach, now used as a girls’ school; the
                    ducal stable; and the Friedrichsthal <pb break="no"

                    excellent city schools, a gymnasium (founded in 1524, one of the most famous in
                    Germany), a ladies’ school of the first order, a training school for teachers
                    and another for female teachers, a free school, a trade school, and a commercial
                    school. Among the other institutions are a lying-in hospital, a surgical and eye
                    hospital, a private lunatic asylum, an orphanage, a reformatory, a magdalen
                    institute, and a school for the board and education of destitute girls. The
                    observatory, erected by Duke Ernest II. in 1787, was in 1857 transferred to a
                    new site in the neighbourhood of the park. Formerly the town obtained its water
                    supply by means of the Leina canal, which was excavated in 1369, but water for
                    drinking purposes has since 1874 been obtained from the Thuringian Forest. Gotha
                    is one of the most active commercial towns of Thuringia, its manufactures
                    including sausages, for which it has a great reputation, porcelain, tobacco,
                    sugar, machinery, mechanical and surgical instruments, musical instruments,
                    shoes, lamps, and toys. There are also a number of nurseries and market gardens.
                    The book trade is represented by about a dozen firms, including that of the
                    great geographical house of Perthes, Population (1875), 22,928.</p>
                <p>• Gotha existed as a village in the time of Charlemagne. In 930 the Abbot
                    Gotthard of Uersfeld surrounded it with walls. It was known as a town as early
                    as 1109, about which time it came into the possession of the landgraves of
                    Thuringia. On the extinction of that line Gotha came into the possession of the
                    electors of Saxony, and on the division of their estates between Frederick the
                    Softhearted and William, it fell to the share of the latter, after whose death
                    it was inherited by the Ernestine line of dukes. After the battle of Mühlberg in
                    1547, the castle of Grimmenstein was partly destroyed, but it was again restored
                    in 1554. In 1566 the town was taken from Duke John Frederick by August of
                    Saxony. After the death without issue of John Frederick’s two sons, it came into
                    the possession of Duke Ernest the Pious, the fourth of the line of the dukes of
                    Gotha; and on the extinction of this line it was, in 1826, united, along with
                    the dukedom, to Coburg.</p>
