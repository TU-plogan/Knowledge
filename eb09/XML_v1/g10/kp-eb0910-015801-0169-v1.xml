                    (1527-1585). This is the familiar name given to the painter Luca Cambiasi
                    (written also Cambiaso or Cangiagio), who was born at Moneglia in the Genoese
                    state, son of a painter named Giovanni Cambiasi. He took to drawing at a very
                    early age, imitating his father, and developed great aptitude for
                    foreshortening. At the age of fifteen he painted, along with his father, some
                    subjects from Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> on the front of a
                    house in Genoa, and afterwards, in conjunction with Calvi, a ceiling showing
                    great daring of execution, in the Palazzo Doria. He also formed an early
                    friendship with Giambattista Castello; both artists painted together, with so
                    much similarity of style that their works could hardly be told apart; from this
                    friend Cambiasi learned much in the way of perspective and architecture.
                    Luchetto’s best artistic period lasted for twelve years after his first
                    successes; from that time he declined in power, though not at once in
                    reputation, owing to the agitations and vexations brought upon him by a passion
                    which he conceived for his sister-in-law. His wife having died, and the
                    sister-in-law having taken charge of his house and children, he endeavoured to
                    procure a papal dispensation for marrying her; but in this he was disappointed.
                    In 1583 he accepted an invitation from Philip II. to continue in the Escorial a
                    series of frescos which had been begun by Castello, now deceased; and it is said
                    that one principal reason for his closing with this offer was that he hoped to
                    bring the royal influence to bear upon the pope, but in this again he failed.
                    Worn out with his disquietudes, he died in the Escorial in the second year of
                    his sojourn. Cambiasi had an ardent fancy, and was a bold designer in a
                    Raphaelesque mode. His extreme facility astonished the Spanish painters; and it
                    is said that Philip II., watching one day with pleasure the offhand zest with
                    which Luchetto was painting a head of a laughing child, was allowed the further
                    surprise of seeing the laugh changed, by a touch or two upon the lips, into a
                    weeping expression. The artist painted sometimes with a brush in each hand, and
                    with a certainty equalling or transcending that even of Tintoret. He made a vast
                    number of drawings, and was also something of a sculptor, executing in this
                    branch of art a figure of Faith. Altogether he ranks as one of the ablest
                    artists of his day. In personal character, notwithstanding his executive energy,
                    he is reported to have been timid and diffident. His son Orazio became likewise
                    a painter, studying under Luchetto.</p>
