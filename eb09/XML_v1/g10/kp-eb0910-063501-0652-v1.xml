                    and chief justiciary of England in the reign of Henry II., was born at Stratford
                    in Suffolk, but in what year is unknown. There is also almost no information
                    regarding his early life. Butterley Abbey was founded by him in 1171. In 1174,
                    along with other barons of Yorkshire, he raised a body of knights to oppose
                    William the Lion, king of Scotland, who had invaded the north of England, and it
                    was he who took the king prisoner at Alnwick. In 1175 he was appointed sheriff
                    of Yorkshire, in 1176 justice of the king’s court and a justice itinerant in the
                    northern circuit, and in 1180 chief justiciary of all England. It was under his
                    direction that Henry II. completed his judicial reforms, but the principal of
                    them had been carried out before he came into office. After the death of Henry
                    in 1189 Glanvil was removed from his office by Richard I., and imprisoned till
                    he had paid a ransom, according to one authority, of .£15,000. Shortly after
                    obtaining his freedom he joined the order of the cross, and he died at the siege
                    of Acre in 1190. At the instance, it is supposed, of Henry II., Glanvil wrote or
                    superintended the writing of the <hi rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi

                    a practical treatise on the forms of procedure in the <hi rend="italic"

                    involved in these forms being only incidentally referred to. As the source of
                    our knowledge regarding the earliest form of the <hi rend="italic">curia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">regis,</hi> and for the information it affords regarding ancient
                    customs and laws, it is of great value to the student of English history. It is
                    now generally agreed that the work of Glanvil is of earlier date than the <hi
                    rend="italic">Regiam Majestatem,</hi> a work which bears a close resemblance to
                    his. To him is also ascribed the recension of English laws made in the reign of
                    Henry II.</p>
                <p>The treatise of Glanvil was first printed in 1554. An English translation, with,
                    notes and introduction by John Beames, was published at London in 1812. A MS.
                    copy of a Norman-French translation, made apparently in the reign of King John,
                    is contained in the library of the duke of Northumberland at Alnwick Castle.</p>
