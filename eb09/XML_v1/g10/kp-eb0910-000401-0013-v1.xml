                <p><label type="entry">GAD</label> (Ι∣) in Hebrew and Chaldee means “luck”; hence,
                    in the Phoenician and Babylonian cultus, the god of luck, who is mentioned in
                    Isa. lxv. 11 (where for “that troop” should be read “Gad”), and whose name
                    appears in several names of places, such as Baal-Gad (Josh. xi. 17, xii. 7);
                    possibly also in Dibon-Gad, Migdol-Gad, and Nahal-Gad. Gad was the name given by
                    Leah, the wife of Jacob, to the patriarch’s seventh son, the first-born of
                    Zilpah, her maid; see Gen. xxx. 11, where the Hebrew K’tib is *1⅞3, and the K’ri
                    “U K3. The former is adopted by the LXX., and rightly rendered «V <hi
                    rend="italic">τvχr]</hi> (Vulgate <hi rend="italic">feliciter)·,</hi> the latter
                    reading is adopted in the Targums and Peshito, which translate “luck is come,”
                    and by the Samaritan and Ven., which interpret the expression as meaning “a
                    troop (or army) is come.” This last rendering has doubtless been influenced by
                    Gen. xlix. 19, where the name is played on as if it were *BΙ∣, “a plundering
                    troop”; “Gad, a plundering troop shall plunder him, but he shall plunder at
                    their heels.” Of the personal history of Gad nothing is related. According to
                    Gen. xlvi. 16, he had seven sons when he went down to Egypt along with Jacob;
                    and in Num. xxvi. 15 these appear as seven families, one of the names, however,
                    being changed (Ozni for Ezbon). At the Exodus the tribe numbered 45,650 fighting
                    men (Num. i. 25); but they declined to 40,500 during the forty years’ wandering
                    in the wilderness (Num. xxvi. 18). During the subsequent period the fortunes of
                    this tribe were very closely connected with those of the tribe of Reuben. At the
                    division of the country a portion in the trans-Jordanie territory was, at their
                    special request, allotted to them by Moses (Num. xxxii. 33), and this
                    arrangement was carried out by Joshua; but considerable difficulty arises when
                    the attempt is made to define the precise limits of the district thus assigned.
                    It is certain that Gad never extended further west than the Jordan; but in
                    different passages we find its northern, eastern, and southern boundaries
                    stretched as far as to the Sea of Galilee, Salkah in the desert, and the river
                    Arnon respectively. In the book of Numbers (xxxii. 34) the cities of Gad appear
                    to lie chiefly to the south of Heshbon; in Joshua xiii. 24-28 they lie almost
                    wholly to the north; while other texts present discrepancies that are not easily
                    reconciled with either passage. That Gad, at one time at least, held territory
                    as far south as Pisgah and Nebo would follow from Deut, xxxiii. 21, if the
                    rendering of the Targums, revived by Ewald and Diestel, were to be accepted—“and
                    he looked out the first part for himself, because there was the portion of the
                    buried lawgiver ;” it is certain, however, that, at a late period, this tribe
                    was localized chiefly in Gilead, in the district which now goes by the name of
                    Jebel Jilad. Possibly some cities were common to both Reuben and Gad, and
                    perhaps 0ther3 more than once changed hands. Both tribes were pastoral and
                    warlike; but the latter seems to have excelled in bravery and force of
                    character, and indeed there are indications that the tribe of Reuben had been
                    absorbed, or become extinct, at a somewhat early date. David’s men of Gad (1
                    Chr. xii. 8) are famous, and Jephthah and Elijah seem to have belonged to that
                    tribe. It followed Jeroboam in the great revolt against the house of David; and
                    a genealogy, a3 at the time of Jeroboam II., is given in 1 Chr. v. 11-16, where
                    the names are in every case different from those in Numbers. The tribe was
                    “carried into captivity” by Tiglath Pileser in the 8th century <hi

                    point it wholly disappears from history.</p>
