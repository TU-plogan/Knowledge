                <p><label type="entry">RIFLEMAN-BIRD</label>, or Rifle-Bird, names given by the
                    English in Australia to a very beautiful inhabitant of that country, <note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Curiously enough its English
                    name seems to be first mentioned in ornithological literature by
                    Frenchmen—Lesson and Garnot—in 1828, who say ( <hi rend="italic">Voy.
                    “Coquille," Zoologie,</hi> p. 669) that it was applied “pour rappeler que ce fut
                    un soldat de la garnison [of New South Wales] qui le tua le premier,”—which
                    seems to be an insufficient reason, though the statement as to the bird’s first
                    murderer may be true. </p></note> probably because in coloration it resembled
                    the well-known uniform of the rifle-regiments of the British army, while in its
                    long and projecting hypochondriac plumes and short tail a further likeness might
                    be traced to the hanging pelisse and the jacket formerly worn by the members of
                    those corps. Be that as it may, the cock bird is clothed in velvety-black
                    generally glossed with rich purple, but having each feather of the abdomen
                    broadly tipped with a chevron of green bronze, while the crown of the head is
                    covered with scale-like feathers of glittering green, and on the throat gleams a
                    triangular patch of brilliant bluish emerald, a colour that reappears on the
                    whole upper surface of the middle pair of tail-quills. The hen is greyish-brown
                    above, the crown striated with dull white; the chin, throat, and a streak behind
                    the eye are pale ochreous, and the lower parts deep buff, each feather bearing a
                    black chevron. According to James Wilson <hi rend="italic">(III. Zoology,</hi>
                    pl. xi.), specimens of both sexes were obtained by Sir T. Brisbane at Port
                    Macquarie, "whence, in August 1823, they were sent to the Edinburgh Museum,
                    where they arrived the following year; but the species was first described by
                    Swainson in January 1825 <hi rend="italic">(Zook Journal,</hi> i. p. 481) as the
                    type of a new genus <hi rend="italic">Ptiloms,</hi> more properly written <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptilorrhis,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Some writers have amended Swainson’s faulty name in the form

                    generally known in ornithology as <hi rend="italic">P. paradisea.</hi> It
                    inhabits the northern part of New South Wales and southern part of Queensland as
                    far as Wide Bay, beyond which its place is taken by a kindred species, the <hi
                    rend="italic">P. vixtoriae</hi> of Gould, which was found by John Macgillivray
                    on the shores and islets of Rockingham Bay. Further to the north, in York
                    Peninsula, occurs what is considered a third species, <hi rend="italic">P.
                    alberti,</hi> very closely allied to and by some authorities thought to be
                    identical "with the <hi rend="italic">P. magnifiai</hi> (Vieillot) of New
                    Guinea—the “Promerops” of many writers. From that country a fifth species, <hi
                    rend="italic">P. wilsoni,</hi> has also been described by Mr Ogden <hi
                    rend="italic">(Proc. Acad. Philadelphia,</hi> 1875, p. 451, pl. 25). Little is
                    known of the habits of any of them, but the Rifleman-bird proper is said to get
                    its food by thrusting its somewhat long bill under the loose bark on the boles
                    or boughs of trees, along the latter of which it runs swiftly, or by searching
                    for it on the ground beneath. During the pairing-season the males mount to the
                    higher branches and there display and trim their brilliant plumage in the
                    morning sun, or fly from tree to tree uttering a note which is syllabled “yass”
                    greatly prolonged, but at the same time making, apparently with their wings, an
                    extraordinary noise like that caused by the shaking of a piece of stiff silk
                    stuff. Verreaux informed Mr Elliot that he believed they breed in the holes of
                    trees and lay white eggs; but on that score nothing is really known. The genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Ptilorrhis,</hi> thought by Gould to be allied to <hi
                    rend="italic">Climacteris,</hi> has been generally placed near <hi rend="italic"
                    >Epimachus,</hi> which is now considered, with <hi rend="italic"
                    >Drepαnornis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Seleucides,</hi> to belong to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Para-diseidae,</hi> or Birds-of-Paradise, and in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Monograph</hi> of that Family all the species then known are
                    beautifully figured by Mr Elliot. (a. n.)</p>
