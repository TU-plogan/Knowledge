                <p><label type="entry">RAFF</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Joachim</hi>
                    (1822-1882), composer and orchestral conductor, was born near Zurich on 27th May
                    1822 and educated chiefly at Schwyz. Here, under the care of the Jesuit fathers,
                    he soon became an excellent classical and mathematical scholar, but received
                    scarcely any instruction in his favourite art, in which, nevertheless, he made
                    extraordinary progress through sheer force of natural genius, developed by
                    persevering study which no external obstacles could induce him to discontinue.
                    So successful were his unaided efforts that, when in 1843 he sent some MSS. to
                    Mendelssohn, that warm encourager of youthful talent felt justified in at once
                    recommending him to Breitkopf &amp; Hartel of Leipsic, who published a large
                    selection of his early works. Soon after this he became acquainted with Liszt,
                    who gave him much generous encouragement. He first became personally acquainted
                    with Mendelssohn at Cologne in 1846, and gave up all his other engagements for
                    the purpose of following him to Leipsic, but his intention was frustrated by the
                    great composer’s death in 1847. After this cruel disappointment he remained for
                    some time at Cologne, where his attention was alternately devoted to composition
                    and to the ¡)reparation of critiques for the well-known periodical <hi
                    rend="italic">Cacilia.</hi> Thus far he must be regarded as, in every sense of
                    the word, a self-taught artist; but he felt the need of systematic instruction
                    so deeply that, retiring for a time from public life, he entered at Stuttgart
                    upon a long course of severe and uninterrupted study, and with so great success
                    that in 1850 he appeared before the world in the character of an accomplished
                    and highly-cultivated musician. Raff now settled for a time in Weimar in order
                    to be near Liszt. Hans von Biilow had already brought him into notice by playing
                    his <hi rend="italic">Concertstiick</hi> for pianoforte and orchestra in public,
                    and the favour with which this fine work was everywhere received encouraged him
                    to attempt a greater one. During his stay in Stuttgart he had begun the
                    composition of an opera entitled <hi rend="italic">K'&amp;nig Alfred</hi> , and
                    had good hope of securing its performance at Dresden; but the political troubles
                    with which Germany was then overwhelmed rendered its production in the Saxon
                    capital impossible. At Weimar he was more fortunate. In due time <hi
                    rend="italic">K'&amp;nig Alfred</hi> was produced there under Liszt’s able
                    direction with complete success; it is still frequently performed at the court
                    theatre, as is also his second opera, <hi rend="italic">Dame Kobold</hi> ,
                    written for the same theatre in 1870. His third opera, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Samson</hi> , has not yet, we believe, been publicly represented.</p>
                <p>Raff remained at Weimar until 1856, when he obtained a large <hi rend="italic"
                    >clientèle</hi> at Wiesbaden as a teacher of the pianoforte. In 1859 he married
                    Doris Genast, an actress of high repute, and thenceforward devoted himself with
                    renewed energy to the work of composition, displaying an inexhaustible fertility
                    of invention tempered by an amount of technical skill which stamped even his
                    lightest works with the dignity to which the union of natural talent with high
                    artistic cultivation can alone give birth. He resided chiefly at Wiesbaden till
                    1877, when he was appointed director of the Hoch-Conservatorium at Frankfort, an
                    office which he retained until his death, 25th June 1882.</p>
                <p>Raff’s compositions are almost innumerable. More than 200 have been published,
                    including ten symphonies—undoubtedly his finest works—quartets, concertos,
                    sonatas, songs, and examples of nearly every known variety of style; yet he
                    never repeats himself. Notwithstanding his strong love for the-romantic school,
                    he is never guilty of extravagance, and, if in his minor works he is sometimes a
                    little commonplace, he never descends to vulgarity. His symphonies <hi
                    rend="italic">Lenore</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Im Walde</hi> are truly
                    wonderful examples of musical painting, and replete with poetry in every
                    bar.</p>
