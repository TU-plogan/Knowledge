                    called, and for this reason, near Strasburg, but the name seems not to be

                    notwithstanding its occurrence in the Levant, cannot be identified with any

                    ornithology, and is widely though not very numerously spread over Europe and
                    Western Asia in summer, breeding so far to the northward as the middle of
                    Sweden, but retiring to winter in Africa. It occurs almost every year in some
                    part or other of the British Islands, from Cornwall to the Shetlands, while it
                    has visited Ireland several times, and is even recorded from St. Kilda. But it
                    is only as a wanderer that it comes hither, since there is no evidence of its
                    having ever attempted to breed in Great Britain; and indeed its conspicuous
                    appearance—for it is nearly as big as a Daw and very brightly coloured—would
                    forbid its being ever allowed to escape the gun of the always ready murderers of
                    stray birds. Except the back, scapulars, and tertials, which are bright
                    reddish-brown, the plumage of both sexes is almost entirely blue—of various
                    shades, from pale turquoise to dark ultra-marine—tinted in parts with green. The
                    bird seems to be purely insectivorous. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coracias,</hi> for a long while placed by systematists among the Crows, has
                    really no affinity whatever to them, and is now properly considered to belong to
                    the heterogeneous group of Birds in this work called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pixariae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Ornithology, vol. xviii. p. 41), in
                    which</hi> it forms the type of the Family <hi rend="italic">Coraciidae·,</hi>
                    and its alliance to the Bee-eaters, <hi rend="italic">Meropidae,</hi> and
                    King-fishers (vol. xiv. p. 81), <hi rend="italic">Alcedinidae,</hi> is very
                    evident. Some eight other species of the genus have been recognized, one of
                    which, <hi rend="italic">C. leuco-cephalus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">C.
                    abyssinus,</hi> is said to have occurred in Scotland. India has two species, <hi
                    rend="italic">C. indiens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">C. affînis,</hi> of which
                    thousands upon thousands are annually destroyed to supply the demand for gaudy
                    feathers to bedizen ladies’ dresses. One species, <hi rend="italic">C.
                    temmincki,</hi> seems to be peculiar to Celebes and the neighbouring islands,
                    but otherwise the rest are natives of the Ethiopian or Indian Regions. Allied to
                    <hi rend="italic">Coracias</hi> is the genus <hi rend="italic">Eurystomus</hi>
                    with some half dozen species, of similar distribution, but one of them, <hi
                    rend="italic">E. jιacificus,</hi> has a wider range, for it inhabits Australia
                    and reaches Tasmania. Madagascar has four or five very remarkable forms which
                    have often been considered to belong to the Family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Coraciidae</hi>; and, according to Professor A. Milne-Edwards, no doubt should
                    exist on that point. Yet if any may be entertained it is in regard to one of
                    them, <hi rend="italic">Lepto-somus discolor,</hi> which on account of its
                    zygodactylous feet some authorities place among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cuculidae,</hi> while others have considered it the type of a distinct Family
                    <hi rend="italic">Lepto-somatidae.</hi> The genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brachypteraxias</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Atelornis</hi> present fewer
                    structural differences from the Rollers, and perhaps may be rightly placed with
                    them; but the species of the latter have long tarsi, and are believed to be of
                    terrestrial habit, which Rollers generally certainly are not. These very curious
                    and in some respects very interesting forms, which are peculiar to Madagascar,
                    are admirably described and illustrated by a series of twenty plates in the
                    great work of MM. Grandidier and A. Milne-Edwards on that island <hi
                    rend="italic">(Oiseaux,</hi> pp. 223-250), while the whole Family <hi
                    rend="italic">Coraciidae</hi> is the subject of a monograph by Mr Dresser, as a
                    companion volume to his monograph on the <hi rend="italic">∖∣ PPCiiuπPρ</hi> I A
