                <p><label type="entry">RIDLEY</label> Nicholas (c. 1500-1555), bishop of London, and
                    a martyr to the Reformation, was descended from a family long seated in
                    Northumberland. The second son of Nicholas Ridley of Unthank near Willimoteswick
                    in that county, he was born in the beginning of the 16th century. From the
                    grammar school of Newcastle-upon-Tyne he was sent to Pembroke College,
                    Cambridge, about 1518, being supported there by his uncle, Dr Robert Ridley,
                    fellow of Queen’s College. At the university he specially distinguished himself
                    in Greek. He proceeded B.A. 1522-23, became a fellow of his college, and, having
                    taken orders, was sent about 1527 at the expense of his uncle to study on the
                    Continent, first at the Sorbonne, Paris, and afterwards at Louvain. On his
                    return to Cambridge he was in 1530 chosen under-treasurer of the university; and
                    in 1534 he was senior proctor, when along with the vice-chancellor and the other
                    proctor Richard Wilkes he signed the decree of the university against the
                    jurisdiction of the pope in England. About this time he began to distinguish
                    himself as an orator and disputant, and was chosen chaplain of the university,
                    and “Magister Glo-meriae,”—an office in which most probably (for its duties have
                    been much disputed) he had to instruct the university entrants in Latin.
                    Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, after Ridley had proceeded B.D. in 1537,
                    appointed him one of his chaplains, and in April 1538 collated him to the
                    vicarage of Herne, Kent, where he began to preach the doctrines of the
                    Reformation. In 1540, having commenced doctor of divinity, he was made king’s
                    chaplain; and in the same year he was elected master of his college in
                    Cambridge. Soon after he was appointed a canon of Canterbury. At the instigation
                    of Bishop Gardiner he was accused in the bishop’s court of preaching against the
                    doctrine of the Six Articles, but after the matter had been referred to
                    commissioners specially appointed by the king he was acquitted. In 1545 he
                    renounced the doctrine of tran-substantiation, and was made, a canon of
                    Westminster. In 1547 he was presented by the fellows of Pembroke Hall to the
                    living of Soham, Cambridgeshire, and the same year was consecrated bishop of
                    Rochester. In 1550 he was one of the commissioners for examining Bishops
                    Gardiner and Bonner. He concurred in their deprivation, and succeeded the latter
                    in the see of London. In 1552, returning from Cambridge, he paid a visit to the
                    princess, afterwards Queen Mary, at Hunsdon, Hertfordshire. On account of her
                    unqualified condemnation of the Reformed doctrines, he from this time concurred
                    in the proposals to exclude her from the throne, and he signed the will of
                    Edward VI. settling the crown on Lady Jane Grey. On the death of the king, he,
                    in a sermon at St Paul’s Cross, 16th July <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0920-0569-0550"/>1553, affirmed that Mary was illegitimate, and
                    predicted that her accession would be disastrous to the religious interests of
                    England. After the proclamation of Mary he set out for Framlingham to confess
                    his offences against her, but was met with a warrant for his arrest and was
                    committed to the Tower. In March 1554 he was sent down, along with Cranmer and
                    Latimer, to Oxford to be tried before a committee of convocation. He was
                    convicted of heresy, and after refusing to recant was sentenced to death. The
                    trial having been declared irregular, he was, in September 1555, along with
                    Cranmer and Latimer, tried by special commissioners, and on the 16th October
                    lie, in company with Latimer, was burnt at the stake at Oxford.</p>
