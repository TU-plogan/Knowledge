                <p><label type="entry">RED RIVER</label>. Three at least of the many Red Rivers of
                    the world deserve to be mentioned,—(1) the Red River or Fleuve Rouge, the
                    Songcoi or Thao of the Anamese, the Hoang-Kiang of the Chinese, which flows
                    through the heart of <hi rend="smallcaps">Tong-king</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(q.v.)</hi>; (2) the Red River which rises in the Stake Plain in Texas (U.S.),
                    passes through a magnificent canon 100 miles long, and from 200 to 1000 feet
                    deep, and furnishes a navigable channel of 1200 miles before it reaches the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mississippi</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> (3) the Red River of the North, a somewhat smaller stream, which, rising
                    in Elbow Lake (so called from its shape) in Minnesota (U.S.), not far from the
                    sources of the Mississippi, crosses into Canada at Pembina, and falls into Lake
                    Winnipeg, after a course of 565 miles (110 in Canada). The Red River of the
                    Mississippi presents the physical geographer with a phenomenon nowhere
                    reproduced on the same scale, —a great raft of timber and driftwood, which, in
                    spite of the labours of Captain Shreve (1835-39) and General Williamson and
                    Captain Linnard (1841-45), had by 1871 increased so as to block the channel for
                    45 miles between Spring Creek and Caroline Bluff. The Red River of the North is
                    equally famous as the scene of some of the leading events in the history of the
                    North-West.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Red River Settlement.—</hi> In 1811 the fifth earl of
                    Selkirk (1771-1820), who had devoted special attention to emigration as a means
                    of providing for the surplus population of the Scottish Highlands, obtained from
                    the Hudson’s Bay Company a grant of land in what was then called the district of
                    Ossiniboia (Assiniboia). In 1813 a settlement was founded by his agent, Mr Miles
                    Macdonell, on the banks of the Red River, the first fort (Fort Daer) being at
                    Pembina. By 1814 the settlers numbered 200. The North-West Fur-Traders of
                    Manchester (a company which was the bitterest rival of the Hudson’s Bay Company
                    till the two amalgamated in 1821) did all they could by force and fraud to break
                    up the colony, which, by 1816, had taken up its headquarters at Fort Douglas, on
                    the site of the present town of Winnipeg. The French-Indian half-breeds
                    (Bois-Brûlés) were incited against it, and its mills and houses were burned. The
                    earl of Selkirk, arriving on the scene, succeeded in reorganizing the community,
                    to which the name of Kildonan was now given, after Kildonan in Helmsdale,
                    Sutherland-shire. He found himself personally involved in a very network of
                    hostile intrigue; but the colony was saved, and after his premature death it
                    continued to be more or less supported by his heirs till 1824. In 1835 Lord
                    Selkirk’s territorial claims were transferred to the Hudson’s Bay Company, who
                    undertook to pay the expenses incurred by the family. At that date the
                    population of the settlement consisted of about 5000 Highlanders, Bois-Brûlés,
                    English half-breeds, and retired company officials. At the transfer of
                    territorial jurisdiction to the Canadian Government in 1869 the Bois-Brûlés,
                    under a certain Louis Riel (son of a Frenchman who had built the first mill on
                    the Red river), revolted and declared an independent republic. Colonel (now
                    Lord) Wolseley was despatched with a force of 1400 men, and without bloodshed
                    took possession of Fort Garry on 24th August 1870. The only striking feature of
                    the expedition was the remarkable energy with which the difficulties of
                    transport were overcome. Riel in 1885 became the leader of another unsuccessful
                    insurrection of half-breeds in the same region.</p>
