                    (1758-1823), who played a considerable part in the early spread and development
                    of the Kantian philosophy, was born at Vienna in 1758. At the age of fourteen he
                    entered the Jesuit College of St Anna with the intention of becoming a priest of
                    the order. The order was dissolved by the pope in the following year; but young
                    Reinhold, being full of Catholic and monastic zeal, joined a similar college of
                    the order of St Barnabas in 1774. There he remained nine years, before the end
                    of which his scientific and philosophic studies had completely estranged him
                    from the life and aims of the cloister. In 1783 he fled to North Germany, and
                    settled in Weimar, where he became Wieland’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >collaborateur</hi> on the <hi rend="italic">German Mercury,</hi> and eventually
                    his son-in-law. In the <hi rend="italic">German Mercury</hi> he published, in
                    the years 1786-87, his <hi rend="italic">Briefe über die Kantische
                    Philosophie,</hi> which, by their clear and eloquent exposition were most
                    important in making Kant known to a wider circle of readers. Reinhold himself
                    had read the <hi rend="italic">Critique</hi> five times without a single ray of
                    light; in the end it was the ethical side of the system by which he found
                    himself attracted and convinced. As a result of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Letters,</hi> Reinhold at once received a call to the neighbouring university
                    of Jena, where he taught from 1787 to 1794, and largely contributed to make
                    Jena, after Königsberg, the second home of the Kantian philosophy. In 1789 he
                    published his chief work, the <hi rend="italic">Versuch einer neuen Theorie des
                    menschlichen Vorstellungsvermögens,</hi> in which he attempted to simplify the
                    Kantian theory and make it more of a unity. In 1794 he accepted a call to Kiel,
                    but his departure from Jena marks the zenith of his reputation. He taught at
                    Kiel till his death in 1823, but his independent activity was at an end. His
                    essentially receptive and impressible nature yielded first to the <pb break="no"

                    on grounds of religious feeling, towards Jacobi, whom he in turn deserted for
                    the so-called “rational idealism <hi rend="italic">”</hi> of Bardili.</p>
                <p>Reinlioldls historical importance belongs entirely to his earlier activity. The
                    development of the Kantian standpoint contained in the <hi rend="italic">Xew
                    Theory of the Human Faculty of Ideas</hi> (1789), and in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fundament ties philosophischcn Wissens</hi> (1791), was called by its author
                    “Elcrnentarphilosophie.” Endeavouring to buildup the system out of simpler
                    elements, Reinhold starts from the mere fact of consciousness of the existence
                    of mental states (“Yorstel-lungeu” or ideas). Every idea carries with it the
                    reference to a subject, whose idea it is, and to an object, of which it is the
                    idea. This double reference explains why every idea consists, as Kant
                    maintained, of “form” and “matter.” In its “form ”lies the reference to the
                    subject, iu its “matter” the reference to an object. Hence, too, we see why the
                    thing-in-itself, though necessarily existent, is at the same time necessarily
                    unknowable, seeing that all knowledge implies a subject-derived element. The
                    rest of Reinhold’s emendations to Kant are little more than suggested
                    improvements in terminology.</p>
