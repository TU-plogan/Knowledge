                    holds a high and distinctive place among the English novelists of the third
                    quarter of the 19th century. The son of an Oxfordshire squire, he was born at
                    Ipsden in 1814, and was educated for the bar. He entered Magdalen College,
                    Oxford, proceeded B.A. in 1835, with a third class in classics, was elected
                    Vinerian Reader in 1842, and was called to the bar (Lincoln’s Inn) in 1843. It
                    was comparatively late in his life that he made his first appearance as an
                    author, but he showed at once that he had subjected himself to a laborious
                    apprenticeship to the study of life and literature.</p>

                <p>He began as a dramatist, and this his first ambition shaped and coloured his work
                    to the end. It was his own wish that the word “dramatist <hi rend="italic"
                    >”</hi> should stand first in the description of his occupations on his
                    tombstone. He was dramatist first and novelist afterwards, not merely
                    chronologically but in his aims as an author, always having an eye to
                    stage-effect in scene and situation as well as in dialogue. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gold,</hi> his first play (1850), was but a moderate success. He did not
                    achieve popularity till 1856, when he produced <hi rend="italic">It <hi
                    rend="superscript">,</hi> s Never Too Late to Mend</hi> , a novel written with
                    the purpose of reforming abuses in prison discipline and the treatment of
                    criminals. The prosecution of his moral purpose carried him too far for most of
                    his readers; he described prison life with a minuteness and fidelity— the result
                    of laborious studies of blue-books and newspapers and personal inquiries—which
                    become at times tedious and revolting; but the power of the descriptions was
                    undeniable, and the interest of the story, in spite of all overelaboration of
                    painful details, was profound and thrilling. The truth of some of his details
                    was challenged, and the novelist showed himself a pungent controversialist. From
                    first to last he defended himself with vigour and great strength of language
                    against all attempts to rebut his contentions or damage his literary property.
                    <hi rend="italic">It ’ s Never Too Late to Mend</hi> was his first great
                    success, but before this he had gained the respect of critics with two shorter
                    novels, <hi rend="italic">Peg Woffington</hi> (1852), a close study of life and
                    character behind the scenes, and <hi rend="italic">Christie Johnstone</hi>
                    (1853), an equally close study of Scotch fisher folk, an extraordinary <hi
                    rend="italic">tour de force</hi> for the son of an English squire, whether we
                    consider the dialect or the skill with which he enters into alien habits of
                    thought. He had also established his position as a dramatist by writing (in
                    combination with Mr Tom Taylor) a stage version of <hi rend="italic">Peg
                    Woffington</hi> under the title of <hi rend="italic">Masks and Faces</hi>
                    (1854), the most successful and the most frequently reproduced of his plays,
                    besides three that were less successful, <hi rend="italic">The Courier of
                    Lyons</hi> (a powerful melodrama), <hi rend="italic">Two Loves and a Life,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">The King's Rivals</hi> (1854). From 1856 onwards he kept
                    his position in the foremost rank of contemporary novelists. Five minor novels
                    followed in quick succession,— <hi rend="italic">The Course of True Love never
                    did Run Smooth</hi> (1857), <hi rend="italic">Jack of all Trades</hi> (1858),
                    <hi rend="italic">The Autobiography of a Thief</hi> (1858), <hi rend="italic"
                    >Love Me Little, Love Me Long</hi> (1859), <hi rend="italic">The Double
                    Marriage, or White Lies</hi> (1860). Then appeared, in 1861, what most critics
                    regard as his masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">The Cloister and the Heart¡{.</hi>
                    He had dealt with the subject two years before in a short story in <hi
                    rend="italic">Once a Week,</hi> but, seeing its capabilities, he returned to it
                    and expanded it into its present form. As a picture of manners it is broad and
                    full; yet amply as the novelist illustrates the times he very rarely becomes
                    tedious or allows the thrilling interest of the story to lapse. Returning from
                    the 15th century to modern English life, he next produced another startling
                    novel with a purpose, <hi rend="italic">Hard Cash</hi> (1863), in which he
                    strove to direct attention to the abuses of private lunatic asylums. Three more
                    such novels, in two of which at least the moral purpose, though fully kept in
                    view, was not allowed to obstruct the rapid flow of thrilling incident, were
                    afterwards undertaken,— <hi rend="italic">Foul Play</hi> (1869), in which he
                    exposed the iniquities of ship-knackers, and paved the way for the labours of Mr
                    Plimsoll; <hi rend="italic">Put Yourself in his Place</hi> (1870), in which he
                    grappled with the tyrannous outrages of trades-unions; and <hi rend="italic">A
                    Woman-Hater</hi> (1877), in which he gave a helping hand to the advocates of
                    woman’s rights. The <hi rend="italic">Wandering Heir</hi> (1875), of which he
                    also wrote a version for the stage, was suggested by the Tichborne trial.
                    Outside the line of these moral and occasional works Reade produced three that
                    might be classified as psychological, inasmuch as they were elaborate studies of
                    character,— <hi rend="italic">Griffith Gaunt</hi> (1866), <hi rend="italic">A
                    Terrible Temptation</hi> (1871), <hi rend="italic">A Simpleton</hi> (1873). The
                    first of these was in his own opinion the best of his novels, and his own
                    opinion was probably right. He was wrong, however, in his own conception of his
                    powers as a dramatist. At intervals throughout his literary career he sought to
                    gratify his dramatic ambition, hiring a theatre and engaging a company for the
                    representation of his own plays. An example of his persistency was seen in the
                    case of <hi rend="italic">Foul Play.</hi> He wrote this in 1869 in combination
                    with Mr Dion Boucicault with a view to stage adaptation. The play was more or
                    less a failure <hi rend="italic">;</hi> but he produced another version alone in
                    1877, under the title of <hi rend="italic">A Scuttled Ship,</hi> and the failure
                    was pronounced. His greatest success as a dramatist attended his last attempt—
                    <hi rend="italic">Drink</hi> —an adaptation of Zola’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >L'Assommoir,</hi> produced in 1879. At his death in 1884 (11th April) Reade
                    left behind him a completed novel, <hi rend="italic">A Perilous Secret,</hi>
                    which showed no falling off in the art of weaving a complicated plot and
                    devising thrilling situations.</p>
                <p>It was characteristic of Reade’s open and combative nature that he admitted the
                    public freely to the secrets of his method of composition. He spoke about his
                    method in his prefaces; he introduced himself into one of his novels—“Dr Rolfe”
                    in <hi rend="italic">A Terrible Temptation;</hi> and by his will he left his
                    workshop and his accumulation of materials open for inspection for two years
                    after his death. It appears that he had collected an enormous mass of materials
                    for his study of human nature, from personal observation, from newspapers, books
                    of travel, blue-books of commissions of inquiry, from miscellaneous reading.
                    This vast collection of notes, cuttings, extracts, gathered together week by
                    week and year by year, is classified and arranged in huge ledgers and note-books
                    duly paged and indexed. He had planned a great work on <hi rend="italic">“</hi>
                    the wisdom and folly of nations,” dealing with social, political, and domestic
                    details, and it was chiefly for this that his collection was destined, but in
                    passing he found the materials very useful as a store of incidents and
                    suggestions. A collector of the kind was bound to be systematic, otherwise his
                    collection would have fallen into inextricable confusion, and Reade’s collection
                    contains many remarkable curiosities in classification and tabulation. On the
                    value of this method for his art there has been much discussion, the prevalent
                    opinion being that his imagination was overwhelmed and stifled by it. He himself
                    strenuously maintained the contrary; and it must be admitted that <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">priori</hi> critics have not rightly
                    understood the use that he made of his laboriously collected facts. He did not
                    merely shovel the contents of his note - books into his novels; they served
                    rather as an atmosphere of reality in which he worked, so that his novels were
                    like pictures painted in the open air. His imagination worked freely among them
                    and was quickened rather than impeded by their suggestions of things suited to
                    the purpose in hand; and it is probably to his close and constant contact with
                    facts, acting on an imagination naturally fertile, that we owe his marvellous
                    and unmatchable abundance of incident. Even in his novels of character there is
                    no meditative and analytic stagnation; the development of character is shown
                    through a rapid unceasing progression of significant facts. This rapidity of
                    movement was perhaps partly the result of his dramatic studies; it was probably
                    in writing for the stage that he learned the value of keeping the attention of
                    his readers incessantly on the alert. The hankering after stage effect, while it
                    saved him from dulness, often betrayed him into rough exaggeration, especially
                    in his comic scenes. But the gravest defect in his work is a defect of temper.
                    His view of human life, especially of the life of women, is harsh, almost brutal
                    <hi rend="italic">;</hi> his knowledge of frailties and vices is obtruded with
                    repellent force; and he cannot, with all his skill and power as a storyteller,
                    be numbered among the great artists who warm the heart and help to improve the
                    conduct. But as a moral satirist and castigator, which was the function he
                    professed over and above that of a story-teller, he undoubtedly did good
                    service, both indirectly in his novels and directly in his own name. (W. M.)</p>
