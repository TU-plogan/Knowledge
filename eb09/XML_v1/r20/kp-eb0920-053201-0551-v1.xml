                <p><label type="entry">RIBERA</label> Jusepe, or, in Italian, Giuseppe (1588— 1656),
                    commonly called Lo Spagnoletto, or the Little Spaniard, a leading painter of the
                    Neapolitan or partly of the Spanish school, was born near Valencia in Spain, at
                    Xativa, now named S. Felipe, on 12th January 1588. His parents intended him for
                    a literary or learned career; but, having an innate tendency to design, he
                    neglected the regular studies, and entered the school of the Spanish painter
                    Francisco Ribalta. Fired with a longing to study art in its Italian
                    headquarters, he somehow, while still quite a youth, made his way to Rome,
                    worked vehemently, and struggled with hunger and destitution. Early in the 17th
                    century a cardinal noticed him in the streets of Rome drawing from the frescos
                    on a palace façade; he took up the ragged stripling and housed him in his
                    mansion. Artists had then already bestowed upon the alien student, who was
                    perpetually copying all sorts of objects in art and in nature, the nickname of
                    Lo Spagnoletto. In the cardinal’s household Ribera was comfortable but
                    dissatisfied; he found his studies in abeyance, and one day he decamped. He then
                    betook himself to the famous painter Michelangelo da Caravaggio, the head of the
                    naturalist school, called also the school of the Tene-brosi, or shadow-painters,
                    owing to the excessive contrasts of light and shade which marked their style. In
                    this method of art Ribera, though not claiming the first place as initiator, was
                    destined to rank as hardly second to Caravaggio himself. The Italian master gave
                    every encouragement to the Spaniard, but not for long, as he died in 1609.
                    Ribera, who had in the first instance studied chiefly from Raphael and the
                    Caracci, had by this time acquired so much mastery over the tenebroso style that
                    his performances were barely distinguishable from Caravaggio’s own. He now went
                    to Parma, and worked after the frescos of Correggio with great zeal and
                    efficiency; in the museum of Madrid is his Jacob’s Ladder, which is regarded as
                    his <hi rend="italic">cdιef-doeuvre</hi> in the Correggesque manner. From Parma
                    Spagnoletto returned to Rome, where he resumed the style of Caravaggio, which
                    was doubtless more conformable to his natural bent, and shortly afterwards he
                    migrated to Naples, which became his permanent home.</p>
                <p>Ribera was as yet still poor and inconspicuous, but a rich picture-dealer in
                    Naples soon discerned in him all the stuff of a successful painter, and gave him
                    his daughter in marriage. This w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> as the turning
                    point in the Spaniard’s fortunes. He painted a Martyrdom of St Bartholomew,
                    which the father-in-law exhibited from his balcony to a rapidly increasing and
                    admiring crowd. The popular excitement grew to so noisy a height as to attract
                    the attention of the Spanish viceroy the Count de Monterey. From this nobleman
                    and from the king of Spain, Philip IV., commissions now flowed in upon Ribera.
                    Various professional honours followed; he painted with incessant vigour; his
                    house became a centre of fashionable concourse; and he made vast sums of money.
                    In the streets he only appeared in his carriage—then a sure criterion of
                    affluence. After a while he found it necessary to curb his own and his patrons’
                    appetite for work, and he limited himself to six hours in the day, ending
                    towards noon. With prosperity came grasping and jealous selfishness.
                    Spagnoletto, chief in a triumvirate of greed, his abettors being a Greek
                    painter, Belisario Corenzio, and a Neapolitan, Giambattista Caracciolo,
                    determined that Naples should be an artistic monopoly; by intrigue, terrorizing,
                    and personal violence on occasion they kept aloof all competitors. Annibale
                    Caracci, the Cavalier d’Arpino, Guido, Domenichino, all of them successively
                    invited to work in Naples, found the place too hot to hold them. Domenichino was
                    so persecuted and victimized that his life was probably abridged by these truly
                    “tenebrous” machinations. The cabal ended at the time of Caracciolo’s death in
                    1641.</p>
                <p>The close of Ribera’s triumphant career has been variously related. If we are to
                    believe Dominici, the historian of Neapolitan art, he totally disappeared from
                    Naples in 1648 and was no more heard of,—this being the sequel of the abduction,
                    by Don John of Austria, son of Philip IV., of the painter’s beautiful only
                    daughter Maria Rosa. Dominici indeed will not even allow that Ribera was a
                    Spaniard by birth; he alleges that the painter, though of Spanish descent, was
                    born at Gallipoli, in the province of Lecce, kingdom of Naples. But these
                    assertions have not availed to displace the earlier and well-authenticated
                    statement that Ribera, a genuine Spaniard in the fullest sense, died peaceably
                    and wealthy in Naples in 1656. His own signature on his pictures is constantly
                    “Jusepe de Ribera, Espanol.” His daughter, so far from being disgraced by an
                    abduction, married a Spanish nobleman who became a minister of the viceroy.</p>
                <p>The pictorial style of Spagnoletto is extremely powerful; or one might better
                    define its special quality as immensely forcible, equally sustaining the test of
                    a distant and general or of a close and scrutinizing view. In his earlier style,
                    founded (as we have seen) sometimes on Caravaggio and sometimes on the wholly
                    diverse method of Correggio, the study of Spanish and Venetian masters can
                    likewise be traced. Along with his massive and predominating shadows, he
                    retained from first to last great strength of local colouring. His forms, though
                    ordinary and partly gross, are correct; the impression of his works gloomy and
                    startling. He delighted in subjects of horror: an agonizing martyrdom—the
                    gridiron of Lawrence, the flaying knife of Bartholomew, or the vulture of
                    Prometheus—had for him no repulsion but a grim fascination. Ho had many
                    imitators, his influence extending from Naples to other parts of Italy, and also
                    to his native Spain. Salvator Rosa and Luca Giordano were his most distinguished
                    pupils; also Giovanni Do, Enrico Fiammingo, Michelangelo Fracanzani, and Aniello
                    Falcone, who was the first considerable painter of battle-pieces. Among Ribera’s
                    principal works should bo named St Januarius Emerging from the Furnace, in the
                    cathedral of Naples; the Descent from the Cross, in the Neapolitan Certosa,
                    generally regarded as his masterpiece; the Adoration of the Shepherds (a late
                    work, 1650), now in the Louvre; the Martyrdom of St Bartholomew, in the museum
                    of Madrid; the Pietà in the sacristy of S. Martino, Naples. His mythologie
                    subjects are generally unpleasant—such as the Silenus, in the Studi Gallery of
                    Naples, and Venus Lamenting over Adonis, in the Corsini Gallery of Rome. The
                    Louvre contains altogether twenty-five of his paintings; the London National
                    Gallery two—one of them, a Pietà, being an excellent though not exactly a
                    leading specimen. He executed several fine male portraits; among others his own
                    likeness, now in the collection at Alton Towers. He also produced twenty-six
                    etchings, ably treated. For the use of his pupils, he drew a number of
                    elementary designs, which in 1650 were etched by Francisco Fernandez, and which
                    continued much in <pb break="no"
