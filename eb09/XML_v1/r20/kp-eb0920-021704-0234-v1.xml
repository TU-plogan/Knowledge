                <p>by Piotrkbw. The area is 4765 square miles. Its southern part stretches over the
                    hilly plateau of Poland, which consists of short ridges of hills from 800 to
                    2000 feet in height, intersected by deep valleys, and is known as the Sandomir
                    Heights. These heights are thickly wooded; the valleys, running west and east
                    and watered by several tributaries of the Vistula, are excellently adapted for
                    agriculture. Farther north in its central portion the contour of the government
                    is level, the soil fertile, and the surface, which is diversified here and there
                    with wood, is further broken up by occasional spurs, 800 feet in height, of the
                    Lysa G6ra Mountains. The northern districts, where the Pilica joins the Vistula,
                    consist of low flat tracts with undefined valleys, exposed to frequent floods
                    and covered over large areas with marshes; the basin of the Pilica, notorious
                    for its unliealthiness, is throughout a low marshy plain. Devonian,
                    Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic deposits appear in the southern plateau,
                    Chalk and Jurassic in the middle, and Tertiary in the north. Wide tracts are
                    covered with Glacial deposits,—the Scandinavian erratics reaching as far south
                    as Ilza; these last in their turn are covered with widely spreading post-Glacial
                    lacustrine deposits. The Vistula skirts the government on the south and east and
                    is an important means of communication, several hundreds of light boats <hi
                    rend="italic">(gcilary)</hi> descending the river every year, while steamers ply
                    as far up as S§domierz. The S§domierz district is occasionally exposed to
                    disastrous inundations of the river. The tributaries of the Vistula (Radomka,
                    Kamienna, and several others) are but short and small, while those of the Pilica
                    are mere streams sluggishly flowing amidst marshes.</p>
                <p>The population (644,830 in 1882) is Polish for the most part, one-seventh being
                    Jews. According to creed the proportions are— Roman Catholic 840־ per cent.,
                    Jewish 146־, Protestant 13־, and Greek 0T per cent. The chief occupation of the
                    inhabitants is agriculture, the principal crops being wheat, oats, rye,
                    potatoes, and beetroot (for sugar). Corn is exported and potatoes largely used
                    for distillation. In 1879 there were 148 manufacturing establishments (197 in
                    1883), employing 1708 hands, with an aggregate production of 2,121,000 roubles
                    (£212,000), the more important being tanneries, flour-mills, sugar-works, and
                    several machinery aud iron-works. These last are suffering, however, from want
                    of wood-fuel, and many of them have recently been closed. Trade is not very
                    extensive, the only channel of commerce being the Vistula. There is no lack of
                    philanthropic institutions within the government (most of them founded early in
                    this century), but nevertheless the sanitary condition of the people is
                    deplorable. <hi rend="italic">Plica polonica,</hi> which is endemic in the
                    government of Radom as well as in that of Kielce, is widely diffused, no fewer
                    than 15,000 persons suffering from it, and cognate maladies, such as goitre,
                    scabies, and <hi rend="italic">tinea capitis,</hi> are also widely
                    prevalent.</p>
                <p>The educational institutions include two lycees or gymnasia and two progymnasia
                    (all at Radom), with 813 male and 287 female pupils, a normal school, a
                    theological seminary at Sandomir, and 170 primary schools (112 in villages),
                    with 8465 scholars.</p>
                <p>The government is divided into eight districts, the chief towns of which
                    are—Radom, Ilza (2750), Konsk (6275), Kozienice (5690), Opatow (5200), Opoczno
                    (5585), and Sgdomierz or Sandomir (6265, or 14,710 including suburbs). Zavihvost
                    (3700) is an important custom-house. Ostrowiec (5290), Staszow (6910), Przedborz
                    (6345), and Szidlowiec (5290) have municipal institutions.</p>
