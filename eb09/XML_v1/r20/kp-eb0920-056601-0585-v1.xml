                    thoroughly, retaining only the practical part of it. Thus either title his book
                    has received is correct, the <hi rend="italic">Little Talmud</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decisions of Rab Al-phez.</hi> Late in the 12th century and in the
                    13th a host of rabbins respectively attacked and defended Al-phasi (see Rabad
                    III., and Rλmban), whilst others commented on him (see below). One of the
                    commentaries accompanying the Riph is by Rashi. This commentary, however, which
                    is now an integral part of the book, was not written for it by Rashi himself,
                    who could scarcely have known of Riph’s existence, and much less of his work.
                    The fact is the enterprising publisher of the second edition (Venice, 1521-22,
                    fol.), the famous Daniel Bombergi, had one of the three recensions which Rashi
                    had made on the Talmud excerpted and applied to corresponding parts of the Riph
                    which has the very wording of the Talmud, or something near it. Where no Rashi
                    was to be found in the passages of the <pb break="no"

                    Riph was not only a great Talmudist, but also a man of the greatest magnanimity
                    and highest morality, as may be seen from the following two facts. When R.
                    Yishak Ibn Albalia, who had been his bitterest enemy, lay at the point of death,
                    he recommended his son to Riph, who received him with the greatest kindness, and
                    at once adopted him as son. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    point of death he recommended to the congregation of Lucena for successor, not
                    his own learned and virtuous son Ya'akob, but the yet more learned, though not
                    more virtuous, R. Yoseph Ibn Migash, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Although Riph’s works which are known are only two, the editions of one of these
