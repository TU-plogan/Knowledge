                <p><label type="entry">BURNET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label> (1635-1715),
                    best known as the author of <hi rend="italic">The Sacred Theory of the
                    Earth,</hi> was born at Croft in Yorkshire about the year 1635, but is supposed
                    to have been descended of a Scottish family. He was educated at the free school
                    of Northallerton, and in June 1651 was admitted a pensioner of Clare Hall at
                    Cambridge, under the tuition of Tillotson, who continued to remember him with
                    kindness. In the year 1654 he removed to Christ’s College, on the election of Dr
                    Cudworth to the mastership, and there he obtained a fellowship in the year 1657.
                    In 1661 he became senior proctor of the university. He was successively domestic
                    tutor to Charles duke of Bolton, and to James earl of Ossory, afterwards duke of
                    Ormond, grandson to the first duke; and by the interest of the latter nobleman
                    he was chosen master of the Charterhouse in 1685. Among the electors some of the
                    bishops opposed him on account of his wearing a lay habit; but the duke was
                    satisfied that he possessed the more essential qualifications of a life and
                    conversation suitable to his clerical character. After this appointment he took
                    the degree of D.D. In his capacity of master he made a noble stand against the
                    illegal attempts to admit Andrew Popham as a pensioner of the house, strenuously
                    opposing an order of the 26th of December 1686, addressed by James II. to the
                    governors dispensing with the statutes for the occasion.</p>
                <p>Dr Burnet published his <hi rend="italic">Telluris Theoria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Sacra,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sacred Theory of the Earth,</hi> at London in
                    1681. This work, containing a fanciful theory of the earth’s structure,
                    attracted an unusual share of public attention, and he was afterwards encouraged
                    to issue an English translation, which was printed in folio, 1684-1689. Addison
                    commended the author in a Latin ode, but his theory was attacked by Dr Keill, Mr
                    Whiston, and Mr Warren, to all of whom he returned answers. His reputation
                    obtained for him an introduction at court by Archbishop Tillotson, whom he
                    succeeded as clerk of the closet to King William. He seemed already to be on the
                    direct road to much higher preferment, when he suddenly marred his prospects by
                    the publication, in 1692, of a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Archao-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">logioe</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophicae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi><hi rend="italic">sive Doctrina antiqua de Rerum Originibus,</hi> in
                    which lie treated the Mosaic account of the fall of man as an allegory. The
                    method of treatment excited a great clamour against him; and the king was
                    obliged to remove him from his office at court. Ot this book, an English
                    translation was executed by Mr Foxton, Lond. 1729, 8vo. Dr Burnet published
                    several other minor works before his death, which took place at the
                    Charter-house on the 27tl∣ September 1715. Two posthumous works were published
                    several years after his death— <hi rend="italic">De Fide</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et Officiis Christianorum,</hi> 1723, <hi rend="italic">anà De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Statu</hi><hi rend="italic">Mortuorum et Resurgentium
                    Tractatus,</hi> 1723; in which he maintained the doctrine of a middle state, the
                    millennium, and the limited duration of future punishment. A <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life of Dr Burnet</hi> by Heathcote appeared in 1759.</p>
