                <p><label type="entry">BUDGET</label> (lit. a bag or small sack), the name applied
                    to an account of the ways and means by which a minister of finance purposes to
                    defray the expenditure of the state. In the United Kingdom the chancellor of the
                    exchequer, usually in April, lays before the House of Commons a statement of the
                    actual results of revenue and expenditure in the past finance year ending March
                    31, showing how far his estimates have been realized, and what surplus or
                    deficit there has been in the income as compared with the expenditure. This is
                    accompanied by another statement in which the chancellor gives an estimate of
                    what the produce of the revenue may be in the year just entered upon, supposing
                    the taxes and duties to remain as they were-in the past year, and also an
                    estimate of what the expenditure will be in the current year. If the estimated
                    revenue, after allowing for normal increase of the principal sources of income,
                    be less than the estimated expenditure, this is deemed a case for the imposition
                    of some new, or the increase of some existing, tax or taxes. On the other hand,
                    if the estimated revenue shows a large surplus over the estimated expenditure,
                    there is room for remitting or reducing some tax or taxes, and the extent of
                    this relief is generally limited to the amount of surplus realized in the
                    previous year. The chancellor of the exchequer has to take parliament into
                    confidence on his estimates, both as regards revenue and expenditure; and when
                    the taxation and expenditure obtain the assent of parliament, the results as
                    thus adjusted become the final budget estimate for the year. This system of
                    annual review and adjustment of the public finances obtains not only in the
                    British colonies, but is carried out, with remarkable despatch for so great an
                    empire, in British India. The Indian budget, giving the results of income and
                    expenditure in the year ending December 31, and the prospective estimates, is
                    laid before the Imperial Parliament in the course of the ensuing session. The
                    budget, though modified by different forms, has also long been practised in
                    France, the United States, and other constitutional countries, and of late years
                    has in some cases been adopted by arbitrary powers. Russia began the publication
                    of annual budgets in 1866; Egypt has followed the example; and Turkey, if
                    financially reinstated, will have to submit to a more strict account of her
                    income and expenditure. Apart from national budgets, to be discriminated (1) as
                    budgets passing under parliamentary scrutiny and debate from year to year, and
                    (2) budgets emitted on executive authority, there are in all the greater
                    countries local and municipal taxations and expenditures of only less account
                    than the national. The ordinary budget of the city of Paris has increased from
                    £1,600,000 in the reign of Louis Philippe to £8,000,000 at the present time;
                    while the extraordinary budget, relating chiefly to public improvements and the
                    city debt, is over £4,000,000 more. In federal governments, such as the United
                    States, the German Empire, or the Argentine Republic, the budgets of the several
                    states of the federation have to be consulted, as well as the federal budget,
                    for a knowledge of the finances. The local taxation of the United Kingdom is
                    equal to nearly one half the imperial revenue, and requires in its various
                    provinces the same process of examination. The budget is an essential part of
                    the machinery of representative Governments; and in the rapid progress of state
                    loans, it has begun to be acknowledged by despotic Governments as a necessary
                    basis of confidence between them and their creditors.</p>
