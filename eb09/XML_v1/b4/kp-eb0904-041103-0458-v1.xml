                    originally <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin Kuhorn,</hi> an eminent German reformer,
                    born at Schelestadt, a town of Alsace, near Strasburg. At the age of fifteen he
                    entered the order of St Dominic, and as he was a youth of great promise he was
                    sent to prosecute his studies at Heidelberg. There he studied the works of
                    Erasmus and Luther, and was present at a disputation of the latter with some of
                    the Roman Catholic doctors. He became a convert to the Reformed Church,
                    abandoned his order, and soon afterwards married a nun. He did not, however,
                    remain strictly a Lutheran. On the great question of the sacrament of the Lord’s
                    Supper, his opinions were decidedly those of Zwingli rather than of Luther.
                    Although differing from them in doctrine he was anxious to be in church unity
                    with the Lutheran party, and constantly endeavoured to bring about a coalition.
                    In 1548 he was sent for to Augsburg to sign the agreement, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Interim,</hi> between the Papists and Protestants, His warm
                    opposition to this project exposed him to many difficulties and hardships, which
                    induced him to accept the invitation of ∙. Archbishop Cranmer to fix his
                    residence in England. On his arrival, in 1549, he was appointed to teach
                    theology in the university of Cambridge. King Edward VI. had the greatest regard
                    for Bucer. Having heard that he had suffered much from the cold, from want of a
                    German stove, he sent him a hundred crowns to purchase one. Bucer died of a
                    complication of disorders in 1551, and was buried at Cam bridge with great
                    funereal pomp. Five years afterwards, in Mary’s reign, his body was dug up and
                    burnt, and his tomb demolished; but it was subsequently re-constructed by order
