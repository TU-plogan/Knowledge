                <p><label type="entry">BRODIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Benjamin
                    Collins</hi></label>, Bart., a distinguished physiologist and surgeon, was born
                    in 1783 at Winterslow, county of Wilts, and died at Broome Park, 21st October
                    1862, in the 79th year of his age. His paternal grandfather, connected with the
                    family of Brodie of Brodie, was born in Banffshire about the year 1710, and came
                    as an adventurer to London, where he acquired considerable wealth as an army
                    clothier. One of his sons, the father of the subject of this notice, was
                    educated at the Charter House, and afterwards at Worcester College, Oxford,
                    where he took holy orders. Here he probably acquired the friendship of the first
                    Lord Holland, with whom he afterwards lived at Holland House. The second Lord
                    Holland having purchased the estate of Winterslow, Mr Brodie rented a cottage
                    near the same place. The second Lord Holland died in 1774, and directed in his
                    will that Mr Brodie should have offered to him the presentation of the first of
                    three livings which he had in his gift when a vacancy occurred. This event took
                    place in consequence of the death of the incumbent of Winterslow, and Mr Brodie
                    became rector of the parish. In 1775 he married one of the daughters of Mr
                    Collins of Milford, a banker of Salisbury. They had six children,—four sons and
                    two daughters,—and the subject of this sketch was their fourth child.</p>
                <p>He received his early education from his father, who appears to have been a man
                    of energy, ability, and method, and at an early age he had acquired a
                    considerable knowledge of the classics. When the time for choosing a profession
                    arrived, his father intimated to him that he was intended for that of medicine,
                    and accordingly, in the autumn of 1801, he began to attend the anatomical
                    lectures of the celebrated Abernethy in London. As his family was connected by
                    marriage with several of the leading members of the profession, such as Dr
                    Denman (the father of the first Lord Denman), Dr Baillie, and Sir Richard Croft,
                    the young student enjoyed many advantages of distinguished professional society,
                    but it does not appear that at this period of his life he had any predilection
                    for medical studies or any aptitude for surgical work. The great eminence as an
                    operator to which he afterwards attained was gained, as he himself said, by
                    persistent application and perseverance.</p>
                <p>He devoted great attention to the clinical study of disease, and began to make an
                    elaborate series of notes of cases which came under his observation. This habit
                    he continued throughout life, and thus gradually amassed that enormous amount of
                    practical experience which afterwards gave his advice as a consulting surgeon
                    such weight.</p>
                <p>Like most young adventurers in the fields of science of that day, he early began
                    to teach. He gave many courses of lectures upon anatomy, not only as it bore on
                    surgical practice, but as a science having important physiological and
                    teleological relations. In 1808 he became assistantsurgeon to St George’s
                    Hospital, and he continued on the staff of that institution for over thirty
                    years. This gave him the opportunity of teaching clinically, and he soon
                    acquired a reputation as an able and fluent extempore speaker. In 1810 he was
                    elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in the following year communicated a
                    series of papers “On the Influence of the Brain on the Action of the Heart, and
                    on the Generation of Animal Heat.” In 1812 he also communicated a paper “On the
                    Mode in which Death is produced by certain Poisons.” These papers were founded
                    upon a series of careful physiological experiments, having for their object to
                    determine, first, the relation of the nervous system to the circulatory and
                    nutritive systems in higher animals, and, second, to ascertain, if possible, how
                    poisons produce death. The most important fact ascertained by the first series
                    of experiments was that the stoppage of the heart’s action at the moment of
                    death does not depend on the removal of the influence of the brain, but on the
                    arrest of respiration. He also pointed out some important facts which could only
                    be accounted for by supposing that the nervous system has an influence on the
                    production and diffusion of animal heat, an idea not then generally accepted.
                    For these researches he received the Copley medal of the Royal Society in 1811.
                    In 1813 he delivered the Croon ιan lecture, “On the Effect of the Nerves on the
                    Heart and on the Involuntary Muscles,” and in 1814 he contributed another paper
                    “On the Influence of the Nerves of the Eighth Pair on the Secretions of the
                    Stomach.” In 1816 he performed many experiments on animals, to ascertain the
                    influence of bile on the food during its passage through the bowels. These
                    papers comprehend what Brodie accomplished in physiology. They are all
                    characterized by lucidity, conciseness, sound judgment, and a modest
                    interpretation of results. They are valuable at the present time not so much for
                    the facts they contain, most of which are now incorporated in the general mass
                    of scientific knowledge, but as admirable illustrations of the application of
                    the experimental method of research to physiological questions.</p>
                <p>At this period of his career Brodie rapidly glided into a large and lucrative
                    practice, and more especially he quickly gave evidence of superior powers as an
                    operator, having <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n406/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0406-0359"/> knowledge, coolness, and readiness of resource.
                    From time to time he wrote upon surgical questions, contributing numerous papers
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Medical and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Chirurgical</hi><hi rend="italic">Society,</hi> and to the medical
                    journals. Probably his most important work is that entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pathological and Surgical Observations on the Diseases of the Joints,</hi> in
                    which he attempts to trace the commencements of disease in the different tissues
                    which form a joint, and to give an exact value to the symptom of pain as
                    evidence of organic disease. The thoughts suggested by this volume led to the
                    adoption by surgeons of measures of a conservative nature in the treatment of
                    diseases of the joints, by which the number of amputations has been reduced, and
                    many limbs and lives have been saved. He also wrote on diseases of the urinary
                    organs, and on local nervous affections of a surgical character. Brodie was a
                    man of restless activity; to use his own words, he felt “his happiness to be in
                    a life of <hi rend="italic">exertion.”</hi> When released from professional
                    cares he had recourse to literary and scientific pursuits, and especially to the
                    study of psychological questions. He was fond of reading, collecting facts, and
                    speculating on all matters connected with mental phenomena; andin 1854 he
                    published anonymously a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Psychological Inquiries
                    —the First Part.</hi> A second edition of this work appeared in 1855, a third in
                    1856, a fourth in 1862, and in the same year the <hi rend="italic">Second
                    Part</hi> was also published. This work enjoyed well-merited popularity, as it
                    was written in clear untechnical language, and revealed the speculations of the
                    writer concerning the mind of man. When the name of the author became known, the
                    greatest interest was excited in the work, although it contains nothing new to
                    professed psychologists. He wrote also occasionally for the quarterly
                    reviews.</p>
                <p>Brodie received many honours during his career. He was the medical adviser of
                    three successive sovereigns, and in 1834 he was elevated to the rank of a
                    baronet. It is generally believed that he might have been created a peer had he
                    desired the honour. He became a corresponding member of the French Institute in
                    1844, D.C.L. of Oxford in 1855, and president of the Royal Society in 1858; and
                    he was the first president of the Medical Council under the Act for the
                    Education and Registration of the Medical Profession.</p>
                <p>A complete edition of his works, with an autobiography, in three volumes,
                    appeared in 1865, collected and arranged by Charles Hawkins, fellow of the Royal
                    College of Surgeons of England; and a generous and discriminative biographical
                    sketch, by Professor Henry W. Acland of Oxford, appeared in the obituary notices
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</hi> for 1863. (J. G.
