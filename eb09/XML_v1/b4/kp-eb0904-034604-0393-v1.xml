                <p><label type="entry">BRINDLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>., a
                    celebrated engineer, was born at Thornsett, Derbyshire, in 1716. His parents
                    were in very humble circumstances, andhe received little or no education. At the
                    age of seventeen he was apprenticed to a millwright near Macclesfield, and while
                    in this employment manifested remarkable mechanical talent. Soon after
                    completing his apprenticeship he set up in business for himself as a
                    wheelwright, and quickly became famous for his ingenuity and skill in repairing
                    all kinds of machinery. In 1752 he designed and set up an engine for draining
                    some coal-pits at Clifton in Lancashire. Three years later he extended his
                    reputation by completing the machinery for a silk-mill at Congleton. About 1754
                    Brindley became acquainted <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0394-0347"/> with the duke of Bridgewater, and an arrangement
                    was soon come to whereby he undertook to carry out that nobleman’s scheme of
                    inland navigation. The duke’s primary object was the carriage of coal from his
                    estate at Worsley to Manchester. The difficulties in the way were great, but all
                    were surmounted by the genius of Brindley, whose crowning triumph waβ the
                    carrying the new canal over the River Irwell at Barton, by means of an aqueduct
                    elevated 39 feet above the water. The great success of this canal, the first of
                    its kind in Great Britain, encouraged similar projects, and Brindley was soon
                    engaged extending his first work to the Mersey. He then designed and nearly
                    completed what he called the Grand Trunk Canal, connecting the Trent and Humber
                    with the Mersey. The Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal, the Oxford Canal,
                    the Stockwith and Chesterfield Canal, were all planned and carried out by him.
                    His excessive toil broke down his strength, and he died in 1772 at the early age
                    of fifty-six. Brindley was a man of no education; he retained to the last a
                    peculiar roughness of character and demeanour; but his innate power of thought
                    more than compensated for his lack of training. It is told of him that when in
                    any difficulty he used to retire to bed, and there remain intensely pondering
                    his problem until the solution became clear to him. His mechanical ingenuity and
                    fertility of resources were very remarkable <hi rend="italic">; he</hi>
                    undoubtedly possessed in the very highest degree the engineering faculty, though
                    the kind of works to which he devoted himself has been cast into the shade by
                    the later developments of steam traffic. Brindley was an enthusiast in his
                    business and possessed with the idea of canals. His reported answer to the
                    committee who asked him what was the use of navigable rivers,—“To feed canals,”
