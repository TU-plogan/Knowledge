                    (1784-1817), a celebrated Swiss traveller, was born at Kirchgarten, near
                    Lausanne, November 24, 1784. After studying at Leipsic and Göttingen he visited
                    England in the summer of 1806, carrying a letter of introduction from the
                    celebrated Blumenbach to Sir Joseph Banks, who, with the other members of the
                    African Association, accepted his offer to explore the interior of Africa. After
                    studying in London and Cambridge, and inuring himself to all kinds of hardships
                    and privations, he left England in April 1809 for Malta, whence he proceeded, in
                    the following October, to Aleppo. In order that he might acquire Arabic
                    thoroughly he disguised himself as a Mussulman, under the name of Sheik Ibrahim
                    Ibn Abdallah; and, after two years passed in that part of Asia, he had so
                    mastered the language as not to be distinguished from the natives, and had
                    acquired such accurate knowledge of the contents of the Koran, and of the
                    commentaries upon its religion and laws, that after a critical examination the
                    most learned Mussulmans entertained no doubt of his being really what he
                    professed to be, a learned doctor of their law. During his residence in Syria he
                    visited Palmyra, Damascus, Lebanon, and thence repaired to Cairo with the
                    intention of joining a caravan, and travelling to Fezzan, in the north of
                    Africa. In 1812, whilst waiting for the departure of the caravan, he undertook a
                    journey to the Nile, as far up as Mahass; and then, in the character of a poor
                    Syrian merchant, he made a journey through the Nubian desert which Bruce had
                    traversed, passing by Berber and Shendy to Suakin, on the Red Sea, whence he
                    performed the pilgrimage to Mecca by way of Jiddah. After enduring privations
                    and sufferings of the severest kind, he returned to Cairo in a state of great
                    exhaustion; but in the spring of 1816 he travelled to mount Sinai, whence he
                    returned to Cairo in June, and there made preparations for his intended journey
                    to Fezzan, and exploration of the sources of the Niger. Several hindrances
                    prevented his prosecuting this intention, and finally, in April 1817, when the
                    long expected caravan prepared to depart, he was seized with an illness of which
                    he died in October. He had from time to time carefully transmitted to England
                    his journals and remarks, and a very copious series of letters, so that nothing
                    which appeared to him to be interesting in the various journeys he made has been
                    lost. He bequeathed his collection of 800 vols, of Oriental MSS. to the library
                    of Cambridge university.</p>
