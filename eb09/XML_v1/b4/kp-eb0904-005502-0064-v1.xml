                <p><label type="entry">BORNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ludwig</hi></label>, German
                    political writer and satirist, of Jewish family, was born 18th May 1786, at
                    Frankfurt-on-the-Main, where his father, Jakob Baruch, carried on the business
                    of a banker. He studied first at Berlin, where he became acquainted with
                    Schleiermacher and the famous Henrietta Herz, and afterwards at Halle, intending
                    to enter the medical profession. His inclinations for pure literature proved too
                    powerful to allow him to carry out this design, and in 1806 he removed to
                    Heidelberg in order to study financial and political economy. Two years later he
                    took his degree at Giessen, and in 1811 he received an appointment in the bureau
                    of police in his native town. The reconstitution of Frankfurt as a free city
                    after the fall of Napoleon’s power in -Germany soon deprived him of a situation
                    which was but little suited to his tastes or abilities. He then devoted himself
                    to literature, and for a time edited a newspaper entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Staats-Ristretto,</hi> which was quickly suppressed by the Government on
                    account of its liberal tone and the boldness of its criticisms. The same fate
                    attended his next venture, <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Zeitschwingen,</hi> which appeared for only four months. In 1817 he renounced
                    hi3 Jewish faith and took the name of Börne, by which he is always known. From
                    1818 to 1821 he edited <hi rend="italic">Die Wage,</hi> a paper particularly
                    distinguished by its lively political articles, and by its powerful but
                    sarcastic theatrical criticisms. For some years after the suppression of his
                    paper, Börne resided principally in Paris, Hamburg, and Frankfurt. After the
                    July revolution (1830) he hurried to Paris, expecting to find the newly
                    constituted state of society somewhat in accordance with his own philosophic
                    views; but in this hope he was completely disappointed, and the bitterness of
                    his anger lent additional force to the satirical letters he began to publish in
                    his last literary venture, <hi rend="italic">La Balance.</hi> While advocating
                    his favourite scheme of a closer union between France and Germany, he assailed
                    with unsparing sarcasm and polished wit the German dynasties, whom he looked
                    upon as the great opponents of liberalism. He died at Paris in 1837. Börne’s
                    works are remarkable for brilliancy of style and for a thoroughly French vein of
                    satire. His most elevated piece of criticism is the <hi rend="italic">Denkrede
                    auf</hi><hi rend="italic">Jean Paul,</hi> in which he shows himself fully able
                    to appreciate the great German humourist. The <hi rend="italic">Menzel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Tranzosenfresser</hi> may be taken as a
                    specimen of his unrivalled powers of sarcasm. There have been several complete
                    editions of his writings, the latest being that of 1862, 12 vols., Leipsic; his
                    life has been written by Gutzkow, 1840.</p>
