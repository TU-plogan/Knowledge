                    Guillaume,</hi> French naturalist, was born at Paris on the 29th January 1759.
                    He was educated at the college of Dijon, and attended the lectures of Durande on
                    botany, which inspired him with a passion for natural history. He followed up
                    his studies at Paris, and was a constant auditor at the Jardin des Plantes. Even
                    when closely occupied in official work, he managed to find time for his
                    favourite researches and contributed many valuable papers to various scientific
                    transactions and reviews. At the age of eighteen he had obtained an appointment
                    under Government, and he rose to be one of the chief officials in the postal
                    department. Under the ministry of Roland he also held the post of superintendent
                    of prisons, but the violent outbreaks of 1793 drove him from office, and
                    compelled him to take refuge in flight. For some months he lay concealed in the
                    forest of Montmorency, barely subsisting on roots and vegetables. He was enabled
                    to return to Paris on the fall of Robespierre, and soon after set out for
                    America, resolving to explore the natural riches of that country. The immense
                    materials he gathered were never published in a complete form, but much went to
                    enrich the works of Lacépède, Latreille, and others. After his return, on the
                    establishment of the Directory, he was reinstated in his old office. Of this he
                    was again deprived by the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état</hi> of 1799, and for a
                    time he was in great destitution. He set resolutely to work, however, and by his
                    copious contributions to scientific literature, contrived to support himself and
                    to lay the foundations of a solid reputation. He was engaged on the Supplement
                    to Rozier’s Dictionary, on the new <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire d’histoire
                    naturelle,</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique.</hi> He
                    edited the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire raisonné et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >universal</hi><hi rend="italic">d’agriculture,</hi> and was one of the editors
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >l’agriculture Française.</hi> His increasing fame brought him manifold
                    employments. He was made inspector of the gardens at Versailles, and of the
                    public nurseries belonging to ministry of the Interior. The last years of his
                    life were devoted to an elaborate work on the vine, for which he had amassed an
                    immense quantity of materials. His death, on the 10th July 1828, prevented the
                    prosecution of this work; and. his notes which still exist are said to be so
                    unsystematic as to be unfit for publication.</p>
