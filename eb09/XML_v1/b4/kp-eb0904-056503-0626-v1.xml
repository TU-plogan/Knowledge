                <p><label type="entry">BURNLEY</label>, a manufacturing town and municipal and
                    parliamentary borough of England, 22 miles N. of Manchester, in a valley on the
                    River Burn, from which it derives it name, and in the immediate vicinity of the
                    Leeds and Liverpool canal. Its streets are well paved, and there is an abundant
                    supply of water. Among its buildings of note are the frequently restored church
                    of St Peter’s; a market hall, erected in 1866; and a literary institution <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n627/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0904-0627-0566"/> and exchange. It also possesses a Church of
                    England institute, with a considerable library, a free grammar school, and
                    several charities. Its staple manufacture is cotton, which in 1872 gave
                    employment to 7972 men and 8267 women of twenty years of age and upwards.
                    Worsted, which was formerly the chief article, is still manufactured to a
                    considerable extent. Calico-printing, machine-making, brewing, tanning, and
                    several other important industries are carried on in the town; and in the
                    neighbourhood there are iron mines and stone quarries, which gave employment in
                    1872 to 1376 and 360 workmen respectively. From the number of Roman remains
                    found at various times on the spot, Burnley seems to be the site of some Roman
                    station; and it has also been suggested that it may coincide with Brunnanburh,
                    the famous battle-field of the Saxons. There are but few facts of importance in
                    its history. During the cotton famine it suffered severely, and the operatives
                    were employed in an extensive system of improvements, to which the present
                    satisfactory condition of the town is mainly due. In 1861 it was incorporated by
                    royal charter, the government being placed in the hands of a mayor, eight
                    aidermen, and twenty-four councillors; and in 1867 it was entrusted with the
                    right of electing one member of Parliament. The population of the parliamentary
                    boroügh in 1871 was 44,320 persons, of whom 21,368 were males and 22,952
                    females; the inhabited houses were 8804, and the registered electors 5628.</p>
