                <p><label type="entry">BRENTFORD</label>, a town of England, in the county of
                    Middlesex, 8 miles west of London, on a loop line of the South-Western Railway,
                    in 51° 28' N. lat. aud 0° 20' W. long. It is divided by the River Brent into two
                    parts, known as Old and New Brentford (the former the larger of the two), and is
                    separated from Kew by the Thames. The Grand Junction Canal joins the Brent some
                    miles further up, so that the town has extensive water communication, and is
                    enabled to maintain a considerable trade. Among its manufacturing establishments
                    are gindistilleries, a brewery, malt-kilns, soap-works, saw-mills, and
                    colour-works. The Grand Junction Water-works, which supply the west end of
                    London, are stationed here, the great stand-pipe, 226 feet high, forming a
                    striking tower-like structure. Market-gardening is largely carried on in the
                    neighbourhood, and there is a weekly market which dates from the time of Edward
                    I. The elections for the county of Middlesex are held in the town. Its
                    population in 1871 was 11,091.</p>
                <p>In 1016 Brentford, or, as it was often called, Braynford, was the scene of a
                    great defeat inflicted on the Danes by Edmund Ironside. In 1280 a toll was
                    granted by Edward I. for the construction of a bridge across the river, and in
                    the reign of Henry VI. a hospital of the Nine Orders of Angels was founded near
                    its Western side. In 1642 a battle was fought here between the royalists and the
                    parliamentary forces, for his services in which the Scotsman Ruthven was made
                    earl of Brentford, a title afterwards conferred on Marshal Schomberg. Brentford
                    was during the 16th and 17th centuries a favourite resort of the London
                    citizens; and its inn of the Three Pigeons, which was kept for a time by John
                    Lowin, one of the first actors of Shakespeare’s plays, has been frequently
                    alluded to by the dramatists of the period. We have also Shakespeare’s “Fat
                    Woman of Brentford” in the <hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windsor,</hi>
                    “Gillian of Brentford” in <hi rend="italic">Westward Ho,</hi> and various other
                    references in old plays. Thomson, in his <hi rend="italic">Castle of
                    Indolence,</hi> refers to the pigs for which the town was formerly famous—</p>
                <p>“E’en so through Brentford town, a town of mud,</p>
                <p>An herd of bristly swine is pricked along.”</p>
                <p>The two kings of Brentford, so well known from Cowper’s allusion, seem to owe
                    their mythical existence to Buckingham’s <hi rend="italic">Rehearsal,</hi> where
                    Bayes prides himself on the skill of his plot, in which he supposes “two kings
                    to be of the same place, as for example at Brentford.” See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Athenoeum,</hi> 1847, p. 1196; and <hi rend="italic">Notesand Queries,</hi> 2d
                    ser. vol. viii.</p>
