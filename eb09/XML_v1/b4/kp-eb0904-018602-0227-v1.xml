                <p><label type="entry">BOZRAH</label>. There are, according to the more usual
                    opinion, two places of this name mentioned in Scripture, one a city of Edom, and
                    the other a city of Moab. About the identification of these cities there has
                    been much discussion, some maintaining that the former occupied the site of the
                    modern village of el-Buseirah, about 25 miles S.E. of the Dead Sea, and that the
                    latter was the city afterward known to the Romans as Bostra and at present as
                    Busrah; while others suppose that the various passages of the Scriptures all
                    refer to one place, and others again that there are two places, but that neither
                    of them is to be identified with Bostra. The first view seems to be freer from
                    difficulties than the other two. Bozrah, or el-Buseirah, is now a small village
                    with a strong fortress on the top of a hill. It is the centre of a pastoral
                    district, and its inhabitants, who number between 100 and 200, are all
                    shepherds. Bozrah, Buzrah, or Bostra, on the other hand, is a very extensive
                    collection of ruins of various ages, situated about 80 miles S. of Damascus. The
                    area within the walls is about a mile and a quarter in length, and nearly a mile
                    in breadth, while extensive suburbs lie without, to the east, north, and west.
                    The principal buildings that can still be distinguished are a temple, an
                    aqueduct, a large theatre (enclosed by a castle of much more recent
                    workmanship), several baths, a triumphal and other arches, three mosques, and
                    what are known as the church and convent of the monk Boheira. In 105 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> the city was beautified and perhaps restored from
                    ruin by Trajan, who made it the capital of the province of Arabia. In the reign
                    of Alexander Severus it was made a colony, and in 245 a native of the place,
                    Philippus, ascended the imperial throne. By the time of Constantine it seems to
                    have been Christianized, and not long after it was the see of an extensive
                    bishopric. It was one of the first cities of Syria that was subjected to the
                    Mahometans, and it successfully resisted all the attempts of the Crusaders to
                    wrest it from their hands. As late as the 14th century it was a populous city.
