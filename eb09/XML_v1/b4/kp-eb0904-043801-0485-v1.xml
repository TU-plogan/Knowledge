                    (1685-1736), a literary man of some eminence in lιis time, the son of Dr Gilbert
                    Budgell, was born at St Thomas, near Exeter. He was educated at Christ Church,
                    Oxford, from which he removed to the Inner Temple, London; but instead of
                    studying law, he devoted his whole attention to literature. He was befriended by
                    Addison, who was first cousin to his mother, and who, on being appointed
                    secretary to Lord Wharton, lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1710, took Budgell with
                    him as one of the clerks of his office. Budgell, who had read the classics and
                    the best English, French, and Italian authors, took part with Steele and Addison
                    in writing the <hi rend="italic">Toiler.</hi> He was also a contributor to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Guardian,—</hi> his
                    papers being marked with an X in the former, and with an asterisk in the latter.
                    He was subsequently made under-secretary to Addison, chief secretary to the
                    lords justices of Ireland, and deputy-clerk of the council, and was afterwards
                    chosen a member of the Irish parliament. In 1717, when Addison became principal
                    secretary of state in England, he procured for Budgell the place of accountant
                    and comptroller-general of the revenue in Ireland. But the next year, the duke
                    of Bolton being appointed lord-lieutenant, Budgell wrote a lampoon against Mr
                    Webster, his secretary, in which the duke himself was not spared. This led to
                    his removed from his post of accountant-general, upon which he returned to
                    England, and, contrary to the advice of Addison, published his case in a
                    pamphlet. In the year 1720 he lost &lt;£20,000 by the South Sea scheme, and
                    afterwards spent £5000 more in unsuccessful attempts to get into parliament.
                    This completed his ruin. He at length employed himself in writing pamphlets
                    against the ministry, and published many papers in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Craftsman.</hi> In 1733 he began a weekly periodical called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bee,</hi> which he continued for above a hundred numbers. By the
                    will of Dr Matthew Tindal, who died in 1733, a legacy of 2000 guineas was left
                    to Budgell; but the bequest (which had, it was alleged, been inserted in the
                    will by Budgell himself) was successfully disputed by <pb break="no"

                <p>“Let Budgell charge low Grub Street on my quill, And write whate’er he
                    please—except my wfll.”</p>
                <p>It was thought that he had some hand in publishing Dr Tindal’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Christianity as Old as the Creation;</hi> for he often talked of an additional
                    volume on the subject, but never published it. After the cessation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bee,</hi> he became so involved in lawsuits that he was reduced to
                    very distressing straits. He then studied law, and was called to the bar,
                    attending the courts for some time; but being unable to make any progress, and
                    finding his prospects utterly ruined, he determined to put an end to his life.
                    Accordingly, in 1736, he took a boat at Somerset-stairs, after filling his
                    pockets with stones, ordered the waterman to shoot the bridge, and while the
                    boat was passing under it threw himself into the river. On his desk was found a
                    slip of paper with the words—“What Cato did, and Addison approved, cannot be
                    wrong.”</p>
                <p>Besides the works mentioned above, he wrote a translation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Characters</hi> of Theophrastus He never married, but left one
                    natural daughter, who afterwards assumed his name, and became an actress at
                    Drury Lane.</p>
