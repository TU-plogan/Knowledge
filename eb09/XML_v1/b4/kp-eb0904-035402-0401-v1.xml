                    >Bretagne,</hi> an ancient province and duchy of France, consisting of the great
                    north-western peninsula of the country, and corresponding very nearly to the
                    present departments of Finistère, Côtes-du-Nord, Morbihan, Ille et Vilaine, and
                    Lower Loire. It is popularly divided into Upper or Western, and Lower or Eastern
                    Brittany. While it is not a mountainous country, none of the elevations much
                    exceeding 1200 feet, it is remarkable for the extreme ruggedness of its physical
                    features, especially along the coast and towards its seaward extremity. There
                    are vast tracts of desolate moorland broken only by the melancholy monuments of
                    a forgotten time, and gloomy water-courses worn deep into the stony strata.
                    Elsewhere, however, beautiful valleys and romantic glens are traversed by
                    fullflowing rivers. Agriculture is in general in a rather backward condition,
                    though here and there there are signs of enterprise. Flax and hemp are largely
                    grown; and in the more fertile districts excellent crops of the cereals are
                    obtained. Bees are almost universally kept, and are often objects of a kind of
                    affection. Pasture is abundant throughout the country, and the dairy produce
                    forms a very important item in the food of the people. Industrial pursuits,
                    except in a few seaport towns, which are rather French than Breton, have
                    hitherto received but little attention. The Bretons are by nature conservative.
                    They cling with almost equal attachment to their local customs and their
                    religious superstitions. It was not till the 17th century that paganism was even
                    nominally abolished in some parts, and there is probably no district in Europe
                    where the popular Christianity has assimilated more from earlier creeds.
                    Witchcraft and the influence of fairies are generally believed in, and charms
                    and antidotes are trustfully resorted to. Part of this superstitious tendency
                    may, no doubt, be attributed to the influence exerted on the minds of the
                    people, not only by the strangeness of their natural environment, but also by
                    the frequency of megalithic monuments, whose origin they cannot explain, for
                    nowhere are these monuments so numerous and varied. The costume of both sexes is
                    very peculiar both in cut and colour, but varies considerably in different
                    districts. Bright red, violet, and blue are much used, not only by the women,
                    but in the coats and waistcoats of the men. The reader will find full

                    language is still generally spoken, especially in lower Brittany, and a
                    considerable body of traditional story and song is current among the people.
                    Four dialects are pretty clearly marked. The whole duchy was formerly divided
                    into nine bishoprics,—Rennes, Dol, Nantes, St Malo, and St Brieuc, in Upper
                    Brittany; and Tréguier, Vannes, Quimper, and St Pol de Léon in Lower; and
                    several of the larger towns were the seats of separate counts.</p>

                    of this distinct, indeed, history is almost silent till the 5th century, when
                    the invasion of Britain by the Saxons was followed by the migration across the
                    channel of large numbers of the defeated islanders. The Breton chronicles
                    contain an account of about a score of dukes from that period to the end of the
                    8th century; but how far the names and the narrative are merely mythical it
                    would be hard to determine. The one great fact that is clearly evident is, that
                    a violent contest for independence was maintained against the Frankish inroads.
                    Under the early Carlovingians the country was for a time in rather more than
                    nominal subjection; but it soon reasserted its duchy on his brother Geoffrey.
                    Geoffrey’s death two years after left the way open to the enterprise of Conan
                    IV., grandson of Conan III., who had made his step-father prisoner, and was
                    gradually obtaining possession of the whole duchy. The new duke, however, was
                    forced not only to give his daughter Constance to Henry’s son Geoffrey, but also
                    in tile long run to abdicate in his favour. On Geoffrey’s death in 1186 the
                    duchy became an object of dispute between the English and French kings, the
                    latter being supported by the native nobility. To this rivalry the young duke
                    Arthur fell a victim, murdered, as is usually supposed, by his uncle John of
                    England. His sister Alice succeeded, under the protection of France, and was
                    married to Pierre de Dreux, who thus became the first of a new line of dukes
                    which lasted till the death of Francis II. in 1488. In 1491 the heiress Anne was
                    forced to marry Charles VIII., and thus the duchy was held by the French crown.
                    In 1532 it was formally united to France, but it retained a separate parliament
                    till the Revolution.</p>
