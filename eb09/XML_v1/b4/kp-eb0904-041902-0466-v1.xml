                    engagement. In 1672, however, on the renewal of hostilities, he distinguished
                    himself by his bravery, and was appointed to the command of a ship. He
                    afterwards served with the land forces, and for a short time joined Turenne, in
                    order to study the art of war. On the accession of James he received a seat in
                    the privy council, and was made lordchamberlain. He was not among the lords who
                    invited over the Prince of Orange, but he acquiesced in the Revolution, and was
                    ultimately received into the cabinet council of William. In 1694 he was made
                    marquis of Normanby. In 1702, on the accession of Anne, with whom he was a
                    personal favourite, he became lord privy seal and lordlieutenant of the North
                    Riding of Yorkshire. In the following year he was made duke of Normanby, and
                    duke of Buckinghamshire. Under the administration of Marlborough and Godolphin,
                    he threw in his lot with the high Tory party, and in 1705 was deprived of the
                    seal Two years later he was dismissed from the privy council. In 1710, when the
                    Tories recovered power, Buckingham became lord steward; and in 1711 he was
                    raised to the dignity of lord president. After the death of Anne he held no
                    state appointment. He died 24th February 1721. His works consist of two
                    tragedies, a few small poems of little value, and of the rhymed <hi

                    is said to have been revised by Dryden, and is sometimes printed among the
                    latter’s works. The <hi rend="italic">Essay on Poetry</hi> was highly praised by
                    Addison, Pope, and other critics of the time, but the praise must have been due
                    to the rank and not to the abilities of the poet. His works were published in
                    1723.</p>
