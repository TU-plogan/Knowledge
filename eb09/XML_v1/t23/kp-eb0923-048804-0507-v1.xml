                    town of Belgium, capital of an arrondissement in the province of Hainault, 53
                    miles by rail west-south-west from Brussels, is divided into two parts by the
                    Scheldt, which is here spanned by seven bridges and lined with spacious
                    tree-shaded quays. The older, which is also the busier and more important
                    portion of the town, stands on the left bank; the new town is distinguished by
                    its neat regular streets and modern architecture. The cathedral, which is a fine
                    example of the Romanesque style, is a cruciform basilica, with a series of
                    chapels and five towers. The nave was probably consecrated in 1171; the
                    transepts date from the 13th century; and the (Gothic) choir was completed in
                    1338, at which time also the Romanesque façade was altered, and a porch in the
                    Pointed style added. The sculptures in the porch range in date from the 13th to
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit23newyrich/page/n508/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0508-0489"/> 17th century, and deserve special notice,
                    particularly those of later date by native artists. The general effect of the
                    interior is harmonious and impressive. The capitals of the pillars are rich and
                    varied; the passage round the choir contains several pictures of the Flemish
                    school; the richly sculptured Renaissance roodloft dates from 1566; and most of
                    the stained glass in the transept dates from about 1456. The adjacent belfry,
                    dating originally from 1187, and partly rebuilt in 1391, was restored in 1852.
                    In the Grande Place, not far from the cathedral, is the church of St Quentin,
                    sometimes spoken of as “la petite cathedrale,” in the Transition style, and
                    nearly of the same date as the cathedral. The church of St Jacques dates from
                    the 13th and 14th centuries, and that of St Brice from the 12th. The buildings
                    of the old monastery of St Martin, on the south-west side of the town, are now
                    used as an hotel de ville, in connexion with which there is a small picture
                    gallery containing some examples of Rembrandt, Rubens, and Van Dyck. The town
                    contains courts of law, an athenaeum, a theatre, a school of arts and
                    manufactures, an episcopal palace and seminary, a natural history museum,
                    besides other public buildings. The fortifications of Vauban, extended after the
                    second treaty of Paris, are now demolished, and their place taken by boulevards.
                    The leading objects of manufacture are stockings and “Brussels” carpets; the
                    other industries include paper-making, threadmaking, and the spinning of wool
                    and flax. The trade of the place is very considerable, as vessels of 150 tons
                    burden can ascend the river to this point, and its railway communications are
                    good. The population in 1876 was 32,145.</p>
                <p>Tournay, supposed to be the <hi rend="italic">Civitas Nerviorum</hi> of Caesar,
                    and afterwards known as Tournacus, was one of the first places conquered by the
                    Franks, and Clovis made it for a time his capital. In modern times, standing as
                    it does on the frontier between Belgium and France, it has been frequently
                    besieged and taken. History records specially the siege by Alexander of Parma in
                    1581, when it was bravely but unsuccessfully defended by the princess D’Épinoy,
                    whose statue now stands in the Grande Place. Perkin Warbeck was a native of
                    Tournai.</p>
