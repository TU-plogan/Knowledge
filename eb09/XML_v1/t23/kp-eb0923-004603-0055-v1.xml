                    presidency, lying between 9° 50' and 11° 25' N. lat. and between 78° 55' and 79°
                    55' E. long., with an area of 3654 square miles. It forms a portion of the
                    Southern Carnatic, and is bounded on the N. by the river Coleroon, which
                    separates it from Trichinopoly and South Arcot districts, on the E. and S.E. by
                    the Bay of Bengal, on the S.W. by Madura district, and on the W. by Madura and

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0056-0047"/> is known as the garden of Southern India. It is
                    well watered by an elaborate system of dams, cuts, and canals in connexion with
                    the rivers Cauvery and Coleroon, and the soil is exceedingly productive. The
                    delta of the Cauvery occupies the flat northern part, which is highly cultivated
                    with rice, dotted over with groves of cocoa-nut trees, and densely populated.
                    Tanjore is a land of temples, many of them being of very early date. The great
                    temple of Tanjore city is said to be the finest in India; it is of the 11th
                    century, and remains in excellent preservation to the present day. The district
                    has a coast-line of 140 miles, but communication with shipping is unsafe, owing
                    to a heavy surf which breaks incessantly on the shore. The rainfall, as
                    elsewhere on the Coromandel coast, varies considerably from year to year; the
                    mean annual fall, as observed at ten stations for four years, was 47 T 4 inches.
                    Tanjore is amply provided with means of communication. It is traversed by two
                    branches of the South Indian Railway.</p>
                <p>The census of 1881 returned the population of the district at 2,130,383 (males
                    1,026,528, females 1,103,855), of whom 1,939,421 were Hindus, 112,058
                    Mohammedans, and 78,258 Christians. Tanjore is the first district in which
                    Protestant missions began, and now it is second only to Tinnevölly in the number
                    of its Christian missions. These establishments were taken over in 1826 by the
                    Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which subsequently founded missions
                    in several parts of the district. The total number of native Protestants
                    belonging to the various societies in 1881 was 8255. Roman Catholic missions in
                    Tanjore date from the first half of the 17th century, and the number of native
                    Roman Catholics in 1881 was 67,745. Five towns have populations exceeding
                    10,000, viz., Tanjore (see below), Negapatam 53,855, Combaconum 50,098,
                    Mayavaram 23,044, and Muunargudi 19,409.</p>
                <p>Of the total area of the district, reckoned at 2,392,117 acres, 1,468,500 were
                    returned in 1884-85 as cultivated, and 149,228 as available for cultivation,
                    while forests covered 21,422 acres. Rice is the staple crop, and is raised
                    almost entirely by artificial irrigation; green crops are common; plantain and
                    betel-vine gardens abound in the delta, where sugar-cane and tobacco are also
                    cultivated. The chief manufactures are metal wares, silk cloths, carpets, and
                    pith-work. Imports consist chiefly of cotton piece goods, twist and yarn,
                    metals, timber, and betel nuts. Rice is by far the most important article of
                    export alike by sea and land. The gross revenue in 1884-85 was £549,982, the
                    land yielding £389,755.</p>
                <p>The modern history of Tanjore commences with its occupation by the Mahrattas in
                    1678 under Venkaji, the brother of Sivajτ the Great. The British first came into
                    contact with Tanjore by their expedition in 1749 with a view to the restoration
                    of a deposed raja. In this they failed, and a subsequent expedition was bought
                    off. The Mahrattas practically held Tanjore until 1799. In October of that year
                    it was ceded to the East India Company in absolute sovereignty by Raja
                    Sharabhoji, pupil of the missionary Schwartz, the company engaging to pay the
                    raja of Tanjore one-fifth of the net revenue of the territory which was
                    transferred to them, with a further sum of £35,000. Raja Sharabhoji retained
                    only the capital and a small tract of country around. He died in 1833, and was
                    succeeded by his son Sivaji, on whose death in 1855 without an heir the house
                    became extinct, the rights and privileges appertaining to it ceased, and Tanjore
                    became British territory.</p>
