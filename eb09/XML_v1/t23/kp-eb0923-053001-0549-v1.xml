                <p><label type="entry">TREASURE-TROVE</label> is defined by Blackstone to be money
                    or coin, gold, silver, plate, or bullion found hidden in the earth or other
                    private place, the owner thereof being unknown. This definition is simply an
                    extension of the Roman law definition of <hi rend="italic">thesaurus
                    inventus</hi> as an ancient deposit of money <hi rend="italic">(vetus depositio
                    pecuniae)</hi> found by accident and without actual search. The right to
                    treasuretrove was not, however, the same in Roman and English law. The former at
                    its latest stage divided it between the finder and the owner of the land on
                    which it was found, except where it was found on public or imperial property,
                    when one-half went to the fisc. If a man found treasure on his own land, he had
                    a right to the whole. The rights of the crown, modified by those of the feudal
                    lord, gradually became more extensive in the feudal law of Europe, so much so as
                    to become, in the words of Grotius, “jus commune et quasi gentium.” In more
                    recent times there has been a return, at any rate in the case of France, to the
                    division made by the Roman law. In England the common law, which at one time
                    apparently conferred treasuretrove, wherever found, upon the finder, now gives
                    it all to the king, in accordance with the maxim “quod nullius est fit domini
                    regis.” This is always provided that the owner cannot be known or discovered. If
                    he can be, he and not the king is entitled to it.</p>
                <p>A right to treasure-trove may be granted by the British crown as a <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Franchise (</hi><hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >).</hi> It is the duty of one finding treasure to make it known to the coroner.
                    By the statute <hi rend="italic">De Officio Coronatoris</hi> (4 Edw. I. st. 2),
                    the coroner is to inquire of treasure that is found, who were the finders and
                    likewise who is suspected thereof, and that may be well perceived where one
                    liveth riotously, haunting taverns, and hath done so of long time. Concealment
                    of treasuretrove is a misdemeanour at common law. There can be no larceny of it
                    until it has been found by the coroner to be the property of the crown. The Home
                    Office has recently issued a notification modifying the existing regulations so
                    far as to permit the finders of coins and antiquities coming under the
                    description of treasuretrove to retain articles not actually required for
                    national institutions, and the sum received from such institutions as the
                    antiquarian value of any articles retained, subject to a deduction of 20 per
                    cent. from the antiquarian value of the objects retained and 10 per cent. from
                    the value of other objects. In the United States treasuretrove is usually vested
                    in the State as <hi rend="italic">bona vacantia.</hi> Louisiana follows the
                    French <hi rend="italic">Code Civil,</hi> and gives half to the finder and half
                    to the landowner. The importance of treasure-trove in India led to the passing
                    of the Indian Treasure-Trove Act (Act vi. of 1878). It provides that treasure is
                    to be delivered to the finder if no owner appears. If the owner can be found,
                    three-fourths go to the finder and one-fourth to the owner, power being reserved
                    to the Government to acquire it by payment of a sum equal to one-fifth more than
                    the value of the material.</p>
