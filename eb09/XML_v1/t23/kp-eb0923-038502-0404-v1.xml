                <p><label type="entry">TIFLIS</label>, capital of the province of the same name and
                    of Russian Caucasia, is picturesquely situated (44° 48' E. long., 41° 42' N.
                    lat.) at the foot of high mountains, on both banks of the river Kúr, some 500
                    feet above the level of the Black Sea. The heat in summer is excessive, owing to
                    the confined position; but the surrounding hills (1350 to 2400 feet) shelter the
                    town effectively from the cold winds of a generally severe winter. A large
                    square, the cathedral, one or more handsome streets, gardens, bridges, many fine
                    or neat buildings—among them the grand-ducal palace, the opera-house, and the
                    museum—European shops, the club or circle, hotels, and public offices are
                    evidence that Western civilization has not only penetrated but has long
                    prevailed in this geographically remote town. Of its 54 churches 26 are
                    Armenian, 2 Lutheran, and 1 Catholic, The (Sion) cathedral traces back its
                    origin to the 5th century; but in the interval it has suffered much and often.
                    Other churches date from the 14th and 15th centuries, the Armenian cathedra! of
                    Vank from 1480, and the Catholic church from the 14th century. Tiflis has two
                    gymnasia and pro-gymnasia for boys and two for girls, and a number of other
                    schools; several scientific societies, of which the Caucasian branch of the
                    geographical society is well known; an astronomical and a physical observatory;
                    and a public library. The manufactures of the place are limited to a few cotton
                    and silk factories, tanneries, soapworks, and brick-works. But the petty trades
                    are largely developed; and the artisans of Tiflis (about 8000) are renowned as
                    silversmiths, gunsmiths, and sword-makers. Since 1883 Tiflis has been in railway
                    connexion with Poti and Batum on the Black Sea and with Baku on the Caspian; but
                    the line from Russia to Vladikavkaz has not yet crossed the main chain of the
                    Caucasus. The trade is of great importance, as Tiflis is the chief centre for
                    the import of raw silk and silken goods, raw cotton, carpets, and dried fruits
                    from Persia, as well as from trans-Caucasia, while a variety of manufactured
                    wares are imported from Russia. The foreign trade of trans-Caucasia with Asia,
                    mostly carried on from Tiflis, in 1884 reached the value of £1,729,800 for
                    exports, and £857,070 for imports. In 1883 the population numbered 104,024, as
                    against 71,051 in summer 1865 and 60,085 in winter, exclusive of a garrison of
                    6800. Ethnologically, the numbers are—Armenians 31,180, Georgians 14,787, and
                    Russians 12,142, with an admixture of about 1200 Germans, 7150 Persians (in
                    summer), 1500 Tatars, and some Jews and Greeks.</p>
                <p>Many chroniclers and travellers have written about Tiflis. Perhaps one of the
                    fullest accounts is contained in Brosset’s edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Description</hi><hi rend="italic">Géographique de la Géorgie</hi> (St
                    Petersburg, 1842), by the illegitimate son of Wakhtang VI., king of Karthli, who
                    became a pensioner of Peter the Great. English travellers since 1849 describe
                    Tiflis in its main features much in the same terms. Lady Sheil, writing in 1849,
                    calls it “most thriving, active, and bustling.” Edward Eastwick (1860),
                    estimating its population at 40,000 and the height of the mountains overhanging
                    it at 3000 feet, represents the plain in which the city is situated to be so
                    barren that “even the Kúr . . . imparts to it but a limited fertility.” Mounsey
                    (1866) speaks in warm terms of its social charms and the great hospitality of
                    its inhabitants, and notes it as the seat of government for the “Caucasian
                    provinces of Russia, headquarters of an army of 150,000 men, and the residence
                    of the governor-general.” In the old division of Tiflis three distinct towns
                    were included,—Tiflis, KaΓa (the fort), and Isni; subsequently Tiflis seems to
                    have become known as Sáiyidábád, KaΓa as Tiflis, and Isni as Aulabár. KaΓa and
                    Isni possessed citadels; that of the former contained the church of St Nicholas
                    and a royal palace, that of the latter the church of the Holy Virgin and the
                    residence of the archimandrite. The town is now divided into quarters :—the
                    Russian (the finest of all), the German, the Armenian, and that in which are
                    congregated Jews, Mohammedans, and the mass of Orientals. Tiflis can lay claim
                    to a very considerable antiquity. In 455 the chieftain of Georgia, Wakhtang,
                    transferred his capital from Mhtset to the warm springs of Tpilisi, where he
                    erected several churches and a fort. In 570 the Persians took the place and made
                    it the residence of their rulers, but retained it only for ten years. Tiflis
                    underwent successive plunderings and devastations at the hands of the Greeks in
                    626, of one of the commanders of Omar in 731, of the Khazars in 828, and of the
                    Saracens in 851. The Georgians, however, always managed to return to it and to
                    keep it in their permanent possession. In the course of the succeeding centuries
                    Tiflis fell repeatedly into Persian hands; and it was plundered by Timur about
                    the end of the 14th century. Afterwards the Turks seized it several times, and
                    towards the end of the 17th century the Lesghians made attacks upon it. In 1795,
                    when the shah of Persia plundered Tiflis, Russia sent troops to its protection,
                    and the Russian occupation became permanent in 1799.</p>
