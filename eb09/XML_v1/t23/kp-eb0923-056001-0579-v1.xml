                    <hi rend="italic">Trst,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">Tergeste),</hi> the
                    principal seaport of the Austrian-Hungarian empire, is picturesquely situated at
                    the north-east angle of the Adriatic Sea, in the Gulf of Trieste and at the foot
                    of the barren Karst Hills. The old town, nestling round the hill on which the
                    castle stands, consists of narrow, steep, and irregular streets. It is connected
                    by the broad and handsome Corso with the well-built new town, which lies on the
                    flat expanse adjoining the crescent-shaped bay, partly on ground that has been
                    reclaimed from the sea. The prevailing air of the town is Italian rather than
                    German. The castle, built in 1680, is believed to occupy the site of the Roman
                    capitol (see below). Near it is the cathedral of S. Giusto, an unimposing but
                    interesting building, mainly of the 14th century, and incorporating fragments of
                    a Roman temple and early Christian churches. Don Carlos of Spain (d. 1855) is
                    interred in the south aisle, and Fouché, Napoleon’s minister of police, in front
                    of the church, while the churchyard contains the grave and monument of
                    Winckelmann, the archaeologist, who was murdered at Trieste in 1768. The Arco di
                    Riccardo, also in the old town, derives its name from a popular delusion that it
                    was connected with Richard Coeur-de-Lion, but is probably an arch of a Roman
                    aqueduct. A collection of Roman antiquities found in or near the town has been
                    formed near the castle. The most prominent building in the new town is the
                    Tergesteo, a huge edifice containing the exchange and numerous shops and
                    offices. The new municipal buildings, with the handsome hall of the provincial
                    diet, the Palazzo Revoltella, the offices of the Austrian Lloyd’s, and the
                    handsome old exchange are also noteworthy. The church of S. Maria Maggiore is a
                    characteristic specimen of Jesuit architecture, and the new Greek church is one
                    of the handsomest Byzantine structures in the empire. The city hospital has
                    accommodation for 2000 patients. The huge Politeama is the largest theatre. In
                    front of the Palazzo Revoltella is a monument to the emperor Maximilian of
                    Mexico, who had been an admiral in the Austrian service. His sumptuous chateau
                    of Miramar is one of the lions of the neighbourhood. The capacious harbour,
                    consisting of two parts, the old and the new, is protected by extensive moles
                    and breakwaters, and has been greatly improved within the last ten or fifteen
                    years. From the harbour the Canal</p>
                <p>Grande extends into the town, allowing large vessels to unload at the warehouses.
                    At the end of the Molo Sta Teresa is a lighthouse upwards of 100 feet high. The
                    population of the town (6424 in 1758) and district of Trieste in 1880 was
                    144,844, of whom 74,544 belonged to the town proper and 133,019 to the town and
                    suburbs. The town population is very heterogeneous, but the Italian element far
                    exceeds all the rest. There are about 5000 <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0923-0580-0561"/> Germans and also numerous Greeks, English, and
                    French. The population includes 26,000 Slavs, most of whom live in the country
                    districts and are engaged in agriculture.</p>
                <p>Trieste has been a free imperial port since 1719. It may be said to nearly
                    monopolize the trade of the Adriatic, and has long eclipsed its ancient rival
                    Venice. The annual value of its exports and imports is about 30 millions
                    sterling. Among the chief imports are coffee, wine, fruit, grain, tobacco,
                    petroleum, cotton, coals, and manufactured goods of various kinds; the exports
                    include spirits, liqueurs, sugar, meal, timber, glass, and machinery. Large
                    quantities of fish are sent to Vienna. In 1885 the port was entered by 6971
                    vessels with an aggregate burden of 1,267,946 tons. The trading fleet of Trieste
                    numbers about 500 ships of 100,000 tons burden. The chief shipping company is
                    the Austrian Lloyd’s, founded in 1836, the steamers of which ply to the
                    Mediterranean ports, Alexandria, Constantinople, the Black Sea, &amp;c. The
                    extensive wharfs and dockyards of the company lie to the south of the town. The
                    chief branches of industry practised at Trieste are shipbuilding, soap-boiling,
                    machine-making (especially marine engines), tanning, brewing, rope-making, and
                    the manufacture of liqueurs (rosoglio). Trieste is the seat of government for
                    the so-called Küstenland or Coast district, and is the seat of naval and
                    military commanders and other officials. The town council, presided over by the
                    podestà, is also the diet of the crownland of Trieste (35 square miles). Trieste
                    is the seat of the bishop of Capo d’Istria.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> At the time of the foundation of Aquileia by the
                    Romans, the district which now includes Trieste was occupied by Celtic and
                    Illyrian tribes; and the Roman colony of Tergeste does not seem to have been
                    established till the reign of Vespasian. After the break-up of the Roman
                    dominion Trieste shared the general fortunes of Istria and passed through
                    various hands. From the emperor Lothaire it received an independent existence
                    under its countbishops, and it maintained this position down to its capture by
                    Venice in 1203. For the next 180 years its history consists chiefly of a series
                    of conflicts with this city, which were finally put an end to by Trieste placing
                    itself in 1382 under the protection of Leopold III. of Austria. The overlordship
                    thus established insensibly developed into actual possession; and except in the
                    Napoleonic period (1797-1805 and 1809-1813) Trieste has since remained an
                    integral part of the Austrian dominions,</p>
