                    time of Alexander’s siege was an island. The mole which he constructed to reach
                    the island city has been widened by deposits of sand, so that the ancient island
                    is now connected with the mainland by a tongue of land a quarter of a mile
                    broad. The greatest length of the former island, from north to south, is about ⅝
                    of a mile and its area about 142 acres, a small surface for so important a town.
                    The researches of Renan seem to have completely refuted the once popular idea
                    that a great part of the original island has disappeared by natural convulsions,
                    though he believes that the remains of a line of submerged wall at the south end
                    indicate that about 15 acres more were once reclaimed from the sea and have been
                    again lost. Confined to this narrow site—on which, moreover, place was found for
                    the great temple of Melkarth with its courts and for all the necessities of a
                    vast trade, for docks and warehouses, and for the great purple factories which
                    in the Roman time were the chief source of wealth and made the town an
                    unpleasant place of residence (Strabo, xvi. 2, 23; Pliny, v. 76)—Tyre was very
                    closely built; Strabo tells us that the many-storied houses were loftier than
                    those of Rome. In the Roman period the population overflowed its bounds and
                    occupied a strip of the opposite mainland, including the ancient Palaetyrus.
                    Pliny gives to the whole city, continental and insular, a compass of 19 Roman
                    miles; but this account must be received with caution. In Strabo’s time the
                    island was still the city, and Palaetyrus on the mainland was 30 stadia off,
                    while modern research indicates an extensive line of suburbs rather than one
                    mainland city that can be definitely identified with Palaetyrus. The ancient
                    history of Tyre has been dealt with in the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Phoenicia</hi>; the topography is still obscure owing to the paucity of
                    Phoenician remains. The present harbour is certainly the Sidonian port, though
                    it is not so large as it once was; the other ancient harbour (the Egyptian port)
                    has disappeared, and is supposed by Renan to have lain on the other side of the
                    island, and to be now absorbed in the isthmus. The most important ruins are
                    those of the cathedral, with its magnificent monolith columns of rose-coloured
                    granite, now prostrate. The present building is assigned by De Vogué to the
                    second half of the 12th century, but the columns must be older and may have
                    belonged to the 4th-century church of Paulinus (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H.
                    E.,</hi> X. 4). The water supply of ancient Tyre came from the powerful springs
                    of Rás al-'Ain on the mainland, one hour south of the city, where there are
                    still remarkable reservoirs, in connexion with which curious revivals of Adonis
                    worship have been observed by Volney and other travellers. Tyre was still an
                    important city and almost impregnable fortress under the Arab empire. From 1124
                    to 1291 it was a stronghold of the crusaders, and Saladin himself besieged it in
                    vain. After the fall of Acre the Christians deserted the place, which was then
                    destroyed by the Moslems. The present town has arisen since the Metâwila
                    occupied the district in 1766.</p>
