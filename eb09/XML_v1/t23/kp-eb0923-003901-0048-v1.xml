                    grandfather Rashi, six teachers (1) his own father, (2) his brother Ribam, (3)

                    of the last-named eminent teacher, but also a great mathematician and
                    astronomer, though a terribly bad poet. His commentary on <hi rend="italic"

                    various libraries in Europe, although not recognized as his. It is ascribed
                    variously to Rashi, to Rashbam, and others. There are copies of it in Cambridge
                    (Add. 1213; Add. 1523), Oxford (Opp. 317), the British Museum (Add. 27201), the

                    before-named MS., leaves 10α and 16α, where the book is quoted by an author of
                    the 13th century. (3) <hi rend="italic">Sepher Hayyashar</hi> (Vienna, 1810,

                    and he is virtually the first Tosaphist. It is true that his father, his brother

                    Rabbenu Yehudah b. Nathan had written <hi rend="italic">Tosaphoth</hi> before
                    him, and that this kind of literary activity lasted to within the first quarter
                    of the 14th century. Still, most and the best of the <hi rend="italic"
