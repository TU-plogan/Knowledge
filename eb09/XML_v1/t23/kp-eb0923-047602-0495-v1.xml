                    Cross</hi></label>, a suburb of London, in the county of Middlesex, is situated
                    on the old “Great Northern” road, about 4∣ miles north from Shoreditch. The
                    cross at Tottenham is not a market-cross, and its origin is doubtful. Towards
                    the close of the 16th century it consisted of a column of wood, capped with a
                    square sheet of lead. The present cross of brick was erected by Dean Wood about
                    1600, and the ornamental work of stucco was added in 1809. In the time of Isaak
                    Walton there stood over it a shady arbour of woodbine, sweetbriar, jessamine,
                    and myrtle. Formerly Tottenham was noted for its “greens,” in the centre of one
                    of which stood the famous old elm trees called the “Seven Sisters”; these were
                    removed in 1840, but the name is preserved in the Seven Sisters Road. Bruce
                    Castle, occupying the site of the old mansion of the Bruces, but built probably
                    by Sir William Compton in the beginning of the 16th century, is now occupied as
                    a private boarding school. The church of All Hallows, Tottenham, was given by
                    David, king of Scotland, probably when he visited Henry in 1126, to the canons
                    of the church of Holy Trinity, London. It has frequently been restored and
                    altered. The older parts are the tower, nave, and south aisle of the
                    Perpendicular period and the south porch of the 16th century. There are a large
                    number of monuments and brasses. Tottenham consists chiefly of an irregular line
                    of houses for about two miles along the high road, with short side streets at
                    intervals. There are a number of almshouses, including the Sanchez almshouses,
                    founded in 1596 by Balthazar Sanchez, or Zanchero, confectioner to Philip of
                    Spain; Reynardson’s (1685); Pheasunt’s, or “The Pound,” for poor widows,
                    originally founded by George Hynningham in 1536, and further endowed by Pheasunt
                    and Saunders; and the sailmakers’ almshouses, founded in 1869 by the Drapers’
                    Company for forty-five inmates. The free grammar school was enlarged and endowed

                    sanitary district (area 4642 acres) in 1871 was 22,869, and in 1881 it was

                <p>In the reign of the Confessor the manor of Tottenham was possessed by Earl
                    Waltheof, who in 1070 married Judith, niece of the Conqueror, and was created in
                    1072 earl of Northumberland, Huntingdon, and Northampton, but joined the
                    conspiracy against William, was betrayed by his wife, and was beheaded at
                    Winchester. It was inherited by his daughter Maud, who was married first to
                    Simon de St Liz and afterwards to David, sou of Malcolm III., king of Scotland,
                    who was created by Henry I. earl of Huntingdon, and received possession of all
                    the lands formerly held by Earl Waltheof. In 1184 the manor was granted by
                    William the Lion, king of Scotland, to his brother David, earl of Angus and
                    Galloway, the grant being confirmed in 1199 by King John of England, who created
                    him earl of Huntingdon. He married Maud, heiress of Hugh, earl of Chester, and
                    his son John inherited both earldoms. The son married Helen, daughter of
                    Llewelyn, prince of Wales, by whom he was poisoned in 1237, dying without issue.
                    She retained possession till 1254, when the manor was divided between his
                    coheirs Robert de Brus, John de Baliol, and Henry de Hastings, each division
                    forming a distinct manor bearing the name of its owner. In 1429 they all came
                    into the possession of Aiderman Gedeney. William Bedwell, the Arabic scholar,
                    was vicar of Tottenham, and published in 1632 a <hi rend="italic">Briefe</hi><hi
