                <p><label type="entry">TERBURG, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gerard</hi></label>
                    (1608-1681), subject painter, was born in 1608, at Zwolle, in the province of
                    Overyssel, Holland. His father, also an artist, sent him to study in Rome, where
                    he adopted a style distinguished by great finish and accuracy. He practised for
                    a time in Paris with much success, visited England, it is said, and then
                    returned to Holland. In 1648 he was at Münster during the meeting of the
                    congress which ratified the treaty of peace between the Spaniards and the Dutch,
                    and executed his celebrated little picture, painted upon copper, of the
                    assembled plenipotentiaries,—a work which, along with the Guitar Lesson, now
                    represents the master in the national collection in London. At this time Terburg
                    was invited to visit Madrid, where he received employment and the honour of
                    knighthood from Philip IV. It is said that, in consequence of an intrigue, he
                    was obliged to return to Holland. He seems to have resided for a time in
                    Haarlem; but he finally settled in Deventer, where he became a member of the
                    town council, as which he appears in the portrait now in the gallery of The
                    Hague. He died at Deventer in 1681.</p>
                <p>Terburg is excellent as a portrait painter, but still greater as a painter of <hi
                    rend="italic">genre</hi> subjects. He depicts with admirable truth the life of
                    the wealthy and cultured classes of his time, and his work is free from any
                    touch of the grossness which finds so large a place in Dutch art. His figures
                    are well drawn and expressive in attitude; his colouring is clear and rich; but
                    his best skill lies in his unequalled rendering of texture in draperies, which
                    is seen to advantage in such pictures as the Letter in the Dutch royal
                    collection, and in the Paternal Advice (known as the Satin Gown)— engraved by
                    Wille—which exists in various repetitions at Berlin and Amsterdam, and in the
                    Bridgewater Gallery. Terburg’s works are rare; only about eighty have been
                    catalogued.</p>
