                <p><label type="entry">TAGANROG</label>, a seaport of southern Russia, on the
                    northern shore of the Sea of Azoff, in the government of Ekaterinoslaff, and
                    nearly 200 miles south-east of its chief town. It is built, principally of wood,
                    on a low cape, and, with its extensive store-houses, exchange, and wholesale
                    shops, has the aspect of an important commercial city. It is well provided with
                    educational institutions for children, and has a library and a theatre. The
                    imperial palace, where Alexander I. died in 1825, and the Greek monastery (under
                    the patriarch of Jerusalem) are worthy of notice. The advantageous situation of
                    Taganrog was well known as early as the 13th century, when Pisan merchants
                    founded there a colony, Portus Pisanus, which, however, was destined soon to
                    disappear during the great migrations of the Mongols and Turks. An attempt to
                    obtain possession of the promontory was made by Peter I., but it was not
                    definitely annexed by the Russians until seventy years afterwards (1769). Its
                    commercial importance dates from the second half of the present century; in 1870
                    its population had risen to 38,000, and after it had been brought into railway
                    connexion with Kharkoff and Voronezh, and thus with the fertile provinces of
                    south and south-east Russia, the increase was still more rapid, the number
                    reaching 63,025 in 1882,—Greeks, Jews, Armenians, and West-Europeans being
                    important elements. Notwithstanding the disadvantages of its open roadstead, the
                    foreign trade of Taganrog rapidly expanded, the annual value of the exports
                    having recently reached £2,500,000. The chief article of export being corn, the
                    trade of the city, depending on the crops in south Russia, is subject to great
                    fluctuations. Linseed and other oil-bearing grains are also important articles
                    of commerce, as well as tallow and butter. The imports, which consist chiefly of
                    fruits (dried and fresh), wine, oil, and coffee, are much smaller than the
                    exports; and of the 989 ships (499,500 tons) that entered the port in 1885 no
                    fewer than 775 (446,500 tons) were in ballast. The coasting trade, chiefly with
                    Rostoff, was represented in the same year by 1321 vessels (224,000 tons)
                    entering and 1343 vessels clearing.</p>
                <p>The roadstead of Taganrog is very shallow, and exposed to winds which cause great
                    variations in the height of the water; it is, moreover, rapidly silting up. At
                    the quay the depth of water is only 8 to 9 feet, and large ships have to lie 5
                    to 13 miles from the town.</p>
                <p>Taganrog, with the surrounding territory of 137,000 acres, having a population of
                    nearly 30,000, living in a dozen villages, constitutes a separate township, and,
                    though reckoned to the Rostoff district of Ekaterinoslaff, has a separate
                    governor and administration.</p>
