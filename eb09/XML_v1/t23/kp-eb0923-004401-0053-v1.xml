                <p><label type="entry">TAMWORTH</label>, a municipal borough and market-town of
                    England, on the borders of Staffordshire and Warwickshire, chiefly in the
                    former, is situated at the junction of the Tame with the Anker, and on branches
                    of the London and North-Western and Midland Railway lines, 7 miles south-east of
                    Lichfield, 20 north-west of Coventry, and 110 north-west of London. The castle,
                    situated on a height above the Anker near its junction with the Tame, is now
                    chiefly of the Jacobean period, but is enclosed by massive ancient walls. It was
                    long the residence of the Saxon kings, and, after being bestowed on the Marmions
                    by William the Conqueror, remained for many years an important fortress. Through
                    the female line of the Alarmions it has descended to the Marquis Townshend.
                    Formerly the town was surrounded by a ditch called the King’s Dyke, of which
                    some trace still remains. The church of St Editha, originally founded in the 8th
                    century, was rebuilt, after being burned by the Danes, by Edgar, who made it
                    collegiate, but the present building in the Decorated style was erected after a
                    fire in the 14th century. Since 1870 it has been undergoing restoration at a
                    cost of £10,000. The free grammar school, refounded by Edward VI., was rebuilt
                    in 1677, and again in 1867-68 at a cost of £3000. The other public buildings are
                    the swimming bath and boys’ institute (1885), the town-hall (1701), and the
                    arcade, formerly used as a covered market, but recently obtained by the
                    Salvation Army. The charities include Guy’s almshouses, endowed in 1678 by
                    Thomas Guy, founder of Guy’s Hospital, London, and the cottage hospital with
                    twenty-one beds. Waterworks have recently been erected at a cost of over

                    blue and red brick clay are dug in the neighbourhood; and there are also market
                    gardens. The town possesses a clothing factory, paper-mills, and manufactories
                    of small wares. The population of the municipal borough (area <pb break="no"

                    4891,— that of the parliamentary borough (area 11,602 acres) in the same years
                    being 11,493 and 14,101. Tamworth ceased to be a parliamentary borough in
                    1885.</p>
                <p>Tamworth is situated near the old Roman Watling Street, and occupies the site of
                    a fort which, from the beginning of the 8th century, was the chief royal
                    residence in Mercia. The town, after being burnt by the Danes, was rebuilt and
                    fortified by Ethelfleda, daughter of Alfred the Great. From the reign of Edward
                    the Martyr to that of William Rufus it was a royal mint, and some of the coins
                    struck at Tamworth are still in existence. The town was incorporated in the 3d
                    year of Elizabeth, from whom it obtained the grant of a fair and the
                    confirmation of various privileges bestowed by Edward III. The Elizabethan
                    charter was superseded by one conferred by Charles 11., which continued to be
                    the governing charter of the town till the passing of the Municipal Act. The
                    town, with occasional intermissions, returned members to parliament from the
                    reign of Henry I. till 1885. Among its more distinguished representatives have
                    been Thomas Guy and Sir Robert Peel.</p>
