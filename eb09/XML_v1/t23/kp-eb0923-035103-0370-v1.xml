                <p><label type="entry">TICINO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Tessin</hi></label>, a canton
                    of Switzerland, ranking as eighteenth in the Confederation, consists of the
                    upper basin of the river from which it takes its name,—the Val Leventina, with
                    the tributary va!1eys of Blegno and Maggia —and farther south takes in the
                    districts of Lugano and Mendrisio between Lakes Maggiore and Como. Its total
                    area is 1088’2 square miles, which is exceeded by only four other Swiss
                    cantons,—Graubünden (Grisons), Bern, Valais, and Vaud. Of this 725’8 square
                    miles are classed as productive, including 215 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 3
                    square miles covered by forests and 33 ’ 8 by vines; <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    the unproductive portion 24 ’ 3 square mi1es are occupied by lakes (most of that
                    of Lugano belonging to the canton) and 13’1 by glaciers. The highest points in
                    the canton are the Basodine (10,749 feet) in the north-west and the Valrhein
                    (11,148 feet) in the north-east comers. In 1880 the population was 130,777 (the
                    females exceeding the males by 10,000, doubtless owing to the emigration of the
                    latter), being an increase of 11,158 on that of 1870; the increase was
                    particularly marked in the Val Leventina and is due to the influence of the St
                    Gotthard Railway, which traverses the entire canton. Of this population 129,409
                    speak Italian; 342 of the remainder form the German-speaking hamlet of Bosco or
                    Gurin in the Val Caverna (in northwest), a colony from the neighbouring valley
                    of Formazza or Pommât, which is politically Italian. In religion 130,017 are
                    Roman Catholics. Until 1859 Ticino was partly (Val Leventina, Val Blegno, and
                    the Riviera) in the metropolitan diocese of Milan, chiefly in that of Como, and
                    is still practically (though not legally) administered by these two bishops,—all
                    attempts made hitherto to incorporate them with the see of Chur or to secure the
                    erection of a special see for them having failed. The chief towns are Lugano
                    (6129 inhabitants), Airolo (3674), Mendrisio (2749), Locarno (2645), and
                    Bellinzona (2436). Formerly Lugano, Locarno, and Bellinzona were the capital by
                    turns of six years each; but since 1881 the seat of government has been
                    permanently fixed at Bellinzona. Ticino stands in a comparatively low position
                    as regards moral, educational, agricultural, and commercial matters. It has
                    produced a number of sculptors, painters, and architects. Many of the men
                    migrate during the summer in search of work as picture-dealers, waiters in
                    cafés, chimney-sweeps, and especially as masons, plasterers, labourers, and
                    navvies. A large quantity of fruit is grown; the chief articles exported are
                    cattle, hay, fish, chestnuts, and earthenware. In manners, customs, and general
                    character the inhabitants strongly resemble their Italian neighbours.</p>
                <p>The canton is made up of all the permanent conquests (with one or two trifling
                    exceptions) made by different members of the Swiss League south of the main
                    chain of the Alps. From an historical point of view Italian Switzerland falls
                    into three groups :—(1) Val Leventina, conquered by Uri in 1440 (previously held
                    from 1403 to 1426); (2) Bellinzona, the Riviera, and Val Blegno (held from 1419
                    to 1426), won in 1500 from the duke of Milan by men from Uri, Schwyz, and
                    Nidwald, and confirmed by Louis XII. of France in 1503; (3) Locarno, Val Maggia,
                    Lugano, and Mendrisio, seized in 1512 by the Confederates when fighting for the
                    Holy League against France, ruled by the twelve members then in the League, and
                    confirmed by Francis I. in the treaty of 1516. These districts were governed by
                    bailiffs holding office two years and purchasing it from the members of the
                    League; each member of group 3 sent annually an envoy, who conjointly
                    constituted the supreme appeal in all matters. This government was very harsh
                    and is one of the darkest pages in Swiss history. Yet only one open revolt is
                    recorded—that of the Leventina against Uri in 1755. In 1798 the people were
                    distracted by the Swiss and “Cisalpine republic” parties, but sided with the
                    Swiss. On being freed from their hated masters, they were formed into two
                    cantons of the Helvetic republic—Bellinzona ( = 1 and 2 above) and Lugano ( =
                    3). In 1803 all these districts were formed into one canton—Ticino— which became
                    a full member of the Swiss Confederation. From 1810 to 1813 it was occupied by
                    the troops of Napoleon. The roads over the Bernardino (1819-23) and the St
                    Gotthard (1820-30) were made under the constitution of 1814. But many of the old
                    troubles reappeared and were only done away with by the constitution of 23d July
                    1830, which (with subsequent modifications) prevails at the present time. A
                    legislative assembly (112 members) chosen by direct election and an executive (5
                    members) chosen by the legislature are its principal features. The ‘ ‘ optional
                    referendum” (permitting the submission of any law to a popular vote if asked for
                    by a certain number of citizens) was adopted in 1883. In 1848, on religious
                    grounds and owing to fears as to customs duties, the canton voted in the
                    minority against the Federal constitution of that year; but in 1874, though the
                    people voted against the revised constitution, the legislature adapted it, and
                    the canton was counted as one of the majority. Since 1830 the local history of
                    the canton has been very disturbed owing to the fact that, though Roman
                    Catholicism is the state religion, and all the population are Roman Catholic
                    (the few Protestants having been expelled from Locarno in 1555), they are
                    divided between the Radical and Ultramontane parties. Since 1876 the
                    intervention of Federal troops (already known in 1870) has been quite common in
                    consequence of conflicts of the local authorities <hi rend="italic">inter
