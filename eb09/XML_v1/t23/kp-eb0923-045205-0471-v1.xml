                <p><label type="entry">TORREY, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1796-1873), a
                    distinguished American botanist, was a member of an old New England family which
                    contributed several officers to the War of Independence. He was born at New
                    York, and spent his school days there, save for the concluding year at Boston.
                    When he was 15 or 16 years of age his father received a prison appointment at
                    Greenwich, and there he made the acquaintance of Amos Eaton, one of the foremost
                    pioneers of natural history studies and popular science teaching in America. He
                    thus learned the elements of botany, as well as something of mineralogy and
                    chemistry, so determining the studies of his life. In 1815·he commenced the
                    study of medicine, meanwhile finding time to prepare his first catalogue of
                    plants, and to establish a correspondence with American and foreign botanists,
                    and in 1818 he commenced practice. Stimulated by Elliott’s account of the flora
                    of South Carolina and Georgia, Torrey commenced a systematic account of the
                    botany of the Northern States, of which the first and only volume appeared in
                    1824. In the same year he obtained the chair of chemistry and geology at West
                    Point military academy, whence he was translated three years later to the
                    chemical professorship in the college of physicians, New York. He next described
                    the collections of the first exploration of the Colorado Territory, so laying
                    the foundation of all subsequent work upon the flora of the Rocky Mountains. In
                    these years he also monographed the sedges, and did good service in substituting
                    the natural for the Linnaean system. In 1836 he was appointed botanist to the
                    State of New York, producing his <hi rend="italic">Flora</hi> of the State in
                    1843; while from 1838-43 he carried on the publication of the earlier portions
                    of <hi rend="italic">Flora of North America,</hi> with the assistance of his
                    pupil Asa Gray. Becoming more and more immersed in chemical labours, which from
                    1857 passed partly and soon completely into those of U.S. assayer, he
                    notwithstanding continued to accumulate and work up masses of material for this
                    vast undertaking, which still awaits completion at the hands of his colleague
                    and successor, Prof. Gray. He evinced a continued interest in botanical
                    teaching, and made over his valuable herbarium and library to Columbia College
                    two or three years before his death. He will be remembered not only as the
                    father of American systematic botany, and an accurate and faithful, if somewhat
                    excessively cautious, investigator, but also as an eminent teacher, and for an
                    excellence of personal character and simplicity of beliefs much resembling
                    Faraday’s. His memory is literally kept green by the beautiful Coniferous genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Torreya,</hi> and his labours commemorated and continued in
                    the valuable memoirs of the Torrey Botanical Club.</p>
