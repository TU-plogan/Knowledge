                <p><label type="entry">T</label> is the twentieth symbol in our alphabet. It has
                    varied but little in form since the earliest days when it appeared in Greece and
                    Italy, though some of the Italic alphabets exhibit variants: <hi rend="italic"
                    >e.g.,</hi> in Umbrian and Etruscan inscriptions we find the horizontal stroke
                    sometimes on one side only, and slanting; sometimes the form is nearly that of
                    our ordinary small <hi rend="italic">t</hi> without the ornamental turn at the
                    bottom. In value it has been in all languages a surd or voiceless dental,
                    corresponding to <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> which is voiced. But the .term
                    “dental” includes some varieties of position, of which the most definite are—(1)
                    where the point of the tongue touches the teeth (true “dental ”), as in French;
                    (2) where the tongue touches the gum behind the teeth, and not the teeth at all,
                    as in English; (3) where the point of the tongue is slightly bent back against
                    the palate, producing the sound much heard in south India (often called
                    “cerebral ”). T when followed by <hi rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >y</hi> is liable to pass into the s-sound; this happened in the local dialects
                    of Italy before the Christian era; at Rome the transition was later. This
                    changed sound passed on into the Romance languages, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi>
                    in French “nation,” pronounced “nasion,” whence in England it was sounded first
                    as “nasiun” and now as “nashun.” Similarly in English <hi rend="italic">t</hi>
                    followed by <hi rend="italic">u</hi> undergoes a change of sound; this is. due,
                    however, to the old sound of <hi rend="italic">ü,</hi> viz., long French <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> or Old English <hi rend="italic">y.</hi> This long <hi
                    rend="italic">yy</hi> developed into the <hi rend="italic">iu</hi> sound heard
                    in “use,” “cure,” &amp;c. · then the new <hi rend="italic">i</hi> affected the
                    preceding <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> and the result is <hi rend="italic"
                    >tsh,</hi> as in “nature” (natshure); similarly <hi rend="italic">d</hi> in
                    “verdure” is sounded as <hi rend="italic">dzh</hi> (verdzhure).</p>
                <p>English employs the digraph <hi rend="italic">th</hi> to denote two sounds,
                    differing as voiceless and voiced sounds—the initial sounds of “thin” and “then”
                    respectively. It would be a great convenience if <hi rend="italic">dh</hi> could
                    be used for the voiced sound, so that “then” should be written “dhen.” But it
                    would be even better if the single symbols could be employed to denote these
                    single sounds, as was to some extent the case in the earlier days of our
                    language: in Anglo-Saxon we have the two symbols Ö and <hi rend="italic">p.</hi>
                    The first is only a <hi rend="italic">d</hi> crossed; the second was a rune and
                    was called “thorn.” These, however, were not consistently employed one for the
                    voiceless and one for the voiced sound; also <hi rend="italic">th</hi> is
                    actually found in the oldest texts, and later on it occurs together with Ö and
                    J&gt;. It is probable that the voiceless sound was originally the only one in
                    Teutonic. It was eventually differentiated into two sounds; but, as is usually
                    the case, writing remained more archaic than speech. In modern English and
                    Icelandic, and probably in the parent Teutonic also, initial <hi rend="italic"
                    >th</hi> is voiceless, except in English in a small number of pronouns and
                    particles in common use, as “thou,” “this,” “that,” “then,” “than,” “though,”
                    “thus”; and it is regularly voiceless when final. The nature of the two sounds
                    is this: the tongue is pressed against the back of the teeth (sometimes,
                    especially when used by foreigners, against the bottom of the upper teeth) and
                    either the breath for <hi rend="italic">th</hi> or the voice for <hi
                    rend="italic">dh</hi> is forced through the interstices of the teeth. This pair
                    of sounds is found in modern Greek, where <hi rend="italic">th</hi> appears as
                    <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dh</hi> as δ. In Spanish and in
                    Danish under certain circumstances the sound denoted by <hi rend="italic">d</hi>
                    is <hi rend="italic">dh.</hi></p>
