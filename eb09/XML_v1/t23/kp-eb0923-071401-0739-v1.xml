                <p><label type="entry">TYUMEN</label>, a district town of West Siberia, in the
                    government of Tobolsk, is situated at a point where the chief highway from
                    Russia across the Urals touches the first navigable river (the Tura) of Siberia.
                    A railway passing through Ekaterinburg and the principal ironworks on the
                    eastern slopes of the middle Urals connects Tyumen with Perm, the terminus of
                    steamboat traffic on the Kama and Volga. The Tura being a tributary of the
                    Tobol, which joins the Irtish, a tributary of the Ob, Tyumen has regular steam
                    communication with Omsk and Semipalatinsk by the Irtish (steamers penetrating as
                    far as Lake Zaisan in Dzungaria); with Tomsk, Barnaul, and Biysk, in the Altai,
                    by the Ob and the Tom; with Irbit—the seat of the great Siberian fair—by the
                    Tura and the Nitsa; and by the Tobol, the Irtish, and the Ob with the Arctic
                    Ocean and the fisheries of the lower Ob. Tyumen stands also at the western
                    extremity of the Siberian highway which goes <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Omsk,
                    Tomsk, and Krasnoyarsk to Irkutsk. In summer the Tura sometimes falls so low
                    that steamers have to stop 90 miles off, passengers and goods being taken thence
                    to Tyumen in lighter vessels. The town is well built, and stands on both banks
                    of the Tura, which is here spanned by a bridge. The portion on the low left bank
                    is inhabited by the poorest class and is often inundated; the best houses are on
                    the high right bank. The streets are unpaved, but the houses (principally
                    wooden) are for the most part inclosed by gardens. The people, who are famed
                    throughout Siberia for their good looks, have always been renowned for their
                    industrial skill. Woollen cloth, linen, belts, and especially boots and gloves,
                    are manufactured to a large amount (70,000 pairs of boots and 300,000 pairs of
                    gloves annually). Tyumen carpets, although made in the simplest way and with the
                    plainest tools, have a wide renown in Russia and Siberia, and recently have
                    appeared in the markets of western Europe as of Oriental origin. All kinds of
                    metal wares are made in small workshops. Sheepskins and various kinds of cloth
                    are extensively manufactured, and the leather prepared at the tanneries (100 in
                    number) is extensively sold all over Siberia, the Kirghiz steppe, and Bokhara.
                    An establishment has recently been opened for the construction of barges, and a
                    paper-mill, the first in Siberia, was opened in 1886. The trade of Tyumen is
                    exceeded only by that of Irkutsk and of Tomsk. In addition to its primary
                    schools Tyumeñ has a “real” school. The population, λvhich is of a fluctuating
