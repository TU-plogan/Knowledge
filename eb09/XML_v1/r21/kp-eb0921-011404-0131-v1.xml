                <p><label type="entry">RUYSDAEL or Ruisdaal</label>, Jacob (c. 1625-1682), the most
                    celebrated of the Dutch landscapists, was born at Haarlem about 1625. The
                    accounts of his life are very conflicting, and recent criticism and research
                    have discredited much that was previously received as fact regarding his career.
                    He appears to have studied under his father Izaac Ruysdael, a landscape-painter,
                    though other authorities make him the pupil of Berghem and of Albert van
                    Everdingen. The earliest date that appears on his paintings and etchings is
                    1645. Three years later he was admitted a member of the guild of St Luke in
                    Haarlem; in 1659 he obtained the freedom of the city of Amsterdam, and we know
                    that he was resident there in 1668, for in that year his name appears as a
                    witness to the marriage of Hobbema. During his lifetime his works were little
                    appreciated, and he seems to have suffered from poverty. In 1681 the sect of the
                    Mennonites, with whom he was connected, petitioned the council of Haarlem for
                    his admission into the almshouse of the town, and there the artist died on the
                    14th of March 1682.</p>
                <p>The works of Ruysdael may be studied in the Louvre and the National Gallery,
                    London, and in the collections at The Hague, Amsterdam, Berlin, and Dresden. His
                    favourite subjects are simple woodland scenes, similar to those of Everdingeu
                    and Hobbema, or views of picturesque mills and cottages, or of ruined towers and
                    temples, set upon broken ground, beside streams or waterfalls. He is especially
                    noted as a painter of trees, and his rendering of foliage, particularly of oak
                    leafage, is characterized by the greatest spirit and precision. His views of
                    distant cities, such as that of Haarlem in the possession of the marquis of
                    Bute, and that of Katwijk in the Glasgow Corporation Galleries, clearly indicate
                    the influence of Rembrandt. He frequently paints coast-scenes, and sea-pieces
                    with breaking waves and stormy skies filled with wind-driven clouds, but it is
                    in his rendering of lonely forest glades that we find him at his best. The
                    subjects of certain of his mountain scenes, with bold rocks, waterfalls, and
                    fir-trees, seem to be taken from Norway, and have led to the supposition that he
                    had travelled in that country. We have, however, no record of such a journey,
                    and the works in question are probably merely adaptations from the landscapes of
                    Van Everdingen, whose manner he copied at one period. Only a single

                    of the New Church, Amsterdam, in the possession of the marquis of Bute. The
                    prevailing hue of his landscapes is a full rich green, which, however, has
                    darkened with time, while a clear grey tone is characteristic of his
                    sea-pieces.</p>
                <p>The art of Ruysdael, while it shows little of the scientific knowledge of later
                    landscapists, is sensitive and poetic in sentiment, and direct and skilful in
                    technique. Figures are sparingly introduced into his compositions, and such as
                    occur are believed to be from the pencils of Adrian Vandevelde, Philip
                    Wouwerman, and Jan Lingel-bach. In his love of landscape for itself, in his
                    delight in the quiet and solitude of nature, the painter is thoroughly modern in
                    feeling.</p>
                <p>Ruysdael etched a few plates, which were reproduced by Amand Durand in 1878, with
                    text by M. Georges Duplessis. The “Champ de Blé” and the “Voyageurs” are
                    characterized by M. Duplessis as ‘ ‘ estampes de haute valeur qui peuvent être
                    regardées comme les spécimens les plus significatifs de l’art du paysagiste dans
                    les Pays-Bas.”</p>
