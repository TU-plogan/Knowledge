                    (1804-1877), Swedish poet, was born at Jakobstad, in Finland, on the 5th of
                    February 1804. Brought up by an uncle at Uleâborg, he entered the university of
                    Âbo in the autumn term of 1822, and in 1826 began to contribute verses to the
                    local newspapers. In the spring of 1827 he received the degree of doctor of
                    philosophy, and shared in the calamity which, in September of the same year,
                    destroyed the city and university of Abo with fire. Runeberg accepted a
                    tutorship at Saarijiirvi, in the interior of Finland, where he remained for
                    three years, studying hard and writing actively. The university had been removed
                    after the great fire to Helsingfors, and in 1830 the young poet returned
                    thither, as amanuensis to the council of the university. In the same year he
                    published his first volume of <hi rend="italic">Dikier</hi> (Poems), and a
                    collection of Servian folksongs translated into Swedish. In 1831 his verse
                    romance <hi rend="italic">Grafven i Perrho</hi> (The Grave in Perrho) received
                    the small gold medal of the Swedish Academy, and the poet married the daughter
                    of Dr Teng-ström, archbishop of Finland. For a tractate on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Medea</hi> of Euripides he was in the same year appointed university lecturer
                    on Roman literature. In 1832 he leaped at one bound to the foremost place among
                    Swedish poets with his beautiful little epic <hi rend="italic">Elgskyttarne</hi>
                    (The Elk-Hunters); and in 1833 he published a second collection of lyrical
                    poems. His comedy <hi rend="italic">Friaren fran Landet</hi> (The Country Lover)
                    was not a success in 1834. He returned to more characteristic fields in 1836,
                    when he published the charming idyl in hexameters called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hanna.</hi> In 1837 Runeberg accepted the chair of Latin at Borg;! College, and
                    resided in that little town for the rest of his life.</p>
                <p>From Borgâ he continued to pour forth volumes of verse, and he was now recognized
                    in his remote Finland retirement as second only to Tegnér among the poets of
                    Sweden. In 1841 he published <hi rend="italic">Nadeschda,</hi> a romance of
                    Russian life, and <hi rend="italic">Julqudllen</hi> (Christmas Eve), an idyl.
                    The third volume of his lyrical pieces bears the date 1843, and the noble cycle
                    of unrhymed verse romances called <hi rend="italic">Rung Fjalar</hi> was
                    published in 1844. Finally, in 1848, he achieved a great popular success by his
                    splendid series of poems about the war of independence in 1808, a series which
                    bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Fdnrik Stals Sdgner</hi> (Ensign Steel’s
                    Stories); a second series of these appeared in 1860. From 1847 to 1850 the poet
                    was rector of Borgâ College, a post which he laid down to take the only journey
                    out of Finland which he ever accomplished, a visit to Sweden in 1851. His later
                    writings may be briefly mentioned. In 1853 he collected his prose essays into a
                    volume entitled <hi rend="italic">Smdrre Berdttelser.</hi> In the same year he
                    was made president of a committee for the preparation of a national Psalter,
                    which issued, in 1857, a Psalm-Book largely contributed by Runeberg for public
                    use. He once more attempted comedy in his <hi rend="italic">Kan ej</hi> (Can’t)
                    in 1862, and tragedy, with infinitely more success, in his stately <hi
                    rend="italic">Kungarne pa Salamis</hi> (The Kings at Salamis) in 1863. He
                    collected his writings in six volumes in 1873-74. Runeberg died at Borgâ on the
                    6th of May 1877.</p>
                <p>The poems of Runeberg show the influence of the Greeks and of Goethe upon his
                    mind; but he possesses a great originality. In an age of conventionality he was
                    boldly realistic, yet never to the sacrifice of artistic beauty. Less known to
                    the rest of Europe than Tegnér, he yet is now generally considered to excel him
                    as a poet, and to mark the highest attainment hitherto reached by imaginative
                    literature in Sweden.</p>
