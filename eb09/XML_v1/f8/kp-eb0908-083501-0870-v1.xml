                <p><label type="entry">FABER</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lefevre, Jacobus
                    (c.</hi> 1450-1536), surnamed Stapulensis, an eminent pioneer of the Protestant
                    movement in France, was born of humble parentage at Staples in Picardy about
                    1450, and received his higher education at the university of Paris. After having
                    graduated, and for some time made use of the privilege of teaching which the
                    degree of magister at that time actually conferred, he went to Italy for the
                    prosecution of his favourite classical studies. On his return to Paris he became
                    professor in the college of Cardinal Lemoine, and at the same time he began the
                    publication, with introductions, commentaries, or translations, of various
                    famous works, including the <hi rend="italic">Physics, Metaphysics,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Ethics</hi> of Aristotle. In 1507 he commenced residence within
                    the Benedictine Abbey of St Germain des Pr&amp;s near Paris, of which hi3 friend
                    Bri^onnet had become superior; and here he began to give himself to biblical
                    studies. The first fruit of his labours was the <hi rend="italic">Quinluplex
                    Psalterium; Gallicum, Romanum, Hebraicum, Vetus, Conciliatum</hi> (Parisiis,
                    Hen. Stephani, 1509). This was followed in 1512 by <hi rend="italic">8. Pauli
                    Epistoloe XIV. ex vulgatci Editione, adjecta intelligentia ex Grceco cum
                    commentariis,</hi> a work characterized by great intelligence and independence
                    of judgment. His <hi rend="italic">De Maria Magdalena et triduo Christi
                    disceptatio,</hi> published in 1517, provoked a violent controversy, and was
                    ultimately condemned by the Sorbonne in 1521. In 1523 he removed to Meaux as
                    vicar to his friend Brigonnet, who had recently been advanced to that bishopric;
                    and in the same year he published his new French translation of the New
                    Testament, also <hi rend="italic">Les Epistres et Evangiles pour les LII.
                    dimanches de Van cl Vusage du diocese de Meaux.</hi> In his prefaces and notes
                    to both these works he had expressly declared his conviction that the Bible is
                    the only rule by which doctrines are to be tried, and also that justification is
                    by faith alone. These utterances excited much hostility, but the powerful
                    protection of the king (Francis I.) and of the Princess Margaret shielded him
                    from any serious consequences. After the battle of Pavia (25th February 1525),
                    Francis being at the time in captivity, Faber was formally condemned, and his
                    works were vigorously suppressed by a commission of the parliament; these
                    proceedings, however, were at once quashed on the return of the king some months
                    afterwards. In 1526 Faber became librarian in the royal palace at Blois; and two
                    years afterwards his translation of the Pentateuch appeared. In 1530 he
                    completed his translation of the Bible, which at once took a high place, has
                    often been reprinted, and has indeed been the basis of all subsequent French
                    versions, both Roman Catholic and Protestant. In 1531 he was induced by Margaret
                    (who had become queen of Navarre) to taka refuge at Ndrac from the storm of
                    persecution which had broken out with fresh violence; and here he spent the
                    closing years of his life in comparative quietude. His death took place in
                    1536.</p>
