                <p><label type="entry">FAIRIES</label> (Fr., <hi rend="italic">fee,faerie;</hi>
                    Prov., <hi rend="italic">fada;</hi> Sp., <hi rend="italic">hada;</hi> Ital., <hi

                    from Latin <hi rend="italic">fatum,</hi> fate, destiny). In early times, when so
                    much of the energy of man was not, as now, applied to practice, it seems to have
                    found a natural outlet in the imagination. Of all the minor creations of
                    mythology, the fairies are the most beautiful, the most numerous, the most
                    memorable in literature. Like all organic growths, whether of nature or of the
                    fancy, they are not the immediate product of one country or of one time; they
                    have a pedigree, and the question of their ancestry and affiliation is one of
                    wide bearing and weighty side-issues. But mixture and connexion of races have in
                    this, as in many other cases, so changed the original folk-product that it is
                    difficult to disengage and separate the different strains that have gone to the
                    making or moulding of the result as we have it. Certain points, however, in the
                    course and development of the superstition can be definitely placed.</p>
                <p>The character of the religion of the people of Gaul was undoubtedly much changed
                    by the Roman occupation, but, in inscriptions and legends, traces are to be
                    found of what the primitive belief was, which faintly shadow out that primitive
                    belief, and it is here that we first find traces of one of the various classes
                    of beings which have in later times received the general name of fairies. Votive
                    inscriptions to supernatural beings, corresponding to the -nymphs and fauns of
                    classic mythology, have been found on Gaulish and German soil repeatedly. A
                    passage in Pomponius Mela <hi rend="italic">(De Situ Orbis,</hi> bk. iii. c. 6)
                    points distinctly to a belief of the Bretons in certain beings having many
                    characteristics of the fairies.</p>
                <p>“Sena being situate in the British sea against the country of the Osismyes is
                    renowned with the oracle of the god of the Galles, whose vowesses in number
                    nine, are hallowed to continual virginitie. They call them Gallicens, and are of
                    opinion that, through the singular wisdom wherewith they are indued, they raise
                    the seas and winds with their charms, and transform themselves into what beastes
                    they will, and heale such diseases as to others are incurable, and knowe things
                    to come and prophesy of them, but not unto any other than such as sayle thither
                    for the nonce, and come of set purpose to demaund counsell of them. ’’—Golding’s
                    translation, p. 78.</p>
                <p>The similarity of these beings to the fays that play so important a part in
                    mediaeval romances is remarkable. A passage in the romance of Lancelot du Lac is
                    so directly descriptive that it may be quoted:—</p>
                <p>“En cellui temps estoient appellees fees toutes celles qui sentermet-toient
                    den-chantements et de charmes, et moult en estoit pour lors principallement en
                    la Grande Bretagne, et scavoient la force et la vertue des parolles, des
                    pierres, et des herbes, parquoy elles estoient tenue en jeunesse et en beaulte
                    et en grandes richesses comment elles divisoient. Et ce fut estably au temps de
                    Merlin le prophete.— Ed. 1533, p. v.</p>
                <p>These fays preside at the birth and influence the destiny of men, taking
                    individuals under their special protection. They take lovers from among men, and
                    are often described as of delicate, unearthly, ravishing beauty. The enjoyment
                    of their charms is, however, generally qualified by some restriction or compact,
                    the breaking of which is the cause of calamity to the lover and all his race, as
                    in the notable tale of Melusine. This fay by enchantment built the castle of
                    Lusignan for her husband. It was her nature to take, every week, the form of a
                    serpent from the waist below. The hebdomadal transformation being once, contrary
                    to compact, witnessed by her husband, she left him with much wailing, and was
                    said to return and give warning by her appearance and great shrieks whenever one
                    of the race of Lusignan was about to die. At the birth of Ogier le Dannois six
                    fairies attend, five of whom give good gifts, which the sixth overrides with a
                    restriction. Gervaise of Tilbury, writing early in the 13th century, has, in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Otia Imperialia,</hi> a chapter <hi rend="italic">De lamiis et
                    noctumis larvis,</hi> where he gives it out, as proved by individuals beyond all
                    exception, that men have been lovers of beings of this kind whom they call <hi
                    rend="italic">Fadas,</hi> and who did, in case of infidelity or infringement of
                    secrecy, inflict terrible punishment—the loss of goods and even of life. There
                    seems little in the characteristics of these fairies of romance to distinguish
                    them from human beings, except their supernatural knowledge and power. They are
                    not often represented as diminutive in stature, and seem to be subject to such
                    human passions as love, jealousy, envy, and revenge. To this class belong the
                    fairies of Boiardo, Ariosto, and Spenser,</p>
                <p>The etymology traced at the beginning of this article is that generally given,
                    but it is by no means universally accepted. Some fanciful theories that
                    prevailed at the beginning of the century, as, for instance, that adopted by Sir
                    W. Scott in his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Fairy Superstition,</hi> which
                    connects the word fairy with the Persian <hi rend="italic">peri,</hi> are now
                    generally rejected. M. Walckenaer believed the word to be purely Celtic (see his
                    <hi rend="italic">Letters sur les Contes des Fees,</hi> Paris, 1836). Apart,
                    however, from the question of the origin and varying intention of the term, the
                    kind of beings first signified by it can be fairly connected with creatures of
                    the Greek and Roman mythology.</p>
                <p>The Gauls had no doubt a populous pantheon. The peasants seeLh to have offered
                    worship to, and peopled the old hills, trees, rocks, streams, and springs with,
                    beings similar to the nymphs and fauns of antiquity. And each little locality
                    seems to have had its protecting deities, female, and generally three in number.
                    The coming of Christianity only changed slightly the way of regarding these
                    creatures—did not by any means overcome the superstition. It is most likely to
                    the similarity in character and function of these local deities to the Parcae or
                    Fates of antiquity that we owe the name generally given to all the different
                    beings, a great part of whose functions it was to preside at the birth and rule
                    the destiny of man. It seems probable that among the people generation after
                    generation of nurses changed these topical divinities into those fairies, the
                    tales of which Perrault and his successors made so popular. The fairy tales in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Piacevoli Notte</hi> of Straparola (1550-54) and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pentamerone</hi> of Basile (1672) are also, no doubt, the results
                    of genuine tradition. By this time, however, the influence of Eastern stories
                    had been brought by travellers and crusaders to bear upon the traditions of the
                    West, as well as that of the superstition next to be mentioned. To the elves and
                    duergar of the northern mythology we must go for the origin of those little
                    creatures that dance in the woods and meadows. The elves are divided into two
                    classes, the light and the dark. It is related in the prose Edda that the gods
                    reflected how the duergar animated the clay below the earth like maggots in
                    flesh; and certainly, under different names, as brownie, cluricaune, kobbold,
                    nisse, lutin, hobgoblin, beings of this kind, whether of the hill or wood, of
                    the rock or stream, or of the household, have played a great part in the life of
                    the peasantry of many countries. They are represented as of very various
                    characteristics and propensities. Their appearance and power are sometimes
                    propitious, at other times baleful. “He that looks on them shall die,” says
                    Falstaff, and hides his face accordingly. Perhaps the leading features of their
                    character with relation to man is a desire for fair human children, which,
                    substituting abortive creatures, they practise many tricks to obtain. They are
                    often represented as animated by a spirit of malicious mockery towards men,
                    which is not, however, altogether malignant. In connexion with their fabled
                    abode underground, it is to be noted that Chaucer makes Pluto and Proserpina
                    king and queen-of faery.</p>

                <p>Besides scattered allusions, we owe to this superstition many fair products of
                    our poetry. Works of Drayton, Ben Jonson, Fletcher, Randolph, and Herrick will
                    at once suggest themselves. Its influence 13 of course very marked in the
                    youthful works of Milton. Of the <hi rend="italic">Midsummer Night's Dream,</hi>
                    that perfect rose among all these flowers of fancy, it is unnecessary to speak,
                    even were it possible to do so adequately.</p>
