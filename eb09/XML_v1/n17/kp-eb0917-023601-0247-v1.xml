                    rend="italic">c.</hi> 1564-1601), poet, playwright, and pamphleteer, was one of
                    the most notable literary celebrities in the brilliant last decade of the reign
                    of Elizabeth. The exact years of his birth and death have not been ascertained;
                    but from the fact that he proceeded B.A. (St John’s, Cambridge) in 1585 it has
                    been conjectured that he was born about 1564, and his death was lamented in an
                    epigram by Fitzgeoffrey in 1601. He tells us himself that his birthplace was
                    Lowestoft. It would seem from a passage in one of his pamphlets that he
                    travelled in Italy after leaving Cambridge, and then he followed the example of
                    Greene and Marlowe, his fellow Cantabs, in trying to make a living by literature
                    in London. Nash was really a journalist born out of due time; he frequently
                    boasts of his power of writing “as fast as his hand can trot”; his style was
                    brilliant and picturesque; he had a keen sense of the ridiculous, was quick in
                    argument, and not without abundance of miscellaneous learning. In the
                    circumstances, there being no market for his gifts, he fared like the other
                    university wits who made the same premature venture at the time to “distil ink
                    into gold,” struggled brilliantly for some years, and succumbed. It was as a
                    “notable railer” both against individuals and against the vices and the
                    absurdities of the time, as a man than whom none “used better or more bitter
                    gall in ink,” that Nash made his reputation. His first effort was a preface to
                    Greene’s <hi rend="italic">Menaphon,</hi> in 1587. In this he made boisterous
                    ridicule, with the arrogance of youth and high spirits, of current literature,
                    laughing especially at the bombast of Marlowe’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tamburlaine,</hi> and promised to follow up his attack with an <hi
                    rend="italic">Anatomy of Absurditie,</hi> which appeared in 1589. Meantime the
                    Marprelate tracts gave him another opening for ridicule, into which he rushed
                    joyously, publishing in quick succession <hi rend="italic">Plaine</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Percevait,</hi><hi rend="italic">Martin’s Month’s Mind, Pasquil in
                    England, An Almond for a Parrot, Pasquil’s Apology.</hi> Then he edited Sidney’s
                    poems, with a preface, in 1591. <hi rend="italic">Pierce Penilesse, His
                    Supplication to the Devill,</hi> published in 1592, at once shows his power as a
                    gaily humorous critic of national manners and lets us into the secret of the
                    hardness of his struggle to live by the pen. It seems to Pierce a monstrous
                    thing that cautious brainless drudges and knaves wax fat “when as the seven
                    liberal sciences and a good leg will scarce get a scholar bread and cheese.” A
                    patron was what the man of letters wanted, and Pierce humorously begs for a
                    trial, undertaking to make it worth a patron’s while. Nash’s complaints of
                    destitution in this tract are sometimes taken too literally; it would seem that
                    he had found a noble patron, and was living at his country seat in 1592, away
                    from the plague in London, and writing his satirical masque <hi rend="italic"
                    >Summer’s Last Will and Testament.</hi> In 1593 he tried his hand at a sermon,
                    <hi rend="italic">Christes Tears over</hi><hi rend="italic">Jerusalem,</hi> a
                    really eloquent composition. In the preface to this, “not basely fear-blasted,
                    or constraintively overruled, but purely pacificatory,” he holds out the hand of
                    friendship to Gabriel Harvey, with whom he had begun a match in personal abuse,
                    recorded in D’Israeli’s <hi rend="italic">Quarrels of Authors.</hi> The overture
                    was not accepted, and Nash resumed his “humorous objurgation” of the enemy.
                    After Marlowe’s death he put the unfinished tragedy of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dido</hi> in shape for the stage, but he had no portion of Marlowe’s genius. In
                    1597 he was in trouble with the authorities for a play called the <hi
                    rend="italic">Isle of Dogs,</hi> which has not been preserved. The author
                    retired to Yarmouth, and there wrote his last work <hi rend="italic">Lenten
                    Stuff</hi> (1599), nominally “in praise of a red herring,” but really a
                    description of Yarmouth which would now make the fortune of a special
                    correspondent.</p>
