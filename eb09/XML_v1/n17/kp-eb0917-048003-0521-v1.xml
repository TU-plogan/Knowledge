                <p><label type="entry">NICE</label>, a city of France, the chief town of the
                    department of Alpes Maritimes, and previous to 1860 the capital of the countship
                    of Nice (Nizza) in the kingdom of Sardinia, is situated in 43° 42' N. lat. and
                    7° 16' E, long., 739 miles by rail from Paris, and occupies a fine position at
                    the mouth of the Paillon (Paglione), a stream (often dried up in summer) which,
                    after a course of 20 miles, enters the northern end of the Baie des Anges. A
                    steep isolated limestone hill, 315 feet in height, running back for some
                    distance from the shore, forms the historical nucleus of the town. Formerly
                    crowned by a castle, which previous to its destruction by the duke of Berwick in
                    1706 was one of the strongest fortresses on the coast, it is now laid out as a
                    public pleasure-ground, and planted with aloe, cactus, agave, and palm. Towards
                    its south-west corner stands a tower (Tour Bellanda or Clérissy) dating, it is
                    believed, from the 5th century. The old town stretches along the western base of
                    the hill; the “town of the 18th century” occupies the ground farther west, which
                    slopes gently towards the Paillon; and away to the north-east and north and west
                    beyond the stream lie the ever-growing quarters of the modern city. To the east
                    of the hill, and thus out of sight of the more fashionable districts, the
                    commercial quarter surrounds the port. The whole frontage of Nice is composed of
                    fine embankments: the Quai des Ponchettes, constructed in 1770 round the base of
                    the castle hill, is continued westward by the Quai du Midi as far as the Pont
                    des Anges, which crosses the mouth of the Paillon; and from the public gardens
                    and the municipal casino on the other side of the stream the Promenade des
                    Anglais, a boulevard 85 feet wide, extends for more than a mile to the mouth of
                    the Magnan, and is likely to be prolonged to the Var. A pier projecting into the
                    sea from the promenade contains a “crystal palace” and a sea-bathing
                    establishment. The course of the Paillon also is embanked on both sides, and at
                    one part the Place Masséna, one of the largest public squares in the city, and
                    the principal resort of foreign visitors, has been laid out across the stream.

                    synagogues, and several Protestant chapels. Architecturally the most remarkable
                    church is Notre Dame, a modern Gothic building with two towers 213 feet high,
                    erected by the town in 1835 to commemorate its preservation from cholera. The
                    secular buildings include the town-house, the prefecture, the theatres, the
                    hospitals, the lycée (founded by the Jesuits in the 17th century), the natural
                    history museum, the library (especially rich in theology), and, at some distance
                    from the town, the astronomical and meteorological observatory on Mount Gros.
                    The industrial establishments comprise perfume factories, distilleries,
                    oil-works, furniture and wood work factories, confectionery works, soap-works,
                    tanneries, and a national tobacco factory employing several hundred persons.
                    Besides the vine, the trees principally cultivated in the neighbourhood are the
                    olive, the orange, the mulberry, and the carob; and the staple exports are oil,
                    agricultural produce, fruits, and flowers. The harbour, which as yet only covers
                    10 acres, is being enlarged. In 1881 the population of the city was 54,953, and
                    of the commune 66,279,—an increase respectively of about 9000 and 13,900 since
                    1872. During winter there is a large proportion of strangers from all parts of
                    the world.</p>
                <p>Protected towards the north by hills which rise stage behind stage to the main
                    ridge of the Alps, Nice is celebrated for the mildness of its climate. The mean
                    temperature is 60° Fahr., that of winter being 49°,of spring 56°, of summer 72°,
                    and of autumn 63°. For a few nights in winter the mercury sinks below freezing
                    point, but snow is practically unknown, falling, on an average, only half a day
                    in the year. The highest reading of the thermometer is rarely above 90°. There
                    are sixty-seven days with rain in the course of the year; but it usually falls
                    in heavy showers which soon leave the sky clear again, though the whole annual
                    amount exceeds 32 inches. Fine days and rainy days are almost equally
                    distributed throughout the different seasons. The winds are very variable,
                    sometimes changing several times a day. Apart from the ordinary land and sea
                    breezes, the most frequent is the east wind, which is especially formidable
                    during autumn. The south-west wind is moist and warm; the north-east, which is
                    happily rare, brings storms of hail and even snow in winter. The mistral (from
                    the north-west) and the tramontane (from the north) are generally stopped by the
                    mountains; but when they do reach the city they raise intolerable dust-storms.
                    For two thousand years the climate of Nice has been considered favourable in
                    chest complaints. Those who are requiring rest, and those suffering from gout,
                    asthma, catarrhs, rachitic affections, scrofula, stone, also experience benefit;
                    but the reverse is the case when heart disease, nervous disorders, or ophthalmia
                    are concerned. Autumn is the best season; in spring the sudden changes of
                    temperature demand great care. Means of passing the time pleasantly are fairly
                    abundant. The city is at its liveliest during the carnival festivities, in
                    which, ' as at Rome, battles are waged with sweetmeats and flowers.</p>
                <p>Nice <hi rend="italic">(Nicaea)</hi> was founded about two thousand years ago by
                    the Phocaeans of Marseilles, and received its name in honour of a victory <hi
                    rend="italic">{.νίκη)</hi> over the neighbouring Ligurians. It soon became one
                    of the busiest trading stations on the Ligurian coast; but as a city it had an
                    important rival in the town of Cemenclium, which continued to exist till the
                    time of the Lombard invasions, and has left its ruins at Cimiez (Italian,
                    Cemella), 2⅛ miles to the north. In the 7th century Nice joined the Genoese
                    league formed by the towns, of Liguria. In 731 it repulsed the Saracens; but in
                    859 and 880 they pillaged and burned it, and for the most of the 10th century
                    remained masters of the surrounding country. During the Middle Ages Nice had its
                    share in the wars and disasters of Italy. As an ally of Pisa it was the enemy of
                    Genoa, and both the king of France and the emperor of Germany endeavoured to
                    subjugate it; but in spite of all it. maintained its municipal liberties. In the
                    course of the 13th and 14th centuries it fell more than once into theΙιands of
                    the counts of Provence; and at length in 1388 it placed itself under the
                    protection of the counts of Savoy. The maritime strength of Nice now rapidly
                    increased till it was able to cope with the Barbary pirates; the fortifications
                    were largely extended and the roads to the city improved. During the struggle
                    between Francis I. and Charles V. great damage was caused by the passage of the
                    armies invading Provence; pestilence and famine raged in the city for several
                    years. It was in Nice that the two monarchs in 1538 concluded, through the
                    mediation of Paul III., a truce of ten years; and a marble cross set up to
                    commemorate the arrival of the pope still gives its name, Croix de Marbre, to
                    part of the town. In 1543 Nice was attacked by the united forces of Francis I.
                    and Barbarossa; and, though the inhabitants, with admirable courage, repulsed
                    the assault which succeeded the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately
                    compelled to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage the city and to
                    carry off 2500 captives. Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580. In 1600
                    Nice was taken by the duke of Guise. By opening the ports of the countship to
                    all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade, Charles Emmanuel in 1626
                    gave a great stimulus to the commerce of the city, whose noble families took
                    part in its mercantile enterprises. Captured by Catinat in 1691, Nice was
                    restored to Savoy in 1696; but it was again besieged by the French in 1705, and
                    in the following year its citadel and ramparts were demolished. The treaty of
                    Utrecht in 1713 once more gave the city back to Savoy; and in the peaceful years
                    which followed the “new town” was built. From 1744 till the peace oi
                    Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) the French and Spaniards were again in possession. In
                    1775 the king of Sardinia destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties
                    of the commune. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the French Republic, the
                    countship of Nice continued to be part of France till 1814; but after that date
                    it reverted to Sardinia. By a treaty concluded in 1860 between the Sardinian
                    king and Napoleon III. it was again transferred to France, and the cession was
                    ratified by nearly 26,000 electors out of a total of 30,700. Nice is the seat of
                    a bishopric, at present dependent on the archbishopric of Aix, and the
                    headquarters of a military division forming part of the corps d’armée of
                    Marseilles. Masséna and Garibaldi were natives of the city.</p>
