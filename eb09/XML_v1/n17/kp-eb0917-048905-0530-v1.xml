                    Harris</hi></label> (1799-1848), English antiquary, was born 10th March 1799,
                    the fourth son of John Harris Nicolas of East Looe in Cornwall, whose Breton
                    ancestors had settled there on the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He entered
                    the navy in 1808, and was promoted lieutenant in 1815. At the close of the war
                    he retired from the service and began to study for the bar. He was called at the
                    Inner Temple in 1825, but his business as a barrister was chiefly confined to
                    the claims of peerage before the House of Lords, his special genealogical
                    knowledge rendering his assistance in such cases invaluable. On genealogical
                    questions and those connected with the descent of ancient families his
                    researches have thrown much important light. Of works on these subjects he
                    published a considerable number, the most useful being <hi rend="italic">Notitia
                    Historica</hi> (1824; expanded in 1835 for “Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia” into
                    <hi rend="italic">Chronology of History), Synopsis of the Peerage of
                    England</hi> (2 vols., 1825), and <hi rend="italic">Testamenta</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Vetusta</hi> (2 vols., 1826). Nicholas wrote a number of valuable
                    biographical notices for Pickering’s Aldine edition of the poets, among others
                    those of Chaucer, Surrey, Wyatt, Collins, Cowper, Thomson, Burns, and Kirke
                    White. His “Lives of Isaak Walton and Charles Cotton,” prefixed to Pickering’s
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Complete Angler,</hi> are also the fruit of
                    independent and original research. The service of Nicolas in the royal navy
                    seems to have left an impress on his mind which his antiquarian studies tended
                    rather 'to deepen than obliterate; and it is where his passion for antiquarian
                    research was exercised in illustrating the historic glories of England and the
                    heroic deeds of famous individuals that he found the most congenial scope for

                    1841-42). For his previous researches into the history of the orders he was, in
                    1831, made a knight of the Hanoverian Guelphic order and in 1832 chancellor of
                    the Ionian order of St Michael and St George, and in 1840 he was advanced to the
                    grade of the Grand Cross. In his later years Nicolas was occupied chiefly with
                    works connected with the naval achievements of England. He published <hi

                    the papers of Sir Hudson Lowe. He died at Cape Curé, near Boulogne, August 3,

                    Antiquaries in 1826, but on account of a controversy with the other members in
                    regard to the management of its affairs he withdrew in 1828. Besides exposing in
                    various pamphlets what he regarded as serious defects in its management, he made
                    frequent reference to them in the <hi rend="italic">Retrospective Review,</hi>
                    of which he was joint-editor. He also instituted an inquiry into the proceedings
                    of the Record Commission, the publications of which he regarded as not
                    commensurate in value with the money expended on them. But, although, owing <pb

                    interest in his subject, Nicolas was apt to involve himself in keen controversy,
                    he never cherished personal animosity, and his motives were otherwise above
