                <p><label type="entry">NEW HAVEN</label>, a city and town of New Haven county,
                    Connecticut, U.S., in 41° 19' 28" N. lat. and 72° 55' 19' ’ W. long, (local time
                    16 minutes before that of Washington), is widely known as the seat of Yale
                    College. The town includes the city and two outlying suburbs— Westville and Fair
                    Haven East. The city occupies an alluvial plain, from 3 to 4 miles in breadth,
                    at the head of New Haven harbour, which is an indentation of the northern shore
                    of Long Island Sound, extending inland about 4 miles, and formed by the
                    confluence of three small rivers flowing through the township; the plain is
                    partly enclosed on the east and west by two prominent trap rocks, with
                    precipitous faces towards the city, respectively 360 and 400 feet in height. The
                    mean annual temperature is 49° Fahr.; and the city ranks among the healthiest in
                    the United States. It is 74 miles north-east from New York, with which it is
                    connected by rail, as well as by daily steamboats; it has communication by three
                    railway lines with Boston, 120 miles to the north-east, and two other railways
                    have their termini here.</p>
                <p>The central and older portion of the city is laid out in regular squares,
                    surrounding a public green of 16 acres, on which stand the three oldest churches
                    and a building formerly used as a State-house; the abundance and beauty of the
                    elms planted about this square and along many of the streets has caused the
                    place to be familiarly known as the “Elm City.” On the squares bordering upon
                    this central park are the interesting grounds and buildings of Yale College, the
                    city-hall and county court-house, the post-office and custom-house, and several
                    churches. The college buildings include six dormitories (accommodating about
                    400) for the undergraduate academical department, which contains 620 students,
                    under 36 instructors; and there are thirteen buildings for recitation rooms,
                    laboratories, museums, library, &amp;c. The handsome buildings of the
                    theological department are in the immediate vicinity. Other public buildings
                    are—the general hospital and training school for nurses, an armoury, the orphan
                    asylum, the almshouse, the county prison, the halls of the Sheffield Scientific
                    School, the college observatory, and the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment
                    Station. The finest private residences are in the section of the city north of
                    the central square. There are ten smaller squares within the town limits, and
                    two private parks, of 55 and 30 acres respectively, the smaller being the
                    college athletic grounds. A beautiful park of 352 acres (partly in an adjoining
                    town) was opened in 1881; it lies 2 miles to the north-east of the city green.
                    The public buildings include sixty-one places of worship, of which nineteen
                    belong to the ∙Congregationalists, the only denomination in the town for a
                    century after its settlement; twelve to the Methodists, first organized here in
                    1795; eleven to the Protestant Episcopal Church, first organized about 1736;
                    seven to the Baptists, who formed a church here in 1816; and seven to the Roman
                    Catholics, whose first church was erected in 1834. There are thirty-six public
                    schools; the expenditure for their maintenance was $368,000 in 1882-83.
                    Twenty-nine schoolhouses owned by the town, with their furniture and grounds,
                    represent an outlay of about $675,000. There are also about twenty private
                    schools, the oldest being the Hopkins Grammar School, founded in 1660.</p>
                <p>The harbour, which originally determined the site of the city, and has always
                    been a large factor in its prosperity, is large and safe, though shallow, and is
                    under improvement by the construction of a costly breakwater. Long Wharf, begun
                    in 1682, is 3480 feet in length, the longest pier in the United States. Natural
                    oyster-beds formerly abounded in the harbour and its tributary streams; and
                    extensive beds are still maintained by planting, which give l&lt;&gt;"ge
                    returns, and make New Haven the chief centre of the important oyster trade of
                    Connecticut. The harbour is still more valuable in its relation to the extensive
                    manufacturing industries of the vicinity. Within a radius of 20 miles not less
                    than $50,000,000 is employed in the manufacture of hardware, carriages, arms,
                    and wire. For this New Haven is the commercial centre, and through its port
                    there annually passes merchandise (largely coal and iron) valued at
                    $175,000,000. The foreign trade is chiefly with the West India Islands and
                    Demerara, and its prosperity dates from the latter part of the 18th century. The
                    exports in the thirty-six vessels employed in this branch of trade in 1882
                    (breadstuff's and live stock) were valued at $3,150,000, the imports (sugar and
                    molasses) at $6,281,000; it should, however, be noted that three-fourths of
                    these imports and exports enter and leave the port of New York, although the
                    capital and management of the trade remain in New Haven. The estimated total
                    value of foreign importations received (in 84 vessels of 18,126 tons) at the
                    port in the year ending June 1883 was $1,155,883, the chief articles being sugar
                    and molasses, salt from the West Indies and Spain (about $100,000), and
                    paper-rags from Alexandria. The value of the foreign exports for the same
                    period, in 42 vessels of 7228 tons, was $670,046, the largest item being the
                    shipments of the Winchester Repeating Anns Company. For the same year the
                    estimated value of cargoes received from domestic ports (in 2200 steam vessels
                    and 4125 sailing vessels and barges) was $93,963,900. Of these receipts the
                    largest items were—iron, valued at $2,000,000; lumber, $3,000,000, twice as much
                    more being received by railroad; and coal (a rapidly increasing business of
                    recent growth), $3,750,000. The value of shipments to domestiè ports was
                    $74,812,000.</p>
                <p>In the production of carriages and carriage trimmings, New Haven, which is the
                    chief seat of the trade in New England, employs a capital of perhaps 1⅛ millions
                    dollars; nearly 2000 workmen receive annual wages of about $750,000; and the
                    estimated value of the yearly product is $2,240,000. Another important industry
                    is represented by the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, which, with a capital
                    of $1,000,000, employs 1200 hands, and does a business in sporting guns and
                    ammunition of about $2,500,000 a year. Another noticeable manufacture is that of
                    superior blotting paper from cotton waste; blotting paper was made here for the
                    first time in America in 1856. The other <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0418-0395"/> principal manufactures are locks, rubber, clocks,
                    organs, corsets, fish-lines, and. paper boxes. There are nine banks of deposit,
                    with an aggregate capital of §4,664,000, and a circulation of §3,038,940; also
                    three savings banks, with deposits of about §9,000,000. About §225,000 is
                    annually paid in New Haven in fire insurance premiums, for the protection of
                    property valued at upwards of §25,000,000.</p>
                <p>New Haven (Indian name Quinnipiac, meaning “long-water land ”) was settled in
                    1638 by nearly three hundred English emigrants of more than the average wealth
                    and business ability, led by John Davenport and Theophilus Eaton, with the
                    design of founding a commercial colony to be governed by the laws of the Bible.
                    Davenport, an Oxford graduate, and for fourteen years a minister in London,
                    became the pastor of the New Haven church; and Eaton, a successful London
                    merchant, was the first governor of the colony which grew up about the town. The
                    colony (of the same name) included five other towns, and remained independent
                    until merged, by a charter of Charles II. in 1662, in the older colony of
                    Connecticut; this result was largely due to the waning prosperity of New Haven
                    (in contrast with Connecticut), and to the prejudice against its more rigidly
                    Puritan tone, as shown, for instance, in its code of laws, and in such incidents
                    as the shelter given to Whalley and Goffe, two of the regicide judges. In
                    recognition of its former standing, the sessions of the legislature were held
                    alternately here and in Hartford (the original capital of Connecticut) from 1701
                    to 1874. From the original territory of the town (about 13 by 18 miles) ten new
                    towns have been wholly or partly taken. New Haven was from the beginning
                    distinguished for its care of public education,—a free school being ordered to
                    be set up as early as 1641, and the establishment of a college being
                    contemplated in 1648. In 1716 Yale College was removed from Saybrook to New
                    Haven, which had then somewhat under a thousand inhabitants. A period of quiet
                    and regular growth ensued. In 1754 a printing press was set up, and in 1755 the
                    first newspaper published in Connecticut appeared here. There are now six daily
                    and six weekly papers, besides several college periodicals, <hi rend="italic"
                    >The American Journal of Science,</hi> founded in 1818 by Professor Silliman,
                    and another review <hi rend="italic">{The New Englander).</hi> The Connecticut
                    Academy of Arts and Sciences, incorporated in 1799, and the American Oriental
                    Society, have their libraries here, and publish valuable transactions. In the
                    American Revolution the town favoured resistance to the British Government, and
                    in 1779 was invaded by a detachment of about 3000 British troops, under General
                    Tyron. In 1784 New Haven received a city charter (the earliest in the State),
                    the territory incorporated having then a population of about 3350. With the
                    close of the Revolutionary War commerce revived and expanded; and after the war
                    of 1812 manufactures were introduced.</p>
                <p>The population numbered in 1790, 4510; in 1800, 5157; in 1810, 6967; in 1820,
                    8327; in 1830, 10,678; in 1840, 14,396; in 1850, 22,529; in 1860, 39,267; in
                    1870, 50,840; and in 1880, 62,882, of whom 15,668 were born in foreign
                    countries. The city was in 1880 the third place (next to Boston and Providence)
                    in size in New England, and the twenty-sixth in the United States. Since 1880
                    new territory has been annexed, and the population is estimated in 1883 at
                    nearly 74,000. The real and personal estate of the inhabitants was in 1882
                    valued at §48,335,632 (real estate 34 millions, personalty 14 millions). The net
                    indebtedness of the city (principally contracted in building sewers) was
                    §631,907 at the close of 1882; there was also a debt contracted by the town
                    government of §941,637. The amount appropriated to meet the city expenses for
                    1883 was §559,435. The city is divided into twelve wards, and is governed by a
                    mayor and twenty-four aidermen (twelve elected yearly) and thirty-six
                    councilmen. The town affairs are controlled by a separate board of seven select
                    men.</p>
