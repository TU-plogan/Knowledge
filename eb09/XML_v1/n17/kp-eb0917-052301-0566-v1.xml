                <p><label type="entry">NOAH</label> (⅛ Nω∈, <hi rend="italic">Noe)</hi> is,
                    according to the book of Genesis, the son of Lamech, and the second father of
                    mankind after the deluge. His name, which is of obscure origin, is connected in
                    Gen. v. 29 with a play on the word DΠ3 (nahem), to comfort. The story of the
                    flood, the two elements of which the extant narrative is composed, and the
                    parallel traditions of other nations, particularly of the Babylonians, have been
                    spoken of in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Deluge.</hi> The earlier narrative
                    does not mention the point at which Noah left the ark, and it is doubtful if
                    Gen. xi. 1 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> which seems to be a fragment of a still
                    older tradition, and which makes mankind disperse from Babylonia, originally
                    stood in any connexion with the story of Noah and the flood. The later priestly
                    (or, as it used to be called, Elohistic) narrative names the mountains of
                    Ararat, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> one of the mountains of the land of Ararat,
                    as the place where the ark rested. The identification of this mountain with the
                    Ararat of modern maps (Μ. Masis) is tolerably old; Jerome (on Isa. xxxvii. 38)
                    already places the land of Ararat in this quarter; but a more ancient Jewish
                    tradition, which remained alive throughout the Middle Ages, seeks Ararat in the
                    land of Kardu, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the mountains of the Kurds east of
                    the Tigris (comp. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ararat).</hi> From the Bible it is only
                    certain (Isa. xxxvii. 38; Jer. li. 27) that the kingdom of Ararat was a remote
                    northern district. After describing the covenant which God made with Noah on
                    leaving the ark (Gen. ix. 1-17) the priestly narrative has nothing further to
                    tell of the patriarch’s life; but an older fragment (Gen. ix. 20-27) makes him
                    plant a vineyard and drink of the wine with consequences which lead him to
                    pronounce a blessing on Shem and Japheth and a curse of slavery on Canaan. The
                    story seems to require, for clearness, the omission of the words “Ham, the
                    father of” in verse 22; and if this be so we find that in one tradition the sons
                    of Noah are Shem, Japheth, and Canaan. So taken, the names of the three sons
                    would represent three elements, not in the population of the world, but in that
                    of Palestine. Shem, in Hebrew, means name, and “sons of name,” as opposed to
                    “sons of no name” (Job xxx. 8, A. V., “sons of base men ”), would naturally
                    denote the Hebrew pure-blooded aristocracy, in antithesis to the subject
                    aborigines (Canaan). Wellhausen, to whom this ingenious theory is due, would
                    further identify Japheth in this passage with the Philistines; Budde thinks
                    rather of the Phoenicians. That the divisions Shem, Ham, and Japheth had not
                    always one fixed sense is clear from Gen. x., where two distinct schemes of
                    classification have been mixed up with such results as that Sheba and Havilah
                    appear under Ham at ver. 7, and under Shem in ver. 28 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>
                    The one division appears to be mainly geographical, and is preserved complete,
                    vers. 2-7, 20-23, 31; it bears the marks of the priestly narrator, and was not
                    written before the exile. On the other hand, vers. 8-19, 25-30 belong to the
                    older narrative, and are fragments of a classification seemingly more
                    ethnographical in character.</p>
