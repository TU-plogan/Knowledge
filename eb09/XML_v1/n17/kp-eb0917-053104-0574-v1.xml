                    department of Vendée, and protecting the Bay of Bourgneuf on the south-west.
                    Between the island and the mainland is a sandbank laid bare at low water, and
                    crossed by an embankment and carriage road, which is continually kept <pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0575-0532"/> in good repair. It was not till about 1766 that
                    people found they could walk across to the island, which lies from
                    north-north-west to south-south-east, and is 11 miles long, its breadth varying
                    from 1 mile in the south part to 3 or 4 miles in the north. It appears to be
                    formed of alluvial deposits gradually accumulated round a rock of no great size
                    situated at the meeting-place of the Gascony and Brittany currents. The area now
                    amounts to 18 square miles, of which about a sixth part is occupied by dunes.
                    The total population was 7726 in 1881. There are two communes: Noirmoutier and
                    Barbâtre. The former has about 2029 of its 5908 inhabitants gathered together in
                    a little town with narrow and winding streets. Its castle was once the residence
                    of the abbot of Her. In the church there is a crypt of the 11 th century. A mile
                    to the north of the town lies a pleasant watering-place, rendered picturesque by
                    the La Chaise woods (evergreen oaks and pines), and a grand confusion of rocks,
                    among which the sea has scooped out many a delightful little beach.</p>
                <p>A dolmen, several menhirs, and the ruins of a Gallo-Roman villa with its hot
                    baths show that the island must have been occupied at an early date; but the
                    first fact in its recorded history is the foundation of the Benedictine
                    monastery of Her by St Philibert about 680. From this monastery the name
                    Noirmoutier (Moustier) is derived. It had already attained to great prosperity
                    when it was pillaged by the Normans in 825 and 843. In 1205 the abbey of Notre
                    Dame la Blanche was built at the north extremity of the island to take the place
                    of a Cistercian convent established in the lie du Pilier, at that time attached
                    to Noirmoutier by a dyke. This abbey was ruined by the Protestants in 1562. In
                    1676 the island was captured by the Dutch. Having been seized by Charette during
                    the war of Vendée, it was recovered by the republican general, Haxo, who caused
                    the Vendean leader, d’Elbée, to be shot.</p>
