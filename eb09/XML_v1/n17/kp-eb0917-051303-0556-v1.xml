                <p><label type="entry">NIOBE</label> is a figure who appears in the legends of many
                    parts of Greece, especially Thebes, Argos, and the Hermus valley. Proud of her
                    numerous family, she scoffed at Leto as the mother of only two children. Apollo
                    and Artemis, the children of Leto, slew all her children with their arrows; and
                    Niobe, after vainly trying to defend them, wept over them till she became a rock
                    which still weeps incessantly. It is probable that this tale was in its simplest
                    form a myth of the annual destruction of the bloom of earth by the shafts of the
                    cruel sun-god, and that Niobe was a form of the mother-goddess, the goddess of
                    all earthly life, whose progeny is thus slain every summer. The tragedians read
                    in this tale a moralized myth of the instability of human bliss: Niobe became a
                    representative of human nature, ever liable to become proud in prosperity and to
                    forget the submission and respect due to the gods. In this form the legend has
                    found permanent acceptance in literature and art. The metamorphosis of Niobe was
                    adopted from the local legends of the Smyrna district; here it is probable that
                    Niobe was originally a title of the Meter Sipylene, the deity worshipped all
                    round the sacred mountain of Sipylus. An archaic figure of the goddess, carved
                    in the northern side of the mountain near Magnesia, gave rise to the tales
                    current in this district, that Niobe had thrown herself down from the rock, or
                    that she had been turned into stone. It seems necessary to distinguish from this
                    archaic figure, which is still visible, the “Niobe” described by Pausanias and
                    Quintus Smyrnaeus, both natives of the district. This was an appearance assumed
                    by a cliff in Sipylus when seen from a distance and from the proper point of
                    view. In these later writers the genuine old local legend had been replaced by a
                    new form, founded on the myth as developed by the tragedians; the archaic figure
                    carved in the cliff was known by the natives to be an image of the
                    mother-goddess, whom they worshipped there year by year. But, as with every
                    other point in the legend in its most developed form, the natives had a local
                    representative, of the Niobe, the weeping rock, which they saw in the heart of
                    Sipylus.</p>
