                    (1618—1660), a Puritan fanatic, was born at Andersloe or Ardsley in Yorkshire,
                    in 1618. When the civil war broke out in 1641 Nayler, who was then resident in
                    the parish of Wakefield, joined the Parliamentary army, and served as
                    quartermaster under Lambert. In 1651 he adopted Quakerism, and became a zealous
                    advocate of the new principles both as a preacher and writer. Gradually his
                    opinions became tinged with the wildest fanaticism, until he arrived at the
                    seeming conviction that he was a new incarnation of Christ. He gathered around
                    himself a small band of disciples, who followed him from place to place, paying
                    him the homage due to one gifted with supernatural endowments. In October 1655
                    he, in imitation of Christ’s procession into Jerusalem, entered Bristol on
                    horseback riding single—“a rawboned nude figure, with lank hair reaching below
                    his cheeks,”—attended by seven followers, some on horseback, some on foot, he in
                    silence and they singing “Hosanna! Holy, holy! Lord God of Sabaoth !” The
                    procession passed on to the High Cross of Bristol, where Nayler and his
                    followers were apprehended by the authorities. His trial occupied the second
                    parliament of Cromwell for several days, and on December 16, 1656, he was
                    convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to be whipped from the Palace Yard to the
                    Old Exchange, to be branded in the forehead, to have his tongue bored with a
                    red-hot iron, to be whipped through the streets of Bristol, and to suffer
                    imprisonment with hard labour for two years. These stern measures had the effect
                    of convincing Nayler that his pretensions to supernatural powers were the result
                    of delusion, and on May 26, 1657, he, after recantation, received his freedom.
                    He was readmitted into the communion of the Quakers. In October 1660 Nayler set
                    out to visit his long-forsaken family in Yorkshire, but died on the journey in
                    Huntingdonshire.</p>
