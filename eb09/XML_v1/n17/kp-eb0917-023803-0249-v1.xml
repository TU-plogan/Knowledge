                <p><label type="entry">NASSAU</label>, now forming the bulk of the government
                    district of Wiesbaden, in the Prussian province of Hesse-Nassau, was till 1866
                    an independent and sovereign duchy of Germany, consisting of a compact mass of
                    territory, 1830 square miles in area, bounded on the S. and W. by the Main and
                    Rhine, on the N. by Westphalia, and on the E. by Hesse. This territory is
                    divided into two nearly equal parts by the river Lahn, which flows from east to
                    west into the Rhine. The southern half is almost entirely occupied by the Taunus
                    Mountains, which attain a height of 2900 feet in the Great Feldberg, while to
                    the north of the Lahn is the barren Westerwald, culminating in the
                    Salzburgerkopf (2000 feet). The valleys and low-lying districts, especially the
                    Rheingau, are very fertile, producing abundance of grain, flax, hemp, and fruit;
                    but by far the most valuable product of the soil is its wine, which includes
                    several of the choicest Rhenish varieties (Johannisberger, Marcobrunner,
                    Assmannshauser, &amp;c.). Nassau is one of the most thickly wooded regions in
                    Germany, about 42 per cent, of its surface being occupied by forests, which
                    yield good timber and harbour large quantities of game. The rivers abound in
                    fish,—the salmon fisheries on the Rhine being especially important. There are
                    upwards of a hundred mineral springs in the district, most of which formerly
                    belonged to the duke, and afforded him a considerable part of his revenue. The
                    best-known are those of Wiesbaden, Ems, Soden, Schwalbach, Schlangenbad,
                    Geilnau, and Fachingen. The other mineral wealth of Nassau includes iron, lead,
                    copper, building <pb break="no"

                    of malachite. Its manufactures, including cotton and woollen goods, are
                    unimportant, but a brisk trade is carried on by rail and river in wine, timber,
                    grain, and fruit. There are few places of importance besides the above-named
                    spas; Höchst is the only manufacturing town. Wiesbaden, with 50,238 inhabitants,
                    is the capital of the government district as it was of the duchy. In 1864 the
                    duchy contained 468,311 inhabitants, of whom 242,000 were Protestants (including
                    the reigning house), 215,000 Roman Catholics, and 7000 Jews. The ecclesiastical
                    jurisdiction was in the hands of the Protestant bishop of Wiesbaden and the
                    Roman Catholic bishop of Limburg. Education was amply provided for in numerous
                    higher and lower schools. The annual revenue of the dukedom was about 4,000,000
                    guldens (£400,000). It furnished a contingent of 6000 men to the army of the
                    German Confederation.</p>
                <p>During the Boman period the district enclosed by the Lahn, the Main, and the
                    Rhine was at first occupied by the Mattiaci and then by the Alemanni. The latter
                    were subdued by the Franks under Clovis in 496, and at the partition of Verdun
                    in 843 the country became part of the Eastern or German empire. Christianity
                    seems to have been introduced in the 4th century. The founder of the house of
                    Nassau is usually recognized in Count Otho of Laurenburg, brother of King Conrad
                    I., who flourished on the banks of the Lahn in the 10th century. His successors
                    afterwards took the title of counts of Nassau, from a castle which they erected
                    on a steep hill overlooking the Lahn, and in 1192 transferred their allegiance
                    from the archbishop of Treves to the emperor of Germany. In 1255 Walram and
                    Otho, the two sons of Count Henry the Rich, divided between them their paternal
                    inheritance, which had in the meantime been steadily increasing, and founded the
                    two Nassovian dynasties which have flourished down to our own times.</p>
                <p>The fortunes of the Othonian or younger branch have been the more brilliant, but
                    belong properly to the history of Holland. In 1564 Count William of Nassau, the
                    hero of the Dutch war of independence, succeeded to the principality of Orange,
                    which furnished the historical title of himself and his descendants. The house
                    is now represented by the king of the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>Adolf of Nassau, the son of the founder of the elder or Walram line, and
                    progenitor of the dukes of Nassau, became emperor of Germany in 1292, but was
                    defeated and slain in 1298 by his rival Albert of Austria. In 1366 the head of
                    the house was created a prince of the empire, and the Reformation was introduced
                    in the second half of the 16th century. The territories of the house of Walram
                    were frequently partitioned among various branch lines, few of which perpetuated
                    themselves beyond a few generations. At the beginning of the 19th century'we
                    find two lines still flourishing—Nassau-Ufingen and Nassau-Weilburg. Both these
                    joined the Rhenish Confederation in 1806, and the prince of Nassau-Ufingen, as
                    head of his family, received the ducal title from the hands of Napoleon. After
                    the battle of Leipsic both princes threw in their lot with the allies. In 1816
                    the duke of Nassau-Ufingen died, and the prince of Weilburg succeeded to the
                    whole of the Nassovian territory, with the title of duke of Nassau.</p>
                <p>This prince had already, in 1814, granted his subjects a limited constitution,
                    providing for two representative chambers on a landed-property basis, and this
                    came into force in 1818. The estates, however, came almost at once into
                    collision with the duke on the question of the ducal domains, and the
                    dissensions arising from this source were not compromised till 1834. In 1835 the
                    duchy took an important step in the development of its material prosperity by
                    joining the Zollverein. In 1848 Duke Adolf was compelled to yield to the temper
                    of the times and grant a more liberal constitution, with a single chamber
                    elected by universal suffrage; but the following years witnessed a series of
                    reactionary measures which reduced matters to their former unsatisfactory
                    condition. The duke adhered steadfastly to his Conservative principles, while
                    his people showed their sympathies by returning one Liberal chamber after
                    another. In 1866, though the chambers refused a vote of credit for military
                    purposes, the duke espoused the cause of Austria, and in doing so sealed the
                    fate of his duchy. A little later he was a fugitive before the Prussian troops,
                    and on October 3d, 1866, Nassau was formally incorporated with the kingdom of
                    Prussia.</p>
                <p>The little town of Nassau, on the right bank of the Lahn, 15 miles above Coblenz,
                    is interesting as the birthplace of the celebrated Prussian statesman, Baron
                    Stein. Adjacent are Burg Stein, his ancestral seat, and Burg Nassau, the cradle
                    of the Nassovian dukes. Nassau is said to have existed as early as the 8th
                    century under the name of Nasonga. Population (1880) 1786.</p>
