                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Heneage Finch</hi> (1621- 1682), first earl, lord
                    chancellor of England, was descended from an old family, many of whose members
                    had attained to high legal eminence, and was the eldest son of Sir Heneage
                    Finch, recorder of London, by his first wife Frances, daughter of Sir Edmund
                    Bell of Beaupré Hall, Norfolk. In the register of Oxford university he is
                    entered as born in Kent, 23d December 1621, and probably his native place was
                    Eastwell in that county. He was educated at Westminster and at Christ Church,
                    Oxford, where he remained till he became a member of the Inner Temple in 1638.
                    He was called to the bar in 1645, and soon obtained a lucrative practice,
                    acquiring from his persuasive powers the titles of “the silver-tongued lawyer”
                    and “the English Cicero,” and from his graceful action that of the “English
                    Roscius.” He was chosen a member of the convention parliament of April 1660, and
                    shortly afterwards was appointed solicitor-general, being created a baronet the
                    day after he was knighted. In May of the following year he was chosen to
                    represent the university of Oxford, and in 1665 the university created him a
                    D.C.L. In 1670 he became attorney-general, and in 1675 lord chancellor. He died
                    in Great Queen Street, Lincoln’s Inn Fields, 18th December 1682, and was buried
                    in the church of Ravenstone in Bucks.</p>
                <p>The contemporaries of Lord Chancellor Nottingham of both sides of politics agree
                    in their high estimate of his integrity, moderation, and eloquence, while his
                    abilities as a lawyer are sufficiently attested by the fact that he is still
                    spoken of as “the father of equity.” His most important contribution to the
                    statute book is “The Statute of Frauds.” While attorney-general he superintended
                    the edition of Sir Henry Hobart’s <hi rend="italic">Reports,</hi> 1671. He also

                <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel Finch</hi> (1647-1730), second earl, son of the
                    preceding, entered parliament for Lichfield in 1679. He was one of the privy
                    councillors who in 1685 signed the order for the proclamation of the duke of
                    York, but during the -whole of the reign of James II. he kept away from the
                    court. At the last moment he hesitated to join in the invitation to William of
                    Orange, and after the abdication of James II. he was the leader of the party who
                    were in favour of a regency. He declined the office of lord chancellor under
                    William and Mary, but accepted that of secretary of state, retaining it till
                    December 1693. Under Anne he in 1702 again accepted the same office in the
                    ministry of Godolphin, but finally retired in 1704. On the accession of George
                    I. he was made president of the council, but in 1716 he finally withdrew from
                    office. He succeeded to the earldom of Winchelsea 9th September 1729, and died
                    1st January 1730.</p>
