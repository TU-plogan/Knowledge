                <p><label type="entry">NIGHTSHADE</label>, a general term for the genus of plants
                    known to botanists as <hi rend="italic">Solanum.</hi> The species to which the
                    name of Nightshade is commonly given in England is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Solanum</hi><hi rend="italic">Dulcamara,</hi> L., which is also called the
                    Bittersweet or Woody Nightshade. It is a common plant in damp hedgebanks and
                    thickets, scrambling over underwood and hedges. It has slender slightly woody
                    stems, with alternate lanceolate leaves more or less cordate and auriculate at
                    the base. The flowers are arranged in drooping cymes, and resemble those of the
                    potato in shape, although much smaller. The corolla is rotate, of a lilacblue
                    colour with a green spot at the base of each segment, and is furnished with
                    yellow sessile anthers united at their margins so as to form a cone in the
                    centre of the corolla.</p>
                <p>The flowers are succeeded by ovate scarlet berries, which in large doses appear
                    to be poisonous or, to say the least, dangerous to children, cases of poisoning
                    by them having occurred. The plant derives its names of bittersweet aud <hi
                    rend="italic">Dulcamara</hi> from the fact that its taste is at first pleasantly
                    sweet and then bitter. The young stems collected in autumn have been used in
                    medicine as an alterative in rheumatism and certain skin diseases, but are
                    little used at the present time except by homoeopaths, by whom <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dulcamara</hi> is given as an anticatarrhal remedy in all symptoms produced by
                    cold arising from exposure to damp. It owes its medicinal activity to a bitter
                    principle yielding by decomposition sugar and the alkaloid “solania,” C <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 43</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 69</hi> NO <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 16</hi>. This principle has been found in small quantity in
                    the leaves, stalks, and berries. <hi rend="italic">Dulcamara</hi> also contains
                    another glucoside “dulcamarin,” C <hi rend="subscript"> 22</hi> H <hi

                    excitant action on the medulla oblongata. The term Deadly Nightshade is often
                    erroneously applied to this plant, and the popular usage has even been confirmed
                    by so eminent a botanist as Bentham <hi rend="italic">(Handbook of the British
                    Flora,</hi> p. 384, 1858). It is generally accepted, however, that the deadly

                    spores to the potato if not removed from the hedges of the fields where potatoes
                    are grown.</p>
                <p>The Garden Nightshade, <hi rend="italic">Solanum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nigrum,</hi> L., differs from &amp; <hi rend="italic">Dulcamara</hi> in having
                    white flowers in small umbels and globose black berries. It is a common weed in
                    gardens and waste places, growing about 12 or 18 inches high, and has ovate,
                    entire or sinuate-dentate leaves. Two varieties of the plant, one with red and
                    the other with yellow berries, are sometimes met with, but are comparatively
                    rare. The berries have been known to produce poisonous effects when eaten by
                    children, and owe their properties to the presence of solania. They are,
                    however, said to be eaten without inconvenience in British Kaffraria, and in
                    Réunion and Mauritius the leaves are eaten like spinach; their innocuousness in
                    these cases may, however, be due to the poisonous principle being removed or
                    decomposed by the process of cooking.</p>
                <p>The name of nightshade is applied to plants of different genera in other
                    countries. American Nightshade is a species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phytolacca</hi>; the Three-leaved Nightshade is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trillium·,</hi> the Malabar Nightshade is a <hi rend="italic">Basella·,</hi>
                    the Bastard Nightshade is a <hi rend="italic">Rivina;</hi> and the Enchanter’s
                    Nightshade is <hi rend="italic">Circaea</hi><hi rend="italic">lutetiana.</hi>
                    The last-named is not known to possess any poisonous property, and the name
                    seems to have been given to it in the first place in mistake for a species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Mandragora</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mandrake).</hi></p>
