                <p><label type="entry">NÁGPUR</label>, a district in the division of the same name,
                    in the Central Provinces of India, lying between 20° 36' and 21° 43' N. lat.,
                    and between 78° 17' and 79° 42' E. long., bounded on the N. by Chhindwâra and
                    Seoni, E. by Bhandâra, S. by Chânda and Wardhâ, and W. by Wardhâ. and Ellichpur,
                    with an area of 3786 square miles. Nâgpur district lies immediately below the
                    great table-land of the Sâtpura range. A second line of hills shuts in the
                    district on the south-west, and a third runs from north to south, parting the
                    country into two plains of unequal size. These hills are all offshoots of the
                    Sâtpuras, and nowhere attain any great elevation. Their heights are rocky and
                    sterile, but the valleys and lowlands at their feet are fertile, yielding rich
                    crops of corn and garden produce. The western plain slopes down to the river
                    Wardhâ, is-watered by the Jâm and Madâr rivers, tributaries of the Wardhâ, and
                    contains the most highly-tilled land in the district, abounding in fruit trees,
                    and the richest garden cultivation. The eastern plain (six times the larger),
                    stretching away to the confines of Bhandâra and Chânda, consists of a rich
                    undulating country, luxuriant with mango-groves, and dotted towards the east
                    with countless small, tanks. It is watered by the Kanhân, with its tributaries,
                    which flows into the Waingangâ beyond the district.</p>
                <p>The population in 1881 was 697,356 (British-born, 1063; other Europeans and

                    224,495, cotton 101,166, and sugar-cane 1545. During the last few years there
                    has been a great increase in the manufacture of cotton in the Empress mills at
                    Nagpur. There were 30,000 spindles in operation in 1882, the output of yarn and
                    cloth being 1,804,530 and 149,995 lb respectively. The Nagpur branch of the
                    Great Indian Peninsula Railway runs through the district for a distance of 26
                    miles. The gross revenue in 1876-77 was 1,460,168 rupees.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nagpub,</hi> the chief town of Nâgpur district, and the
                    administrative headquarters of the Central Provinces, India, is situated in the
                    centre of the district, on the banks of a small stream, the Nâg, in 21° 9' 30"
                    N. lat., 79° 7' E. long. The population was 79,842 in 1881. The municipal limits
                    include, besides the city proper, the suburb of Sftâbaldf, and the European
                    station of Sftâbaldf, with Tâklf. In the centre stands Sftâbaldf Hill, crowned
                    with the fort, which commands a fine view of the country round. On the north and
                    west lies the prettily wooded station of Sftâbaldf; beyond, to the north, are
                    the military lines and <hi rend="italic">bàzàrs,</hi> and, again, beyond these
                    the suburb of Tâklf. Close under the southern side of the hill is the native
                    suburb of Sftâbaldf. Below the eastern glacis of the fort is the railway
                    terminus. Beyond this lies the broad sheet of water knoλvn as the Jamâ Talâo,
                    and farther east is the city, completely hidden in a mass of foliage. Three
                    great roads connect the city with the European station. Handsome tanks and
                    gardens, constructed by the Mahratta princes, lie outside the city. Many Hindu
                    temples, elaborately carved in the best style of Mahratta architecture<pb

                    black basalt, profusely ornamented with wood carving, was burnt down in 1864,
                    and only the great gateway now remains. The tombs of the Bhonslà kings lie to
                    the south of the city.</p>
                <p>Nagpur does a large and increasing trade, the chief imports being wheat and other
                    grain, salt, country cloth, European piece goods, silk, and spices. Cloth forms
                    the chief article of manufacture and export. The finer fabrics of Nagpur have
                    long been famous, and are still, in spite of the competition of English stuffs,
                    in great request. Most of the public offices are in the station of
                    Sitabaldi.</p>
