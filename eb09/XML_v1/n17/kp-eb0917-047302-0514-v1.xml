                <p><label type="entry">NIAM-NIAM</label>, a numerous and widespread Central African
                    race, who were first visited by John Petherick in 1858, and have since been more
                    fully described, especially by Piaggia, Dr Schweinfurth, Dr W. Junker, Potagos,
                    and G. Casati. But none of these explorers have penetrated more than a few miles
                    from the upper Nile and Welle basins into the Niam-Niam domain, which
                    consequently still remains for the most part an unknown land. Its limits are
                    determined on the east by the Bongo and Monbuttu territories, about 28° E.
                    long., and on the north as far as 20° E. long, by Dar-Fertit and Dar-Banda,
                    about 7° N. lat. But in other directions they extend for unknown distances on
                    the south towards the middle Congo, westwards along the Kuta (upper Shari ?)
                    probably to the F'an country, which is now known to stretch from the Ogoway
                    basin for a vast space towards the north-east. Nearly the whole of equatorial
                    Africa, from the neighbourhood of Lake Albert Nyanza to the Atlantic, east and
                    west, and from the Congo to the headwaters of the Shari, south and north, would
                    thus appear to be divided between the two great cannibal nations of the Fans on
                    the west and Niam-Niam on the east. Their common cannibalism, combined with some
                    other characteristics, has suggested a possible ethnical relationship of these
                    two peoples, which, however, has not been confirmed by a close examination of
                    the respective physical types. The Fans, like the Fulahs of Soudan, seem to be
                    fundamentally distinct from the Negro stock, although more or less affected by
                    Negro elements, whereas the Niam-Niam, notwithstanding certain marked
                    peculiarities, cannot be severed ethnically from that connexion.</p>
                <p>Affinities have also been sought for them amongst the neighbouring Krej tribes,
                    amongst the Nubas of Kordofan and the Nile, and even amongst the Soudanese
                    Fulahs, but, in the absence of more ample details, any attempt to determine the
                    relations of the Niam-Niam to the surrounding peoples must be regarded as
                    premature.</p>
                <p>The term Niam-Niam, by which they are best known<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Not exclusively, for they are called

                    pronounced Gnam-gnam (Ital. <hi rend="italic">gn),</hi> has been adopted and

                    populations, appears to be of Dinka origin, meaning in that language “great
                    eaters,” with reference, as is supposed, to their cannibalistic propensities.
                    The most general national name is Zandey (pl. A-Zandey), which seems to be
                    current throughout the eastern NiamNiam domain, a region estimated by
                    Schweinfurth (ii. p. 4) at about 48,000 square miles, with a population of at
                    least two mdlions. But these by no means constitute a uniform ethnical group,
                    for within this area is the large A-Madi nation,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Visited by Dr W. Junker in 1882-83, and

                    even in some respects physically from the ordinary Niam-Niam type. Apart also
                    from numerous tribal divisions, the eastern Niam-Niam proper form three very
                    distinct branches, presenting considerable varieties in appearance, language,
                    usage, and general culture. The bleak, northern highlands bordering east on the
                    Bongos and north on DarFertit are occupied by the Banda Niam-Niam, a rude and
                    savage people, rather of a black-brown than of a red complexion, omnivorous in
                    taste, devouring apes, reptiles, insects, and apparently human flesh, practising
                    circumcision, and wearing a broad strip of bast or even mere foliage round the
                    loins. These are succeeded southwards by the more civilized Belanda Niam-Niam,
                    who hold the fertile hilly territory about the headwaters of the Abu-Dinga,
                    Beri, Dembo, and other western tributaries of the White Nile. They are of a very
                    dark red or coppery colour, of middle size, and somewhat regular features,
                    betraying distinctly Negro blood chiefly in their woolly hair and thick lips.
                    Their costume is even more scanty than that of the Banda, but special attention
                    is paid to the hair, which often presents the most elaborate designs, more
                    picturesque than conducive to the comfort of the wearer. They cultivate durrah,
                    maize, sesame, bananas, batatas, and are skilled wood and ivory carvers, and
                    workers in iron, producing knives, spears, chains, bracelets, and other
                    ornaments in this metal, which abounds in their country. Very different from
                    either of the foregoing are the so-called “White” Niam-Niam, neighbours of and
                    probably often confounded with the already mentioned A-Madi of the Makua-Welle
                    river basin. The complexion seems to be more of a bronze tint, and they are
                    distinguished from the other branches of the family by their tall stature,
                    symmetrical figure, long kinky hair and beard, and higher social culture. They
                    wear cotton garments, obtained by barter for ivory, copper, and iron, are fond
                    of music and dancing, occasionally form powerful political states, which,
                    however, are liable to disintegration at the death of the founder,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>About the middle of this
                    century most of the eastern Niam-Niam lands appear to have been subject to
                    Yapaty, son of Mabengeh. But after his death they were distributed amongst his
                    seven sons, Renjy, Balia, Perkye, Tombo, Bazimbey, Manuba; and in 1870 there
                    were already fourteen reigning princes of this dynasty, besides several· others
                    of doubtful relationship with the line of Mabengeh. In the Niam-Niam districts
                    visited by the traders from Egyptian Soudan there were at that time altogether
                    as many as thirty-five independent chiefs. But reports were current of a very
                    powerful “sultan” named Mofio, whose empire lay some 300 miles farther west.
                    Another large state, founded in the Welle region by Kipa (Kifa), brother of
                    Yapaty, also fell to pieces after his death in 1868. The powerful chiefs
                    Bakangoi and Kanna, visited in 1883 by Casati, are sons of this Kipa, whose
                    grave near Kanna’s village is still watched by twenty-five “vestals,” bound,
                    under penalty of death, to keep a fire constantly burning, and to preserve their

                    certain affinities with the Baghirmi and other Negroid peoples of the Chad
                    basin. But so little is yet known of the institutions and internal condition of
                    the Niam-Niam race that these divisions cannot be accepted as finally
                    established. At the same time there can be no doubt at all about the existence
                    of a very distinct Niam-Niam type, which is one of the most marked in the whole
                    of Africa. “These beings,” remarks Schweinfurth, on his first introduction to
                    them, <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n515/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0917-0515-0474"/> “stood out like creatures of another world . . .
                    a people of a marked and most distinct nationality, and that in Africa and
                    amongst Africans is saying much” (i. p. 437).</p>
                <p>Their most salient characteristics appear to be—great space between the orbits,
                    giving them at once a peculiarly savage and frank expression; very short nose,
                    with correspondingly long upper lip; woolly hair much longer than that of any
                    other Negro people; head of a pronounced brachycephalous type, agreeing in this
                    respect with the Bongos of the White Nile, but differing from the great majority
                    of the other African dark races, who are distinctly dolichocephalic; features
                    generally round, less prognathous, aud altogether more regular than the typical
                    Negro; ruddy brown or chocolate colour, like that of a cigar, scarcely ever
                    black, but occasionally bronze and even olive (Petheriek); symmetrical figures,
                    about the middle size, robust and active. These points seem to indicate a large
                    commingling of Negro and foreign elements, but in what proportion and from what
                    source it would be unsafe to conjecture in the absence of trustworthy
                    anthropometrical data. At present all that can be said with any certainty is
                    that the A-Zandey are to be regarded as rather of mixed Negroid than of pure
                    Negro stock.</p>
                <p>Their traditions, customs, political and religious institutions, and general
                    culture seem to point at the same conclusion. The savagery of most tribes, their
                    pronounced cannibalism, agricultural and hunting rather than pastoral habits,
                    universal belief in sorcery and fetichism, may be credited to the Negro element,
                    while to foreign influences may be attributed their great intelligence, shown
                    especially in the skilful structure of their dwellings and in the remarkable
                    taste and proficiency displayed in the native industries. Prominent among these
                    are their earthenware vessels of faultless symmetry; iron-smelting and metal
                    works such as scimitars, knives, and spears; wood carvings such as stools,
                    benches, bowls, tobacco pipes of varied and intricate design, and often
                    “admirable works of art” (Schweinfurth). It may also be stated that their
                    reputation for extreme ferocity appears to have been greatly exaggerated by
                    early report, although on the other hand the charge of cannibalism in its very
                    worst forms has been fully confirmed by the latest European observers.
                    Nevertheless the A-Zandey, who everywhere present those sharp contrasts of
                    habits and temperament so characteristic of mixed races, are distinguished by
                    some excellent qualities, such as frankness, courage, an instinctive love of
                    art, and above all a genuine and lasting affection for their women, such as is
                    betrayed by no other African race. “A husband will spare no sacrifice to redeem
                    an imprisoned wife; and the Nubians, being acquainted with this, turn it to
                    profitable account in the ivory trade. They are quite aware that whoever
                    possesses a female hostage can obtain almost any compensation from a Niam-niam”
                    (Schweinfurth, i. p. 472).</p>
                <p>Beyond a few meagre vocabularies no materials have yet been collected for the
                    study of the Zandey language, which, except in the A-Madi country, appears to be
                    everywhere spoken with considerable uniformity in the eastern Niam-niam lands.
                    Its phonetic system, such as initial <hi rend="italic">mb</hi> and vowel <hi
                    rend="italic">auslaut,</hi> affiliates it, not to the Libyan, as has been
                    asserted, but to the Negro linguistic type. Within this order of speech its
                    pronominal prefix inflexion points to affinity rather with the southern Bantu
                    than with the Soudan group of languages. Thus the personal plural α-, as in
                    A-Zandey, A-Madi, A-Banga, &amp;c., would appear to be identical in origin and
                    meaning with the Bantu <hi rend="italic">wa-,</hi> as in Wa-Ganda, Wa-Swaheli,
                    Wa-Zambara, &amp;c. There is also the same dearth of abstract terms, which
                    renders the translation of Scripture into the Negro tongues such a hopeless
                    task. Compare <hi rend="italic">gumbah,</hi> an expression for the deity, really
                    meaning “lightning,” with the Chinyanja <hi rend="italic">chuuta=thunder= God
                    (I)</hi> and the Zulu <hi rend="italic">Unkulunlculu=great-grandfather,</hi>
                    also adopted by the missionaries as the nearest equivalent for the deity in that
                    language.</p>
