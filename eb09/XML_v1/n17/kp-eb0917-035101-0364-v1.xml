                <p><label type="entry">NERTCHINSK</label>, a district town of eastern Siberia,
                    situated in the government of Transbaikalia, 178 miles to the east of Tchita, on
                    the left bank of the Nertcha, 3 miles from its junction with the Shilka. It is
                    badly built of wood, and its lower part frequently suffers from inundations. The
                    4000 inhabitants support themselves mainly by agriculture, tobacco-growing, and
                    cattle breeding; a few merchants also carry on an active trade in furs and
                    cattle, in brick-tea from China, and manufactured wares from Russia,—Nertchinsk
                    being the trading centre for all that part of Dahouria which is situated on the
                    eastern slope of the Stanovoy ridge.</p>

                <p>The fort of Nertchinsk dates from 1654, and the town was founded in 1658 by
                    Pashkoff, who in that year opened direct communication between the Russian
                    settlements in Transbaikalia and those on the Amur which had been founded by
                    Cossacks and fur-traders coming from the Yakutsk region. The mutual help thus
                    given proved, however, insufficient, and two years after the fall of Albazin—the
                    chief Russian fort on the Amur—the Russian envoy Golovin, meeting at Nertchinsk
                    the Chinese envoys, who were supported by a strong military force encamped on
                    the banks of the Shilka, signed in 1689 the well-known “treaty of Nertchinsk,”
                    which stopped for two centuries the further advance of Russians into the basin
                    of the Amur. Nertchinsk, which in the following year received municipal
                    institutions and was more strongly fortified, soon became the chief centre for
                    the trade with China. The opening of the western route through Mongolia, by
                    Urga, and the establishment of a custom-house at Kiachta in 1728, diverted this
                    trade into a new channel; so that towards the end of the 18th century Nertchinsk
                    lost its commercial importance; but it acquired a new consequence from the
                    influx of immigrants, mostly exiles, into eastern Transbaikalia, the discovery
                    of rich mines, and the arrival of great numbers of convicts. It ultimately
                    became the chief town of Transbaikalia, andin 1812 was transferred from the
                    banks of the Shilka to its present site, on account of the floods. After the
                    foundation, in 1851, of Tchita, the present capital of Transbaikalia, it was
                    reduced to the rank of a district town, and is now rapidly falling into
                    decay.</p>
