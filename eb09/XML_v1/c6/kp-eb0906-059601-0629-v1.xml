                <p><label type="entry">CROMARTY</label>, a county in the north of Scotland,
                    consisting of eleven detached portions scattered throughout Ross-shire, with
                    which county it is for most purposes incorporated. One of these portions, that
                    which is situated on the south shore of the Cromarty Firth (from which it takes
                    its name <hi rend="italic">cromachty,</hi> or crooked bay), is the original
                    county; and this district still preserves for Cromarty a separate
                    lordlieutenancy and commission of supply. As a county, it was originally very
                    inconsiderable in extent; but by the additions which were made to it towards the
                    end of the 17th century it was increased to fifteen times its former size. Of
                    these additions, one is a small district surrounding Tarbat House, on the
                    northern shore of Cromarty Bay; and a second runs from the south side of Tain
                    Firth to the Moray Firth, cutting off that portion of the county of Ross which
                    terminates in Tarbat Ness, the, extremity of which also belongs to Cromarty. Two
                    more fragments lie on the south of the River Carron, in the parish of
                    Kincardine; the sixth extends northward from the burgh of Dingwall, situated
                    chiefly in the parish of Fodderty, and occupied in great part by the peak and
                    slopes of Ben Wyvis; the seventh lies to the north of Loch Fannich in the parish
                    of Contin, at some distance to the north-west of which a triangular morsel is
                    found to the north of Loch Nid; the ninth is that which stretches along the
                    southern shore of Little Loch Broom; and the tenth is the district of Ullapool
                    and Coygach, with the adjacent islets, lying between the northern shore of Loch
                    Broom and Sutherlandshire. This district, which is the largest portion of the
                    county, occupies an area of about 20 miles in length by 9 in breadth. The
                    straggling arrangement of Cromarty was produced by the influence of George,
                    Viscount Tarbat, afterwards earl of Cromarty, who, wishing to have all his
                    various lands included in one shire, got them annexed to his own county in 1685
                    and 1698. The total extent of the county is estimated at 220,800 acres, or 345
                    square miles, equal to about a tenth of the area of the united county of Ross
                    and Cromarty. The Cromarty Firth forms one of the finest harbours on the east
                    coast of Scotland, securely sheltered at its mouth by two remarkable crags
                    called the “Soutars.” See Ross.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cromarty,</hi> the county town, is situated near the mouth
                    of the firth of that name on its southern shore, 16 miles N.N.E. of Inverness.
