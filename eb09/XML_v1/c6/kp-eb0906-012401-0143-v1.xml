                <p><label type="entry">COLCHESTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Abbot,
                    Lord</hi></label> (1757-1829), born at Abingdon, was the son of Dr John Abbot,
                    rector of All Saints, Colchester, and, by his mother’s second marriage,
                    half-brother of the famous Jeremy Bentham. From Westminster School, Charles
                    Abbot passed to Christ Church College, Oxford, where be gained the chancellor’s
                    medal for Latin verse and the Vinerian Scholarship. In 1795, after having
                    practised twelve years as a barrister, and published a treatise proposing the
                    incorporation of the judicial system of Wales with that of England, he was
                    appointed to the office previously held by his brother of clerk of the rules in
                    the King’s Bench; and in June of the same year he was elected member of
                    parliament for Helston, through the influence of the duke of Leeds. In 1796
                    Abbot commenced his career as a reformer in parliament, by obtaining the
                    appointment of two committees,—the one to report on the arrangements which then
                    existed as to temporary laws or laws about to expire, the other to devise
                    methods for the better publication of new statutes. To the latter committee, and
                    a second committee which he proposed some years later, it is owing that copies
                    of new statutes were thenceforth sent to all magistrates and municipal bodies.
                    To Abbot’s efforts were also due the establishment of the Royal Record
                    Commission, the reform of the system which allowed the public money to lie for
                    some time at long interest in the hands of the public accountants, and, most
                    important of all, the Act for taking the first census, that of 1801. On the
                    formation of the Addington ministry in March 1801, Abbot became chief secretary
                    and privy seal for Ireland; and in the February of the following year he was
                    chosen speaker of the House of Commons—a position which he held with universal
                    satisfaction till 1817, when an attack of erysipelas compelled him to retire. In
                    response to an address of the Commons, he was raised to the peerage as Baron
                    Colchester, with a pension of £4000, of which £3000 was to be continued to his
                    heir. On the 8th May 1829, he died of erysipelas. His speeches against the Roman
                    Catholic claims were published in 1828.</p>
