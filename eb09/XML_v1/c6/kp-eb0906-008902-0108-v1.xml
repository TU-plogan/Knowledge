                    the capital of Rhenish Prussia, is pleasantly situated at the confluence of the
                    Rhine and Moselle. From this circumstance it derived its ancient name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Confluentes,</hi> of which Coblentz is a corruption. This city is
                    still of consequence from a military point of view, since it commands the
                    junction of two great rivers. Its fortifications, which are very extensive, not
                    only protect the town, but connect the works on the left bank of the Rhhιe with
                    the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein on the other side of the river. The city is
                    almost triangular in shape; two sides are bounded by the Rhine and Moselle, the
                    third by strong fortifications. These are pierced by two massive gates, the Lohr
                    and Mayence gates, with drawbridges over the fosse. The military works, which
                    were constructed on the combined systems of Carnot and Montalembert, include no
                    fewer than 26 forts, and form a fortified camp capable of containing 100,000
                    men. The Rhine is crossed here by a bridge of boats 485 yards long, and by the
                    Iron Bridge, built for railway purposes in 1866 The Moselle is spanned by a
                    Gothic freestone bridge of 14 arches, 1100 feet in length, erected in 1344, and
                    also by a railway bridge. In the more ancient part of Coblentz are several
                    buildings which possess an historical <pb break="no"

                    confluence of the rivers, is the church of St Castor, built in the early Lombard
                    style of architecture, and surmounted by four towers. The church was originally
                    founded in 836 by Lewis the Pious, but the present edifice is considerably less
                    ancient. It was here that the sons of Charlemagne met in 843, when they divided
                    the empire into France, Germany, and Italy. In front of the church of St Castor
                    stands a fountain, erected by the French in 1812, with an inscription to
                    commemorate Napoleon’s invasion of Russia. Not long after, the Russian troops
                    occupied Coblentz; and St Priest, their commander, added in irony these words-—
                    <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">Vu et approuvé</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >par</hi><hi rend="italic">nous, Commandant Russe de la Ville de Coblence:
                    Janvier 1er,</hi> 1814.” In this quarter of the town there is also the
                    Liebfrauenkirche, a fine specimen of the old cathedral style, built in 1259; the
                    ancient townhall; the Castle of the Electors of Treves, erected in 1280, now
                    converted into a manufactory of japan-ware; and the family-house of the
                    Metternichs, where Prince Metternich, the Austrian statesman, was born in 1772.
                    The more modern part of the town has open, regular streets, and many of its
                    public buildings are handsome. The principal of these is the Palace or Royal
                    Castle, with one front looking towards the Rhine, the other into the Neustadt,
                    or Great Square. It was built in 1778-86, and contains among other curiosities
                    some fine Gobelin tapestry work. Another large edifice is the Palace of Justice,
                    where the law courts sit, and assizes are held every three months. Coblentz has
                    also a gymnasium (formerly a convent of Jesuits), a hospital, managed by the
                    sisters of charity, an orphan asylum, a valuable town library, a theatre, a
                    casino, a picture gallery, a musical institute, and a medical school. Above the
                    Iron Bridge are <hi rend="italic">Anlagen,</hi> or pleasure-grounds, much
                    resorted to by the town’s-people. The manufactures consist chiefly of linens,
                    cottons, japan-ware, furniture, and tobacco. Coblentz is a free port, and
                    carries on an extensive commerce by means of the Rhine, Moselle, and Lahn. Being
                    in the centre of the hock wine district, a large trade in this class of produce
                    is carried on with Great Britain, Holland, and other countries. Large exports of
                    mineral waters are also made, about one million jars of seltzer being shipped
                    annually. Among the products of the neighbouring provinces which are exported
                    from Coblentz are corn, iron, volcanic stones, potter’s clay, stoneware, and
                    bark. The population is 28,000.</p>
                <p>Coblentz was one of the military posts established by Drusus about 9 B.c. It is
                    not unfrequently mentioned during the early centuries of the Christian era as
                    the residence of the Frankish kings, and in 860 and 932 it was the seat of
                    ecclesiastical councils. In 1018 it obtained the rights of a city from Henry IL,
                    but at the same time was made subject to the Bishop of Treves, who entrusted the
                    administration to the count palatine of the Rhine. In the following century the
                    fief was held by the counts of Arnstein and the counts of Nassau; but it
                    returned to the bishops in 1253. Archbishop Arnold surrounded the city with new
                    walls in 1249-54, and, in spite of an insurrection on the part of the
                    inhabitants, founded the citadel which still overlooks the town. As a member of
                    the League of the Rhenish cities which took its rise in the 13th century,
                    Coblentz attained to great prosperity; and it continued to advance till the
                    disasters of the Thirty Years’ War occasioned a rapid decline When in 1632 the
                    Elector Philip Christopher of 8otern surrendered Ehrenbreitstein to the French
                    the town received an· imperial garrison, which was soon, however, expelled by
                    the ⅛wedes, They in their turn handed the city over to the French, but the
                    imperial forces succeeded in retaking it by storm. In 1688 it was besieged by
                    the French Marshal Bouliers, but was successfully defended by Count Lippe. In
                    1786 the elector of Treves, Clemens Wenceslas, took up his residence in the
                    town, and gave great assistance in its extension and improvement; and a few
                    years later it became, through the invitation of his minister, Duminique one of
                    the principal rendezvous of the French émigrés. In 1794 it was taken by the
                    Revolution army, and, after the peace of Lunéville <hi rend="superscript">
