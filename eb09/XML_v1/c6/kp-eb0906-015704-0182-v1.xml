                    (1490-1547), the daughter of Fabrizio Colonna, grand constable of the kingdom of
                    Naples, and of Anna da Montefeltre, daughter of the “Good Duke” Frederick of
                    Urbino, was born at Marino, a Roman fief of her father’s house. Betrothed when
                    four years old, at the instance of Ferdinand of Aragon, to Francisco D’Avalos,
                    son of the marquis of Pescara, she received the highest education, and gave
                    early proof of a love of letters. Her hand was sought, among other suitors, by
                    the dukes of Savoy and Bragança, but at seventeen, as she ardently desired, her
                    marriage with D’Avalos took place. The couple resided on the islet of Ischia
                    till 1511, when the husband offered his sword to the Holy League, in whose
                    service he was taken at Ravenna (1512), and carried to France. During the months
                    of exile and the long years of campaigning that followed this mishap, they
                    corresponded in most passionate terms, in prose and verse. They saw each other
                    but seldom, for Pescara was one of Charles V.’s most brilliant and active
                    captains; but Vittoria⅛ influence over him was sufficient to keep him, after

                    the emperor, and to make hiin refuse the crown of Naples that was offered him as
                    the price of his treason. The same year he died of wounds at Milan. Vittoria,
                    who was hastening to tend him, received the news of his death at Viterbo. She
                    halted, and turned off to Rome, whence, after a brief stay, she departed for
                    Naples. There she remained for about ten years. She refused several suitors, and
                    began to produce those <hi rend="italic">Rime</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Spirituali</hi> that form so distinct a feature in her works. In 1536 she left
                    Naples for Ferrara, calling at Rome, where she was visited by Charles V., and
                    whither in 1538 she came to take up her abode. In Rome, besides winning the
                    esteem of Reginald Pole and Cardinal Contarini, she became the object of a
                    passionate friendship on the part of Michelangelo, then in his sixty-fourth
                    year. The great artist wrote for her some of his finest sonnets, made drawings
                    for her, and spent long hours in her society. Her removal from Rome to Orvieto
                    (1541), on the occasion of her brother Ascanio Colonna’s revolt against Paul
                    III., and her subsequent residence in Viterbo (1541-45), where Reginald Pole was
                    governor and legate, produced no change in their relations; they visited and
                    corresponded as before. She returned to Rome in 1546, and died there about the
                    end of February 1547.</p>

                    afterwards; and a fourth, including a still larger proportion of the religious
                    element, was issued at Venice in 1544.</p>
