                    (1625-1709), was nearly twenty years younger than his brother, the day of his
                    birth being August 20, 1625. Hisskill in verse-making seems to have shown itself
                    early, as at the age of fifteen he composed a piece in Latin which was
                    represented by his fellow pupils at the Jesuits’College of Rouen. He soon
                    followed'his brother’s steps, and his first piece, <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Engagements du</hi><hi rend="italic">Hasard,</hi> was acted in 1647. From this
                    time forward he produced a constant series of plays, sometimes in collaboration,
                    offener alone. At his brother’s death he succeeded to his vacant chair in the
                    Academy. He then turned his attention to philology, producing a new edition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Remarques</hi> of Vaugelas in 16S7, and in 1694 a
                    dictionary intended to supplement that of the Academy. A complete translation of
                    Ovid’s <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> (he had published six books with the
                    <hi rend="italic">Heroic Epistles</hi> some years previously) followed in 1697.
                    In 1704 he lost his sight and was constituted a “veteran,” a dignity which
                    preserved to him the privileges, while it exempted him from the duties, of an
                    Academician. But he did not allow his misfortune to put a stop to his work, and
                    soon produced a large <hi rend="italic">Geographical and Historical
                    Dictionary</hi> in 3 vols, folio. This was his last labour. He died on the 8th
                    of December 1709, aged eighty-four. It has been the custom to speak of Thomas
                    Corneille as of one who, but for the name he b &gt;re, would merit no notice.
                    This is by no means the case; on the contrary, he is rather to be commiserated
                    for his connection with a brother who outshone him as he would have outshone
                    almost any one. Of his forty-two plays (this is the utmost number assigned to
                    him) the last edition of his complete works contains only thirty-two, but he
                    wrote several in conjunction with other authors. Two are usually reprinted at
                    the end of his brother’s selected works. These are <hi rend="italic">Ariane</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Comte</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">Essex,</hi> in the former of which Rachel
                    attained success. But of <hi rend="italic">Laodice,</hi><hi rend="italic">Camma,
                    Stilico,</hi> and some other pieces, Pierre Corneille himself said that “he
                    wiched he had written them,” and he was not wont to speak lightly. <hi
                    rend="italic">Camma</hi> especially deserves notice. Thomas Corneille is in many
