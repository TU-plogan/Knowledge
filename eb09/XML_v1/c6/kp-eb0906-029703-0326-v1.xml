                <p><label type="entry">CONSTANT DE REBECQUE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henri
                    Benjamin</hi></label>, an eminent French statesman and publicist, was born at
                    Lausanne, 25th October 1757, and died at Paris 10th December 1830. His family
                    was French, and had taken refuge in Switzerland during the religious
                    persecutions. Till the age of thirteen he lived in his father’s house at
                    Lausanne; he afterwards studied at Oxford, Erlangen, and Edinburgh successively.
                    It was in these foreign studies that he made a beginning in the cosmopolitan
                    culture which afterwards characterized him; in England especially he learned to
                    admire constitutional government, and made the acquaintance of such men as
                    Erskine and Mackintosh. Shortly before the Revolution he went to Paris, and
                    became acquainted with some of the leading liberal spirits of that city, where,
                    after further travels, he finally settled in 1795. He attached himself to the
                    moderate republican party, and supported it through many changes of fortune,
                    both in the Assemblies and by writing, under the Directory and the Consulate,
                    till 1802, when he was expelled from the Tribunate by Napoleon. The circle to
                    which he belonged again provoked the anger of the First Consul by its private
                    opposition to the Government, whereupon Constant, with his celebrated friend
                    Madame de Staël, found it advi⅛ able to retire from France. Thus arrested in his
                    political career he turned to literature, and proceeded to Weimar, where he
                    enjoyed the acquaintance of Goethe and Schiller, translated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Wallenstein,</hi> and wrote the romance of <hi rend="italic">Adolphe.</hi> He
                    did not return to France till the overthrow of Napoleon in 1814. Attracted by
                    the prospect of the restoration of constitutional government he supported the
                    Bourbons; and, apparently for a similar reason, he adhered to Napoleon during
                    the Hundred Days. After the violence of the second Bourbon restoration had
                    subsided Constant reappeared on the political scene to maintain the principles
                    of constitutionalism. By all legal means, in the journals aud in the Chambers,
                    as well as by political tractates and pamphlets, under Louis XVIII. and Charles
                    X.he combated, not without success, the reactionary measures of the government.
                    Ill-health detained him in the country during the revolution of July (1830); but
                    at the urgent request of Lafayette he returned to the capital, and concurred in
                    the elevation to the vacant throne of Louis Philippe. Notwithstanding his feeble
                    health Constant continued to support the new Government, but an unsuccessful
                    candidature for a seat in the Academy so aggravated his previous complaint, that
                    he died a few months after the triumph of the principles to which he had
                    consecrated his life. Adverse circumstances had prevented the champion of
                    representative government from playing a first part in the history of France,
                    assuming that he had the faculty to do so. His voice was dry, his manner
                    deficient in ease and grace, and he did not excel in improvising a reply; but
                    his intellect was clear and powerful, his culture wide, and his industry
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>The greater part of his political tractates have been collected by himself under

                <p>The most important of his purely literary productions are the novels, <hi
                    rend="italic">Adolphe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cecile,</hi> and the
                    translation of <hi rend="italic">Wallenstein.</hi> His philosophical work on
                    religion, which occupied him more or less almost all his life, is an attempt to
                    trace the successive transformations of the religious sentiment, his conclusion
                    being that, while the religious instinct is imperishable, the doctrinal and
                    ceremonial forms by which it expresses itself are transitory. A quotation or two
                    will suffice to indicate his attitude towards the liberalism of the 18th
                    century. “Christianity has introduced moral and political liberty into the
                    world.” “If Christianity has been often despised, it is because men have not
                    understood it. Lucian was incapable of understanding Homer; Voltaire has never
                    understood the Bible.”</p>
