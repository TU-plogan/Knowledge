                    Romance language spoken in the district), the capital of the Swiss canton of the
                    Grisons or Graubünden, at the foot of the valley of the Plessur, a short
                    distance above the confluence of that river with the Rhone, in 46° 50' 54" N.
                    lat. and 9° 31' 26" E. long. It lies 1830 feet above the level of the sea, and
                    is overshadowed by the Mittenberg and Pizokelberg. The streets are narrow, and
                    the general appearance of the place bespeaks its antiquity. The upper part of
                    the town, or Bishop’s Quarter, was once surrounded with walls, and it is still
                    distinguished from the lower portion as the almost exclusive residence of the
                    Roman Catholic population. The cathedral church of St Lucius is its most
                    remarkable building, ascribed in part to Bishop Tello of the 8th century, and
                    deriving its name from a legendary British king, who is reputed to have suffered
                    martyrdom in the town. Of antiquarian interest are the statues of the Four
                    Evangelists, the ancient wood carvings, and several monuments by Holbein and
                    Dürer. The episcopal palace on the other side of the court is believed to occupy
                    the site of a Roman castle; and two ancient towers, probably dating from the
                    10th century, are popularly regarded as of Roman construction, the opinion being
                    supported by deriving their names, Marsoel and Spinoel, from the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">Mars in</hi><hi rend="italic">Oculis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spina in</hi><hi rend="italic">Oculιs.</hi> The episcopal school is now
                    administered by the canton, and contains a rich collection of native literature.
                    In the lower town are situated the great town-house, with a public library and
                    three stained-glass windows of the 16th century; <pb break="no"

                    trade between Germany and Italy; but it also engages in the manufacture of
                    cotton, wool, leather, and pewter wares, has dye-works and breweries, and deals
                    in cattle and grain. The population, which is mainly Protestant, numbered 7552
                    in 1870.</p>
                <p>Coire is identified, with <hi rend="italic">Curia Rhaetorum,</hi> a late Roman
                    city, first mentioned about the 4th century. Its bishopric, which held sway over
                    an extensive district, seems to have been founded in 470 by Asimo. In the 15th
                    century the town made itself free from episcopal control, and in 1460 obtained
                    from the emperor, Frederick IV., the rank of an imperial city; but before the
                    beginning of the next century it split with the empire and joined the
                    confederacy of the Grisons. In 1526 the Reformation was introduced; and a
                    conspiracy for the restoration of the former ecclesiastical regime was
                    vigorously suppressed. In the 17th century the city was frequently the centre of
                    the great struggle between the Cantons and the Austrian empire which raged with
                    such fury and so many alternations of success. In 1802 the French general
                    Massena occupied the town, and from that date the bishops have had no
                    territorial possessions.</p>
