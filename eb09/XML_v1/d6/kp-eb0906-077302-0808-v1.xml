                <p><label type="entry">DAKOTA</label>, a territory of the United States of North
                    America, bounded on the N. by the Dominion of Canada, E. by Minnesota and a
                    small part of Iowa, S. by Nebraska, and W by Montana and Wyoming. It is situated
                    between 42° 28'and 49° N. lat. and 96° 20' and 104 <hi rend="superscript">
                    s</hi> W. long.,—thus extending about 400 miles from E. to W. and about as much
                    from N to S., with an area estimated at 150,932 square miles. With the exception
                    of a small portion drained by the Red River and the Minnesota, Dakota belongs to
                    tho basin of the Missouri, which enters at the N.W. corner as a navigable river,
                    and proceeds with considerable meandering for upwards of 1000 miles in a S.E.
                    direction across the territory, receiving from the right the Little Missouri,
                    the Big Knife, the Cannon Ball, the Grande River, the Owl, the Big Sheyenne, the
                    Bad River, and the White River, and from the left, besides a large number of
                    small tributaries, one considerable affluent known as the James or Dakota River,
                    which traverses nearly the whole length of the territory with a predominant
                    southern direction, and joins the larger stream at the S.E. corner. There are no
                    mountains of any importance in the territory except the Black Hills on the
                    western frontiers, which attain a height of 6700 feet; but a plateau called the
                    Coteau des Prairies, with a mean elevation of 1450 feet above the level of the
                    sea, occupies a considerable area on the eastern borders, and another known as
                    the Coteau du Missouri stretches south between the Missouri and the Dakota. A
                    large district in the south-west between the White River and one of tho main
                    branches of the Big Sheyenne bears tho descriptive designation of the Mauvaises
                    Terres. In the Coteau des Prairies and several other parts of the territory
                    there are a large number of lakes, the most extensive of which is the Minniwakan
                    or Devil’s Lake, a sheet of salt water 40 miles long by about 12 miles in
                    breadth. Dakota has hitherto been only partially explored, but the military
                    expedition of 1874 under the command of General Custer reports very favourably
                    of the soil and the climate of the virgin districts. A large part of the surface
                    consists of open prairie-land finely adapted for the raising of stock, and most
                    of the river-valleys appear suitable for the plough. The experience of the
                    settlers shows that Indian com, wheat, barley, oats, and potatoes, as well as
                    apples, plums, grapes, and hops can be successfully cultivated. The hills are
                    covered with timber, mostly pine and spruce; while the banks of the rivers are
                    in many places bordered with ash, elm, poplar, maple, and other trees. The
                    mineral wealth of the region includes deposits of iron ore, extensive beds of
                    limestone, gypsum, and sandstone, and a certain amount of plumbago and gold.
                    Coal, lead, and petroleum have also been discovered. Buffaloes, bears,
                    antelopes, and elks are still abundant in the remoter districts; and the beaver
                    still builds his dam in many of the streams. The population of Dakota is mainly
                    aboriginal,—the principal tribes being the Sioux in the south, who number about
                    26,000, and the Arickarces, the Gros-Ventres, and the Mandans in the north-west.
                    The chief settlement of the whites, Yankton on the Missouri, had in 1870 a
                    population of 737; and the whole amount of land under cultivation at the same
                    date was 42,645 acres. The northern Pacific railroad passes through the
                    territory from east to west, entering at Fargo on the Red River, crossing the
                    Missouri at Burleigh City, and proceeding onwards to cut the Yellowstone River
                    at Wolf Rapids in Montana. Tho territory is administered in the sam§ way as the
                    other territories of the United States. Dakota belongs to the ancient French
                    district of Louisiana, which was purchased by the United States in 1803. It was
                    not till 1861 that it was separated from Minnesota and received a separate
                    organization; and its present boundaries only date from 1868, when it
                    surrendered 89,665 square miles for <pb break="no"
