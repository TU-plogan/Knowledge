                    (1661-1725), French dramatist and actor, was born at Fontainebleau on the 1st
                    November 1661. He belonged to a family of rank, and his parents intrusted his
                    education to Father De la Rue, a Jesuit, who made earnest but fruitless efforts
                    to induce him to join the order. Preserving his freedom he studied law, became
                    an advocate, and engaged for a short time in the practice of his profession. His
                    marriage to the daughter of the celebrated comedian La Thorilli&amp;re led him
                    to adopt the career of an actor, and in 1685, in spite of the strong opposition
                    of his family, he appeared on the stage of the Theatre Frangais. His power of
                    facial expression, vivacity of manner, and fluency of utterance gave him
                    immediate and marked success, both with the public and with his fellow actors.
                    The latter chose him for their spokesman on occasions of state, and in this
                    capacity he frequently appeared before Louis XIV., who treated him with great
                    favour. As a dramatic author Dancourt was exceedingly prolific, and as an almost
                    necessary consequence somewhat unequal. His first play, <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Notaire obligeant,</hi> produced in 1685, was so well received as to lead its
                    author speedily to repeat the experiment. <hi rend="italic">La Desolation des
                    Jouenses</hi> (1686) was still more successful; and <hi rend="italic">Le
                    Chevalier d la Mode</hi> (1687) is generally regarded as his best work, though
                    his claim to original authorship in this and some other cases has been disputed.
                    These were followed by others in constant succession till 1718, when he
                    terminated his career both as an actor and as an author. Retiring to a chateau
                    at Courcelles le Roi, in Berry, he employed himself in making a poetical
                    translation of the psalms and in writing a sacred tragedy. He died on the 6th
                    December 1725, and was buried in a tomb he had caused to be constructed during
                    his lifetime in the chapel of his chateau. The plays of Dancourt are true in the
                    main to nature. The characters have a vraisemblance that has led to his being
                    styled the Teniers of comedy. He is most successful in his delineation of low
                    life, and especially of the peasantry. The dialogue is sparkling, witty, and
                    natural. Many of the incidents of his plots were derived from actual occurrences
                    in the “fast” and scandalous life of the period, and several of his characters
                    were drawn from well-known personage of the day. Most of the plays incline to
                    the type of farce rather than of pure comedy.</p>
                <p>The complete works of Dancourt were published in 1760 (12 vols. 12mo). An edition
