                <p><label type="entry">DANTZIC</label> (or, according to the German form, which is
                    often used, <hi rend="smallcaps">Danzig),</hi> an important seaport of Prussia,
                    the capital of West Prussia, is situated on the left bank of the Vistula, about
                    three miles from its mouth, 253 miles northeast of Berlin, in 54° 21' N. lat.
                    and 18° 41' E. long. In 1875 the inhabitants, most of whom are Protestants,
                    numbered 98,181. The town is traversed by the Mottlau, a small branch of the
                    Vistula. It ranks as a fortress of the first class, the fortifications including
                    ramparts, bastions, wet ditches, and works for laying the surrounding country
                    under water. There is a harbour in the town, but the principal port is at
                    Neufahrwasser, at the mouth of the Vistula.</p>
                <p>Dantzic is entered by four gates, one of which dates from the 16th century, and
                    another from the 17th. The streets are narrow and winding, but in the Langgasse,
                    the chief street, reaching from the Hohe Thor to the Langenmarkt, there are many
                    interesting specimens of ancient architecture. The high gables, often
                    elaborately ornamented, give the houses a very picturesque aspect. There are 13
                    Protestant churches, 5 Catholic churches, and 2 synagogues. Of these the most
                    important is St Mary’s, one of the largest Protestant churches in existence,
                    begun in 1343, completed in 1503. It possesses a famous painting of the Last
                    Judgment, known as the Dantzic picture, formerly attributed to J an van Eyck,
                    but probably by Memling. The town hall, founded in 1379, is a fine Gothic
                    structure, the interior of which has recently been restored. Among other
                    noteworthy buildings are the exchange, built in the 14th century, the citadel,
                    built in 1605, and the theatre, of recent date. To the west of the town is a
                    suburban district of considerable extent, with wide, pleasant streets.</p>
                <p>The Government of West Prussia, and a Board of Commerce and of Admiralty, have
                    their seat in Dantzic. It is also a naval station, with docks, magazines, and a
                    marine depot. The educational institutions of the town, besides providing amply
                    for elementary education, include a gymnasium, founded in 1558, two real-schools
                    of the highest class, a commercial academy, a technical school, and a school of
                    navigation. There are a public library, containing 50,000 volumes, a collection
                    of paintings, chiefly modern, and several societies for the promotion of
                    science, art, and literature. The manufacture of arms and artillery is carried
                    on to a large extent, and the imperial and private docks give employment to a
                    great number of workmen. The town is still famous for its amber, beer, brandy,
                    and the liqueur known as Danziges Goldwasser; and it3 transit trade makes it one
                    of the most important commercial towns in the north of Europe. Its harbours are
                    visited annually by about 2000 sea-going vessels, besides an immense number of
                    smaller craft employed in river navigation. The chief exports are grain,
                    especially wheat, which comes for the most part from Poland and is of excellent
                    quality, and timber. The principal imports are herring, coal, petroleum, salt,
                    and wine. The annual value of the imports by sea is from <hi rend="italic"
                    >£2,</hi> 500,000 to <hi rend="italic">£3,</hi> 000,000, by river about
                    £2,250,000, by railway from £2,400,000 to £2,750,000; that of exports by sea
                    from £2,500,000 to £2,750,000, by river from £750,000 to £1,250,000, by railway
                    about £2,500,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The origin of Dantzic is unknown, but it is
                    mentioned in 997 as an important town. At different times' it was held by
                    Pomerania, Poland, Brandenburg, and Denmark, and in 1308 it fell into the hands
                    of the Teutonic knights, under whoso rule it long prospered. It was one of the
                    four chief towns of the Hanseatic <pb break="no"

                    become thoroughly corrupt, Dantzic shook off its yoke and submitted to the king
                    of Poland, to whom it was formally ceded, along with the whole of West Prussia,
                    at the Peace of Thorn. Although nominally subject to Poland, and represented in
                    the Polish diets and at the election of Polish kings, it enjoyed the rights of a
                    free city, and governed a considerable territory with more than thirty villages.
                    It suffered severely through various wars of the 17tli and 18th centuries, and
                    in 1734, having declared in favour of Stanislas Lesczinski, was besieged and
                    taken by the Russians and Saxons. At the first Sartition of Poland, in 1772,
                    Dantzic was separated from thatking-om; and in 1793 it came into the possession
                    of Prussia. In 1807, during the war between France and Pussia, it was bombarded
                    and captured by Marshal Lefebvre, who was rewarded with the title of duke of
                    Dantzic; and at the Peace of Tilsit Napoleon declared it a free town, under the
                    protection of France, Prussia, and Saxony, restoring to it its ancient
                    territory. A French governor, however, remained in it, and by compelling it to
                    submit to the Continental system almost ruined its trade. It was given back to
                    Prussia in 1814.</p>
