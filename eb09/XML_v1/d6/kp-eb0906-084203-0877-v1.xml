                    (1748-1825), historical painter, was born in Paris in 1748. His father having
                    been killed in a duel, a maternal uncle first placed him in the College des
                    Quatre-Nations and afterwards in an architect’s office. An accidental visit to
                    the studio of his great-uncle, Boucher, led him to leave his adopted profession;
                    and Boucher, observing the boy’s distaste for his own erotic style, sent him to
                    Vien, who, having succeeded to the directorship of the French Academy, in Rome
                    just at the time his pupil had taken the grand prize (1775), carried the youth
                    with him to that city. At this time Winckelmann was writing, Raphael Mengs
                    painting, and the taste for classic severity was a necessary reaction on what
                    had gone before. This is shown by Carstens and the younger Germans very shortly
                    after following a quite independent movement of the same nature. David’s
                    classicism was directly derived from the antique, and easily understood. The
                    spirit of the day made the first picture, “Date Obolum Belisario,” painted
                    according to his new principles, a complete success, and this was followed by
                    others more perfect—The Grief of Andromache, The Oath of the Horatii, The Death
                    of Socrates, and The Rape of the Sabine Women, now in the Louvre. In the French
                    drama an unimaginative imitation of ancient models had long prevailed; even in
                    art Poussin and Le Sueur were successful by expressing a bias in the same
                    direction; and in the first years of the revolutionary movement, the fashion of
                    imitating the ancients even in dress and manners went to the most extravagant
                    length. At this very time David returned to Paris; he was now painter to the
                    king, Louis XVI., who had been the purchaser of his principal works. It is not
                    possible to overestimate the popularity of the young painter, who was himself
                    carried away by the flood of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0906-0878-0843"/> enthusiasm that made all the intellect of France
                    believe in a new era of equality and emancipation from all the ills of life.</p>
                <p>Sent to the Convention in September 1792, by the Section du Musde, he quickly
                    distinguished himself by the defence of two French artists in Rome who had
                    fallen into the merciless hands of the sbirri of the Inquisition; and as the
                    behaviour of the authorities of the French Academy in Rome had been in obedience
                    to old slavish ideas, he had the influence to get it suppressed. In January
                    following his election into the Convention his vote was given for the king’s
                    death. Thus the man who was so greatly indebted to the Roman Academy and to
                    Louis XVI. assisted resolutely in the destruction of both. This line of action
                    was no doubt a kind of self-sacrifice to him; it was in obedience to a
                    principle, like the dreadful act of Brutus condemning his sons,—a subject he
                    painted with all his powers. Cato and Stoicism were the order of the day.
                    Hitherto the actor had walked the stage in modern dress. Brutus had been
                    applauded in red-heeled shoes and <hi rend="italic">culottes jarretees;</hi> but
                    Talma, advised by David, appeared in the toga and sdndals before an enthusiastic
                    audience. At this period of his life Mdlle. de Noailles thought to make a good
                    impression upon him by insisting on his painting a sacred subject, with Jesus
                    Christ as the hero. When the picture was done, the Saviour was found to be
                    another Cato. “I told you so,” he replied to the expostulations of the
                    lady,—“there is no inspiration in Christianity now 1” He accordingly developed
                    the scheme of the <hi rend="italic">Fete d VEtre Supreme,</hi> and he remained
                    the master of pageants for a long period, escaping the guillotine only by the
                    regard paid to his character as an artist. When Napoleon destroyed the new-found
                    liberty, and expunged the novel gospel, David succumbed to the military spirit
                    and well-nigh worshipped him. His picture of Napoleon on horseback pointing the
                    way to Italy is now in Berlin</p>
                <p>We have mentioned the principal classic subjects painted by David. They are hard
                    and dry in execution, painted on a white ground with opaque but splendid colour,
                    which has, however, really little charm. The other class of works which came
                    from his easel was commemorative of the Revolution. When Lepelletier was
                    assassinated in the Palais Royal, after the vote for the death of the king,
                    David painted the subject, and the picture was exhibited in the Convention with
                    much emotion. Marat Dead in the Bath is a work of a very impressive kind. The
                    Oath in the Tennis Court is another very important production, both historically
                    and in relation to the artist. His extensive commissions from the emperor are
                    still objects of attraction at Versailles. On the return of the Bourbons our
                    painter was exiled with the other remaining regicides, and retired to Brussels,
                    where he recommenced his classic series by the Loves of Paris and Helen. Here he
                    remained till his death, 29th December 1825, at the age of seventyseven, having
                    rejected the offer made through Baron Humboldt of the office of minister of fine
                    arts at Berlin. His end was true to his whole career and to his nationality.
                    While dying, a print of the Leonidas, one of his favourite subjects, was
                    submitted to him. It was placed conveniently, and after vaguely looking at it a
                    long time, “Il n’y a que moi qui pouvais concevoir la tete de Leonidas,” he
                    whispered, and died. His friends and his party thought to carry the body back to
                    his beloved Paris for burial, but the Government of the day arrested the
                    procession at the frontier, an act which caused some scandal, and furnished the
                    occasion of a terrible song of Beranger’s. Gros, Girodet, and Gdrard were
                    David’s best pupils.</p>
