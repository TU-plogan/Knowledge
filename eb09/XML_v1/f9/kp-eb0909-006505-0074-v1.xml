                    papal chair in December 269. Regarding his pontificate there is little authentic
                    information, but he is said to have given ecclesiastical sanction to the yearly
                    celebration of the mass over the graves of the martyrs, a custom, however, which
                    had been previously in existence; and the law regarding the consecration of
                    churches is also ascribed to him. On account, it is said, of his having strongly
                    supported the Christians during the persecutions under Aurelius, he was enrolled
                    among the martyrs, his day being the 20th of May. He died in 274. A fragment of
                    a letter to Maximus, bishop of Alexandria, in support of the doctrines of the
                    Trinity and Incarnation against the arguments of Paul of Samosata, was in all
                    probability written by Felix, but other three letters ascribed to him are
                    certainly ungenuine.</p>

                    the archdeaconate of Rome to the papal chair, when Tiberius was banished by the
                    emperor Constantius for refusing to subscribe the sentence of condemnation
                    against Athanasius. His election was contrary to the wishes both of the clergy
                    and of the people, and the consecration ceremony was performed by certain
                    prelates belonging to the court In 357 Constantius, at the urgent request of an
                    influential deputation of Roman ladies, agreed to the release of Tiberius on
                    condition that he signed the semi-Arian creed. Constantius also issued an edict
                    to the effect that the two bishops should rule conjointly, but Tiberius, on his
                    entrance into Rome in the following year, was received by all classes with so
                    much enthusiasm that Felix found it necessary to retire at once from Rome.
                    Regarding the remainder of his life little is known, and the accounts handed
                    down are contradictory, but he appears to have spent the most of it in
                    retirement at his estate near Porto. He died in 365, and, on what grounds it is
                    impossible to determine, was enrolled amongst the number of martyrs, his day
                    being the 2 2d of July. In the reign of Gregory XIIL the claims of Felix to rank
                    among the popes was discussed, and in order to discover whether any miraculous
                    help was to be found to aid in the decision of the question his sarcophagus wa3
                    opened, when it is said the words “Pope and Martyr” were found inscribed on his
                    body; but this supernatural testimony is in contradiction to the earlier
                    authorities of the church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Felix</hi> III. (or II.) was descended from one of the most
                    influential families of Rome, and succeeded Simplicius in the papal chair 2d
                    March 483. His first act was to repudiate the Henoticon, a deed of union,
                    originating, it is supposed, with Acacius, patriarch of Constantinople, and
                    published by the emperor Zeno with the view of allaying the strife between the
                    Monophysites and their opponents in the Eastern church. He also addressed a
                    letter of remonstrance to Acacius; but the latter proved refractory, and
                    sentence of deposition was passed against him. As Acacius, however, had the
                    support of the emperor, a schism (the first on record) arose between the Eastern
                    and Western churches, which lasted for 34 years. Felix died in 492.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Felix</hi> IV. (or III.), a native of Beneventum, was, on
                    the death of John in 526, raised to the papal chair by the emperor Theodoric in
                    opposition to the wishes of the clergy and people. His election was followed by
                    serious riots, which were only quieted by the explanation of Theodoric that he
                    had merely interposed his authority on account of the strifes of the
                    ecclesiastical factions, and by his promise that in future the election should
                    be vested in the clergy and people, although the confirmation of the emperor
                    should also be required to render it valid. Felix, after an uneventful
                    pontificate of four years, died in September 530.</p>
