                <p><label type="entry">FRATRICELLI</label> was a common name given to a number of
                    obscure mediaeval sects who flourished in the 13th and 14th centuries. They were
                    also called Bioschi, Bighini, Bocasoti, Frérots, &amp;c., and included such
                    sects as the Brethren of the Full Spirit, the Brethren of the Free Spirit, the
                    Beghards, the Brethren of the Common Life, &amp;c. The history of these
                    mediaeval sects is very obscure; but it seems now made out that while they had
                    some relation to and sympathy with the older Cathari and other Manichaean
                    heretics, they had a distinct origin in the Franciscan order, and that their
                    real aim was to carry out the principles of St Francis even in defiance of the
                    court of Rome. Their origin has been traced to Peter of Macerata and Peter of
                    Fossombrone, who put themselves at the head of certain malcontent Franciscans,
                    who, having been condemned by Pope Celestine in 1294, declared that the rule of
                    Francis was of more authority than any pope, and that papal opposition only
                    showed that the pope himself might become antiChristian. They soon began to
                    teach opposition to the pope, the clergy, and the church. They held millenarian
                    views, and preached and practised communism after the fashion, they said, of the
                    early Christians. Their opinion soon spread among the Franciscan Tertiaries, and
                    the common people everywhere favoured them. Boniface VIII. ordered the
                    Inquisition to look after them, and on a report of Matthew of Chieti they were
                    condemned in 1297 and handed over to the Inquisition. This only roused
                    opposition. They held a general meeting in Rome, elected a pope of their own,
                    organized themselves, spread over Europe, and by preaching missions made
                    converts everywhere. Their ranks were continually recruited from the malcontent
                    friars, especially from the Franciscans. Pope John XXII. condemned them under
                    the names of Fratricelli, Fratres de paupera vita, Bizochi, and Bighini, and
                    issued briefs against them in 1322 and 1331. They gave great trouble to the
                    church in Strasburg, Cologne, and the Rhineland. In Italy their headquarters
                    were in the Mark of Ancona and in Turin, <pb break="no"
