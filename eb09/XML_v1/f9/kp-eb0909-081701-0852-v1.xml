                    >canus)</hi> and not unlike it in general coloration, except that its primaries
                    are grey instead of black. This bird, which ranges over the North Atlantic, is
                    seldom seen on the European side below lat. 53° N., but on the American side
                    comes habitually to lat. 45°, or even lower. It has been commonly believed to
                    have two breeding places in the British Islands, namely, St Kilda and South
                    Barra; but, according to Mr Robert Gray <hi rend="italic">{Birds of the West of
                    Scotland,</hi> p. 499), it has abandoned the latter since 1844, while he is
                    assured of its now breeding in Skye. Northward it established itself about 1838
                    on Myggenaes Holm, one of the Faroes, while it has several stations off the
                    coast of Iceland and Spitsbergen, as well as at Bear Island. Its range towards
                    the pole seems to be only bounded by open water, and it is the constant
                    attendant upon all who are employed in the whale and seal fisheries, shewing the
                    greatest boldness in approaching boats and ships, and feeding on the offal
                    obtained from them. By our seamen it is commonly called the “Molly Mawk”<note

                    <hi rend="italic">Mallemuck),</hi> and is extremely well known to them, its
                    flight, as it skims over the waves, first with a few beats of the wings and then
                    gliding for a long way, being very peculiar. It only visits the land to deposit
                    its single white egg, which is laid on a rocky ledge, where a shallow nest is
                    made in the turf and lined with a little dried grass. Many of its
                    breeding-places are a most valuable property to those who live near them and
                    take the eggs and young, which, from the nature of the locality, are only to be
                    had at a hazardous risk of life. In St Kilda it is said that from 18,000 to
                    20,000 young are killed in one week of August, the only time when, by the custom
                    of the community, they are allowed to be taken. These, after the oil is
                    extracted from them, serve the islanders with food for the winter. This oil,
                    says Mr Gray, having been chemically examined by Mr E. C. C. Stanford, was found
                    to be a fish-oil, and to possess nearly all the qualities of that obtained from
                    the liver of the cod, with a lighter specific gravity. It, however, has an
                    extremely strong scent, which is said by those who have visited St Kilda to
                    pervade every thing and person on the island, and is certainly retained by an
                    egg or skin of the bird for many years. Whenever a live example is seized in the
                    hand it ejects a considerable quantity of this oil from its mouth. The Fulmar is
                    said by Mr Darwin <hi rend="italic">{Origin of Species,</hi> ed. 4, p. 78) to be
                    the most numerous bird in the world; but on whose authority the statement is
                    made does not appear, and to render it probable we should have to unite
                    specifically with the Atlantic bird, not only its Pacific representative, <hi
                    rend="italic">F. pacificus,</hi> which some ornithologists deem distinct, but
                    also that which replaces it in the Antarctic seas and is considered by most
                    authorities to be a perfectly good species, <hi rend="italic">F.
                    glacialioides.</hi> The differences between them are, however, exceedingly
                    slight, and for Mr</p>
                <p>Darwin’s purpose on this particular occasion it matters little how they are
                    regarded. It is a more interesting question whether the statement is anyhow
                    true, but one that can hardly be decided as yet. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
