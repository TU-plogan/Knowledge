                <p><label type="entry">FAUCHER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Leon</hi></label> (1803-1854),
                    a French statesman and political economist, was of Jewish extraction, and was
                    born at Limoges 8th September 1803. His parents afterwards removed to Toulouse,
                    and he found the means of supporting himself by the execution of designs for
                    embroidery while attending the college of that place. From Toulouse he went to
                    Paris, where for a short period he followed the profession of private tutor; but
                    on the outbreak of the revolution of 1830 he became immersed in the political
                    struggles of the time and a contributor to the political journals. In 1833 and
                    1834 he was editor of the <hi rend="italic">Constitutionnel,</hi> after which he
                    joined the staff of the <hi rend="italic">Courier,</hi> and in 1839 became its
                    editor. In politics he belonged to the party known as the dynastic left, and he
                    was frequently consulted by the Thiers ministry of 1840. In 1842 the <hi
                    rend="italic">Courier</hi> changed hands, and on its new proprietors wishing
                    slightly to modify its principles, Faucher resigned the editorship, and from
                    that time devoted his attention almost exclusively to questions of political
                    economy. In 1843 he visited England with the view of studying the social aspects
                    of that country, and in October of the same year he began a series of articles
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Revue des Deux Mondes,</hi> recording the impressions
                    made by his visit. These papers, though not altogether free from the defects
                    incident to the imperfect knowledge of a foreigner, are characterized not less
                    by shrewdness of observation than by able statement and illustration of
                    economical principles, and form an important contribution towards the solution
                    of the great social questions of the time. Shortly after this he became one of
                    the editors of the <hi rend="italic">Journal des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >économistes,</hi> to the pages of which he contributed several valuable papers,
                    more especially on the tariff of customs. He also took a prominent part in the
                    organization of the French association on the model of the free-trade league of
                    England, but on account of the extreme opinions of the majority of its members
                    he soon resigned his connexion with it. In 1846, chiefly on account of his
                    advocacy of free-trade doctrines, he was elected member of the chamber of
                    deputies for Rheims, and in the chamber he took a leading part in the discussion
                    of all economical and financial questions. After the revolution of 1848 he
                    became a member of the new assembly for the department of Marne, and in December
                    of the same year he was named minister of public works, and a little later
                    minister of the interior; but he was compelled through the opposition manifested
                    to his measures by the extreme republicans to resign his office 14th May 1849.
                    On 10th April 1851 he again accepted the same office from Louis Napoleon, then
                    president of the republic, but when Napoleon resolved to appeal to universal
                    suffrage Faucher again resigned; and after the <hi rend="italic">coup d</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">etat</hi> he also refused to
                    become a member of the constitutional commission instituted by the emperor. The
                    occurrence of an affection of the throat which gradually assumed an alarming
                    form induced him to pass the summer of 1854 in different parts of the Pyrenees.
                    He had resolved to remain in Italy over the winter, but in November business
                    affairs called him to Paris, and on his way back to Italy he was seized at
                    Marseilles by typhoid fever, and died 14th December. During his whole political
                    career Faucher maintained his probity unsullied, and in very difficult
                    circumstances held with unswerving steadfastness to the path pointed out to him
                    by convictions which were formed solely by a scientific study of political
                    problems and an unprejudiced regard for the welfare of the human race. His
                    economical writings are characterized by clearness of statement, fulness of
                    information, incisiveness of reasoning, and firm grasp of principles. In
                    relation to the cause of free trade in France he <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0061-0052"/> occupies, more than any other Frenchman, a
                    position analogous to that occupied by Cobden in relation to the same cause in
                    England; and perhaps both by his writings and by his former relations with
                    Napoleon he had no small share, though an indirect and posthumous one, in
                    bringing about the commercial treaty which through the intervention of Cobden
                    was effected between the two countries in 1860.</p>
                <p>The principal writings of Faucher were contributed to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Revue</hi><hi rend="italic">des Deux Momies,</hi> ana were published
                    posthumously in 2 vols, under the title <hi rend="italic">Mélanges
                    d’économie</hi><hi rend="italic">politique et de finance,</hi> 1856. Among his
                    other writings the principal are <hi rend="italic">Recherches sur l'or
                    et</hi><hi rend="italic">sur l’argent, considérés comme étalons de la

                    1845. The former work and a portion of the latter have been translated into
                    English. A short biography of Faucher, by Léonce de Lavergne, is contained in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Revue</hi><hi rend="italic">des Deux Mondes</hi> for
                    January 1855.</p>
