                <p><label type="entry">FLUTE</label>, a wind instrument which in a variety of forms
                    has been in constant use from the earliest ages, To Olympus the Phrygian has
                    been ascribed the introduction of flute-playing into Greece, an art which was
                    much encouraged in the later days of the empire. The Greeks employed
                    professional flute-players in many of their religious ceremonies, and
                    competitive trials of skill were frequent. The old English flute, called <hi
                    rend="italic">↑hQ</hi><hi rend="italic">flute-à-bec,</hi> from the supposed
                    resemblance of the mouthpiece to the beak of a bird, was played from the upper
                    and wider end, had seven finger holes, and was made of various sizes, called
                    treble, alto, tenor, and bass flutes respectively. This instrument continued in
                    common use to about the middle of the 18th century, when it was gradually
                    superseded by the modern horizontal <hi rend="italic">{flauto</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">traversa)</hi> or “German” flute. Handel was one of the first to
                    introduce the new instrument into the orchestra, employing it for solos in <hi
                    rend="italic">The Ode on Saint Cecilia's Day</hi> (1739), notably in the air
                    “The soft complaining Flute.” But the capacities of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >traverso</hi> of Handel’s time were very limited in comparison with those of
                    its modern representative, which possesses a workable compass of about three
                    octaves from the low C in the treble clef, with all the chromatic intervals.
                    Various systems of fingering have been introduced from time to time by the most
                    eminent flautists and flute-makers, and concertos for the flute as a solo
                    instrument have been composed with a view to exhibiting the powers of celebrated
                    performers. In orchestral scores the flute part is generally placed at the top,
                    and is written in the violin or G clef. The <hi rend="italic">piccolo</hi> or
                    octave flute, the E flat or <hi rend="italic">tierce,</hi> the D flat or <hi
                    rend="italic">minor ninth</hi> (transposing piccolo), the <hi rend="italic"
                    >flute d’amour,</hi> a minor third below the ordinary instrument—are all

                    shaped like a quadrant, and gradually tapering towards the mouthpiece; and the

                    Handel has written an <hi rend="italic">obbligato</hi> part for it in the
                    well-known barytone air “O, ruddier than the cherry.” The fife, much used in
                    military bands, is simply an octave flute in D, played horizontally, and having
                    six finger holes and one key.</p>
