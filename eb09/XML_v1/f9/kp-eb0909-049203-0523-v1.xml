                    rend="italic                     smallcaps"> (c.</hi> 1560-1614), one of the
                    poets who frequented the court of James VI. before his accession to the throne
                    of England, was born about the year 1560. After attending St Leonard’s College,
                    St Andrews, between 1573-74 and 1578, he seems to have selected the legal
                    profession, and in 1580, when about twenty years of age, he was at Paris
                    studying the civil law. He subsequently became private secretary and master of
                    requests to Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI. On the occasion of the baptism of
                    Prince Henry on 30th August 1594, the preparation of the pageants exhibited “was
                    by the king’s majesty committed to the lord of Lindores and Mr William Fowler”;
                    and the description of these “rareshows and singular inventions” was published
                    at the time. The sister of Fowler, Susannah, was married to Sir John Drummond,
                    Knight, and gentleman usher of the black rod, and was mother of the celebrated
                    poet Drummond of Hawthornden. On the title of some of his works Fowler styles
                    himself P. of Hawick, thus indicating that he was parson or rector of Hawick. He
                    is frequently styled Sir William Fowler, but there is no evidence that he was
                    ever knighted. That Fowler was a man of very superior literary merit is evinced
                    by his works, which are still preserved. The first of these is a collection of
                    sonnets entitled <hi rend="italic">The Tarantula of Love;</hi> the other is a
                    translation from the Italian of the <hi rend="italic">Triumphs of Petrarch.</hi>
                    These two manuscripts were presented by his nephew, Drummond of Hawthornden, to
                    the library of the university of Edinburgh in 1626, and it is understood both
                    will shortly be published. Fowler was a great favourite at court. He prefixed a
                    panegyrical sonnet to <hi rend="italic">The Furies,</hi> a composition of James
                    VI., while the king in return performed a similar office for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Triumphs of Petrarch,</hi> in a strain of versification which for
