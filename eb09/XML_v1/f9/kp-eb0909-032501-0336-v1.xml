                <p><label type="entry">FLINT</label> is a calcedonic variety of silica found in the
                    form of irregular concretionary nodules of varying size, chiefly in the Upper
                    Chalk beds and in other similar limestone deposits. The mode in which flint
                    originated is not altogether satisfactorily explained; but as traces of some of
                    the humbler marine organisms are almost invariably found in the nodules, it is
                    assumed that the silicious matter was partly derived from these organisms
                    themselves, and that they formed nuclei around which soluble silica accumulated.
                    From the prevalence of silicious spiculae of sponges in tho nodules, it is
                    affirmed by Dr Bowerbank that all flints had, for their primary nuclei, the
                    silicious framework of the sponges which flourished in the depths of the sea
                    during the Cretaceous epoch. Flints occur in the chalk in stratified order, and
                    the various beds are possessed of a uniformly distinctive character. In some
                    cases they arc found in continuous layers, at other places they occur as
                    isolated nodules. In the county of Norfolk, huge flints termed “potstones,” of a
                    pear-shaped outline, measuring as much as three feet in length by one foot
                    across, are obtained; and these are imbedded in the chalk at right angles to the
                    horizontal layers of small flints. Flint is a compact homogeneous substance,
                    externally coated with a white silicious coat, and frequently hollow in the
                    centre. It has a dark steely grey, almost black, sometimes brownish colour; it
                    is faintly translucent, and it breaks with a conchoidal or glassy fracture. In
                    composition it consists of almost pure silica, partly in the crystalline or
                    non-solublo quartzy form, and partly in the non-crystalline soluble state. It
                    contains traces of lime, iron, and alumina, and when the proportion of lime
                    present is large it passes into chert. When newly obtained from the pits the
                    contained moisture of flint renders it easily flaked and otherwise worked, but
                    after exposure to the air it becomes dry, hard, and intractable. From the
                    earliest times flint has been employed as a fire-producer, by percussion with
                    iron pyrites, and subsequently with a steel implement in the yet familiar form
                    of “flint and steel.” In classical authors occasional allusions are made to the
                    use of flint knives; and the employment of flint and steel to produco fire is
                    very pointedly described by Virgil and other writers. Except to a trifling
                    extent in tho preparation of strike-alight flints, the only form in which flint
                    industry now continues is in the fabrication of gun-flints, an occupation
                    carried on at Brandon, and to a smaller extent at Icklingham, two villages in
                    Suffolk. In 1876 there were 21 flint knappers in Brandon, and about 80,000
                    flints were sent away weekly, the greater proportion of which go to West <pb

                    sinking a narrow pit into the chalk till the bed of suitable flints (the best
                    are “floor-stones”) is reached, and along this the miner drives a series of
                    small galleries or burrows, carrying all the excavated material by hand to the
                    surface. The knapper’s tools consist of three simple forms of hammer and a
                    chisel; and probably the only essential modification these tools have ever
                    undergone consists in the substitution of metal for stone. The flint is first
                    broken into convenient sized angular pieces, cubes of about 6 inches, called
                    “quarters.” The next operation, “flaking,” consists in striking off, by means of
                    carefully measured and well directed blows, flakes extending from end to end of
                    the quarter, this process of flaking being continued till the quarter or core
                    becomes too small to yield good flakes. The subsequent operation termed
                    “knapping” consists in cutting or breaking the flakes transversely into the
                    sizes required for gun-flints, each flake yielding two or three flints of
                    different sizes. An expert flaker will make 7000 to 10,000 flakes in a day of
                    twelve hours, and in the same time an average knapper will finish from flakes
                    about 3000 gun-flints. Flint is also employed in building and for road metal.
                    Calcined and powdered it is very much used in the manufacture of superior kinds
                    of pottery. For the flint implements of primitive times, see <hi
