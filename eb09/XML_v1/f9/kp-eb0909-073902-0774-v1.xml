                    was the eldest son of Frederick William II., and was born on the 3d August 1770.
                    He was carefully trained under the supervision, in early youth, of his
                    grand-uncle, Frederick the Great. As crown prince he accompanied his father in
                    1791 to the interview with the emperor at Pillnitz, and in the following year
                    visited with him <pb break="no"

                    war with France. In 1793 he married the Princess Louise, daughter of the duke of
                    Mecklenburg-Strelitz. She became a highly popular queen, and thoroughly deserved
                    the affection and respect with which she was regarded. Simple and unostentatious
                    in manner, she was of a refined and gentle disposition, yet endowed with a quick
                    and keen intelligence, and with an heroic spirit which the greatest disasters
                    could not break. Her husband’s character was not nearly so interesting. He was
                    rather dull and slow; but he had a sincere desire for the welfare of his people;
                    was capable in emergencies of undertaking a great enterprise, and allowed
                    himself to be freely influenced by the loftier impulses of his wife. When he
                    succeeded to the throne he at once removed the principal grievances due to the
                    weakness of his father, and called to his aid capable and honest ministers. By
                    the treaty of Lunéville, in 1801, he was obliged to concede to Napoleon his
                    territory on the left bank of the Rhine; but he received some compensations. In
                    1805 he was brought for a short time into conflict with England for accepting
                    Hanover from Napoleon in return for certain concessions. Up to this time he had
                    remained at peace with France; but the formation of the Confederation of the
                    Rhine in 1806 filled him with alarm and indignation, and, giving way to a sudden
                    impulse, he demanded that all French troops should forthwith quit German soil.
                    The result was the battles of Jena and Auerstädt, followed by those of Eylau and
                    Friedland; and on July 9, 1807, he had to sign the treaty of Tilsit, which
                    deprived him of half his kingdom. Early in the war he had been obliged to leave
                    Berlin with the queen, and not till the end of 1809 were they able to return. In
                    1810 the queen died. Meanwhile, under the guidance of the great minister Stein,
                    who was succeeded by Hardenberg, he had begun thoroughly to reorganize the
                    state; while, through the exertions of Scharnhorst and Gneisenau, the army, in
                    which the traditions of a past age had survived too long, was raised to a state
                    of high efficiency. The king was forced in 1812 to conclude an alliance with
                    Napoleon, and to aid him with an auxiliary corps in his expedition to Russia;
                    but seeing the disastrous retreat of the French from Moscow, Frederick William
                    appealed to the country to undertake a war of liberation. In due time the appeal
                    was followed by the battle of Leipsic and the battle of Waterloo. After the
                    conclusion of peace he laboured sincerely, with the aid of competent ministers,
                    to undo many of the evils caused by the confusion of the previous years; but he
                    forgot that in his time of need he had promised to set up a constitutional
                    system of government. He only instituted (1817) provincial estates; and after
                    the July Revolution he proved himself an uncompromising and bitter opponent of
                    liberal ideas. He died on the 7th of June 1840.</p>
