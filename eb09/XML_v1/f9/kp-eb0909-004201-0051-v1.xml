                    a district of British India, in the Agra division, and under the jurisdiction of
                    the lieutenant-governor of the North-Western Provinces, lies between 26’ 45' 45"
                    and 27’ 42' 45" N. lat., and 79* 10' 45" and 80° 6' 0" E. long. It is bounded on
                    the N. by Budâon and Shâhjahânpur, E. by Harduf, S. by Cawnpur and Etâwah, and
                    W. by Mâinpuri and Etah. The district is a flat alluvial plain in the middle <hi
                    rend="italic">duaf.</hi> The principal rivers are—the Ganges, which has a course
                    of 87 miles either bordering on or passing through the district, but is not at
                    all times navigable by large boats throughout its entire course; the Budh Gangâ,
                    which enters the district in its north-west comer, and falls into the Ganges
                    opposite the town of Farrakhâbâd, after a course of 45 miles; the Kâli-nadi (84
                    miles), and the Isân-nadi (42 miles), both tributaries of the Ganges; and the
                    Arind-nadi, which, after a course of 20 miles in the south of the district,
                    passes into Cawnpur. The census of 1872 returned the population at 499,722 males
                    and 419,026 females,—total, 918,748, of whom 816,733 were Hindus, 101,538
                    Mahometans, and 477 Christians. The area of the district is 1744 square miles,
                    of which 1021 are returned as under cultivation, and 264 as cultivable, but not
                    actually under tillage. The principal products are rice, wheat, barley, millets,
                    pulses, cotton, sugar-cane, potatoes, &amp;c. The grain crops, however, are
                    insufficient for local wants, and grain is largely imported from Oudh and
                    Rohilkhand. The district is, therefore, liable to famine, and it has been
                    severely visited by this calamity five times during the present century—in
                    1803-4, 1815-16, 1825-26, 1837-38, and in 1868-69.</p>
                <p>The civil station and principal town is Farrakhâbâd, situated on the right or
                    west bank of the Ganges in 27’ 24' N. lat. and 79° 40' E. long.; population,
                    65,441. The other towns are—Fathigarh (Futtehguhr or Futtygur), civil and
                    military station on the Ganges, 3 miles east of Farrakhâbâd, population 13,439;
                    Kanauj, on the right bank of the KâÙ-nadi, 17,903; Kâimganj, 10,323; Shâmsâbâd,
                    8710; Allahganj, 6246; Chibramau, 5444. Kanauj is of great archaeological
                    interest as being the ancient Hindu capital of this part of India. The ruins of
                    the ancient town cover an area of 5 square miles. The only municipality in the
                    district is that of Farrakhâbâd-cum-Fathigarh, with a population of 78,880;
                    municipal revenue iu 1875, .£8177, 10s.; expenditure, £766, 6s. The total
                    revenue of the district in 1876 was £197,229; the expenditure on civil
                    administration, £43,755. The regular police force consisted of 943 officers and
                    men, maintained at a cost of £10,279. For the education of the people there were
                    320 Government and aided schools in the district, attended by 7507 pupils, and
                    receiving state aid to the extent of £3416. For medical relief four charitable
                    dispensaries are maintained, at which 789 indoor and 19,732 outdoor patients
                    were treated in 1875. Farrakhâbâd is one of the healthiest districts in the <hi

                <p>Of the tract comprising the present district, the portion lying north of the
                    Kâli-nadi was included within the <hi rend="italic">jagir</hi> or fief of the
                    Rohilla nawâb of Farrakhâbâd, while the country to the south of the river formed
                    part of the territories of the vizir of Oudh. During the wars of the middle of
                    the last century, the district frequently changed hands, at one time being held
                    by the Rohillas, and at another by the nawâb vizir. In 1774, however, the
                    latter, with the assistance of the Euglish, completely defeated the Rohillas;
                    and Farrakhâbâd, together with the whole of Rohilkhand, passed into his hands,
                    and remained with him till 1801, when it was ceded to the East India Company. In
                    1804 the Marhattâs, under Holkar, ravaged this tract, but were utterly routed by
                    Lord Lake at the town of Farrakhâbâd. During the mutiny Farrakhâbâd shared the
                    fate of other districts, and passed entirely out of our hands for a time. The
                    native troops, who had for some time previously evinced a seditious spirit,
                    finally broke into rebellion on the <pb break="no"

                    Farrakhâbâd on the throne. The English military residents took shelter in the
                    fort, which they held until the 4th July, when, the fort being undermined, they
                    endeavoured to escape by the river. One boat succeeded in reaching Cawnpur, but
                    only to fall into the hands of the Nànâ. Its occupants were made prisoners, and
                    perished in the massacre of the 10th July. The other boat was stopped on its
                    progress down the river, and all those in it were captured or killed, except
                    four who escaped. The prisoners were conveyed back to Fathigarh, and murdered
                    there by the nawâb on the 19 th July. The rebels were defeated in several
                    engagements, and on the 3d January 1858 the English troops recaptured Fathigarh
                    fort; but it was not till May that order was thoroughly re-established. Since
                    then nothing has occurred to disturb the peace of the district.</p>
