                    Roman grammarian, rhetorician, and advocate, was born of an Italian family at
                    Cirta in Numidia, a Libyan of the Libyans, as he calls himself, <hi
                    rend="italic">Λ,iβυ&lt;i τωv R</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">βυωv.</hi> The date of
                    his birth is unknown, but as he was quaestor in 138, it must have been before
                    113, and not improbably between 100 and 110. He came to Rome in the reign of
                    Hadrian, and soon gained such renown as an advocate and orator as to be reckoned
                    inferior only to Cicero. Antoninus Pius, hearing of his fame, appointed him
                    tutor to his adopted sons Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus; and Fronto, as
                    appears from his surviving letters, completely gained the confidence and
                    affection of both these pupils. He was proconsul of Asia for a few months in
                    143, and five years later he was offered the same post, but declined acceptance
                    on the plea of bad health. He preferred to remain at Rome, where, by the
                    practice of his profession, he amassed a very large fortune, which enabled him
                    to purchase the famous gardens of Maecenas, besides sumptuous villas in various
                    parts of Italy. In his old age, when confined to his house by the gout, he used
                    to receive the leading literary men, who flocked to hear his unrivalled
                    conversation. This exhibited the same qualities as his more formal orations,
                    which were so much admired that a school of rhetoricians called itself after his
                    name, having for its object the restoration to the Latin language of its ancient
                    purity and simplicity. Fronto died at an advanced age, but the exact date of his
                    death is not known, and it is even uncertain whether he survived or predeceased
                    the emperor Marcus Aurelius. Till 1815 the only work of Fronto’s believed to
                    exist was some disjointed fragments of his essay <hi rend="italic">De
                    Differentia</hi><hi rend="italic">Vocabulorum,</hi> and even this is more
                    probably the production of a later grammarian who made use of Fronto’s works. In
                    that year, however, Angelo Mai discovered in the Ambrosian library at Milan a
                    palimpsest manuscript, on which had been originally written some of Fronto’s
                    letters to his royal pupils. These he deciphered and published with notes,
                    Milan, 1815. On his removal to Rome he discovered in the Vatican some additional
                    sheets of the same palimpsest, which, like the first, contained letters of
                    Fronto to Aurelius and Verus, with their replies. These palimpsests had
                    originally belonged to the famous convent of St Columba at Bobbio, and had been
                    written over by the monks with the acts of the first council of Chalcedon. All
                    these letters were published by Mai, at Rome, in 1823, under the title of <hi

                    rend="italic">scripta grammatica.</hi> The discovery excited intense interest
                    among the scholars of Europe, but a certain amount of disappointment was felt
                    when the contents of the letters were examined. The characters of the two
                    emperors, indeed, are displayed in a very favourable light, especially in the
                    affection which they both seemed to have retained for their old master; but the
                    subject-matter of most of the letters is of such ephemeral interest as to throw
                    little additional light on Roman antiquity. Not only have 146 of the leaves of
                    the manuscript been lost, but hardly a half of the 194 still extant have been
                    deciphered so as to furnish an intelligible context. A more careful examination
                    of the palimpsest might possibly show good results.</p>
