                    de</hi></label> (1755-1794), a French poet and romancist, was bom at the chateau
                    of Florian, near Sauve, in that part of Languedoc which now forms the department
                    of Gard. His mother, a Spanish lady named Gilette de Salgues, died when he was
                    quite a child, and the person who seemed to have had most influence on his early
                    years was his grandfather, an old noble who had run through his estate. His
                    uncle, the marquis of Florian, who had married a niece of Voltaire, introduced
                    him at Ferney, and Florianet, as he was soon affectionately nicknamed, spent a
                    pleasant time with the old dictator of French literature. In 1768 he became page
                    in the household of the duke υf Penthièvre at Anet, and throughout his life he
                    was the object of the powerful patronage of that cultured nobleman. Having
                    studied for some time at the artillery school at Bapaume he obtained from the
                    duke a commission in a dragoon regiment, and in this capacity it is said he
                    displayed a boisterous behaviour as unlike as might be to what the reader of his
                    works would naturally imagine. He afterwards left the army and became gentleman
                    in ordinary. On the breaking out of the French Revolution he retired to Sceaux,
                    but he was soon discovered and dragged to prison by the Parisian sans-culottes;
                    and though his incarceration was not of long continuance, it so injured his
                    health that he survived his release only a few months. His death took place on
                    September 13, 1794.</p>
                <p>Florian’s first literary efforts took the shape of little comedies; but he first
                    attracted attention by an epistle in verse entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Voltaire</hi><hi rend="italic">et le</hi><hi rend="italic">serf du Mont
                    Jura</hi> and an eclogue called <hi rend="italic">Ruth,</hi> which were crowned
                    by the French Academy in 1782 and 1783 respectively. In the latter year he also
                    produced his <hi rend="italic">Galatêe,</hi> a professed imitation of the
                    Galatea of Cervantes, and this was followed two years later by <hi rend="italic"

                    Fénelon’s <hi rend="italic">Télémaque,</hi> which as an educational work has
                    proved only less popular than its prototype. In 1788 ho became a member of the
                    French Academy and published <hi rend="italic">Estelle,</hi> a pastoral of the
                    same class as <hi rend="italic">GalaCee,</hi> which is reckoned one of the best
                    of his works. Another romance, <hi rend="italic">Gonzalve de Cordoue,</hi>
                    preceded by an historical notice of the Moors, appeared in 1791, and his famous
                    collection of <hi rend="italic">Fables</hi> in 1792. After his death there
                    appeared an unfinished treatment of the story of William Tell, to which he had
                    devoted the leisure of his confinement, and an <pb break="no"

                <p>Florian was a professed imitator of Gessner, and his style has all the artificial
                    delicacy and sentimentality of the Gessnerian school. Perhaps the nearest
                    example of the class in English literature is afforded by Wilson’s <hi

                    his fables, his comedies, and some of his minor tales. Among the best of the
                    fables are reckoned “the Monkey showing the Magic Lantern,” “the Blind Man and
                    the Paralytic,” and “the Monkeys and the Leopard”; and <hi rend="italic">Les
                    Deux Billets,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le Bon Père,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Bon Menage</hi> are the best known of the comedies. In
                    the latter he brought the arlequinades again into fashion, and raised them to a
                    higher level. Florian’s <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres Complètes</hi> appeared at
                    Paris in 16 volumes, 1820; his <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres inédites</hi> in 4
                    volumes, 1824. Didot published an edition in 24 volumes, Briand another in 13,
                    and Jauffret a third in 12. The editions of some of the more popular works are
                    extremely numerous.</p>
