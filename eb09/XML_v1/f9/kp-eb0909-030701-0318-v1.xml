                    (1800-1864), a German philanthropist and restorer of the office of deaconess to
                    the Protestant Church of Germany, was born January 21, 1800, at Eppstein, a
                    small village on the frontiers of Hesse and Nassau, where his father was parish
                    clergyman. He early showed a preference for the pastoral office, to qualify
                    himself for which he studied at the universities of Giessen and Göttingen, and
                    at the theological seminary of Herborn. At the age of twenty he passed his final
                    examination; and after a year spent in teaching and preaching, he accepted a
                    call from the Evangelical Church at Kaiserswerth, a little town on the Rhine a
                    few miles below Düsseldorf. His stipend was only £27, and the failure, soon
                    after he was settled, of a large firm of velvet manufacturers, which supplied a
                    large proportion of the members of his congregation, rendered even this small
                    sum no longer secure. To provide an endowment for his church, he undertook
                    journeys through part of Germany, and then to Holland and England. He met with
                    considerable success, and had opportunities of observing what was being done in
                    those countries towards prison reform, a subject which soon attracted his
                    attention. The German prisons were then in a very bad state. The prisoners were
                    huddled together in dirty rooms, were badly fed, and were left in complete
                    idleness. No one dreamed of instructing them or of collecting statistics to form
                    the basis of useful legislation on the subject. Fliedner at first singly
                    undertook the work. He applied for permission to be imprisoned for some time, in
                    order that he might look at prison life from the inside. This petition was
                    refused, but he was allowed to hold fortnightly services in the Düsseldorf
                    prison, and to visit the inmates individually. The work grew. Those interested
                    in the subject banded themselves together, and on June 18, 1826, the first
                    Prison Society of Germany was founded. The fact was clearly recognized that if
                    any permanent good was to be done, the prisoners must be looked after on their
                    release; and therefore in 1833 Fliedner opened at Kaiserswerth a refuge for
                    discharged female convicts. His circle of practical philanthropy rapidly
                    increased. The state of the sick poor had for some time excited his interest,
                    and it seemed to him that hospitals might be best served by an organized body of
                    women specially trained and devoted to the work. Accordingly in 1836 he began
                    the first deaconess house, and the hospital at Kaiserswerth. By their ordination
                    vows the deaconesses devoted themselves to the care of the poor, the sick, and
                    the young. They were to be dressed in a plain uniform without distinctive badge,
                    and their engagements were not final—they might leave their work and return to
                    ordinary life if they chose. To these institutions Fliedner added in 1836 an
                    infant school, then a normal school for infant school mistresses, an orphanage ∙
                    for orphan girls of the middle class (1842), and an asylum for female lunatics
                    (1847). Besides these, he assisted at the foundation and in the management of
                    various similar institutions, not only in Germany, but in different parts of
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>In 1849 he resigned his pastoral charge, and from 1849 to 1851 he travelled over
                    a large part of Europe, America, and the East,—the object of his journeys being
                    to found “mother houses,” which might not merely be training schools for
                    deaconesses, but also centres whence other training establishments might arise.
                    He established a deaconess house in Jerusalem, and after his return assisted by
                    counsel and money in the erection of establishments at Constantinople, Smyrna,
                    Alexandria, and Bucharest. Among his later efforts may be mentioned the
                    Christian house of refuge for female servants in Berlin (connected with which
                    other institutions soon arose) and the “house of evening rest” for retired
                    deaconesses at Kaiserswerth. These and similar labours wore out a naturally
                    strong constitution, and in 1856 he visited the East for the sake of his health.
                    He returned worse rather than better, and thereafter was for the most part
                    confined to his room; he continued, however, by correspondence to promote the
                    objects of his life. He died October 4, 1864, leaving behind him over 100
                    stations attended by 430 deaconesses; and these by 1876 had increased to 150
                    with an attendance of 600.</p>
                <p>In 1855 Fliedner received the degree of doctor in theology from the university of
                    Bonn, in recognition rather of his practical activity than his theological
                    attainments. He scarcely seems indeed to have concerned himself with the great
                    controversies which during his lifetime agitated the German Church, his whole
                    life being devoted to steady, well-directed, and eminently successful efforts to
                    benefit the poor, the weak, and the suffering. His character was marked by
                    prompt decision, clear insight, and great practical sagacity. Nor was it without
                    traits of quaint Teutonic humour which relieved its sterner features.</p>
                <p>Fliedner’s writings are almost entirely of a practical character. He edited a
                    periodical, <hi rend="italic">Der</hi><hi rend="italic">Armen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">und Kranken</hi><hi rend="italic">Freund,</hi> which contained
                    information regarding the various institutions, and also the yearly almanac of
                    the Kaiserswerth institution. Besides purely educational and devotional works,
                    he wrote <hi rend="italic">Buch der Märtyrer-, Nachricht über das
                    Diakonissen-Werk in der Christ. Kirche; Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >evangel.</hi><hi rend="italic">Märtyrer Ungarns und Siebenbürgens-,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Beschreibung der Reise nach Jerusalem und Constantinopel.</hi>
                    All were published at Kaiserswerth. There is a translation of the German life,
                    prepared by the family, by C. Winkworth (London, 1867). On Fliedner and his work
