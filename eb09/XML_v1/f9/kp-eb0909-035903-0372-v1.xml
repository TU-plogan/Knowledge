                    (1798-1845), attorneygeneral of England, was born at Topsham in Devonshire,
                    December 2, 1798. He was the son of Captain Benjamin Follett, who had retired
                    from the army in 1790, and engaged in business at Topsham. His mother was an
                    Irish lady of Kinsale. The early indications which he gave of superior abilities
                    induced his father to bring him up for the bar. He received his early education
                    at Exeter grammar-school, of which Dr Lempriere, author of the well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Classical Dictionary,</hi> was then head-master. After a short
                    course of study under a private tutor, he entered, in 1814, Trinity College,
                    Cambridge, and two years later the Inner Temple. In 1818 he took his degree of
                    B.A. without academical honours, and the same year settled in London, becoming a
                    pupil of Godfrey Sykes and Robert Bayley, two of the most eminent special
                    pleaders of the day. He began to practise as a pleader below the bar in 1821,
                    was called to the bar in 1824, and joined the western circuit in 1825. At the
                    very outset his great qualifications were universally recognized, and his rapid
                    rise was assured. He was thoroughly master of his profession, having devoted
                    himself to it with exclusive zeal; and with remarkable quickness of perception
                    he combined a solidity and ripeness of judgment such as are rarely seen in one
                    so young. The statements current soon after his death as to the frequent
                    interruption of his studies by ill health are emphatically contradicted by Lord
                    Brougham. His rapid and continuous success was owing not only to his
                    unquestionable superiority, but to his singular courtesy, kindness, and
                    sweetness of temper. In 1830 he married the eldest daughter of Sir Ambrose
                    Harding Gifford, chief justice of Ceylon. His reputation in Westminster Hall
                    being solidly established, he sought in 1832 an entrance into parliament, and
                    offered himself as candidate for the city of Exeter on the Conservative side. On
                    this occasion he failed; but in 1835 he was returned for the same city at the
                    head of the polL In parliament he early succeeded in gaining the ear of the
                    house, and attained a position of high distinction. Under the first
                    administration of Sir Robert Peel, Follett was appointed solicitor-general
                    (November 1834), but resigned with the ministry in April 1835. In the course of
                    this year he was knighted. On the return of Peel to power in 1841 Sir William
                    was again appointed solicitor-general, and in April 1844 he succeeded Sir
                    Frederick Pollock as attorney-general But his health, which had begun to fail
                    him in 1838, and had been permanently injured by a severe illness in 1841, now
                    broke down, and he was compelled to relinquish practice and to visit the south
                    of Europe. He returned to England in March 1845; but the disease, consumption,
                    reasserted itself, and he died in London on the 28th of June following. His
                    death was mourned as a loss not only to the profession but to his country, and
                    the public esteem for his character was marked by the attendance at his funeral
                    in the Temple Church of many distinguished persons,—the lord chancellor, the
                    first lord of the treasury, and the chief justice of the common pleas being
                    among the pall-bearers. A noble statue of Follett, executed by Behnes, was
                    erected by subscription in St Paul’s cathedral (See Brougham’s notice of
                    Follett, <hi rend="italic">Works,</hi> vol. iv.) <pb break="no"
