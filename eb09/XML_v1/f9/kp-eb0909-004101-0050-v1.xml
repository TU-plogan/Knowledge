                    (1801-1870), first admiral of the United States navy, was the son of Major
                    George Farragut, a Catalan by descent, a Minorquin by birth, who had emigrated
                    to America in 1776, and, after the peace, had married a lady of Scotch family
                    and settled near Knoxville, in Tennessee; there Farragut was born on the 5th
                    July 1801. At the early age of nine he entered the navy, under the protection of
                    his name-father, Captain David Porter, with whom he served in the “Essex” during
                    her cruise in the Atlantic in 1812, and afterwards in the Pacific, until her
                    capture by the “Phcebe,” in Valparaiso Bay, on the 28th March 1814. He
                    afterwards served on board the “Washington,” 74, carrying the broad pennant of
                    Commodore Chauncey in the Mediterranean, and pursued his professional and other
                    studies under the instruction of the chaplain, Mr Folsom, with whom he
                    contracted a life-long friendship. Folsom was appointed from the “Washington ’
                    as U.S. consul at Tunis, and obtained leave for his pupil to pay him a
                    lengthened visit, in the course of which he acquired a familiar knowledge of
                    Arabic and Turkish. Farragut is said, in his later years, to have spoken
                    fluently all the principal European languages; this is probably an exaggeration,
                    but with an hereditary knowledge of Spanish, he may have picked up some French
                    and Italian at this time; until the very end of his career, it was his only
                    visit to European waters. In 1825 he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant,
                    whilst serving in the navy yard at Norfolk, where he continued till 1832; he
                    then served for a commission on the coast of Brazil, and was again appointed to
                    the yard at Norfolk. It is needless to trace the ordinary routine of his service
                    step by step. The officers of the U.S. navy have one great advantage which is
                    wanting to our own; when on shore they are not necessarily parted from the
                    service, but are employed in their several ranks in the different dockyards,
                    escaping thus not only the private grievance and pecuniary difficulties of a
                    very narrow halfpay, but also, what from a public point of view is much more
                    important, the loss of professional aptitude, and of that skill which comes from
                    unceasing practice. On the 8th September 1841 Farragut was promoted to the rank
                    of commander, and on the 14th September 1855 to that of captain. At this time he
                    was in charge of the navy yard, Mare Island, California, from which post he was
                    recalled in 1858, and appointed to the “Brooklyn” frigate, the command of which
                    he held for the next two years. When the war of secession broke out in 1861, he
                    was “waiting orders” at Norfolk. By birth and marriage he was a Southerner, and
                    the citizens of Norfolk counted on his throwing in his lot with them; but
                    professional pride, and affection for the flag under which he had served for
                    more than fifty years, held him true to his allegiance: he passionately rejected
                    the proposals of his fellow’ townsmen, and as it was more than hinted to him
                    that his longer stay in Norfolk might be dangerous, he hastily quitted that
                    place, and offered his services to the Government at "Washington. These were at

                    specially-constituted for clearing the navy of unfit or disloyal officers, —and
                    a few months later was appointed to the command of the “Western Gulf Blockading
                    Squadron,” with the rank of flag-officer, and ordered to proceed forthwith, in
                    the “Hartford,” to the Gulf of Mexico, to collect such vessels as could be
                    spared from the blockade, to proceed up the Mississippi, to reduce the defences
                    which guarded the approaches to New Orleans, and to take and hold the city. All
                    this Farragut executed to the letter, with a skill and caution that won for him
                    the love of his followers, and with a dash and boldness that won for him the
                    admiration of the public, and the popular name of “Old Salamander.” The passage
                    of the Mississippi was forced on the 24th April 1862, and New Orleans
                    surrendered on the 26th; this was immediately followed by the operations against
                    Vicksburg, from which, however, Farragut was compelled to withdraw, having
                    relearnt the old lesson that against heavy earthworks, crowning hills of
                    sufficient height, a purely naval attack is unavailing; it was not till the
                    following summer, and after a long siege, that Vicksburg surrendered to a land
                    force under General Grant. During this time the service on the Mississippi
                    continued both difficult and irksome; nor until the river was cleared could
                    Farragut seriously plan operations against Mobile, a port to which the fall of
                    New Orleans had given increased importance. Even then he was long delayed by the
                    want of monitors with which to oppose the ironclad vessels of the enemy. It was
                    the end of July 1864 before he was joined by these monitors; and on the 5th
                    August, undismayed by the loss of his leading ship, the monitor “Tecumseh,” sunk
                    by a torpedo, he forced the passage into the bay, destroyed or captured the
                    enemy’s ships, including the ram “Tennessee,” bearing Admiral Buchanan’s flag,
                    and took possession of the forts. The town was not occupied till the following
                    April, but with the loss of its harbour it ceased to have any political or
                    strategical importance. With this Farragut’s active service came to an end; for
                    though in September 1864 he was offered the command of the force intended for
                    the reduction of Wilmington, the state of his health, after the labours and
                    anxieties of the past three years, in a trying climate, compelled him to decline
                    it and to ask to be recalled. He accordingly returned to New York in December,
                    and was received with the wildest display of popular enthusiasm. It was then
                    that the Government instituted the rank of vice-admiral, previously unknown in
                    the American service. Farragut was promoted to it, and in July 1866 was further
                    promoted to the rank of admiral. In 1867, with his flag flying in the
                    “Franklin,” he visited Europe. The appointment was an honourable distinction
                    without political or naval import: the “Franklin” was, to all intents, for the
                    time being, a yacht at Farragut’s disposal; and her arrival in the different
                    ports was the signal for international courtesies, entertainments, and social
                    gaiety. She returned to America in 1868, and Farragut retired into private life.
                    Two years later, on the 14th August 1870, he died at Portsmouth, New
                    Hampshire.</p>
