                <p><label type="entry">FRITZLAR</label>, a town formerly of Electoral Hesse and now
                    of Prussia, at the head of a circle in the district of Cassel, about 16 miles
                    S.S.W. of Cassel, on the left bank of the Eder, a left-hand sub-tributary of the
                    Weser. It is an old-fashioned place still surrounded with watchtowers, and it
                    possesses a large number of churches, an Ursuline nunnery, and an old Franciscan
                    monastery, now partly used as a Protestant church and partly as a poorhouse. Its
                    inhabitants, who according to the census of 1875 numbered 2965, are mainly
                    engaged in agriculture, but also manufacture considerable quantities of
                    earthenware. As early as 732 Boniface, the apostle of Germany, established the
                    church of St Peter’s and a small Benedictine monastery at Frideslar, “the quiet
                    home” or “abode of peace.” Before long the school connected with the monastery
                    became famous, and among its earlier scholars it numbered Sturm, abbot of Fulda,
                    and Megingoz, bishop of Würzburg. When Boniface found himself unable to continue
                    the supervision of the society himself, he entrusted the office to Wigbert of
                    Glastonbury, who thus became the first abbot of Fritzlar. In 774 the little
                    settlement was taken and burnt by the Saxons; but it evidently soon recovered
                    from the blow. For a short time after 786 it was the seat of the bishopric of
                    Buraburg, or Bürberge, which had been founded by Boniface in 741. At the diet of
                    Fritzlar in 919 Henry I. was elected by the Franks and Saxons. In the beginning
                    of the 13th century the village received municipal rights; in 1232 it was
                    captured and burned by the landgrave, Conrad of Thuringia, and his allies; in
                    1631 it was taken by storm by William of Hesse; in 1760 it was successfully
                    defended by General Luckner against the French; and in 1761 it was occupied by
                    the French and unsuccessfully bombarded by the allies. As a principality
                    Fritzlar continued subject to the archbishopric of Mainz till 1802, when it was
                    incorporated with Hesse. From 1807 to 1814 it belonged to the kingdom of
                    Westphalia; and in 1866 it passed with Hesse to Prussia.</p>
