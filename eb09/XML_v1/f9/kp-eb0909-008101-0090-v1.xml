                <p><label type="entry">FERDINAND III</label>. (1200-1252), usually known as Saint
                    Ferdinand, was the son of Alphonso IX. of Leon, and of Berenguela, sister of
                    Henry I. of Castile. On the death of Henry without issue in 1217, the just title
                    of Blanche, the elder of the surviving sisters, was set aside and Berenguela
                    procured the proclamation of Ferdinand. He rapidly secured the homage of the
                    towns and the submission of the nobles, especially of the brothers Alvaro and
                    Fernando de Lara. On the death of his father in 1230 he ultimately, though not
                    without dispute, became king of Leon as well as of Castile, thus finally uniting
                    the two kingdoms under one crown. Following up the advantage which had been
                    gained for the Christian arms by his father and the allied kings in the great
                    battle at Las Navas de Tolosa in 1212, he devoted all his energies to the
                    prosecution of the Moorish war. Among his conquests may be mentioned those of
                    Ubeda in 1234, of Cordova in 1236, of Jaen in 1245, and of Seville in 1248. He
                    was planning an invasion of Africa when he died at Seville on the 30th of May
                    1252, leaving his kingdom to his eldest son Alphonso X. (Alonso el Sabio).</p>
                <p>Though not canonized till centuries afterwards (by Clement X. in 1671), he came
                    to be popularly known as <hi rend="italic">el Santo</hi> from a very early
                    period. Distinguished though he was for great military talent, he was still more
                    remarkable for his religious zeal. Like his younger cousin Saint Louis of
                    France, he was supremely a champion of the Catholic faith. It was not on the
                    field of battle alone that his ardour was displayed. His Spanish panegyrists
                    never fail to relate how it was his wont to assist in carrying wood for burning
                    the followers of the Albigensian heresy, and how sometimes with his own royal
                    hands he applied the torch to the pile.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    (Madrid, 1690), introduces Ferdinand as declaring to St Dominic his firm
                    determination to apply the cautery which alone can cure the cancer of heresy. He
                    is ready to have his own arm destroyed should it fail him in this duty. Compare

                    very favourably with him as a sincere friend of learning. He was the original
                    founder (1243) of the university of Salamanca, which his son and successor did
                    so much to foster and encourage. He it was also who caused to be translated into
                    the vulgar tongue the <hi rend="italic">Fuero</hi><hi rend="italic">Juzgo</hi>
                    (Forum Judicum) or code of Visigothic laws, which as collected and translated at
                    his instance has the double interest of being one of the oldest extant specimens
                    of Castilian prose, and also of being the foundation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Las</hi><hi rend="italic">Siete</hi><hi rend="italic">Partidas,</hi> the code
                    for Christian Spain, which was finally drawn up by Alphonso the Wise.</p>
                <p>His body now lies in the Capilla Real of Seville Cathedral, where it is exhibited
                    as a relic on certain annual occasions (in May, August, and November). His day
                    in the Spanish calendar is May 30.</p>
