                <p><label type="entry">FLOR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Roger di</hi></label>, a military
                    adventurer who, in the early years of the 14th century, distinguished himself
                    as. leader of the Catalan Grand Company. He was the second son of a falconer in
                    the service of the emperor Frederick IL, and when eight years old was sent to
                    sea in a galley belonging to the Knights Templars. He entered the order, and
                    became commander of a galley. At the siege of Acre by the Saracens in 1291 he
                    absented himself, took no part in the defence of the town, and was accused of
                    appropriating to his own use the treasures of his order. He was denounced to the
                    pope by the grand master as a thief and an apostate, was degraded from his rank,
                    and threatened with arrest. To escape imprisonment he fled to Genoa, where he
                    began to play the pirate. The struggle between the kings of Aragon and the
                    French kings of Naples for the possession of Sicily was at this time going on:
                    and Roger entered the service of Frederick, king of Sicily, who gave him the
                    rank of vice-admiral. At the close of the war, in 1302, Frederick being anxious
                    to free the island from the auxiliaries whom he had no longer the means of
                    paying, Roger induced his followers to seek new adventures in the East, in
                    fighting against the Turks, who were ravaging the empire. The emperor Andronicus
                    II. accepted his offer of service; and in September 1303 Roger with his fleet
                    and army arrived at Constantinople. He was adopted into the imperial family, was
                    married to a granddaughter of the emperor, and was made grand duke and
                    commander-in-chief of the army and the fleet. After some weeks lost in
                    dissipation, intrigues, and bloody quarrels, Roger and his men were sent into
                    Asia, and after some successful encounters with the Turks they went into winter
                    quarters at Cyzicus. In May 1304 they again took the field, and rendered the
                    important service of relieving Philadelphia, then invested and reduced to
                    extremities by the Turks. But Roger, bent on advancing his own interests rather
                    than those of the emperor, determined to found in the East a principality for
                    himself. He sent his treasures to Magnesia, but the people slew his Catalans and
                    seized the treasures. He then formed the siege of the town but his attacks were
                    repulsed, and he was compelled to raise the siege. Passing over into Europe, he
                    settled his troops in Gallipoli and other towns, and visited Constantinople to
                    demand pay for the Grand Company. Dissatisfied with the small sum granted by the
                    emperor, he plundered the country and carried on intrigues both with and against
                    the emperor. In the spring of 1306 Roger was created Caesar, this being the
                    first time that the title was given to a mere adventurer. Before setting out on
                    a second expedition to Philadelphia, he visited the young emperor Michael at
                    Adrianople; and there he was assassinated and his Catalan cavalry were
                    massacred, April 4, 1306. His death was avenged by a war which was fiercely
                    waged by the Grand Company against the Greeks.</p>
