                <p><label type="entry">FINIGUERRA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Maso</hi></label>
                    (contraction for <hi rend="smallcaps">Tommaso),</hi> a Florentine goldsmith, is
                    distinguished as the inventor of the method of taking impressions from engraved
                    plates. The date of his birth is not ascertained, and conjectures vary from 1400
                    to 1426. He was one of the best workers in niello, a form of decorative art then
                    very much in vogue in Italy, which, however, in the next century fell into
                    neglect. He is said to have been a pupil of the famous sculptor Lorenzo
                    Ghiberti, and to have assisted him in the execution of the beautiful bronze
                    gates of the baptistery of Florence; but whether the first or second pair of
                    gates is not stated. Baldinucci makes him a pupil of Masaccio; but it appears
                    probable that he was rather one of those art students who were powerfully
                    influenced by the new style, noble in simplicity, of Masaccio’s works, than a
                    personal disciple of the painter. One indisputably genuine work of Finiguerra is
                    still extant, a silver Pax on which is λvrought in niello a representation of
                    the Coronation of the Virgin. By some writers it is called an Assumption. It was
                    executed for the church of San Giovanni Battista at Florence, and is still
                    preserved there. It is in height a little more than 4 inches, and in breadth
                    about 3 inches; and within this small space is a composition of more than forty
                    figures, marvellous for accuracy of drawing and minute finish. The date of its
                    completion is fixed by an entry in the city archives, under the year 1452.
                    During the progress of the work the artist, according to the custom, took casts
                    in sulphur from the plate, and also impressions upon damped paper. For these
                    impressions he made use of a smooth roller, which passed over the paper on the
                    plate, and produced impressions that looked like pen drawings. This method was
                    followed by other workers; and thus copperplate engraving and printing soon
                    became generally practised in Italy. The title of Finiguerra to the discovery
                    was long disputed, especially on the ground that while prints by early German
                    masters were in existence bearing earlier dates than any Italian engravings, not
                    a single print by Finiguerra could be produced in support of his claim. The
                    question was settled by Zani’s discovery in 1797, in the National Cabinet of
                    Paris, of the identical impression taken by the artist himself from the silver
                    Pax of San Giovanni. This print is believed to have been executed as early as
                    1440. Zani’s account of his discovery (see Ottley’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Engraving,</hi> vol. i. pp. 306-312) is a singularly fascinating narrative,
                    breathing an enthusiasm as intense and a joy as devout as those of a Columbus
                    who first sights a long-sought world. The date of Maso’s death is not known.
                    Zani places it about 1460, others about 1475.</p>
