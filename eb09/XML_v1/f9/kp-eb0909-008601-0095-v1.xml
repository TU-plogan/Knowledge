                <p><label type="entry">FERGUSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Adam</hi></label> (1723-1816),
                    a distinguished philosopher and historian, was born, June 20, 1723, at
                    Logierait, Perthshire, of which parish his father was minister. He received the
                    rudiments of his education at the village school of his native parish, after
                    which he was removed to Perth grammar-school, where he made remarkable progress
                    in classical literature. Towards the end of 1738 he entered the university of St
                    Andrews, where he took the degree of M.A. on 4th May 1742. In November of the
                    same year he entered the divinity hall, and in 1745, although he had studied
                    divinity only one half of the usual period, he was allowed by the General
                    Assembly to be ordained by the presbytery of Dunkeld, on the representation that
                    he had been selected as the fittest person, from his knowledge of the Gaelic
                    language, to fill the office of chaplain to the 42d regiment, under the command
                    of Lord John Murray. When this regiment was at the battle of Fontenoy, Ferguson
                    went into action at the head of the attacking column with a drawn broadsword in
                    his hand, and could with difficulty be persuaded to retire to the rear. He
                    continued attached to the regiment till 1754, after which he resolved to devote
                    himself to literary pursuits. About the beginning of 1757, on the resignation of
                    David Hume, he was elected librarian and clerk to the Faculty of Advocates, but
                    these offices he relinquished in about a year on becoming tutor to Lord Bute. In
                    1757 he rendered himself conspicuous by the interest he took in the success of
                    the tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Douglas,</hi> written by his friend Home, and
                    by a pamphlet, <hi rend="italic">The Morality of Stage Plays seriously

                <p>In 1759 Ferguson succeeded Dr John Stewart as professor of natural philosophy in
                    the university of Edinburgh. In 1764 he was transferred to the chair of moral
                    philosophy, and within little more than a year after he published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Essay on the History of Civil Society,</hi> which was received
                    with much approbation, and wa≡ translated into several European languages. Soon
                    afterwards he began to collect materials for a history of the Roman
                    commonwealth. Whilst thus engaged, he was solicited by the guardians of Charles,
                    earl of Chesterfield, to superintend that young nobleman’s education, which had
                    been much neglected. He joined his young charge at Geneva in May 1774, and
                    remained with him for about a year. In his absence he had very nearly been
                    deprived of his office in the university, the town-council having, as patrons,
                    proposed to declare the chair vacant. In 1776 Ferguson published a pamphlet on
                    the American revolution in opposition to Dr Price’s “Observations on the nature
                    of civil liberty,” in which he sympathized with the views of the British
                    legislature. When the Government resolved to send out commissioners to quiet the
                    disorders in the colonies, he was appointed secretary. They failed to accomplish
                    the object of their <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0909-0096-0087"/> mission, but the Government obtained through them
                    fuller information regarding the state and temper of the Americans than they had
                    previously possessed.</p>
                <p>In 1780 Ferguson had a paralytic attack, which was one of the most remarkable on
                    record, for, by an abstemious diet, he continued to enjoy almost uninterrupted
                    good health for more than thirty years, while his mental powers were not
                    impaired. In 1783 his great work, the <hi rend="italic">History of the Progress
                    and Termination of the Roman Republic,</hi> appeared in 3 vols. 4to; it was very
                    popular, and went through several editions. In it Ferguson gives, in a connected
                    and elegant form, a narration of the great facts of Roman history for a period
                    of five hundred years. He was led to undertake this work from a conviction that
                    the history of that remarkable people during the period of their greatness was a
                    practical illustration of those ethical and political doctrines which were the
                    object of his peculiar study.</p>
                <p>No longer able to undergo the fatigue of public teaching, Ferguson in 1785
                    resigned his chair in the university, in which he was succeeded by Dugald
                    Stewart, then professor of mathematics. He now proceeded to revise his academic
                    lectures, and in 1792 they were published under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Principles of Moral and Political Science.</hi></p>
                <p>In his ethical system Ferguson treats man throughout as a social being, and
                    illustrates his doctrines by political examples. As a believer in the
                    progression of the human race, he placed the principle of moral approbation in
                    the attainment of perfection. His speculations have been carefully criticized by
                    Cousin, who thus expresses himself with reference to this theory :—“We find in
                    his method the wisdom and circumspection of the Scottish school, with something
                    more masculine and decisive in the results. The principle of <hi rend="italic"
                    >perfection</hi> is a new one, at once more rational and comprehensive than
                    benevolence and sympathy, which in our view places Ferguson as a moralist above
                    all his predecessors.” By this principle Ferguson endeavours to reconcile all
                    moral systems. With Hobbe3 and Hume he admits the power of self-interest or
                    utility, and makes it enter into morals as the law of self-preservation.
                    Hutcheson's theory of universal benevolence and Smith’s idea of sympathy he
                    combines under the law of society. But, as these laws are the means rather than
                    the end of human destiny, they are subordinate to a supreme end, and this
                    supreme end is perfection. In the political part of his system Ferguson follows
                    Montesquieu, and pleads the cause of well-regulated liberty and free
                    government.</p>
                <p>When in his seventieth year, Ferguson, intending to prepare a new edition of his
                    Roman history, resolved to visit Italy. He visited some of the principal cities
                    of Europe, and passed part of the winter of 1793 at Rome. He was generally well
                    received, and was elected a member of the Academy of Sciences of Berlin, of the
                    Etruscan Society of Antiquaries at Cortona, and of the Arcadia at Rome. From
                    1795 he resided successively at the old castle of Neidpath near Peebles, at
                    Hallyards on Manor water, and at St Andrews, where he died February 22,
                    1816.</p>
                <p>Besides the works above mentioned, Ferguson is the author of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Analysis of Pneumatics and Moral Philosophy,</hi> Edinburgh, 1766; <hi
                    rend="italic">Institutes of Moral Philosophy,</hi> 1769, 1773, 1785, translated
                    and used as a text-book in several foreign universities; and a few minor
                    publications. See a biographical sketch by J. Small, in <hi rend="italic">Trans,
