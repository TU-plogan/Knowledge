                    (1710-1792), French dramatist, was born at Paris, November 13, 1710. He was the
                    son of a noted pastry-cook, a man of some parts who in his leisure hours amused
                    himself with making verses. The son was educated at the college of
                    Louis-le-Grand, and after his father’s death carried on the business for a time
                    for the sake of his mother. His first success in literature was a poem entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">France</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >délivrée</hi><hi rend="italic">par</hi><hi rend="italic">la</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Pucelle d'Orlcans,</hi> which obtained the prize of the Académie
                    des Jeux Floraux. After the production of his first vaudeville, <hi
                    rend="italic">Les Deux Jumelles,</hi> circumstances enabled him to relinquish
                    his business and devote himself entirely to the drama. He provided many piecee
                    anonymously for the lesser theatres, and first put his name to <hi rend="italic"
                    >La Chercheuse</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Esprit,</hi>
                    which was produced in 1741. Among his most successful works were <hi
                    rend="italic">Annette et Lublin,</hi><hi rend="italic">Le Coq</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Village</hi> (1743), <hi rend="italic">Ninette</hi> à <hi
                    rend="italic">la Cour</hi> (1755), <hi rend="italic">Les Trois Sultanes</hi>
                    (1761), and <hi rend="italic">HAnglais</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Bordeaux</hi> (1763). Favart became director of the Opéra Comique;
                    and in 1745 he married Mademoiselle Duronceray, a beautiful young singer and
                    actress who had made a successful début the year before. By their united talents
                    and labours the Opéra Comique rose to such a height of success that the jealousy
                    of rival theatres was aroused, and through their influence the house was
                    suppressed the same year. Favart thus left without resources accepted the
                    proposal of Marshal Saxe, and undertook the direction of a troupe of comedians
                    which was to accompany his army into Flanders. It was part of his duty to
                    compose from time to time impromptu verses on the events of the campaign,
                    amusing and stimulating the spirits of the men. So popular were Favart and his
                    troop that “the enemy” became desirous of sharing his services, and permission
                    was given to gratify them, battles and comedies thus curiously alternating with
                    each other. But in the midst of his success a heavy blow fell upon him. The
                    marshal had looked with evil eyes upon Favart’s young wife, and attempted to
                    seduce her. To escape him the wife fled to Paris, and the wrath of the foiled
                    adulterer fell upon the husband. A <hi rend="italic">lettre</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de cachet</hi> was issued against him, and he only saved himself
                    by flight and concealment in a cave. Madame Favart meanwhile had been
                    distinguishing herself at the Comédie Italien; but as she still rejected the
                    brutal advances of the marshal, she was suddenly arrested and confined in a
                    provincial convent, where she was treated as a prisoner of state. After an
                    imprisonment of more than a year her fortitude gave way, and, yielding to the
                    will of her pursuer, she was at length liberated. After the marshal’s death in
                    1750, Favart returned to Paris, and resumed his pursuits as a dramatist. It was
                    at this time that the Abbé de Voisenon became intimately associated with him and
                    took part in his labours, though to what extent is uncertain. Madame Favart,
                    after a long and painful illness, died at Paris, April 22, 1772. She is
                    remembered as a bold reformer of stage costumes, breaking with the custom of
                    dressing all the <hi rend="italic">dramatis personae</hi> in court or showy
                    style, and introducing the use of costumes appropriate to the various
                    characters. She had remarkable powers of mimicry, especially of the speech and
                    accent of foreigners. She assisted her husband in some of his best productions.
                    He felt her loss deeply, survived her twenty years, becoming nearly blind in his
                    last days, and died at Paris, May 12, 1792. His works have been several times
                    republished In 1809 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires et Correspondance
                    littéraire, dramatique, et anecdotique,</hi> which furnish valuable information
                    on the state of the literary and theatrical worlds in the 18th century. This
                    work, in 3 vols. 8vo, was edited by his grandson A. P. C. Favart and H. F.
