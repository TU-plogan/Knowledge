                    municipal borough, seaport, and market-town of England, county of Kent, is
                    situated on the London and South-Eastern Railway, 7 miles W.S.W. of Dover. It is
                    very irregularly built, part of it lying in a hollow between the chalk and
                    greensand hills, and other portions on the hills. Folkestone is much frequented
                    in summer for sea-bathing, and steam packets ply daily between the town and
                    Boulogne. Many of the inhabitants are engaged in the fisheries, and there is
                    also a considerable shipping trade. The pier-harbour is 19 acres in extent, and
                    admits vessels of 150 tons burden. In 1861 a low-water landing-pier was erected,
                    which enables passengers to land from the steamers at all states of the tide.
                    The coast is defended by three martello towers, and a battery situated on the
                    heights protects the town. During 1877 the number of vessels that entered the
                    port was 885, with a tonnage of 154,897, and 854 cleared, with a tonnage of
                    153,208. Of these the number engaged in trade with foreign countries was—entered
                    46, with a tonnage of 9333; cleared 148, with a tonnage of 22,452. Among the
                    public buildings may be mentioned the free grammarschool, the harbour-house, the
                    town-hall and market-house, and the parish church, a cruciform structure in the
                    early Gothic style, with a tower rising from the intersection. It has recently
                    been enlarged and restored. The original church of St Eanswitha was built in
                    1095, and attached to it was a monastery for Benedictine monks, but the
                    devastations of the sea compelled the removal of both to the cliff on which the
                    church now stands. The monastery was destroyed at the dissolution of religious
                    houses in 1535. At a very early period Folkestone was a place of some
                    importance, and Roman remains have been <pb break="no"

                    to the Saxon crown, and it was granted by William the Conqueror to his knight
                    William d’Avranches, who built a Norman stronghold near the site of the old
                    castle founded by Eadbald, king of Kent, about 630. The cliff on which these
                    stood has been almost wholly swept away by the encroachments of the sea. In the
                    time of Queen Elizabeth Folkestone contained only 120 houses, and it was a mere
                    fishing village until the formation of a harbour in 1809. The opening of the
                    railway in 1844, and the establishment of the steam packet service with Boulogne
                    lent additional impulse to the town, and for some years it has been rapidly
                    increasing. Harvey, the discoverer of the circulation of the blood, was bom
                    there in 1578. Folkestone unites with Hythe in returning a member to parliament.
