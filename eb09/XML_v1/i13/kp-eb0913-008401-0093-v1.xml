                <p><label type="entry">INNOCENT IV</label>., Sinibaldo de Fieschi, pope from 1243 to
                    1254, belonged to one of the first families of Genoa, and, educated at Parma and
                    Bologna, passed for one of the best canonists of his time. He had for his
                    immediate predecessor Celestine IV., who, however, was pope for eighteen days
                    only, and therefore the events of Innocent’s pontificate practically link
                    themselves on to those of the reign of Gregory IX. It was on occasion of
                    Innocent’s election (June 28,1243) that Frederick II. is said to have remarked
                    that he had lost the friendship of a cardinal and gained the enmity of a pope;
                    the letter which he wrote, however, expressed in respectful terms the hope that
                    an amicable settlement of the differences between the empire and the papal see
                    might be reached. The negotiation which shortly afterwards began with this
                    object speedily proved abortive, Frederick being unable to make the absolute
                    submission to the pope’s demands which was required of him. Finding his position
                    in Rome insecure, Innocent secretly withdrew in the summer of 1244 to Genoa, and
                    thence to Lyons, where he summoned a general council which met in 1245 and
                    deposed Frederick. The agitation caused by this act throughout Europe terminated
                    only with Frederick’s death in 1250, which permitted the pope to return, first
                    to Perugia, and afterwards in 1253 to Rome. The remainder of his life was
                    largely devoted to schemes for compassing the overthrow of Manfred, the natural
                    son of Frederick II., whom the towns and the nobility had for the most part
                    received as his father’s successor. It was on a sick bed at Naples that Innocent
                    heard of Manfred’s victory at Foggia, and the tidings are said to have
                    precipitated his death (December 7, 1254). His learning gave to the world an <hi

                    decretalium,</hi> which is highly spoken of; but essentially Innocent IV. was a
                    small-souled man, whose avarice, cowardice, cunning, and vindictiveness suggest
                    a striking contrast with Innocent III., whose character and career, if his
                    selection of a name may be taken as an indication, he seems to have admired and
                    sought to follow. He was succeeded by Alexander IV.</p>
