                    (18,000), the chief town of Tyrol, Austria, is situated on the right bank of the
                    Inn, not far from its junction with the Sill, in a beautiful valley surrounded
                    by lofty mountains, which seem to overhang the town. It is connected with its
                    suburbs on the left bank of the stream by three bridges. The old wooden bridge,
                    which was the scene of a fierce struggle between the Tyrolese and the Bavarians
                    in 1809, was replaced in 1871-72 by a handsome iron structure, and the banks of
                    the Inn have, during the last few years, been widened and planted with trees.
                    Innsbruck is the seat of the law courts and the usual administrative offices for
                    the district of Tyrol and Vorarlberg. The town has broad streets, with four open
                    places. The houses are handsome; many of those in the old town date from the 17
                    th and 18th centuries, and are built in the Italian style, adorned with
                    frescoes, and having arcades beneath used as shops. The Franciscan or court
                    church (1553-1563), in the Renaissance style, contains several works of art, of
                    which the chief is the imposing cenotaph of the emperor Maximilian I. This
                    monument of art, one of the most important on the Continent, represents the
                    emperor kneeling in prayer on a marble sarcophagus, surrounded by twenty-eight
                    colossal bronze statues of his ancestors; while on the sides of the sarcophagus
                    there are twenty-four reliefs, depicting the chief events in Maximilian’s life.
                    Alexander Colin executed most of the reliefs (see vol. vi. p. 141); and Gilg
                    Sesselschreiber, court-painter, had the general superintendence of the work, and
                    designed many of the statues. In the same church are the monuments of the
                    patriots Hofer, Haspinger, and Speckbacher, and one in memory of the Tyrolese
                    who fell in defence of their country between 1796 and 1809. The silver chapel of
                    the church contains a silver Madonna and altarpiece, and the graves of Archduke
                    Ferdinand II. and his wife Philippa. In this church Christina of Sweden <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> daughter of Gustavus Adolphus, publicly adopted the
                    Roman Catholic faith in 1654. Other churches worthy of note are the
                    Pfarr-church, the Jesuits’ church, the Serviten church, and St John’s of
                    Nepomuk. There are numerous monastic institutions, including a Jesuits’ college,

                    university, founded in 1672 and, after being twice suspended, finally
                    reinstituted in 1826, had in 1880-81 a teaching-staff of 76, and (1879-80) 607
                    students. It possesses a fine library, and exhibitions to the annual value of
                    &lt;£1200. The Ferdinandeum, an interesting national museum, was founded in
                    1845, and is maintained by private enterprise. The other chief buildings are the
                    palace, completed in 1771, the theatre, the post-office, the landhaus,
                    town-house, and other officia] buildings, and several schools and benevolent

                <p>The Golden Roof (Goldne Dachl) is prominent on the front of a mansion built in
                    1425 at great expense by Frederick of the Empty Pockets, as a practical
                    refutation of his nickname. Among the several monuments in the town are St
                    Anna’s pillar, erected in 1706 to commemorate the repulse of the French and
                    Bavarians in 1703; the fountain, with a bronze statute of Duke Rudolf IV.,
                    raised in 1863-77 in memory of the five.hundredth anniversary of the union of
                    Tyrol with Austria; statues of the archduke Leopold V. and of Walter von der
                    Vogelweide; and the triumphal arch erected in 1765, on the occasion of the
                    marriage of the emperor Leopold II. to the infanta Maria Ludovica. The
                    manufactures of Innsbruck comprise woollen and cotton goods, stained glass,
                    leather, and machinery; and there is considerable transit trade between Italy
                    and Austria. The population in 1869 was 16,324; but in 1879 it was estimated at
                    about 18,000, with a garrison of 2000 men.</p>
                <p>The ancient name of the town was Oeni Pons or (Enipontum, of which Innsbruck
                    (Bridge of Inn) is the German equivalent. It received town privileges in 1234
                    from Duke Otto I. of Meran; from that dato till about 1665 it was the capital
                    of. the Tyrolese counts; and after the union of Tyrol with Austria in 1363 <hi

                    capturing the emperor Charles V., to whom a mutiny among Maurice’s troops
                    afforded time for a hasty flight. In the war of the Spanish succession, and
                    again in the patriotic Tyrolese wars at the beginning of the 19th century,
                    Innsbruck suffered severely. During the commotions of 1848, it was the temporary
                    refuge of the emperor Ferdinand.</p>
