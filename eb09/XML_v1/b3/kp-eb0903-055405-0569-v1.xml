                    one of the most enterprising and successful Egyptian explorers, was born of
                    humble parentage at Padua in 1778. When about eighteen years of age he appears
                    to have removed to Rome, and for a short time became a monk. In 1798 the
                    occupation of the city by the French troops drove him from Rome. He wandered
                    through Holland, and in 1803 came to England. Here for some time he was
                    compelled to find subsistence for himself and his wife, an Englishwoman, by
                    exhibiting on the streets athletic exercises and feats of agility. Through the
                    kindness of Mr Salt, who was ever afterwards his patron, he was engaged at
                    Astley⅛ amphitheatre, and his circumstances soon began to improve. In 1812 he
                    set out on his travels, passing through Lisbon and Madrid to Egypt, where his
                    friend, Mr Salt, was British consul. He was desirous of laying before the pasha
                    Mehemet Ali a hydraulic machine for raising the waters of the Nile. Though the
                    experiment with this engine was successful, the design was abandoned by the
                    pasha, and Belzoni resolved to continue his travels. He visited Thebes and
                    removed with great skill the colossal statue, commonly called young Memnon,
                    which he shipped for England. He also pushed his investigations into the great
                    temple of Edfoo, visited Elephantina and Philae, discovered the temple of
                    Abusimbel, made excavations at Carnac, and opened up a splendid tomb in the
                    Beban-el-Molouk. He was the first to penetrate into the second great pyramid of
                    Ghizeh, and the first to visit the oasis west of Lake Moeris. In 1819 he
                    returned to England and published in the following year a most interesting
                    account of his travels and discoveries. He also exhibited for some time at the
                    Egyptian Hall facsimiles of the great tomb at Beban-el-Molouk. In 1823 he again
                    set out for Africa, intending to penetrate to Timbuctoo. He reached Benin, but
