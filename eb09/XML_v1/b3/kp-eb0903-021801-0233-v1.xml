                <p><label type="entry">BACON, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, who may be
                    considered the founder of the British school of sculpture, was born Nov. 24,
                    1740. He was the son of Thomas Bacon, cloth-worker in Southwark, whose
                    forefathers possessed a considerable estate in Somersetshire. At the age of
                    fourteen he was bound apprentice in Mr Crispe’s manufactory of porcelain at
                    Lambeth, where he was at first employed in painting the small ornamental pieces
                    of china, but by his great skill in moulding he soon attained the distinction of
                    being modeller to the work. The produce of his labour he devoted to the support
                    of his parents, then in somewhat straitened circumstances. While engaged in the
                    porcelain works he had an opportunity of seeing the models executed by different
                    sculptors of eminence, which were sent to be burned at an adjoining pottery. An
                    observation of these productions appears to have immediately determined the
                    direction of his genius; he devoted himself to the imitation of them with so
                    much success, that in 1758 a small figure sent by him to the Society for the
                    Encouragement of Arts received a prize, and the highest premiums given by that
                    society were adjudged to him nine times between the years 1763 and 1776. During
                    his apprenticeship he also improved the method of working statues in artificial
                    stone, an art which he afterwards carried to perfection. Bacon first attempted
                    working in marble about the year 1763, and, during the course of his early
                    efforts in this art, was led to improve the method of transferring the form of
                    the model to the marble (technically called <hi rend="italic">getting out the
                    points),</hi> by the invention of a more perfect instrument for the purpose,
                    which has since been adopted by many sculptors both in this and other countries.
                    This instrument possesses many advantages above those formerly employed; it is
                    more exact, takes a correct measurement in every direction, is contained in a
                    small compass, and can be used upon either the model or the marble. In the year
                    1769 he was adjudged the first gold medal given by the Royal Academy, and in
                    1770 was made an associate of that body. He shortly afterwards exhibited a
                    figure of Mars, which gained him considerable reputation, and he was then
                    engaged to execute a bust of George III., intended for Christ Church, Oxford. He
                    secured the king’s favour, and retained it throughout life. His great celebrity
                    now procured him numerous commissions, and it is said, that of sixteen different
                    competitions in which he was engaged with other artists, he was unsuccessful in
                    one case only. Considerable jealousy was entertained against him by other
                    sculptors, and he was commonly charged with ignorance of classic style. This
                    charge he repelled by the execution of a noble head of Jupiter Tonans, and many
                    of his emblematical figures are in perfect classical taste. On the 4th of August
                    1799, he was suddenly attacked with inflammation, which occasioned his death in
                    little more than two days, in the 59th year of his age. He left a widow, his
                    second wife, and a family of six sons and three daughters. Of his merit as a
                    sculptor, the universal reputation of his works affords decisive proof, and his
                    various productions which adorn St Paul’s Cathedral, London, Christ Church and
                    Pembroke College, Oxford, the Abbey Church, Bath, and Bristol Cathedral, give
                    ample testimony to his powers. Perhaps his best works are to be found among the
                    monuments in Westminster Abbey. (See <hi rend="italic">Memoir of the late John
