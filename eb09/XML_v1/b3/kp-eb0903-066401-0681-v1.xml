                <p><label type="entry">BIBULUS</label>. Ths best-known of those who bore this
                    surname, which belonged, to the Gens Calpurnia at Rome, was Marcus Calpurnius
                    Bibulus, elected consul with Julius Caesar, 59 B.c. He was the candidate put
                    forward by the aristocratical party in opposition to L. Lucceius, who was of the
                    party of Caesar; and bribery was freely used (with the approval, says Suetonius,
                    of even the rigid Cato) to secure his election. But he proved no match for his
                    able colleague. He made an attempt to oppose the agrarian law introduced by
                    Caesar for distributing the lands of Campania, but was overpowered and even
                    personally ill-treated by the violence of the mob. After making vain complaints
                    in the senate, he shut himself up in his own house during the remaining eight
                    months of his consulship, taking no part in public business beyond fulminating
                    edicts against Caesar’s proceedings, which only provoked an attack upon his
                    house by a mob of Caesar’s partizans. When the interests of Caesar and Pompey
                    became divided, Bibulus supported the latter, and joined in proposing his
                    election as sole consul (52 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> Next year he went
                    into Syria as proconsul, and claimed credit for a victory gained by one of his
                    officers over the Parthians, who had invaded the province, but which took place
                    before his own arrival in the country. After the expiration of his government
                    there, Pompey gave him the command of his fleet in the Ionian Sea. Here also he
                    proved himself utterly incapable; distinguishing himself chiefly by the cruel
                    burning, with all their crews on board, of thirty transport vessels which had
                    conveyed Cae3ar from Brundisium to the coast of Epirus, and which he had
                    captured on their return, having failed to prevent their passage. He died soon
                    afterwards of fatigue and mortification. By his wife Portia, daughter of Cato,
                    afterwards married to Brutus, he had three sons. The two eldest were murdered in
                    Egypt by some of the soldiery of Gabinius; the youngest, Lucius Calpurnius
                    Bibulus, fought on the side of the republic at the battle of Philippi, but
                    surrendered to Antony soon afterwards, and was by him appointed to the command
                    of his fleet. He died while governor of Syria under Augustus.</p>
