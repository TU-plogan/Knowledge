                <p><label type="entry">BELSHAZZAR</label>, the name of a Babylonian prince mentioned
                    in the book of Daniel. According to the account in the fifth chapter of Daniel,
                    Belshazzar was king of Babylon at the time of the capture of the city by the
                    Medes and Persians, and was slain when the city was surprised during a festival.
                    No ancient historian mentions the name of Belshazzar among the successors of
                    Nebuchadnezzar, and there has been considerable controversy as to the identity
                    of the unfortunate monarch. The successors of Nebuchadnezzar, according to the
                    copyists of Berosus, were as follows :—Evil-merodach, two years, son of
                    Nebuchadnezzar; Neriglissar, or Nergalsharezer, four years, son-in-law of
                    Nebuchadnezzar; Laborosoarchod, nino months, son of Neriglissar; Nabonidus,
                    seventeen years, not of the royal family. Niebuhr and some others identified
                    Belshazzar with Evil-merodach; other scholars with Neriglissar; and a third
                    section, including Ewald and Browne, identified him with Nabonidus. There is no
                    necessity now to argue against these and similar views, as they are set aside by
                    the Babylonian cuneiform inscriptions, which show that Bel-sar-uzur, or
                    Belshazzar, was the name of the eldest son of Nabonidus, the last king of
                    Babylon. In some of his latter inscriptions Nabu-nahid or Nabonidus mentions his
                    eldest son Bel-sar-uzur in such terms as to lead to the impression that the
                    young prince was associated with himself on the throne; and this explains
                    several difficulties between the historians and the book of Daniel with respect
                    to the capture of Babylon. After the defeat of the Babylonian forces Nabonidus
                    fled to Borsippa, while the young prince Belshazzar was left in charge of
                    Babylon, the capital, which was closely besieged by the Medes and Persians. The
                    historians all say that Nabonidus, the last king of Babylon, submitted to the
                    conquerors at Borsippa after the taking of his capital, while the book of Daniel
                    states that Belshazzar was slain on the night of the capture of Babylon. These
                    two statements have been supposed to contradict each other, but we now know that
                    they refer to two totally distinct princes whose fates were quite different. The
                    inscriptions of Nabonidus which mention Belshazzar are found on clay cylinders
                    from Mugheir and other Chaldean sites, and they were first discovered and
                    published by Sir Henry Rawlinson, to whom we owe this rectification in ancient
                    history. One of these passages in a prayer reads: “Me Nabu-nahid, king of
                    Babylon, from sin against thy great divinity, do thou save me, and health and
                    long days numerous do thou multiply. And of Bel-sar-uzur,—my eldest son, the
                    delight of my heart in the worship of thy great divinity, his heart do thou
