                <p><label type="entry">BHÂWALPUR</label>, a feudatory state in North-Western India,
                    under the political jurisdiction of the Lieutenant-Governor of the Panjâb, lying
                    between 27° 41' and 30° 25' N. lat., and 69° 30' and 73° 58' E. long. It is
                    bounded on the N. by Sind and Panjâb, on the E. and S.E. by the British district
                    of Hissar and the Râjput states of Bikânir and Jasalmir, and on the S.W. by
                    Sind. The state contains an estimated area of about 22,000 square miles;
                    greatest length from N.E. to S.W., 310 miles; greatest breadth, 110 miles. Only
                    a sixth part of the total area is capable of cultivation.</p>
                <p>Thornton thus describes the general aspect of the state :—“Bhawalpur is a
                    remarkably level country, there being no considerable eminence within its
                    limits, as the occasional sand-hills, seldom exceeding 50 or 60 feet in height,
                    cannot be considered exceptions. The cultivable part extends along the river
                    line for a distance of about 10 miles in breadth from the left or eastern bank.
                    In the sandy part of the desert beyond this strip of fertility both men and
                    beasts, leaving the beaten path, sink as if in loose snow. Here, too, the sand
                    is raised into ever-changing hills by the force of the wind sweeping over it In
                    those parts of the desert which have a hard level soil of clay, a few stunted
                    mimosas, acacias, and other shrubs are produced, together with rue, various
                    bitter and aromatic plants, and occasionally tufts of grass. Much of the soil of
                    the desert appears to be alluvial; there are numerous traces of streams having
                    formerly passed over it, and still, where irrigation is at all practicable,
                    fertility in the clayey tract follows; but the rains arc scanty, the wells few
                    and generally 100 feet deep or more.”</p>
                <p>The Ghara, a great stream formed by the united waters of the Bias and Satlej, the
                    Indus, and the Panjnad, are the principal rivers .of the state, affording a
                    continuous river-line of 300 or 350 miles in length. In 1872 the population was
                    estimated at 472,791, the majority of whom are Mahometans, consisting of Jâts of
                    Hindu descent, Beluchιs, and Afghans. The principal products are woollen and
                    cotton cloths, silk goods, indigo, cereals, alum, saltpetre, &amp;c. These form
                    the principal exports; the imports are inconsiderable. Value of external trade
                    in 1872, £358,000; internal trade, £444,700 Principal trade routes:—(1), From
                    Bikânir to Central Asia <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Bhawalpur; (2), from Jasalmir
                    to Afghanistan; (3), from Bhâwalpur to Sind. In 1872 the gross revenue of the
                    state was returned as £197,344; estimated military force, 2679 Principal
                    towns-Bhawalpur, the capital, situated on a branch of the River Ghara; Ahmadpur,
                    Uch, Khânpur, and Michinâbâd.</p>
                <p>The state was a dependency of the Durâni kingdom till its dismemberment, when
                    Bhâwalpur became independent. On the rise of Ranjit Singh, the khân of Bhawalpur
                    tendered his allegiance to the British Government, and received a L·fe-pension
                    of £10,000 per annum for his services in the Silch war. The present ruler is a
                    minor (1875), and the state is now under British management, under which it has
                    greatly prospered. The Panjâb Administration ReDort for 1871-72 states that on
                    the death of the late chief, when Bhâwalpur came under British management, “the
                    treasury was empty, the Government in debt, the army disorganized, the canals,
                    on which cultivation mainly depends, neglected, while a general sense of
                    insecurity prevailed; but now (1871-72) there is a cash balance of £80,000 in
                    hand, the state debts have been paid off, the revenue has reached £200,000 a
                    year (or double what it was three years ago), while the ordinary expenditure is
                    about £160,000, the canals have been greatly increased in number and efficiency,
                    waste lands have been brought under cultivation, population has increased, and
                    the aπny has been reorganized.”</p>
