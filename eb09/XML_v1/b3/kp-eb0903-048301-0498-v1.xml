                <p><label type="entry">BEDFORDSHIRE</label>, one of the south midland counties of
                    England, surrounded by the counties of Buckingham, Northampton, Huntingdon,
                    Cambridge, and Hertford. It is the fourth smallest county, containing only
                    295,509 acres or 461 square miles. Its extreme length from north to south is
                    about 47 miles, and its width 21 miles. The great Ouse, which flows through the
                    county eastward, is navigable from Bedford to the sea at King’s Lynn. The
                    Midland and Great Northern Railways intersect the county, also the Bletchley and
                    Cambridge branch of the London and North-Western. The surface of the county is
                    for the most part level, but the northern half is undulating, with a subsoil
                    generally of boulder-clay and Oxford-clay. A fine tract of land south of Bedford
                    is bounded by a range of lower-greensand running east and west, presenting
                    beautiful woodland scenery, parallel to which, along the Hertfordshire border,
                    the Chiltern chalk range rises to 500 feet above the sea-level and 400 feet
                    above the level of Bedford. The county is generally devoted to corn-growing, but
                    the Ouse valley has a large breadth of rich pasturage, and all along the west
                    side of the Great Northern railway is a sandy loam, on which onions, potatoes,
                    and market produce are grown. Agricultural implement and other engineering works
                    employ about 1000 hands at Bedford and Luton; while the female industry of the
                    county is pillow-lace, and in the south straw-plait. The plait is made up,
                    chiefly at Dunstable and Luton, into hats and bonnets, which are exported to all
                    parts of the world. Luton is the most populous town in the county, slightly
                    exceeding the county town of Bedford. The county rate assessment is .£585,840.
                    and the expenditure in 1873 was <hi rend="italic">£1</hi> 1,802. The county
                    belongs to the diocese of Ely, and coincides with the archdeaconry of Bedford.
                    It contains 9 hundreds and 124 parishes. It is in the Norfolk circuit, and
                    assizes are held twice a year. A court of quarter-sessions sits at Bedford, and
                    the petty sessional divisions are seven. Two members are returned to parliament
                    for the county and two for the town of Bedford. The titles derived from the
                    county are that of duke to the house of Russell, and of baron of Bletsoe to the
                    family of Lord St John, and the largest landowners are the duke of Bedford and
                    Mr Whitbread of Southill. The most distinguished residence in the county is
                    Woburn Abbey (duke of Bedford), near the town of that name. It was formerly a
                    Cistercian abbey, granted at the Reformation by Henry VIII. to the family of
                    Russell, the fourth duke of which house erected the present edifice. It is a
                    very grand and capacious pile, situated in an extensive park, and is furnished
                    with a large and valuable collection of paintings and statues. Luton Hoo is also
                    an extensive mansion, which was reconstructed and improved for the third earl of
                    Bute by the brothers Adam. A library, 146 feet in length, furnished with a
                    valuable collection of books, and a large selection of paintings of some of the
                    first masters, chiefly of the Italian school, are its distinguishing ornaments.
                    Besides these there are other mansions which are highly deserving of notice,
                    especially that of Mr Whitbread at Southill; Wrest Park, belonging to the
                    Dowager Countess Cowper, Hawnes House, to the Rev. Lord John Thynne; Sutton, to
                    Sir John Μ. Burgoyne; and Oakley House, to the marquis of Tavistock.</p>
                <p>There are a general infirmary and fever hospital at Bedford; near Aresey is the
                    Three Counties Lunatic Asylum (for Beds, Herts, and Hunts) provided for 685
                    patients; at Carlton is the juvenile county reformatory; at Kempstonthe county
                    school (300 boys), also the Military Brigade Dépôt. Connected with the county
                    are the militia (18th Light Infantry), the duke of Manchester’s cavalry
                    volunteer corps, and the rifle volunteers.</p>
                <p>The population of the county stood at the four last decennial enumerations as

                <p>In the year 1871 the number of agricultural labourers was 15,962, of
                    straw-plaiters 23,508 (90 per cent, being females), and of lacemakers 6051, all
                    female3. The towns and their populations in 1871 were as follows:—Luton, 17,317;
                    Bedford, 16,850; Leighton-Buzzard, 4696; Dunstable, 4558; Biggleswade, 4244.</p>
                <p>When the Romans landed in Britain Bedfordshire formed a portion of the district
                    of the Cattieuchlani, whose sovereign or chief, Cassibelenus or Cassivelaunus,
                    com manded the united forces which opposed Julius Caesar. When, in the year 310,
                    the Emperor Constantine ruled the whole island, and divided it into five
                    provinces, Bedfordshire was included in the third division called <hi
                    rend="italic">Flaυia C</hi><hi rend="italic">oesariensis,</hi> and remained so
                    till the final abandonment of Britain by the Romans. Under the Saxon heptarchy
                    it formed part of the kingdom of Mercia, until with the rest of the island it
                    was united to the kingdom of the West Saxons, which was divided by Alfred into
                    counties, hundreds, and tythings, when this county first received its present
                    name.</p>
                <p>There are many remains of Roman, Saxon, and Norman antiquities. Traces of a Roman
                    station are to be seen at Sandy near Potton, and at Maiden-Bower near Dunstable.
                    Leighton-Buzzard, or Beaudesert, is supposed to have been a Roman camp. The
                    ancient Icknield and Watling Streets passed through the county; and the remains
                    of both may be definitely traced, as well as of some others constructed by the
                    Romans.</p>
