                <p><label type="entry">BANDELLO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Matteo</hi></label>, an
                    Italian novelist, was born at Castelnuovo, near Tortona, about the year 1480. He
                    received a very careful education, and entered the church, though he does not
                    seem to have prosecuted his theological course with great zeal. For many years
                    he resided at Mantua, and superintended the education of the celebrated Lucrezia
                    Gonzaga, in whose honour he composed a long poem. The decisive battle of Pavia,
                    which gave Lombardy into the hands of the emperor, compelled Bandello to fly;
                    his house at Milan was burnt and his property confiscated. He took refuge
                    with.Cesar Fregoso, an Italian general in the French service, whom ho
                    accompanied into France. In 1550 he was raised to the bishopric of Agen, a town
                    in which he resided for many years before his death in 1562. Bandello wrote a
                    number of poems, but his fame rests entirely upon his extensive collection of
                    <hi rend="italic">Novelle,</hi> or tales, which have been extremely popular.
                    They belong to that species of literature of which Boccaccio’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Decameron</hi> and the queen of Navarre’s <hi rend="italic">Heptameron</hi>
                    are, perhaps, the best known examples. The common origin of them all is to be
                    found in the old <hi rend="italic">Fabliaux</hi> of the French Trouveurs, though
                    some well known tales are evidently Eastern, and others classical. Bandello’s
                    novels are esteemed the best of those written in imitation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Decameron,</hi> though Italian critics find fault with them for
                    negligence and inelegance of style. They have little value in a purely literary
                    point of view, and many of them are disfigured by the grossest obscenity.
                    Historically, however, they are of no little interest, not only from the insight
                    into the social life of the period which they afford, but from the important
                    influence they exercised on the Elizabethan drama. The stories, on which
                    Shakespeare based several of his plays, were supplied by Bandello, probably
                    through Belleforest or Paynter (see Simrock, <hi rend="italic">Quellen</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Shakespeare).</hi> The same is true of Massinger, Beaumont and
                    Fletcher, and others. The most convenient edition of Bandello is that in 9
                    vols., 1813.</p>
