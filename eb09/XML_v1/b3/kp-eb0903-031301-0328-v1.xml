                <p><label type="entry">BANGALORE</label>, the administrative capital and most
                    important town of the chief commissionership of Mysore, also a large military
                    cantonment, situated in 12° 58' N. lat., and 77° 38' E. long. In 1872 the total
                    population of the Bangalore municipality amounted to 191,300; municipal income
                    in 1872-73, £19,090; expenditure, £17,496; average rate of taxation, 2s. per
                    head of the population. For the protection of the town, a municipal police,
                    consisting of 22 officers and 124 men, was maintained in 1872-73, at a total
                    cost of £2756. Bangalore commands the province of Mysore from a military point
                    of view. The elevation of the district on which it stands renders it healthy for
                    English troops; and a large European and Native force is quartered at the
                    military cantonment,—the Native force in 1872-73 consisting of six regiments of
                    cavalry, numbering 2095 officers and men, and four regiments of infantry,
                    numbering 2149 officers and men. The principal institution of the town is the
                    Bangalore High School or Central College for the province, attended by between
                    four and five hundred pupils. The average annual charge of educating each pupil
                    in 1872-73 was £3, 4s. 6d, of which £2, 3s. 9d. was contributed by the state. Mr
                    Thornton thus writes regarding the history of the town :—</p>
                <p>The foundation of the present fort was laid by a descendant of Kemp≡-Goud, a
                    husbandman of the neighbouring country, who, probably in the 16th century, had
                    left his native village to avoid the tyranny of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >wadeyar</hi> of that place, and settled on a spot a few miles to the north of
                    Bangalore. To the peaceful occupation of a farmer he added that of a warrior,
                    and his first exploit was the conquest of this place, where, and at Savendrug,
                    his family subsequently erected fortresses. Bangalore, with other possessions,
                    was, however, wrested from them by Bijapur. Somewhat later we find it enumerated
                    among the <hi rend="italic">j&lt;igirs</hi> of Shahji, father of Sivaji, the
                    founder of the Marhatta sway; and at an early period of his career in the
                    service of the Bijapur state, that adventurer seemed to have fixed his residence
                    there. It appears to have passed into the possession of Venkoji, one of the sons
                    of Shâhjf; but he having occupied Tanjor, deemed Bangalore too distant,
                    especially under the circumstances of the times, to be safe. He accordingly, in
                    1687, entered into a bargain for its sale to Chik Deo, Râjâ of Mysore, for three
                    lacs of rupees; but before it could be completed, Kasim Khan, commander of the
                    forces of Aurangzeb, marched upon the place, and entered it almost without
                    resistance. This event, however, had no other result than to transfer the
                    stipulated price from one vendor to another; for that general, not coveting the
                    possession, immediately delivered it over to Chik Deo on payment of the three
                    lacs. In 1758, Nanjiraj, the powerful minister of the Râjâ, caused Bangalore to
                    be granted, as a <hi rend="italic">jdgir</hi> or fief, to Haidar Ali, afterwards
                    usurper of Mysore, who greatly enlarged and strengthened the fort, which, in
                    1760, on his expulsion from Seringapatam, served as his refuge from destruction.
                    In 1791 it was stormed by a British army commanded by Lord Cornwallis.</p>
                <p>The subsequent history of Bangalore belongs to the general events of Mysore, the
                    province of which it forms the political capital. Bangalore is now one of the
                    handsomest English stations in India, with noble public buildings, spacious and
                    artistically laid out gardens, broad smooth roads, well-supervised bazaars, and
                    a good water supply. The markets display almost every sort of English and Indian
                    fruit or vegetable. Bangalore forms the residence of the chief commissioner of
                    Mysore and the principal officers of his administration, and is well worthy of
                    its place as the political and military capital of the province.</p>
