                    (1790-1852), born in 1790 at Lewes, Sussex, rose to eminence as a popular
                    exponent of geology, and contributed many original papers to the literature of
                    the science. Educated for the medical profession, he first practised in his
                    native town, afterwards in Brighton, and finally at Clapham, near London. While
                    devoting himself with industry and success to the duties of a medical man, he
                    yet found time to prosecute researches in the palaeontology of the Secondary
                    rocks, particularly in Sussex—a region which he has made for ever classical in
                    the history of discovery. While he was still a country <pb break="no"

                    investigator was fully recognized on the publication of his work on <hi
                    rend="italic">The. Fossils of the South Downs,</hi> 1822. His most remarkable
                    discoveries were made in the Wealden formations, whence he brought to light and
                    described the remarkable Γ)inosaurian reptiles known as <hi rend="italic"

                    of these strange creatures, and pointed out the probable conditions in which
                    they lived, were recognized by the Geological Society as deserving of its
                    highest honour—the Wollaston medal. The Royal Society also awarded him a Royal
                    medal. Besides these and other contributions to the literature of palaeontology
                    and geology, he published from time to time various popular works which had a
                    large sale and did much to spread a knowledge of and interest in the
                    science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Of these the

                    Towards the end of his life Dr Manteli retired to London. Though for many years
                    suffering from a severe spinal disease, the result of an accident, he continued
                    with unabated enthusiasm the prosecution of his favourite scientific pursuits,
                    sparing neither pains nor expense towards the attainment of his objects, and
                    kindling in others a spirit of eager desire to farther the cause of science. He
                    wrote with great clearness and attractiveness, so that his general works were
                    deservedly popular. As a lecturer also he was almost unrivalled for fluency and
                    eloquence. His name appeared on the list of membership of many learned societies
                    both at home and abroad. He died in 1852.</p>
