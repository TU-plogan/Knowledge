                    (1730-1807), born in Geneva in 1730, and educated there, became tutor in the
                    family of the count of Calenberg in Saxony. In 1752 he was appointed professor
                    of belles lettres to the academy at Copenhagen, but as the French language was
                    then little known in Denmark he had but few students. He was naturally attracted
                    to the study of the ancient literature and history of his adopted country, and
                    in 1755 he published the first fruits of his researches, under the title <hi
                    rend="italic">—Introduction</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Γhistoire</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Danemarck</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">où l'on traite de la religion, des moeurs, des lois, et des usages
                    des anciens Danois.</hi> A second part was issued in 1750, more particularly
                    relating to the ancient literature of the country, and bearing the title— <hi
                    rend="italic">Monuments</hi><hi rend="italic">de la mythologie et de la poesie
                    des Celtes, et particulièrement des anciens Scandinaves.</hi> In the same year a
                    translation of the work appeared in Danish. This is the work by which the author
                    is best known in Britain. Though intended only as a preliminary dissertation to
                    the formal history of Denmark, by which it was followed, it has all the merits
                    of an independent work, complete in itself, and presenting a general view of the
                    civilization and culture, religion and customs, of the Scandinavian nations. A
                    translation into English, with notes and preface, by Bishop Percy, was issued in
                    1770 under the title of <hi rend="italic">Northern Antiquities</hi> (republished
                    with additions in 1847). It had a wide circulation, and attracted much attention
                    on account of its being the first (though a very defective) translation into
                    French of the <hi rend="italic">Edda.</hi> Mallet’s dissertations and notes are
                    vitiated by untenable theories as to the racial affinities of the early
                    inhabitants of Scandinavia; but, judged by the standards of its time, his work
                    was of great merit and usefulness. Its publication attracted the notice of the
                    king to its author, and he was chosen as preceptor of the prince of Denmark. In
                    1760 he returned to Geneva, and became professor of history in his native city.
                    While there t e was requested by the czarina to undertake the education of the
                    heir-apparent of Russia (afterwards the Czar Paul I.), but declined the honour.
                    An invitation more congenial to his tastes led to his accompanying Lord
                    Mountstuart in his travels through Italy and thence to England, where he was
                    presented at court and commissioned to write the history of the house of
                    Brunswick. He had previously received a similar commission from the landgrave of
                    Hesse-Cassel for the preparation of a history of the house of Hesse, and both
                    works were completed in 1785. The quietude of a literary life was rudely broken
                    by the shock of the Revolution, to which he was openly hostile. His leanings to
                    the unpopular side were so obnoxious to his fellow citizens that he was obliged
                    to quit his native country in 1792, and remained in exile till 1801. He died at
                    Geneva, 8th February 1807.</p>
