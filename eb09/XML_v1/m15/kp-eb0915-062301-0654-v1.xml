                    is derived from an ancestor Mas'ud, a Meccan, whose son 'Abdalla accompanied
                    Mohammed on his flight to Medina, and is often mentioned in the history of the
                    prophet. Details as to the family are given by Reiske, <hi rend="italic">Ann.

                    of the 9th Christian century. Great part of his life was spent in travel; in
                    912-13 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> he was at Mültân in the Punjab, and also
                    visited Mansura. Three years later he was at Basra and met Abu Zeid, the

                    Mas'ιidy are indebted each to the other. In the interval it would seem our
                    traveller had gained that personal acquaintance with Fars and Susiana, and that
                    knowledge of the books of the Persians, of which he speaks in his writings. Once
                    more turning eastward he was at Cambay in 915-16, and soon after at Saimιir.
                    Hence he pushed on to Ceylon and sailed to Madagascar, returning to Omân in
                    916—17. In the introduction to the <hi rend="italic">Meadows</hi> he seems also
                    to say that he had journeyed as far as China. A northern journey carried Mas'ùdy
                    as far as the Caspian Sea. In 926 he was at Palestine, where his curiosity, not
                    limited by religious prejudice, led him to visit the Christian church and
                    describe its relics. In 943-44 he made a careful study of the ruins of Antioch,
                    and subsequently proceeded to Basra. In the same year he composed the <hi

                    in Syria and Egypt. His last work, <hi rend="italic">The Indicator and
                    Monitor,</hi> was written 345 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.,</hi> and his death took
                    place in Egypt the same year (956-57 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi><note

                    Mas⅛dy did not pass beyond the lines of commercial enterprise among the Moslems
                    of those days, when Trâk was not unjustly held to be the centre of the world,
                    and the arms, the trade, and the religion of Islâm penetrated to the remotest
                    parts of Asia and Africa. But Mas'ùdy did not travel for gain. His object was to
                    study with his own eyes the peculiarities of every land, and to collect whatever
                    was of interest for archaeology, history, and manners. Singularly free from
                    bigotry—he was himself a Mo'tazilite, one of the heretical sect, as they were
                    reckoned, who held the doctrine of man’s free will— he was ready to derive
                    information even from the writings of infidel Persians or of a Christian
                    bishop.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the <hi
                    rend="italic">Meadows,</hi> iii. 69, he tells us that at Fostat (Ohl Cairo), in
                    336 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>, there fell into his hands a chronicle (now
                    lost) by Godmer, bishop of Gironne, which he uses for his narrative.</p></note>
                    In the range of his observations and the naive uncritical honesty with which he
                    records them he has naturally suggested comparison with Herodotus, and so
                    competent a judge as Ibn Khaldιin gives him the title of imâm of Eastern
                    historians, an epithet precisely parallel to that borne by Herodotus among the
                    historians of the West. The parallel, however, must be taken with great
                    deductions. Of the <hi rend="italic">Meadows,</hi> the work by which Mas'ιidy is
                    chiefly known, by far the greater part is an historical compilation, enlivened
                    indeed in some parts by personal recollection of places and the like, but mainly
                    drawn from a vast mass of earlier books<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    of Eastern history. Even in the earlier cosmographical chapters the author’s
                    vast and miscellaneous reading, which included the Arabic translations of
                    Ptolemy and other Greek writers, is mingled with his original observa-tιons<pb

                    characteristic of men of prodigious acquisitive power; and the presentation of

                    history, as it appeared to the Moslem, fall short of the epic interest of the

                <p>Mas'tidy lias himself sketched his literary activity in the opening chapter of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Meadows</hi> and in his last book <hi rend="italic">The

                    the whole cosmographical and geographical science of his age. These works are
                    lost or known only by fragments, but we possess an abridgment in the author’s
                    third great work <hi rend="italic">The Meadows of Gold and Mines of Precious
                    Stones,</hi> of which there are many MSS. in European libraries. It was printed
                    by Barbier de Meynard with a French translation, 9 vols. 8vo, Paris, 1861-77,
                    and at Bιilakin 1867 (2 vols, folio). The first volume of an English translation
                    by Sprenger appeared at London in 1841; but the work was not continued. The
