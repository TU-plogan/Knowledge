                    rend="smallcaps">Henri</hi> (1763-1817), one of the most remarkable composers of
                    France, was born at Givet, in Ardennes, on the 24th of June 1763. His father
                    being too poor to give him a regular musical education, his first ideas of art
                    were derived from a poor blind organist of Givet; yet such was his aptitude
                    that, when ten years old, he was appointed organist of the convent of the
                    Récollets. In 1775 an able German musician and organist, Wilhelm Hauser, was
                    engaged for the monastery of Lavaldieu, a few miles from Givet, and Méhul became
                    his occasional pupil. In his sixteenth year he was taken to Paris by a military
                    officer, and placed himself under Edelmann, a good musician and harpsichord
                    player. His first attempts at instrumental composition in 1781 did not succeed,
                    and he therefore turned his attention to sacred and dramatic music. The great
                    composer Gluck received him kindly, and gave him advice in his studies. After
                    various delays and disappointments during his efiorts for six years to obtain,
                    at the Grand Opera, a representation of his <hi rend="italic">Cora el
                    Alonzo,</hi> he offered to the Opéra Comique his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Euphrosine</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Coradin,</hi> which,
                    being accepted and performed in 1790, at once fixed his reputation. The critics
                    acknowledged in it great energy of dramatic expression, and much brilliant
                    instrumentation, but objected to a general want of graceful melody,—a strange
                    complaint, since his style is far more refined than that of either Hérold or
                    Auber. His opera of <hi rend="italic">Stratonice</hi> had great success. After
                    several other operas which did not succeed, his <hi rend="italic">Adrien</hi>
                    appeared, and added much to his fame, which was still further increased by his
                    three best works, <hi rend="italic">Le jeune</hi><hi rend="italic">Henri,
                    Uthal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Joseph,</hi> the finest of the series. He had
                    been appointed one of the four inspectors of the Paris Conservatory, but that
                    office made him feel continually the insufficiency of his early studies, a want
                    which he endeavoured to remedy by incessant application. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Timoleon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ariodant,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Bion</hi>
                    followed <hi rend="italic">Stratonice,</hi> with various success. <hi
                    rend="italic">Uthal</hi> can scarcely be expected to live, since, by desire of
                    Napoleon Bonaparte, it was written for an orchestra without violins. <hi
                    rend="italic">Epicure</hi> was composed by Méhul and Cherubini jointly; but the
                    superiority of the latter was evident. Méliul’s next opera, <hi rend="italic">E
                    Irato,</hi> failed. After writing forty-two operas, besides a number of songs
                    for the festivals of the republic, cantatas, and orchestral pieces of various
                    kinds, his health gave way, from an affection of the chest, which terminated his
                    life on the 18th of October 1817.</p>
