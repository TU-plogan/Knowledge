                <p><label type="entry">MANDLA</label>, a district in the chief commissionership of
                    the Central Provinces, India, lying between 22° 14' and 23° 22' N. lat., and
                    between 80° and 81° 48' E. long., is bounded on the N.E. by Rewah state, on the
                    S.E. by Bilâspur, on the S.W. by Balaghat, and on the W. by Seoni and Jabalpur.
                    It has an area of 4719 square miles, and the headquarters are at Mandla town.
                    The district consists of a wild highland region, broken up by the valleys of
                    numerous rivers and streams. In the lower valleys there is abundance of rich
                    black cotton soil, while in the less favoured valleys a light friable soil is
                    found. The Nerbudda river flows through the centre of the district, receiving
                    several tributaries which take their rise in the Maikal Hills, a range densely
                    clothed with <hi rend="italic">sdl</hi> forest, and forming part of the great
                    watershed between eastern and western India. The loftiest mountain is
                    Chauràdadar, about 3400 feet high. Tigers and wild beasts abound, and the
                    proportion of deaths caused by wild animals is greater in Mandla than in any
                    other district of the Central Provinces.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 disclosed a population of 213,018 (males, 110,473; females,
                    102,545). The aboriginal or hill tribes number more strongly in Mandla than in
                    any other district of the Central Provinces, the Gonas being alone returned at
                    113,306. Mandla town, with a population of 4936, is the only place in the
                    district with upwards of. 2000 inhabitants. Of the total area of 4719 square
                    miles, 556 were returned in 1881 as cultivated, and 2530 as cultivable. In the
                    same year 54,431 acres were devoted to the production of rice, and 75,196 to
                    wheat, while other food grains occupied 199,062 acres. Fibres and sugar-cane are
                    produced in considerable quantities. The magnificent <hi rend="italic">sdl</hi>
                    forests which formerly clothed the highlands of the district have suffered
                    greatly from the nomadic system of cultivation practised by the hill tribes, who
                    cut down and burn the wood on the hill-sides, and sow their crops in the ashes.
                    Of late years, however, measures have been taken to prevent further damage to
                    the forests. The only local manufacture consists in the weaving of coarse cotton
                    cloth. The total gross revenue of the district in 1881 was returned at £21,398,
                    of which £8999 was derived from the land. There are 46 Government and aided
