                    (1663-1730), a scholar to whom we are largely indebted for the preservation of
                    the old Icelandic literature, was born in the west of Iceland in 1663. In his
                    youth he resided for a time at Hvamm, then the residence of his mother’s father,
                    Ketil the priest, who was a well-known copyist of manuscripts. In 1683 he came
                    to Copenhagen, and was employed by Bartholinus at first as a, copyist, and
                    afterwards to investigate the monuments and ancient customs of Norway. In 1697
                    he was appointed secretary of the archives of the kingdom. Before this he had
                    begun to collect Icelandic manuscripts, his earliest acquisition <hi
                    rend="italic">(Hulda)</hi> being in 1687. From that time he steadily persevered,
                    but his great acquisitions were chiefly made in Iceland, whither he went in
                    connexion with the royal survey in 1702-12. The old and important manuscripts
                    were by that time falling into neglect, and it is more than probable that
                    without Arni’s intervention the greater part would have been lost to us. On his
                    return from Iceland he was appointed professor of history and Danish antiquities
                    in the university of Copenhagen. He is said never to have recovered the shock
                    caused by the mischief done to his library by the great fire of Copenhagen in
                    1728. He himself had never the courage to ascertain exactly what he had lost;
                    but it appeared afterwards that scarcely any MS. of real importance had
                    perished. On his death on 6th January 1730, he bequeathed his property to the
                    university of Copenhagen for the purpose chiefly of publishing Icelandic
                    manuscripts (Arna-Magnaean Bequest). The first volume published under the
                    bequest was <hi rend="italic">Njala,</hi> which appeared in 1772, and was
                    succeeded by a number of valuable publications of the same class. Arni left
                    behind him no literary work of any consequence, and his notes and historical
                    material were mostly destroyed in the conflagration. The signal service which he
                    rendered to Icelandic literature lay in his judicious and extensive collection
                    of the old manuscripts, and investigation of their history so far as attainable,
                    at a time when they were rapidly being superseded and disappearing through
                    neglect</p>
