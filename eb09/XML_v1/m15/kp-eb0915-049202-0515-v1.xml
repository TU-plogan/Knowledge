                <p><label type="entry">MANN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Horace</hi></label>, one of the
                    best-known of American educationists, was born at Franklin, Massachusetts, May
                    4, 1796, and died at Yellow Springs, Ohio, August 2, 1859. His childhood and
                    youth were passed in great poverty. “It was the misfortune of his family that it
                    belonged to the smallest district, had the poorest schoolhouse, and employed the
                    cheapest teachers, in a town which was itself small and poor.” His health was
                    early injured by hard manual labour, which left him no time for recreation
                    either in summer or winter. He lost his father at the age of thirteen. He was
                    from his childhood an eager reader; but his only means of gratifying this desire
                    was a very small library in his native town. Up to the age of fifteen he had
                    never been able to attend school for more than eight or ten weeks in any one
                    year. He remained at home, working for his mother and the rest of the family,
                    till the age of twenty. At that age he was taught the rudiments of Latin and
                    Greek and a little English grammar by an itinerant schoolmaster, and entered the
                    junior classes in Brown University in the year 1816. Symptoms of consumption,
                    poverty, the necessity of supporting himself while at college, and other
                    circumstances interfered with his studies. He, however, graduated in 1819. In
                    1821 he entered the school of law at Litchfield, Connecticut, and was called to
                    the bar in 1823. In 1827 he was elected to the State legislature of
                    Massachusetts, and in 1833 he was returned to the upper house. He suggested and
                    organized the State lunatic asylum of Worcester. In 1837 the legislature
                    appointed a board of education to revise and reorganize the common school system
                    of the State; and Mann was appointed secretary. To give his whole time to the
                    work, he gave up his profession and also his seat in the senate. He was
                    secretary for twelve years. For these twelve years he worked fifteen hours a

                <p>conventions, gave lectures, and carried on an enormous correspondence. He started
                    a periodical, <hi rend="italic">The Common School Journal,</hi> in which he
                    explained his views on education. He also published a series of <hi
                    rend="italic">Annual Reports;</hi> these American critics call “a classic on the
                    subject.” His seventh annual report gave the substance of his observations in
                    Europe, and compared the systems of instruction followed in Prussia with those
                    in use in Massachusetts, much to the disadvantage of the latter.<note

                <p>In 1848 Mann was elected to Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the death of
                    John Quincy Adams. He tried to induce the Government to establish a bureau of
                    education at Washington, but this was not done till much later. He resigned his
                    seat in Congress in 1853, and became the first president of Antioch College, at
                    Yellow Springs,—a college for the combined education of men and women. Mann’s
                    chief work in American education is the reform which he brought about in the
                    common and normal school system of Massachusetts; and this reform is largely due
                    to his twelve annual reports.</p>
                <p>Mann’s other works are— <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Education,</hi> 1848; <hi
                    rend="italic">A Few Thoughts for a Young Man,</hi> 1850; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Slavery, Letters and Speeches,</hi> 1851; <hi rend="italic">Powers and Duties
                    of Women,</hi> 1853, &amp;c. A complete edition of his writings, with a
                    biography, was published in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1867; and a selection,
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Thoughts Selected from the Writings of
                    Horace Mann,</hi> in 1869.</p>
