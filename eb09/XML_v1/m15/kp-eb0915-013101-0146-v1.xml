                    books of this name are included among the Apocrypha of the English Bible, as
                    they had formerly been in the Vulgate, and were accepted as canonical by the
                    council of Trent. A third book is usually included in editions of the
                    Septuagint, and is found in common with books iv. and v. in the Syriac, but
                    never took a place in Latin Bibles; a fourth is found in some MSS. of the
                    Septuagint (including the Sinaitic and Alexandrian—the Vatican does not contain
                    the Maccabee books) and also in MSS. of Josephus, and has been printed in both
                    connexions.</p>
                <p>1 <hi rend="italic">Maccabees</hi> was originally written in Hebrew, as appears,
                    not only from the testimony of Jerome <hi rend="italic">{Prol. Calf,</hi> who
                    had seen the Hebrew text, but from internal evidence. Josephus, however, already
                    used the Greek, <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> and no trace of the Semitic
                    original survives except the problematical title recorded by Origen <hi
                    rend="italic">{ap.</hi> Eus., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> vi. 25). <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 3</hi></p>
                <p>The book gives the history of the national movement in Judaea from the accession
                    of Antiochus Epiphanes (175 B.c.) to the murder of Simon (135 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> in a plain and honest style, and evidently from
                    good information. When the book was written there already existed a history of
                    the reign or high priesthood of John Hyrcanus, to which the author refers for
                    the continuation of his narrative. On the other hand, the friendly tone in which
                    he always speaks of the Romans seems to justify the inference that he wrote
                    before 63 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi><hi rend="superscript smallcaps">
                    4</hi></p>
                <p>2 <hi rend="italic">Maccabees,</hi> covering the history from 176 B.c. to the
                    victory over Nicanor (160 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> is much inferior in
                    value. It begins with two epistles which are certainly forgeries, and then
                    proceeds to the task of summarizing in one book the five books of a certain
                    Jason of Cyrene on the war of liberation against Antiochus Epiphanes. The
                    narrative is a useful supplement to that in the first book, but is not nearly so
                    trustworthy, and can never claim the preference where the two are in conflict.
                    Geiger has shown that in 2 Maccabees the history is coloured and distorted by
                    sympathy with the Pharisees, who became the bitter enemies of the Hasmoneans <hi

                <p>3 <hi rend="italic">Maccabees</hi> records a persecution of the Alexandrian Jews
                    by Ptolemy IV. Philopator, with the ultimate repentance of the tyrant. It is
                    quite unliistorical, and the local feast of the Alexandrian Jews, of which it
                    professes to explain the origin (vi. 36), is connected by Josephus <hi
                    rend="italic">{Cont. Ap.,</hi> ii. 5) with an event that took place under
                    Ptolemy Physcon. Ewald’s conjecture that the story contains a hidden reference
                    to the emperor Caius <hi rend="italic">{Gesch,,</hi> iv. 611 <hi rend="italic"
                    >sq.~)</hi> has found considerable favour. It seems strange that this book
                    should ever have found entrance in Christian circles. It had, however,
                    considerable acceptance in the Eastern Church.</p>

                    sovereignty of reason,” was ascribed to Josephus by Eusebius and Jerome. This
                    opinion is now given up, and nothing certain can be said of its origin. It is a
                    not uninteresting specimen of a Jewish philosophical theme composed under Stoic
                    influence. The author illustrates the sovereignty of pious reason over the
                    passions by historical examples, and is thus led to give anecdotes from the time
                    of the Maccabees.</p>
                <p>.Fritzsche’s edition of the Apocrypha (1871) is the best, and contains the four
                    books of Maccabees. Grimm’s commentary on 1 Mac. appeared in 1853, on the other
                    three books in 1857. There is also a commentary on 1 Mac. by Keil, 1875. On 4
                    Mac. there is an elaborate study by Freudenthal, <hi rend="italic">Die Fl.
