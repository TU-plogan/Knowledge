                <p><label type="entry">MAGISTRATE</label>. The term magistrate, derived from the
                    Latin <hi rend="italic">magistratus,</hi> is one of more general and
                    comprehensive meaning than <hi rend="smallcaps">Justice of the Peace,</hi> which
                    has already been treated of (vol. xiii. p. 789), and is of far higher antiquity.
                    In its full significance it indicates one side of the universal public relation
                    by which men are connected together as governors and governed—in other words, as
                    magistrates and people. Of magistrates some are supreme, in whom the sovereign
                    power and executive government of the state reside, as the king or queen
                    regnant, or the president of a republic, as of the United States; and such a
                    functionary would formally be designated the first magistrate of the realm or
                    state. Speaking generally, a magistrate may be described as a public civil
                    officer invested with legal or other authority; but the term is more
                    particularly applied to subordinate officers, as justices of the peace and the
                    like, deriving their authority solely from the chief of the state or in virtue
                    of legislative enactment. During the Roman republic the offices of magistrate
                    and judge were distinct and separate. A magistrate was appointed <hi
                    rend="italic">cum</hi><hi rend="italic">jurisdictione et imperio</hi>; to a
                    judge belonged only <hi rend="italic">nuda notio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sine</hi><hi rend="italic">jurisdictione</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">impemo.</hi> The office of the magistrate was to inquire into
                    matters of law; and whatever business was transacted before him was said to be
                    done <hi rend="italic">in jz&lt;,re.</hi> The office of the judge was to inquire
                    into matters of fact; and whatever was transacted before him was said to be done
                    <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi rend="italic">judicio.</hi> This distinction is
                    thus clearly defined by Cicero in his well-known oration for Cluentius :—“Legum
                    ministri, magistratus; legum interpretes, judices.” When the magistrate took
                    cognizance both of the law and the fact he was said to administer justice <hi

                    and the judgment so administered was called extraordinary. The magistrate, when
                    he decided on matters of law, was assisted by a council of ten, called <hi
                    rend="italic">decemviri</hi><hi rend="italic">litibus judicandis.</hi> To these
                    was added in important cases another council of one hundred and five persons,
                    selected from each tribe, whose judgment was final; this was called <hi
                    rend="italic">judicium</hi><hi rend="italic">centumvirale.</hi> After the
                    decline of the Roman republic the offices of magistrate and judge were united,
                    by which means all judgments became extraordinary, and the distinction of what
                    was done <hi rend="italic">injure</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">judicio</hi> was abolished. The magistrates were chosen only from
                    the patricians in the early republic, but in the course of time the plebeians
                    shared in these honours. The chief magistrates of Athens were designated
                    archons. They were nine in number, and none were chosen but such as were
                    descended from ancestors who had been free citizens of the republic for three
                    generations. They took an oath that they would observe the laws, administer
                    justice with impartiality, and never suffer themselves to <pb break="no"

                    malefactors with death. The chief among them was called archon, and the year
                    took its designation from him,—the <hi rend="italic">archon epoηymus,</hi> who
                    was also constituted a sort of state protector of those who were unable to
                    defend themselves. The Franks, Lombards, and Saxons appear to have been jealous
                    of judicial authority, and averse to removing what concerned a man’s private
                    right out of the hands of his neighbours and equals; every ten families are
                    supposed to have had a magistrate of their own election, the tything man of
                    England, the decanus of France and Lombardy. The decanus was the lowest species
                    of judge.</p>
