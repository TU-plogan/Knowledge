                    (1769-1833), soldier, diplomatist, administrator, and author, was born at
                    Burnfoot of Esk, near Langholm, Dumfriesshire, Scotland, on May 2, 1769. At the
                    age of twelve he received a cadetship in the Indian army, and in April 1783 he
                    landed at Madras, shortly afterwards joining his regiment at Vellore. In 1792,
                    having for some time devoted himself to the study of Persian, he was appointed
                    to the staff of Lord Cornwallis as Persian interpreter, but two years afterwards
                    was compelled by ill-health to leave for <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0348-0327"/> England. On his return to India in 1796 he became
                    military secretary to Sir Alured Clarke, commander-inchief at Madras, and
                    afterwards to his successor General Harris; and in 1798 he was appointed by Lord
                    Wellesley assistant to the resident at Hyderabad. In the last-mentioned capacity
                    he highly distinguished himself by the manner in which he gave effect to the
                    difficult measure of disbanding the French corps in the pay of the nizam. In
                    1799, under the walls of Seringapatam, began his intimacy with Colonel Arthur
                    Wellesley, which in a short time ripened into a life-long friendship; in the
                    course of the same year he acted as first secretary to the commission appointed
                    to settle the Mysore government, and before its close he was appointed by Lord
                    Wellesley to proceed as envoy to the court of Persia for the purpose of
                    counteracting the policy of the French by inducing that country to form a
                    British alliance. Arriving at Teheran in December 1800, he was successful in
                    negotiating favourable treaties, both political and commercial, and returned to
                    Bombay by way of Baghdad in May 1801. He now for some time held the interim post
                    of private secretary to Lord Wellesley, and in 1803 was appointed to the Mysore
                    residency. At the close of the Mahratta war, in 1804, and again in 1805, he
                    negotiated important treaties with Sindhia and Holkar, and in 1806, besides
                    seeing the arrangements arising out of these alliances carried out, he directed
                    the difficult work of reducing the immense body of irregular native troops. In
                    1808 he was again sent on a mission to Persia, but circumstances prevented him
                    from getting beyond Bushire.; on his reappointment in 1810, he was successful
                    indeed in procuring a favourable reception at court, but otherwise his embassy,
                    if the information which he afterwards incorporated in his works on Persia be
                    left out of account, was (through no fault of his) without any substantial
                    result. He sailed for England in 1811, and shortly after his arrival in the
                    following year was knighted. His intervals of leisure he devoted to literary
                    work, and especially to the composition of a <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Persia,</hi> which was published in two quarto volumes in 1815. On his return to
                    India in 1817 he was appointed by Lord Moira his political agent in the Deccan,
                    with eligibility for military command; as brigadier-general under Sir T. Hislop
                    he served against the Mahrattas and Pindharis, and took a distinguished part in
                    the victory of Mehidpur (December 21, 1817), as also in the subsequent work Of
                    following up the fugitives, determining the conditions of peace, and settling
                    the country. In 1821 he returned once more to England, where he remained until
                    1827, when he was appointed to the Bombay government. His influence in this
                    office was directed to the promotion of various economical reforms and useful
                    administrative measures. Leaving India for the last time in 1830, he shortly
                    after his arrival in England entered parliament as member for Launceston, and
                    was an active opponent of the Reform Bill. He died of paralysis on May 30,
                    1833.</p>
