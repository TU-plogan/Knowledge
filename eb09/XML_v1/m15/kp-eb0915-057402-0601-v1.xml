                    >maralι,</hi> horse, and <hi rend="italic">scale,</hi> care-taker), in its
                    original signification a servant of the royal <hi rend="italic">manege^</hi> was
                    afterwards a title given in different countries to the holder of various high
                    offices, military and civil. In the time of Philip Augustus the commander of the
                    French forces was called the marshal of France. Under Francis I. the marshals of
                    France became two in number, under Henry III. four, and in the time of Louis
                    XIV. their number was raised to twenty. In England the marshal was a high
                    officer of state as far back as the 12th century. In the end of the 12th and
                    first half of the 13th century the office was conferred on the earls of
                    Pembroke, from whom it passed by female descent to the family of Bigod, earl of
                    Norfolk. The dignity of earlmarshal was afterwards held successively by the
                    Mowbrays, dukes of Norfolk, the Howards, dukes of Norfolk, and the earls of
                    Arundel and Norwich. Under a grant by Charles II. to.Henry Howard, earl of
                    Norwich, it has descended to and continues in the line of the existing dukes of
                    Norfolk. The marshal was in feudal times (in conjunction with the constable, a
                    still higher officer) the judge in the court of chivalry, which had cognizance
                    of questions of honour and dignity; and, when the king headed his army in
                    person, it was the marshal who selected the proper spot for the encampment of
                    each noble. The constable’s powers and duties were superseded in the reign of
                    Henry VIII.; but the earl-marshal is still the head of the Heralds’ College, and
                    appoints the officers of arms. In Scotland (an orthography resembling the French
                    maréchal being adopted) the office of marischal, probably introduced under David
                    I., became from the 14th century hereditary in the family of Keith. The Scottish
                    marischal became an earl under the designation of “earl-marischal” in 1458.
                    Marischal College in Aberdeen was founded and endowed by the munificence of
                    George, 5th earl-marischal. The dignity came to an end by the attainder of
                    George, 10th earl-marischal, in 1716. The military title of field-marshal was at
                    first borrowed by the Germans from the French <hi rend="italic">maréchal</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de champs·,</hi> and in the Thirty Years’ War it meant much what
                    quartermaster-general does now. It was not till last century that the word rose
                    in dignity so as to signify the highest military dignity except that of
                    commander-in-chief. It was adopted into the British military system from
                    Germany,—the first field-marshals being John, duke of Argyll, and George, earl
                    of Orkney, made so by George II. in 1736.</p>
