                <p><label type="entry">MEATH</label>, a maritime county of Ireland, in the province
                    of Leinster, is bounded E. by the Irish Sea, S.E. by Dublin, S. by Kildare and
                    King’s county, W. by Westmeath, N. W. by Cavan and Monaghan, and N.E. by Louth.
                    Its greatest length north and south is about 40 miles, and its breadth east and
                    west about 45 miles. The total area comprises 578,247 acres, or 904 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The county forms part of the great limestone plain that occupies the central
                    portion of Ireland. In some districts the surface is variegated by hills and
                    swells, which to the west reach a considerable elevation, although the general
                    features of a fine champaign country are never lost. The coast, which is low and
                    shelving, extends to about 10 miles, but there is no harbour of importance. The
                    Boyne, whose banks are specially beautiful, enters the county at its south-west
                    extremity, and flowing north-east to Drogheda divides it into two almost equal
                    parts. At Navan it receives the Blackwater, which flows south-west from Cavan.
                    The Boyne is navigable for barges as far as Navan, where a canal is carried to
                    Trim. The Royal Canal passes along the southern boundary of the county to
                    Dublin. There are no lakes of importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Climate and Agriculture.—</hi> The climate is genial and
                    favourable for all kinds of crops, there being less rain than even in the
                    neighbouring counties. The principal substratum is limestone, but there are some
                    districts of clay slate. Except a small portion occupied by the Bog of z∖llen,
                    the county is very verdant and fertile. The soil is principally a rich deep loam
                    resting on limestone gravel, but varies from a strong clayey loam to a light
                    sandy gravel.</p>
                <p>The total number of holdings in 1881 was 11,867, of which 1632 were less than 1
                    acre in extent, and 4300 between 5 and 15 acres. Only 93 were above 500 acres.
                    According to the agricultural statistics for 1881, the area of arable land was

                    1881 to 87,469, of whom 44,315 were males and 43,154 females. The principal
                    towns are Navan, 3873; Kells, 2822; and Trim, 1586. A portion of the
                    parliamentary borough of Drogheda, including 933 of the inhabitants, is also
                    within the county. The number of births in the county during the ten years
                    ending 3d March 1881 was 21,293, an average of 23’3 to every 1000 of the
                    population; of deaths 16,878, an average of 18‘4; of marriages 3165, an average

                <p><hi rend="italic">History and Antiquities.—</hi> According to Ptolemy, Meath was
                    originally inhabited by the Eblani, whose territory extended from the Boyne to
                    the Liffey. A district known as Meath, and including the present county of Meath
                    as well as Westmeath and Longford, with parts of Cavan, Kildare, and King’s
                    county, was in the 2d century formed by Tuathal into a kingdom to serve as
                    mensal land of the Ard Ré or over-king. Afterwards it was divided into
                    Oireamlιain, now known as Meath, and Eireamhain, which included the remainder of
                    the old kingdom. The district was frequently subject to invasions from the
                    Danes; they were totally defeated at Tara in 980. About 800,000 acres, including
                    all the present county of Meath, was granted by Henry II. to IIugh de Lacy.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable antiquarian remains are two round towers, the one at Kells,
                    and the other in the churchyard of Donoughmore, near Navan. At New Grange, near
                    Slane, there is an artificial cavern of a very peculiar construction. A large
                    rath on Tara hill was the meeting-place of the princes before the Danish
                    invasion, and the seat of a royal palace referred to in the well-known lines of
                    Moore. A stone on the top of the rath is supposed by some to be the stone of
                    destiny where the ancient monarchs of Ireland were crowned. Monastic buildings
                    were very numerous, among the more important ruins being those of Duleek, which
                    is said to have been the first ecclesiastical edifice in Ireland built of stone
                    and mortar; the extensive remains of Bective; and those of Clonard, where also
                    were a cathedral and a very famous college. Of the old fortresses, Trim Castle
                    on the Boyne still presents an imposing appearance. There are also many fine old
                    mansions.</p>
