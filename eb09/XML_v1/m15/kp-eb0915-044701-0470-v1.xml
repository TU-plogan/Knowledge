                    many legendary stories among the natives of the lands in which they occur. Among
                    these one of the most prevailing is that the Mammoth was, or still is, an animal
                    which passes its life habitually in burrows below the surface of the ground, and
                    which immediately dies if by any chance it comes into the upper air.</p>
                <p>The general characteristics of the animals of the order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Proboscidea,</hi> to which the Mammoth belongs, are given in the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> (p. 423). Its position is also there indicated as
                    a member of the most highly specialized section of the group of Elephants, that
                    called by Falconer <hi rend="italic">Euelephas,</hi> which also contains the
                    modern Asiatic species. Of the whole group it is in many respects, as in the
                    size and form of the tusks, and especially the characters of the molar teeth,
                    the farthest removed from the primitive Mastodon-like type, while its nearest
                    surviving relative, <hi rend="italic">E. indicus,</hi> has retained the slightly
                    more generalized characters of the Mammoth’s contemporaries of more southern
                    climes, <hi rend="italic">E.</hi><hi rend="italic">columbi</hi> of America, and
                    <hi rend="italic">E. armeniacus</hi> of the Old World, if, indeed, it can be
                    specifically distinguished from them.</p>
                <p>The tusks or upper incisor teeth were doubtless present in both sexes, but
                    probably of smaller size in the female. In the adult males they often attained
                    the length of from 9 to 10 feet measured along the outer curve. Upon leaving the
                    head they were directed at first downwards and outwards, then upwards and
                    finally inwards at the tips, and generally with a tendency to a spiral form not
                    seen in other species of Elephant. Different specimens, however, present great
                    variations in curve, from nearly straight to an almost complete circle.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly by the characters of the molar teeth that the various extinct
                    modifications of the Elephant type are distinguished. Those of the Mammoth (see
                    fig. 2) differ from the corresponding organs of allied species in (1) great
                    breadth of the crown as compared with the length, (2) the narrowness and
                    crowding or close approximation of the ridges, (3) the thinness of the enamel
                    and its straightness, parallelism, and absence of “crimping” as seen on the worn
                    surface, or in a horizontal section of the tooth. The molars, as in other
                    Elephants, are six in number on each side above and below, succeeding each other
                    from before backwards. Of these Dr Falconer gave the prevailing “ridge-formula”
                    (or number of complete enamelled ridges in each tooth) as 4, 8, 12, 12, 16, 24,
                    as in <hi rend="italic">E. indicus.</hi> Dr Leith Adams, working from more
                    abundant materials, has shown that the number of ridges of each tooth,
                    especially those at the posterior end of the series, is subject to very great
                    individual variation, ranging in each tooth of the series within the following
                    limits: 3 to 4, 6 to 9, 9 to 12, 9 to 15, 14 to 16, 18 to 27,—excluding the
                    small plates called “talons” at each end of the tooth. Besides these variations
                    in the number of ridges or plates of which each tooth is composed, the thickness
                    of the enamel varies so much as to have given rise to a distinction between a
                    “thick-plated” and a “thin-plated” variety, —the latter being most prevalent
                    among the specimens from the Arctic regions, and most distinctively
                    characteristic of the species. From the specimens with thick enamel plates the
                    transition to the other species or varieties mentioned above, including <hi
                    rend="italic">E. indicus,</hi> is almost imperceptible.</p>
                <p>The bones of the skeleton generally more resemble those of the Indian Elephant
                    than of any other known species, but the skull differs, in the narrower summit,
                    narrower temporal fossae, and more prolonged incisive sheaths, required to
                    support the roots of the enormous tusks. Among the external characters by which
                    the Mammoth was distinguished from either of the existing species of Elephant
                    was the dense clothing, not only of long coarse outer hair, but also of close
                    under woolly hair, of a reddish-brown colour, evidently in adaptation to the
                    colder climate which it inhabited. This character, for a knowledge of which we
                    are indebted to the well-preserved remains found in northern Siberia, is also
                    represented in the rude but <pb break="no"

                <p>The geographical range of the Mammoth was very extensive. There is scarcely a
                    county in England in which some of its remains have not been found either in
                    alluvial deposits of gravel or in caverns, and numbers of its teeth are from
                    time to time dredged up from the bottom of the sea by the fishermen who ply
                    their trade in the German Ocean, having been washed out of the water-worn cliffs
                    of the eastern counties of England. In Scotland and Ireland its remains are less
                    abundant, but they have been found in vast numbers at various localities
                    throughout the greater part of central Europe (as far south as Santander in
                    Spain and Rome), northern Asia, and the northern part of the American continent,
                    though the exact distribution of the Mammoth in the New World is still a
                    question of debate. It has not hitherto been met with in any part of Scandinavia
                    or Finland.</p>
                <p>In point of time, the Mammoth belongs exclusively to the post-Tertiary or
                    Pleistocene epoch of geologists, and it was undoubtedly contemporaneous with man
                    in France, and probably elsewhere. There is evidence to show that it existed in
                    Britain before, during, and after the glacial period.</p>
                <p>As before indicated, it is in the northern part of Siberia that its remains have
                    been found in the greatest abundance, and in quite exceptional conditions of
                    preservation. For a very long period there has been from that region a regular
                    export of Mammoth ivory in a state fit for commercial purposes, both eastward to
                    China and westward to Europe. In the middle of the 10th century an active trade
                    was carried on at Khiva in fossil ivory, which was fashioned into combs, vases,
                    and other objects, as related by Abd Ί Kâsim, an Arab writer of that period.
                    Middendorff reckoned that the number of tusks which have yearly come into the
                    market during the last two centuries has been at least a hundred pairs, and
                    Nordenskiöld from personal observation considers this calculation as probably
                    rather too low than too high. They are found at all suitable places along the
                    whole line of the shore between the mouth of the Obi and Behring’s Straits, and
                    the farther north the more numerous do they become, the islands of New Siberia
                    being now one of the most favourite collecting localities. The soil of Bear
                    Islands and of Liachoff Islands is said to consist only of sand and ice with
                    such quantities of Mammoth bones as almost to compose its chief substance. The
                    remains are not only found around the mouths of the great rivers, as would be
                    the case if the carcases had been washed down from more southern localities in
                    the interior of the continent, but are imbedded in the frozen soil in such
                    circumstances as to indicate that the animals had lived not far from the
                    localities in which they are now found, and they are exposed either by the
                    melting of the ice in unusually warm summers or by the washing away of the sea
                    cliffs or river banks by storms or floods. In this way the bodies of more or
                    less perfect animals, often standing in the erect position, with the soft parts
                    and hairy covering entire, have frequently been brought to light.</p>
