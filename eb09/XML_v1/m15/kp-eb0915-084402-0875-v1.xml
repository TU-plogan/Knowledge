                    Baron</hi></label>, an eminent Dutch geographer, was born at the Hague 20th May
                    1816, and died October 24, 1856. He traced his descent from an old Scotch
                    family, originally it is said of Hungarian extraction. Destined for the navy, in
                    which his grandfather had won distinction, Melvill imbibed a taste for
                    hydrography and cartography as a student under Pilaar in the college of
                    Medemblik, and he showed his capacity as a surveyor on his very first voyage to
                    the Dutch Indies (1835). In,1839 he wasagainin the East, and was now attached to
                    the hydrographical bureau at Batavia. With the assistance of the long-neglected
                    documents collected by the old company, he completed in wonderfully short time
                    his first great hydrographical work—a map of Java in five sheets, accompanied by
                    sailing directions (Amsterdam, 1842; 2d revised edition, 1849),—which was
                    received with great applause. Melvill remained in India till 1845 collecting
                    materials for his second great hydrographical work, the chart of the waters
                    between Sumatra and Borneo (two sheets, 1845 and 1846, revised edition of first
                    sheet 1847; compare the descriptive memoir in Tindal and <pb break="no"

                    his return to Holland Melvill was attached to the naval department with the
                    special charge of studying the history of the hydrography of the Dutch Indies.
                    He also undertook, in connexion with Von Siebold, the publication of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Moniteur des Indes,</hi> a valuable series of scientific papers,
                    mainly from his own pen, on the foreign possessions of Holland, which was
                    continued for three years. In 1850 Melvill returned to India as lieutenant of
                    the first class and adjutant to Vice-Admiral Van den Bosch; and after the
                    premature death of this commander he was again appointed keeper of the charts at
                    Batavia. He was one of the founders and for a time the president of the new
                    society for natural science (1850). In 1853 he obtained exemption from active
                    naval service that he might devote himself to a general atlas of the Dutch
                    Indies; and under the most unfavourable circumstances he prosecuted the task
                    with incredible energy. But he was not to see its completion. Just after he had
                    lost his young wife and new-born son he was called in 185G to be director of the
                    marine establishment of Onrust; 'and there he soon fell a victim to climate,
                    dying after much suffering in the hospital of Weltevreden, only forty years of
                    age. In spite of delays caused by the engraving of the maps in Holland, no fewer
                    than twenty-five sheets were already finished, but it was not till 1862 that the
                    whole plan, embracing sixty sheets, was ably brought to a close by
                    Lieutenant-Colonel W. F. Versteeg. The premature loss of Melvill was severely
                    felt not only in Holland but in foreign countries, where, as shown by his
                    connexion with the geographical societies of Paris, London, Berlin, and Bergen,
                    his labours were highly esteemed. His industry and energy were equalled only by
                    the benevolence and warmth of his heart. In 1843 he received the decoration of
                    the Netherlands Lion, in 1849 that of the Legion of Honour.</p>
