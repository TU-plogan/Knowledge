                    (1765-1832), publicist, historian, statesman, and philosopher, was born at
                    Aldourie, 7 miles from Inverness, in 1765. He came of old Highland families both
                    through his father and his mother. Of the former, who was an officer in the
                    army, and was mostly on duty abroad, he saw but little, and he spent his early
                    years under the care of his mother and her relatives. At a very early age young
                    James bore the reputation of a prodigy for multifarious reading and learning.
                    His schooling he received at Fortrose, whence he went in 1780 to college at
                    Aberdeen. As a student in the arts faculty there his reading extended far beyond
                    the bounds of the curriculum; but the influence that most powerfully formed his
                    mind was the companionship of Robert Hall, afterwards so famous as a pulpit
                    orator, with whom he ardently beat the usual round of vexed questions. In 1784
                    he proceeded for the study of medicine to Edinburgh, where he found a still more
                    congenial field for his opening mind, at a time when Hume had been dead just
                    eight years, while Adam Smith, Dr Black the father of chemistry, Dr Cullen,
                    Robertson, Ferguson, and other eminent men, were resident there. Mackintosh
                    participated to the full in the intellectual ferment, but did fiot quite neglect
                    his medical studies, and took his degree, though with characteristic
                    unpunctuality he kept the professors waiting for a considerable time on the
                    examination morning.</p>
                <p>In 1788 Mackintosh removed to London, then agitated by the trial of Hastings and
                    the king’s first lapse into insanity. He was much more interested in these and
                    other political events than in his professional prospects; and his attention was
                    specially directed to the events and tendencies which caused or preceded the
                    Revolution in France. In the year of his removal to London his father died, and
                    he succeeded to the family estate, which, being small and burdened, brought very
                    little income; and, as he made no headway in his profession, his financial
                    outlook was not very bright. It was under these circumstances that he wedded his
                    first wife Catherine Stuart. Yet his marriage was a happy event for him. His
                    wife’s prudence was a corrective to his own unpractical temperament, and his
                    efforts in journalism soon became fairly profitable. Mackintosh was soon
                    absorbed in the question of the time; and in April 1791, after long meditation,
                    he published his <hi rend="italic">Vindiciae Gallicae,</hi> a reply to Burke’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Reflections on the French Revolution.</hi> It was the only
                    worthy answer to Burke that appeared. It placed the author in the front rank of
                    European publicists at the age of twenty-five, and won him the friendship of
                    some of the most distinguished men of the time, including Burke himself. About
                    the same time he became honorary secretary of the association of the Friends of
                    the People. The success of the <hi rend="italic">Vindiciae</hi> finally decided
                    him to give up the medical for the legal profession. He was called to the bar in
                    1795, and gained a considerable reputation there as well as a tolerable
                    practice. During this period his greatest public efforts were his lectures
                    (1799) at Lincoln’s Inn on the law of nature and nations, of which the
                    introductory discourse was published, and his eloquent defence (1803) of Jean
                    Peltier, a French refugee, tried at the instance of the French Government for a
                    libel against the first consul. In 1804 he was created knight, and received the
                    post of recorder at Bombay, where he spent the next seven years of his life. The
                    spoilt child of London society was not at home in Bombay. He did seek to
                    interest himself in India, and in imitation of Sir William Jones founded the
                    Literary Society of Bombay; but the current literature of Europe was far more
                    engrossing than the old Indian life, and the packet with the latest tidings from
                    Europe and the newest development of the Napoleonic drama was infinitely more
                    interesting than either. In spite of his scholarly and historic sympathies, his
                    heart always was with the new era, and he was glad to return to England, where
                    he arrived in 1812. True to his old faith, he courteously declined the offer of
                    Perceval to resume political life under the auspices of the dominant Tory party,
                    though tempting prospects of office in connexion with India were opened up. He
                    entered parliament in the Whig interest as member for Nairn. He sat for that
                    county, and afterwards for Knaresborough, till his death. In London society, and
                    in Paris during his occasional visits, he was a recognized favourite for his
                    genial wisdom and his great conversational power. On Madame de Stael’s visit to
                    London he was the only Englishman capable of <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0915-0178-0161"/> representing his country in talk with that
                    phenomenal woman. His parliamentary career was marked by the same wide and
                    candid liberalism as his private life. He opposed the repressive and reactionary
                    measures of the Tory Government, supported and afterwards succeeded Romilly in
                    his efforts for reforming the criminal code, and took a leading part both in
                    Catholic emancipation and in the Reform Bill. But he was too little of a
                    partisan, too widely sympathetic and candid, as well as too elaborate, to be a
                    telling speaker in parliament, and was consequently surpassed by more practical
                    men whose powers were incomparably inferior. From 1818 to 1824 he was professor
                    of law and general politics in the East India Company’s College at
                    Haileybury.</p>
                <p>In the midst of the attractions of London society and of his parliamentary
                    avocations Mackintosh felt that the real work of his life was being neglected.
                    His great ambition was to write a history of England. His studies both in
                    English and foreign speculation led him to cherish the design also of making
                    some worthy contribution to philosophy. There is real pathos in the fact that it
                    was not till 1828, when he was sixty-three years of age, and even then only at
                    the instance of Macvey Napier, editor of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia
                    Britannica,</hi> that he set about the first task of his literary ambition. This
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Dissertation on the Progress of Ethical
                    Philosophy,</hi> prefixed to the seventh edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Encyclopaedia.</hi> The dissertation, written mostly in ill-health and in
                    snatches of time taken from his parliamentary engagements, was published in
                    1831. About the same time he wrote for the <hi rend="italic">Cabinet
                    Cyclopaedia</hi> a “History of England from the Earliest Times to the Final
                    Establishment of the Reformation.” His more elaborate <hi rend="italic">History
                    of the Revolution,</hi> for which he had made great researches and collections,
                    was not published till after his death. Already a privy councillor, Mackintosh
                    was appointed commissioner for the affairs of India under the Whig
                    administration of 1830. He died in 1832.</p>
                <p>Mackintosh was undoubtedly one of the most cultured and catholic-minded men of
                    his time. His studies and sympathies embraced almost every human interest,
                    except pure science. But it was the width of his intellectual sympathies joined
                    to a constitutional indecision and <hi rend="italic">vis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >inertiae</hi> that prevented him from doing more enduring work. Thus it was
                    that his actual achievements came so far short both of his real power and of the
                    promise given in his early efforts. The works of Mackintosh which have the best
                    claim to permanent value are the <hi rend="italic">Vindiciae Gallicae,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">Dissertation,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    English Revolution.</hi> Of the three the first is the greatest both in ability
                    and historical significance. It is the verdict of a philosophic Liberal on the
                    development of the French Revolution up to the spring of 1791, and is at the
                    same time a sympathetic estimate of its causes, principles, and tendencies.
                    While respectful to his great opponent, he is firm and manly in his assertion of
                    the rights and interests of man so deeply concerned in the Revolution. Its
                    excesses compelled him a few years after to express his entire agreement with
                    the opinions of Burke; but few will now deny that his early judgment was the
                    more correct. The <hi rend="italic">Dissertation</hi> is a sketchy and
                    fragmentary work, redeemed by catholic criticism and ingenious suggestion. It
                    was a great undertaking, for which half a lifetime would hardly have been
                    sufficient, attempted at a time when the study of the history of philosophy had
                    hardly been begun. Yet his suggestions as to the formation of conscience are
                    valuable. The <hi rend="italic">History of the Revolution in England</hi> in
                    1688, which is only a posthumous fragment of a long meditated history of England
                    beginning with the Revolution, is written in a style of calm and lofty
                    impartiality. It is wanting in colouring, in movement, in the concrete and
                    picturesque, and could never have been a popular history. It gives the history
                    only of three years (1685-88), breaking off at the point where William of Orange
                    is preparing to intervene in the affairs of England. The account of the early
                    career of the prince is a noble and striking piece of work, showing that, if the
                    author could have resisted the charms of society and applied himself resolutely
                    to historical composition, he might have achieved something really great iu that
                    department.</p>
