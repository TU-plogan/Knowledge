                    (1746-1818), a min∩r Scottish poet, born near Roslin, October 22, 1746, died at
                    Edinburgh, March 15, 1818. The son of an impoverished army captain, he spent
                    several years of his boyhood on a farm which his father had taken on the banks
                    of Loch Lomond, and was sent to Bristol at the age of fourteen to enter on a
                    mercantile career. Soon afterwards he was despatched to the West Indies, where
                    he remained many years without ever enjoying even a moderate prosperity. When
                    about forty he returned to Scotland with the intention of devoting himself to a
                    literary life, but his ill fortune still pursued him, and he was obliged to go
                    back to Jamaica. The kindness of two friends enabled him soon to come home again
                    to Scotland, and on the journey he finished <hi rend="italic">The Harp, a

                    narrative poem intended to show the deteriorating influences of whisky and
                    pothouse politics, which appeared in 1795, and at once made its author popular,
                    having passed through fourteen editions within the year. A sequel, <hi
                    rend="italic">The Ways of War,</hi> appeared next year, and in 1799 <hi
                    rend="italic">The Links of Forth, or a Parting Peep at The Carse of
                    Stirling,</hi> a somewhat feeble descriptive poem, intended as a parting tribute
                    to his kind host before his own departure for Jamaica. Not long after his
                    arrival an early friend settled on him an annuity of £100, which enabled the
                    poet to return soon afterwards to Scotland, and so close his long struggle
                    against adversity with fifteen years of comparative comfort at Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>In 1800 he published <hi rend="italic">The Memoirs of Charles Macpherson,
                    Esq.,</hi> a novel understood to be a close narrative of his own hardships and
                    adventures. His later works, which added little to his fame, were <hi
                    rend="italic">—The Pastoral or Lyric Muse of Scotland,</hi> 1809; two anonymous
                    works in verse entitled <hi rend="italic">Town Fashions, or Modern Manners
                    Delineated,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Byegone Times and Latecome Changes,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">The Scottish Adventurers,</hi> a novel. He left behind an
                    autobiography still unpublished, but of which an abstract appeared in <hi
                    rend="italic">Blackwood's Magazine</hi> for December 1818. A complete edition of
                    the poems he wished to own appeared in 1812, and it is on these that his fame
                    will rest. His songs, “Mary of Castlecary,” “Come under my plaidy,” “My boy,
                    Tammy,” “O tell me how for to woo,” “I lo’ed ne’er a lassie but ane,” “The plaid
                    amang the hether,” and “Jeanie’s black e’e,” will live, spite of Allan
                    Cunningham, for their sweetness and simplicity, while his <hi rend="italic">Will
                    and Jean,</hi> quite apart from its excellent intention and tendency, will
                    maintain a place among the most characteristic productions of the Doric Muse in
                    Scotland.</p>
