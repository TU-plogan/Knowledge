                    Bishop of Sherborne in the time of the Saxon heptarchy, was born about the
                    middle of the 7th century. He is said to have been the son of Kenred, brother to
                    Ina, king of the West Saxons; but, in the opinion of William of Malmesbury, his
                    father was no more than a distant relation to the king. Having received the
                    first part of his education in the school of Meildulf, a. learned Irish monk, he
                    travelled in France and Italy for his improvement. On his return home he studied
                    some time under Adrian, abbot of St Augustin’s in Canterbury, the most learned
                    professor of the sciences who had ever been in England. The fame of his learning
                    soon spread, not only in England, but in foreign countries. Learned men sent him
                    their writings for his criticism; among others, a son of the king of Scotland is
                    said to have sent his compositions to Aldhelm, “entreating him to give them the
                    last polish by rubbing off their Scotch rust.” He was the first Englishman who
                    wrote in the Latin language, both in prose and verse; and he composed a book for
                    the instruction of his countrymen on the prosody of that language. Bede says
                    that Aldhelm “was a man of universal erudition, having an elegant style, and
                    being wonderfully well acquainted with books both on philosophical and religious
                    subjects.” His Latin was in later times considered somewhat barbarous and
                    corrupt From one of his letters· to Hedda, bishop of Winchester, concerning the
                    nature of his studies whilst at Canterbury, he appears to have been
                    indefatigable in his endeavours to acquire every species of learning in his
                    power. For a copy of this curious epistle see Henry’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History,</hi> vol. ii. p. 320. King Alfred declared that Aldhelm was the best
                    of all the Saxon poets; and a favourite song, which was universally sung in his
                    time, nearly 200 years after its author’s death, was of his composition. He was

                    and refinement to his barbarous countrymen. After having governed the monastery
                    of Malmesbury, of which he was the founder, about thirty years, he was made
                    bishop of Sherborne, where he died in May 709.</p>
