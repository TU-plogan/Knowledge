                <p><label type="entry">ALMQVIST, <hi rend="smallcaps">Karl Jonas
                    Ludwig</hi></label>, one of the most extraordinary figures that the history of
                    literature can produce, was born at Stockholm in 1793. He began life under
                    highly favourable auspices; but becoming tired of a university career, he threw
                    up the position he held in the capital to lead a colony of friends to the wilds
                    of Werm-land. This ideal Scandinavian life soon proved a failure; Almqvist found
                    the pen easier to wield than the plough, and in 1829 we find him once more
                    settled in Stockholm. Now began his literary life; and after bringing out
                    several educational works, he made himself suddenly famous by the publication of
                    his great novel, <hi rend="italic">The Book of the Thorn-Rose.</hi> The career
                    so begun developed with extraordinary rapidity; few writers have equalled
                    Almqvist in productiveness and versatility; lyrical, epic, and dramatic poems;
                    romances; lectures; philosophical, aesthetical, moral, political, and
                    educational treatises; works of religious edification, studies in lexicography
                    and history, in mathematics and philology, form the most prominent of his
                    countless contributions to modern Swedish literature. So excellent was his
                    style, that in this respect he has been considered the first of Swedish writers.
                    His life was as varied as his work. Unsettled, unstable in all his doings, he
                    passed from one lucrative post to another, at last subsisting entirely on the
                    proceeds of literary and journalistic labour. More and more vehemently he
                    espoused the cause of socialism in his brilliant novels and pamphlets; friends
                    were beginning to leave him, foes beginning to triumph, when suddenly all minor
                    criticism was silenced by the astounding news that Almqvist, convicted of
                    forgery and charged with murder, had fled from Sweden. This occurred in 1851.
                    For many years no more was heard of him; but it is now known that he went over
                    to America, and under a feigned name succeeded in being appointed secretary to
                    Abraham Lincoln. After Lincoln’s death, Almqvist again fell under the ban of the
                    law; his MSS., including several unprinted novels, were confiscated and
                    destroyed, but he himself escaped to Europe, where under another alias he
                    continued to exist a short time longer. His strange and sinister existence came
                    to a close at Bremen in 1866. It is by his romances, un doubtedly the best in
                    Swedish, that his literary fame will mainly be supported; but his singular
                    history will always point him out as a remarkable figure even when his works are
                    no longer read. He was another Eugene Aram, but of greater genius, and so far
                    more successful that he escaped the judicial penalty of his crimes. <hi
