                    Scottish prelate, Archbishop of St Andrews, was born in the year 1543, in the
                    town of Perth, where he received the rudiments of his education. He afterwards
                    studied philosophy, and took his degree of master of arts at the University of
                    St Andrews. In 1564 he set out for Paris as tutor to the eldest son of Sir
                    William Macgill. In the month of June of the same year, Mary Queen of Scots
                    being delivered of a son, afterwards James VI. of Scotland and I. of England, Mr
                    Adamson <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n159/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0901-0159-0144"/> wrote a Latin poem, in which he gave the prince
                    the title of king of France and England. This proof of his loyalty involved him
                    in difficulties. The French court was offended, and ordered him to be arrested;
                    and he was confined for six months. He was released only through the
                    intercession of Queen Mary and some of the principal nobility, who interested
                    themselves in his behalf. As soon as he recovered his liberty, he retired with
                    his pupil to Bourges. He was in this city during the massacre at Paris; and the
                    same persecuting spirit prevailing among the Catholics at Bourges as at the
                    metropolis, he lived concealed for seven months in a public-house, the aged
                    master of which, in reward for his charity to heretics, was thrown from the
                    roof, and had his brains dashed out. Whilst Mr Adamson lay thus in his
                    sepulchre, as he called it, he wrote his Latin poetical version of the book of
                    Job, and his tragedy of Herod in the same language. In the year 1573 he returned
                    to Scotland, and, having entered into holy orders, became minister of Paisley.
                    In the year 1575 he was appointed one of the commissioners, by the General
                    Assembly, to settle the jurisdiction and policy of the church; and the following
                    year he was named, with Mr David Lindsay, to report their proceedings to the
                    Earl of Morton, then regent. About this time the earl appointed him one of his
                    chaplains; and, on the death of Archbishop Douglas, promoted him to the
                    archiepiscopal see of St Andrews. This gave rise to a protracted conflict with
                    the Presbyterian party in the Assembly. Soon after his promotion, he published a
                    catechism in Latin verse, dedicated to the king, a work highly approved even by
                    his enemies, who nevertheless still continued to persecute him with great
                    violence. In 1578 he submitted himself to the General Assembly, which procured
                    him peace but for a very little time; for, the year following, fresh accusations
                    were brought against him. A Provincial Synod was held at St Andrews in April
                    1586; the archbishop was here accused and excommunicated. He appealed to the
                    king and the states, but this availed him little. At the next General Assembly,
                    a paper being produced containing the archbishop’s submission, he was absolved
                    from the excommunication. In 1588 fresh accusations were brought against him.
                    The year following he published the Lamentations of the prophet Jeremiah in
                    Latin verse, which he dedicated to the king, complaining of his hard usage.
                    Towards the end of the same year he published a translation of the Apocalypse in
                    Latin verse, and a copy of Latin verses. The king was unmoved by his
                    application, and granted the revenue of his see to the Duke of Lennox, so that
                    the prelate and his family were literally reduced to the want of bread. During
                    the remaining part of his unfortunate life he was supported by charitable
                    contributions, and died in 1592. He had previously made a written recantation of
                    his alleged errors in regard to Episcopacy, though the genuineness of this is
                    doubted by Spottiswoode. (See Cunningham’s <hi rend="italic">Church History of
                    Scotland,</hi> vol. i.) The character of this prelate has been variously
                    represented, according to the sentiments of religion and politics which
                    prevailed. But there is little doubt that he encouraged and supported, under the
                    authority of the king, oppressive and injurious measures. The panegyric of the
                    editor of his works, Mr Wilson, is extravagant and absurd. He says that “he was
                    a miracle of nature, and rather seemed to be the immediate production of God
                    Almighty than born of a woman.”</p>
