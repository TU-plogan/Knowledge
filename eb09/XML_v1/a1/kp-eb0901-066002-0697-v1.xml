                    rend="italic">grisea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Ambre gris,</hi> or Grey Amber) is a
                    solid, fatty, inflammable substance of a dull grey or blackish colour, the
                    shades being variegated like marble, possessing a peculiar sweet earthy odour.
                    It is now known to be a morbid secretion formed in the intestines of the
                    spermaceti whale <hi rend="italic">(Physeter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >macrocephalus),</hi> and is found floating upon the sea, on the sea-coast, or
                    in the sand near the sea-coast. It is met with in the Atlantic Ocean, on the
                    coasts of Brazil and Madagascar; also on the coast of Africa, of the East
                    Indies, China, Japan, and the Molucca Islands; but most of the ambergris which
                    is brought to England comes from the Bahama Islands, Providence, &amp;c. It is
                    also sometimes found in the abdomen of whales, always in lumps in various shapes
                    and sizes, weighing from ½ oz. to 100 or more lb. A piece which the Dutch East
                    India Company bought from the King of Tydore weighed 182 lb. An American
                    fisherman from Antigua found, inside a whale, about 52 leagues south-east from
                    the Windward Islands, a piece of ambergris which weighed about 130 lb, and sold
                    for £500 sterling. Like many other substances regarding the origin of which
                    there existed some obscurity or mystery, ambergris in former times possessed a
                    value, and had properties attributed to it, more on account of the source from
                    which it was drawn than from its inherent qualities. Many ridiculous hypotheses
                    were started to account for its origin, and among others it was conjectured to
                    be the solidified foam of the sea, a fungoid growth in the ocean similar to the
                    fungi which form on trees, the excreta of sea-birds, &amp;c. The true source and
                    character of ambergris was first satisfactorily established by Dr Swediaur in a
                    communication to the Royal Society <hi rend="italic">(Philosophical
                    Transactions,</hi> vol. lxxiii.) It was found by Dr Swediaur that ambergris very
                    frequently contained the horny mandibles or beaks of the squid <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Sepia moschata),</hi> on which sperm whales are known to feed. That
                    observation, in connection with the fact of ambergris being frequently taken
                    from the intestines of the sperm whale, sufficiently proved that it was formed
                    within that creature, and not an extraneous substance swallowed by the whale. It
                    was further observed that the whales in which ambergris was found were either
                    dead or much wasted and evidently in a sickly condition. From this it was
                    inferred that ambergris was in some way connected with a morbid condition of the
                    sperm whale. Ambergris, when taken from the intestinal canal of the sperm whale,
                    is of a deep grey colour, soft consistence, and a disagreeable smell. On
                    exposure to the air it gradually hardens, becomes pale, and develops its
                    peculiar sweet earthy odour. In that condition its specific gravity ranges from
                    0∙780 to 0∙926. It melts at a temperature of about 145° Fahr. into a fatty
                    yellow resinous-like liquid; and at 212° it is volatilised into a white vapour.
                    It is soluble in ether, volatile and fixed oils, but only feebly acted on by
                    acids. By digesting in hot alcohol, a peculiar substance termed ambrein is
                    obtained, which deposits in brilliant white crystals as the solution cools. In
                    chemical constitution ambrein very closely resembles cholesterin, a principle
                    found abundantly in biliary calculi. It is therefore more than probable that
                    ambergris, from the position in which it is found and its chemical constitution,
                    is a biliary concretion analogous to what is formed in other mammals. The <pb

                    confined to perfumery, though it formerly occupied no inconsiderable place in
                    medicine. As a material of perfumery its price varies from 15s. to 25s. per
                    ounce; and in minute quantities its alcoholic solution is much used for giving a
                    “floral” fragrance to bouquets, washes, and other preparations of the perfumer.
                    It occupies a very important place in the perfumery of the East, and there it is
                    also used in pharmacy, and as a flavouring material in cookery. The high price
                    it commands makes it peculiarly liable to adulteration, but its genuineness is
                    easily tested by its solubility in hot alcohol, its fragrant odour, and its
                    uniform fatty consistence on being penetrated by a hot wire.</p>
