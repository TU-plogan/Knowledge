                <p><label type="entry">AIRAY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, D.D. This
                    celebrated Puritan president of Queen’s College, Oxford, was born at Kentmere,
                    near Windermere, but no record remains of the date of either birth or baptism.
                    Anthony à Wood names Westmoreland as his birthplace. In the well-known <hi
                    rend="italic">Life of Bernard Gilpin</hi> it is told that when he was making
                    preparations for martyrdom, he “received the account with great composure; and
                    immediately after called up <hi rend="italic">William Airay,</hi> a favourite
                    domestic, who had long served him as his almoner and steward.” From the great
                    kindness shown to our Airay by Gilpin, and from the vicinity of Kentmere to the
                    Rectory, it does not appear to be hazarding too much to assume that this William
                    Airay was his father, and that the family tradition is right in assigning
                    Kentmere, not Barton or Wilford, as his birthplace. The truly apostolic man’s
                    bounty showed itself in sending Henry and a (probable) brother Ewan or Evan to
                    his own endowed school, where they were fully educated “in grammatical
                    learning,” and were in attendance at Oxford when Gilpin lay a-dying. From the
                    <hi rend="italic">Athenae</hi> we glean the details of Array’s college
                    attendance. He was “sent,” says Wood, “to St Edmund’s Hall in 1579, aged
                    nineteen or thereabouts.” “Soon after,” he continues, “our author, Airay, was
                    translated to Queen’s College, where he became <hi rend="italic">pauper
                    puer</hi><hi rend="italic">serviens;</hi> that is, a poor serving child that
                    waits on the fellows in the common hall at meals, and in their chambers, and do
                    other servile work about the college.” His transference to Queen’s College is
                    explained by its having been Gilpin’s own college, and by his Westmoreland
                    origin giving him a claim on Eaglesfield’s foundation. He proceeded B.A. on June
                    19, 1583. On June 15, 1586, he passed M.A.; B.D. in 1594; and D.D. on June 17,
                    1600—all in Queen’s College. “About the time he was master” (1586), “he entered
                    holy orders, and became a frequent and zealous preacher in the university.” His
                    Commentary on the Epistle to the Philippians (1618), reprinted 1864, is a
                    specimen of his preaching before his college, and of his fiery denunciation of
                    Popery, and his fearless enunciation of. that Calvinism which Oxford, in common
                    with all England, prized then. In 1598 he was chosen provost of his college, and
                    in 1606 was vice-chancellor of the university. In the discharge of his
                    vice-chancellor’s duties, he came into conflict with Laud, who even thus early
                    was betraying his Romish tendencies. He was also rector of Otmore (or Otmoor),
                    near Oxford, a living which involved him in a trying litigation, whereof present
                    incumbents reap the benefit. He died on 6th October 1616. His character as a
                    man, preacher, divine, and as an important ruler in the university, will be
                    found portrayed in the Epistle by Potter, prefixed to the <hi rend="italic"

                    Puritans— possessed of a robust common-sense in admirable contrast with some of
                    his contemporaries. <hi rend="italic">{Lectures on the whole Epistle of Paul to
