                <p><label type="entry">AIR-ENGINE</label>. Engines which have for their working
                    fluid heated air instead of steam are called “air-engines.” The name “caloric
                    engine” has also been applied to them, but is not to be commended, for they have
                    no more right to that title than steam-engines—the useful effect of both
                    machines being due to the transformation of heat into mechanical energy, the air
                    in the one case and the steam in the other being merely convenient media through
                    which to effect that transformation.</p>
                <p>The utilisation of the expansion of heated air for driving an engine has for many
                    years been a subject which has exercised the ingenuity of inventors. The history
                    of air-engines has, however, been little more hitherto than a history of
                    failures, and they are as far now from superseding steam-engines as they were
                    fifty years ago. This is owing mostly to the fact that the inventors have too
                    often worked empirically, without any real knowledge of the conditions under
                    which, and under which only, the real advantages of the fluid could be attained,
                    and have therefore continually violated these conditions. There are also certain
                    constructive difficulties in the way of making a successful air-engine which
                    have never been fully overcome. It should be distinctly understood that,
                    regarded simply as a medium for transforming heat into work, air possesses <hi
                    rend="italic">no</hi> advantage over steam or any other fluid. Its advantage is,
                    that it can be used with safety at much higher temperatures than steam (and
                    therefore a larger proportion of the heat given to it can be transformed into
                    work), and that by employing the gases of combustion in the cylinder much heat
                    can be utilised which with steam-engines is necessarily wasted.</p>
                <p>Of the air-engines which have actually worked we have— (1.) Those in which the
                    changes of temperature take place at a pair of constant volumes; (2.) those in
                    which the changes of temperature take place at a pair of constant pressures; and
                    (3.) those in which heat is received and rejected at a pair of constant
                    pressures. The first two classes, fitted with “economisers,” are in theory
                    “perfect” engines; that is, they are theoretically capable of transforming into
                    work the largest fraction the limits of temperature allow of the heat received
                    from the fuel. The third class are not perfect engines, but possess certain
                    practical advantages which will be afterwards mentioned.</p>
                <p>The well-known engine invented by the Rev. Dr Stirling in 1816, and subsequently
                    improved by him, in conjunction with his brother, Mr James Stirling, C.E., of
                    Edinburgh, belongs to the first class. In this engine the same mass of air is
                    used again and again, and is compressed at starting to a pressure of 7 to 10
                    atmospheres. A cylindrical air-receiver, in which a plunger can be moved up and
                    down, is placed over the flue of the furnace. The annular space between the
                    plunger and the sides of this receiver is occupied by an immense number of thin
                    sheets of metal, which form the “economiser.” In the upper part of the receiver,
                    which communicates freely with one end of a working cylinder of the usual
                    construction, is a “refrigerator,” consisting of a coil of tubing through which
                    cold water continually circulates. The plunger is alternately raised and lowered
                    by suitable mechanism, and in its motion causes the great body of air in the
                    machine to occupy alternately the bottom or heating end and the top or cooling
                    end of the receiver. It thus undergoes alternate expansion and contraction, and
                    thereby gives motion to the piston of the working cylinner, and thence to a
                    crank shaft in the usual way. The advantages of this engine were, that the air
                    in the cylinder was always cool, and that the great pressure which could be used
                    rendered the size of the machine for a given power very moderate. It was
                    ultimately abandoned because of the failure of the receiver to stand the
                    destructive action of the heat.</p>
                <p>The most familiar example of the second class of air-engines is that invented by
                    Captain Ericsson. It differed from Stirling’s in many respects, and does not
                    seem in any one particular to have been an improvement on it. Fresh air was
                    drawn from the atmosphere at every stroke, and a very low pressure used, and
                    what was the receiver in Stirling’s engine became the working cylinder of
                    Ericsson’s. It was thus excessively bulky in proportion to its power, and all
                    the working parts were exposed to the destructive action of intense heat. It is
                    chiefly interesting on account of the enormous scale on which its construction
                    was actually carried out. The engines of the steamship “Ericsson” had four
                    working cylinders, each 14 ft. in diameter, with other parts in proportion. The
                    trials of this vessel were conducted in a manner which did not allow any
                    confidence to be placed in the results said to be obtained, and steam - engines
                    replaced those of Ericsson within two years.</p>
                <p>To the third class of air-engines belong those of Sir George Cayley and several
                    of the older inventors. The best known modern example is, however, the engine of
                    Mr Philander Shaw, which is shown in our engraving, and which was exhibited at
                    the Paris Exhibition of 1867. The most important feature of this type of engine
                    is the use of the products of combustion themselves, instead of merely the air
                    heated by them, to drive the piston. The construction of the engine is very
                    simple: the working piston is fitted with a trunk on its upper side, which, thus
                    reduced in area, serves as a compressing pump, and the products of combustion
                    act directly upon its under side, which is protected by a large drum filled with
                    non-conducting material from the heat. The furnace stands beside the cylinder,
                    and is entirely closed up, means being provided for feeding it with fuel without
                    allowing any air to enter. The air compressed by the pump is delivered into the
                    furnace, where it combines with the fuel to form the gases of combustion, and in
                    this way receiving additional heat, expands, and raises the piston of tho
                    working cylinder for a portion of its stroke. The admission-valve of the latter
                    is then closed, and the gases expand, without addition of heat, until the piston
                    has completed its stroke, and are then discharged into the atmosphere. By the
                    addition of an “economiser,” the efficiency of this type of engine may be very
                    greatly increased; but its principal advantage is that, by actually using the
                    products of combustion inside the engine, much heat is saved which in other
                    engines is unavoidably sent up the chimney and lost.</p>
                <p>One of the principal features of all air-engines is the “economiser” (sometimes
                    erroneously called the “regenerator”), an invention of Mr Stirling’s. The object
                    of this apparatus is to store up the heat rejected by the fluid when it falls in
                    temperature, and subsequently to raise the temperature of the fluid by
                    re-storing the same heat, so that the only heat which the furnace has to supply
                    is the latent heat of expansion, together with the amount of sensible heat which
                    may be lost through the imperfection of the economiser.</p>
