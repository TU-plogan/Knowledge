                    surnamed <hi rend="italic">Flaccus,</hi> an eminent ecclesiastic and a reviver
                    of learning in the 8th century, was born in Yorkshire about 735 (died 804). He
                    was educated at York under the direction of Archbishop Egbert, as we learn from
                    his own letters, in which he frequently calls that prelate his beloved master,
                    and the clergy of York the companions of his youthful studies. He succeeded
                    Elbert as director of the seminary, and in later life modelled after it his
                    famous school at Tours. He survived Bede about seventy years; it is therefore
                    hardly possible that he could have received any part of his education under him,
                    as some writers of literary history have affirmed; and it is worthy of
                    observation that he never calls Bede his master, though he speaks of him with
                    the highest veneration. It is not well known to what preferments he had attained
                    in the church before he left England, though some say he was abbot of
                    Canterbury. He was sent to Rome by Eanbald, the successor of Ethelbert, to
                    procure the <hi rend="italic">pallium,</hi> and, in returning, at Parma he met
                    Charlemagne,, who, as Alcuin had already visited the French court, was no
                    stranger to his extraordinary merit. The emperor contracted so great an <pb

                    urged and at length induced him to take up his residence at court and become his
                    preceptor in the sciences. Alcuin accordingly instructed Charlemagne and his
                    family in rhetoric, logic, mathematics, and divinity. He particularly
                    distinguished himself by his writings in defence of the orthodox faith against
                    the adoptionists, Felix, bishop of Urgel, and Elipandus, archbishop of Toledo,
                    convincing the former of his error after a six days’ debate at Aix-la-Chapelle
                    (799), and treating the latter in the most conciliatory manner; and on more than
                    one occasion he was employed in important missions between Charlemagne and Offa,
                    king of Mercia. “France,” says one of our best writers of literary history, with
                    some degree of truth, “is indebted to Alcuin for all the polite learning it
                    boasted of in that and the following ages. The universities of Paris, Tours,
                    Fulden, Soissons, and many others, owe to him their origin and increase, those
                    of which he was not the superior and founder being at least enlightened by his
                    doctrine and example, and enriched by the benefits he procured for them from
                    Charlemagne.” Alcuin, it is alleged, however, forbade the reading of the
                    classical poets. In 790 he went to England in the capacity of ambassador, and
                    returned to France in 792, never again to visit his native land. After Alcuin
                    had spent many years in the most intimate familiarity with the greatest prince
                    of his age, he at length, in 801, with great difficulty, obtained leave to
                    retire from court to the abbey of St Martin at Tours, of which he had been
                    appointed the head by Charlemagne in 796. Here he remained and taught till his
                    death in 804. In his retirement he kept up a constant correspondence with
                    Charlemagne, which displays, on the part of both, an ardent love of learning and
                    religion, and great zeal and earnestness in contriving and executing noble
                    designs for their advancement. Alcuin composed many treatises on a great variety
                    of subjects, in a style much superior in purity and elegance to that of most
                    writers of the age in which he flourished. His works were collected and
                    published by Duchesne, in 1 vol. folio, Paris, 1617: a better edition is that of
                    Froben, 2 vols. folio, Ratisbon, 1777. They consist of (1) Tracts upon
                    Scripture; (2) Tracts upon doctrine, discipline, and morality; (3) Historical
                    treatises, letters, and poems. It is not improbable that Alcuin was the writer
                    of the famous <hi rend="italic">Caroline Books,</hi> issued under the name of
                    Charlemagne, which denounced as idolatrous every form of image-worship. A Life
                    of Alcuin, by Lorenz, was published at Halle in 1829, and appeared in an English
                    translation, by Slee, in 1837.</p>
