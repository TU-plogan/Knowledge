                <p><label type="entry">ANJOU</label>, one of the thirty-six ancient provinces of
                    France, approximately equivalent to the modern department of Maine and Loire. It
                    was bounded on the N. by Maine, which separated it from Normandy; E. by
                    Touraine; S. by Poitou; and W. by Brittany. It was, as Mr Freeman has remarked,
                    altogether lacking in geographical individuality, and owed its somewhat
                    prominent position in history to the character and fortunes of its counts and
                    dukes. By the ancient chronicler of Anjou the origin of the countship is
                    referred to a certain Tertullus, who owed his elevation from an humble rank to
                    Charles the Bald; but the first person history lays hold of is Ingelgar, who
                    lived about 870, and obtained possession of that portion of the subsequent
                    province which lies between the Maine and the Mayenne. He was followed in
                    succession by Fulk the Bed (888); Fulk the Good (938), author of the proverb
                    that an unlettered king is a crowned ass; Geoffrey Grisegonelle, or Grey-Tunic
                    (958); Fulk Nerra, or the Black, famous as a warrior, and on account of his
                    pilgrimages, by way of penance, to the Holy Sepulchre; Geoffrey Martel, a
                    vigorous but unsuccessful opponent of William the Conqueror; his nephews,
                    Geoffrey the Bearded and Fulk Bechin, from the latter of whom we have an
                    interesting historical fragment, giving an account of his ancestors and
                    defending his own conduct (D’Achéry, <hi rend="italic">Spicilegium,</hi> folio
                    edition, vol. iii.); Fulk Nerra II.; and Geoffrey Plantagenet, who united Anjou
                    and Maine, and —by his marriage with Matilda of England—Normandy also into one
                    dominion. When his son became (1154) king of England, as Henry IL, these various
                    provinces passed into the power of the English crown, but were forfeited by King
                    John (1204) to Philip Augustus of France. Henry III. demanded restitution, but
                    did little in support of his demand; and Anjou soon passed into the hands of
                    Philip, son of Louis VIII., and from him to Charles, the brother of Louis, who
                    by his exploits in Italy made the name of Charles of Anjou famous, and
                    established the house of Anjou on the throne of Naples (1266-1285). His son,
                    Charles II., king of Naples, nicknamed <hi rend="italic">il</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Zoppo,</hi> or the Lame, gave the investiture of Anjou and Maine
                    to his son-in-law, Charles of Valois, younger son of Philip the Bold; and from
                    1290 the counts of Valois took the title of. dukes of Anjou and counts of Maine.
                    In 1328 the son of Charles of Valois became king of France, as Philip VI., and
                    united the duchy of Anjou to the crown. King John in 1356 bestowed it on his son
                    Louis. The Anjou line ended in the unfortunate Bené (noticed below), who was
                    deprived of his duchy by Louis XI. of France, or, more strictly, in his brother
                    Charles, who died in 1481. Meanwhile old Bené’s daughter Margaret, who was made
                    of sterner stuff than her father, was battling with more than a woman’s valour
                    for the rights of her son in England. From this time onward the title of duke of
                    Anjou has been borne, without implying any territorial sovereignty, by Charles
                    VIII. of France, by each of the four sons of Henry II., by the second son of
                    Henry IV,, by the two sons of Louis XIV., by his grandson (Philip V. of Spain),
                    and by his great-grandson (Louis XV.) Charles, a nephew of Charles of Naples,
                    obtained the throne of Hungary in 1308, and was succeeded by his son Louis the
                    Great, who also became king of Poland; but the same fatality of failure in the
                    male line also befell this branch of the house of Anjou. (See Freeman’s <hi
