                <p><label type="entry">ARSON</label> has been defined as the malicious and wilful
                    burning of the house of another, and is at common law an offence of the degree
                    of felony. Some part of the house must be actually burnt; a bare intention or
                    attempt will not constitute the offence, but the burning of any part, however
                    trifling, is sufficient. The burning must be malicious and wilful. If a man by
                    wilfully setting fire to his own house bum the house of his neighbour also, it
                    will be felony. The word <hi rend="italic">house,</hi> in the definition of the
                    offence at common law, extends not only to dwelling-houses, “but to all
                    out-houses which are parcel thereof, though not adjoining thereto.” Barns, with
                    corn and hay in them, though distant from a house, are within the
                    definition.</p>
                <p>The different varieties of the offence are specified in the statute 24 and 25
                    Vict. c. 97 (Malicious Injuries to Property Act). The following crimes are
                    thereby made felonies :—(1.) Setting fire to churches or other places of divine
                    worship; (2.) Setting fire to a dwelling-house, any person being therein; (3.)
                    Setting fire to a house, outhouse, manufactory, farm-building, &lt;fcc., with
                    intent to impose and defraud any person; (4.) Setting fire to buildings
                    appertaining to any railway, port, dock, or harbour; or, (5.) Setting fire to
                    any public building. In these cases the Act provides that the person convicted
                    shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to be kept in penal servitude
                    for life, or for any term not less than three years (now <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jive</hi> years by the 27 and 28 Vict. c. 47), or to be imprisoned for any time
                    not exceeding two years, with or without hard labour, and with or without
                    solitary confinement, and, if a male under sixteen years of age, with or without
                    whipping. Setting fire to other buildings, and setting fire to goods in
                    buildings in such circumstances that, if the same were thereby set on fire, the
                    offence would be felony, are subject to the punishments last enumerated, with
                    this exception, that the period of penal servitude is limited to fourteen years.
                    The attempt to set fire to any building, or any matter or thing (as in last
                    offence), is to be punished in the same way. So also is the crime of setting
                    fire to crops of hay, grass, corn, &amp;c., but setting fire to stacks of the
                    same, or any cultivated vegetable produce, or to peat, coals, &lt;fcc., is
                    regarded as a more serious offence, and the penal servitude may be for life. For

                    seven years. Setting fire to mines is visited with the full measure of penalty,
                    and in the case of the attempt, the penal servitude is limited to fourteen
                    years. Setting fire, or attempting to set fire to ships is punishable by the

                <p>In Scotland the offence, equivalent to arson in England, is known by the more
                    expressive name of wilful fire-raising. The later statutes cited above do not
                    apply to Scotland, where the crime is punishable capitally by old consuetudinary
                    law. The public prosecutor has the privilege, as in other such cases, of
                    declining to demand capital punishment, and invariably does so.</p>
