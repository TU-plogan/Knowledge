                    rend="smallcaps">Friederich,</hi> a historian and Prussian statesman, one of the
                    family of French Protestant refugees noticed above, was born at Berlin, 3Oth
                    April 1766, and died there, 19th April 1837. Descended from a family of divines,
                    he early selected the ecclesiastical profession, and studied theology first at
                    Berlin and then at Geneva. Shortly after finishing his course he was appointed
                    minister to the French community at Berlin, as well as professor of history in
                    the military academy, and he attracted attention even at court by the eloquence
                    of his style. In 1793 he visited Switzerland and, a few years after, France, the
                    details of his journeys and observations being published on his return. He was a
                    frequent and able contributor to the literary journals of the period, and in
                    1801 appeared as the author of <hi rend="italic">Literary and Philosophical
                    Miscellanies,</hi> revealing a shrewd, philosophic cast of mind. Ancillon took
                    rank among the most famous historians of his day by his next work, <hi
                    rend="italic">A Picture of Political Revolutions in Europe since the</hi>
                    15&lt;A <hi rend="italic">Century,</hi> which gained him the eulogium of the
                    Institute of France, and admission to the Royal Academy of Berlin. It is
                    unfortunate that this work was never finished, for it is one of the ablest and
                    most philosophical on the sulject. The merits of Ancillon were not overlooked.
                    He was appointed tutor to the prince royal of Prussia and his cousin in 1806, by
                    Frederic William III., and received various appointments from the Government. In
                    1814 he accompanied the princes to Paris, and there became acquainted with
                    Guizot, De Broglie, and other persons of eminence. After completing the term of
                    his office as tutor, he was attached to the department of foreign affairs, and
                    made a counsellor of state. He took an active part in many diplomatic
