                <p><label type="entry">APPEAL</label>, in its usual modern sense, is the act by
                    which a decision is brought for review from an inferior to a superior court In
                    Roman jurisprudence it was used in this and in other significations; it was
                    sometimes equivalent to prosecution, or the calling up of an accused person
                    before a tribunal where the accuser appealed to the protection of the magistrate
                    against injustice or oppression. The derivation from the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >appello,</hi> naturally shows its earliest meaning to have been an urgent
                    outcry or prayer against injustice. Hence it inferred a superior power capable
                    of protecting against petty tyranny. In its meaning of seeking a higher tribunal
                    for recourse against a lower, it does not seem to have been a characteristic of
                    the Republic, where the magistrate was generally supreme within his sphere, and
                    those who felt themselves outraged by injustice threw themselves on popular
                    protection by <hi rend="italic">provocatio,</hi> instead of looking to redress
                    from a higher official authority. The Empire, however, introduced grades of
                    jurdisdiction, and the ultimate remedy was an appeal to the emperor; thus Paul,
                    when brought before Festus, appealed unto Caesar. It must be understood that the
                    appeal was actually dealt with by a supreme judge representing the emperor, not
                    by the emperor in person. In the Corpus Juris, the appeal to the emperor is
                    called indiscriminately <hi rend="italic">appellatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >provocatio.</hi> A considerable portion of the 49th book of the Pandects is
                    devoted to appeals; but little of the practical operation of the system is to be
                    deduced from the propositions there brought together.</p>
                <p>The ecclesiastical hierarchy, and the gradations of the feudal system, naturally
                    afforded scope in the Middle Ages for appeals from the lower to the higher
                    authority. In matters ecclesiastical, including these matrimonial, testamentary,
                    and other departments which the church ever tried to bring within the operation
                    of the canon law, there were various grades of appeal, ending with the Pope. The
                    European princes in general struggled against this assumption of authority by
                    the court of Rome, and it was the source of many contests between the
                    ecclesiastical and the regal power.</p>
                <p>It became customary for ambitious sovereigns to encourage appeals from the courts
                    of the crown vassals to themselves as represented by the supreme judges, and
                    Charlemagne usually enjoys the credit of having set the example of this system
                    of centralisation, by establishing <hi rend="italic">missi dominici.</hi> The
                    great vassals, however, sought recourse against the decisions of the royal
                    courts in their own order, embodied as the great council or parhament of the
                    nation, and hence arose the appeal to the House of Lords as the court of last
                    resort.</p>
                <p>When the progress of civilisation and the art of self-government render judges no
                    longer amenable to the charge of tyranny or fraud, an appellate system changes
                    its character and objects. It in some measure certainly tends to preserve that
                    judicial integrity which renders it unnecessary as the immediate refuge of the
                    persecuted suitor. But its ostensible object is the preservation of uniformity
                    in the law. The attainment of this object renders it unfortunately necessary, in
                    such a country as ours, that no tribunal shall give, in the first instance, in
                    any important question, a decision which is not open to appeal. The process has
                    the double advantage, that it has a tendency to bring every legal difficulty
                    ultimately to one tribunal, where a uniformity of principle may be expected in
                    the application of the law, and, at the same time, stimulates the exertions of
                    the subordinate judge, who knowing that his proceedings will be revised, is
                    careful to bring them as close as he can to those uniform principles of law,
                    which he knows that the court of appeal</p>
