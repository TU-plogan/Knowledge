                <p><label type="entry">ATHENAeUS</label>, a Greek rhetorician and grammarian, or man
                    of letters, was a native of Naucratis, a town in Egypt, near the mouth of the
                    Nile. Exceedingly little is known of his life, but from one or two references to
                    known events which occur in his works it may be gathered that he flourished
                    about the end of the 2d and the beginning of the 3d century <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a.d.</hi> Besides a history of the Syrian kings, and a small tract on the
                    identification of the <hi rend="italic">thratta,</hi> a peculiar kind of fish,
                    mentioned by the comic poet Archippus, both of which are lost, he wrote the
                    extensive work, in fifteen books, called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deipnosophistoe,</hi><hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> the Feast of the Learned, or,
                    as it may be translated, the Skilled in Feasting. The first two books, and parts
                    of the third, eleventh, and fifteenth, are only extant in epitome, but otherwise
                    we seem to possess the work entire. It is an immense store-house of
                    miscellaneous information, largely but not exclusively on matters connected with
                    the table, and full of quotations from writers whose works have not come down to
                    us. It has been calculated that nearly 800 writers and 2500 separate writings
                    are referred to by Athenaeus; and he boasts of having read 800 plays of the
                    Middle Comedy alone. Of many writers we have no remains, save the excerpts given
                    by him; and a glance at any collection of Greek fragments will show how large is
                    the proportion drawn solely from this source. The plan of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >.Deipnosophistoe</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Λα</hi> exceedingly cumbrous,
                    and is badly carried out. It professes to be an account given by the author to
                    his friend Timocrates of a banquet held at the house of Laurentius, a wealthy
                    patron of art. It is thus a dialogue within a dialogue, after the manner of
                    Plato, but a conversation of sufficient length to occupy several days (though
                    represented as taking place in one) could not be conveyed in a style similar to
                    the short conversations of Socrates. Among the twenty-nine guests whose remarks
                    Athenaeus reports are Galen and Ulpian, a lawyer, supposed to be the famous
                    jurist. Their conversation ranges from the dishes before them to literary
                    matters of every description, including points of grammar and criticism; and the
                    guests are expected to bring with them extracts from the poets, which are read
                    aloud and discussed at table. The whole is but a clumsy apparatus for displaying
                    the varied and extensive reading of the author. As a work of art it can take but
                    a low rank, but as a repertory of fragments and morsels of information it is
                    invaluable. The text, particularly in the quotations from the minor comic poets,
                    is still in a very corrupt state.</p>
