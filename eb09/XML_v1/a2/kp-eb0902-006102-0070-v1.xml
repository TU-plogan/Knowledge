                    in the county of Dumfries, situated on the riper Annan, nearly two miles from
                    the Solway Firth, and about fifteen from Dumfries. It iβ a well-built town,
                    containing a town hall, a.parish church, several dissenting chapels, and an
                    excellent academy. The river Annan which has been embanked, is navigable for
                    vessels of 300 tons up to within half a mile of the town, and for vessels of 60
                    tons to the bridge, a fine structure of three arches built in 1824. Annan is a
                    station on the G. and S.-W. Railway, and is connected with the main line of the
                    Caledonian Railway, and also with England, by the Solway Junction branch which
                    crosses the firth by means of a very strong viaduct. The principal manufactures
                    are cotton, ropes, and cured hams; shipbuilding and salmon fishing are also
                    carried on, while there is a considerable trade w ith England, the chief exports
                    being cured hams, cattle, sheep, and grain. The town, which is governed by a
                    provost and fourteen councillors, including three bailies, unites with Dumfries,
                    Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben, and Sanquhar, in returning one member to parliament.
                    In 1871 the population of the royal burgh was 4174, of the parliamentary,
                    3172.</p>

                    Lanark, Peebles, and Selkirk. About two miles beyond Moffat it receives two
                    large tributaries, —-the Moffat Water, which flows westward from Loch Skene, a
                    mountain lake in the north-eastern corner of Dumfriesshire, and the Evan Water,
                    which flows eastward from the upper part of Lanarkshire. The Annan has a total
                    length of about 40 miles, and below its junction with the Moffat and the Evan it
                    is joined by the Kennel Water from the west and the Dryfe Water from the east.
                    Annandale was once the name of a stewartry which comprehended a large portion of
                    Dumfriesshire.</p>

                    situated on the Severn, about 2 miles from its mouth in Chesapeake Bay, and
                    about 25 in a direct line from Washington, with which it is connected by
                    railway. It is a neat, regularly-built place, but the trade which at one time
                    seemed likely to enrich it has been transferred almost entirely to Baltimore,
                    and Annapolis is now little more than the political capital of the state. It
                    contains handsome Government buildings, a college, and the United States Naval
                    Academy, which was established at Annapolis in 1845, and was for a time removed
                    to Newport, Rhode Island. Providence, as Annapolis was first called, was founded
                    in 1649, but it did not get a charter until 1708, when it also received its
                    present name in honour of Queen Anne. It has been the seat of government since
                    1689. Population in 1870, 5744.</p>
