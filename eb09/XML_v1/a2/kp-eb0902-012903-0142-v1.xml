                <p><label type="entry">ANTINOMIANS</label> (αντί, against, and νό/ios, law), a term
                    first employed by Luther as a designation of the followers of John Agricola, who
                    maintained that the moral law was not binding, as such, upon Christians (see <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Agricola,</hi> J <hi rend="smallcaps">ohannes).</hi> In this,
                    as in many other cases, however, the thing existed long before the name. From
                    the 1st century of the Christian era downwards, there have been those who, on
                    one ground or other, denied that the law was of use or obligation under the
                    gospel dispensation, and the term Antinomian is, accordingly, applied with
                    sufficient propriety to many who lived at an earlier date than the sect or
                    school to describe whom Luther invented it. It would seem, from several passages
                    in the New Testament (Rom. iii. 8, 31, vi. 1; Eph. V. 6; 2 Pet. ii. 18, 19), in
                    which the apostles warn their followers against perversions of their doctrine as
                    an excuse for licentiousness, that Antinomianism, in its grosser form, found a
                    place even in the primitive church. It is to be noticed that this first
                    manifestation of the heresy seems to have been due to the same cause as that
                    which operated in the case of Agricola,—a mistaken interpretation of the
                    doctrine of justification by faith. The Gnostic sects, several of whom are
                    classed as Antinomian, seem to have <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n143/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0902-0143-0130"/> proceeded on the principle, that being spiritual
                    their nature could not be corrupted whatever their moral conduct might be.
                    Gnostic Antinomianism seems; therefore, to have been in this'respect analogous
                    to that of the High Calvinists, some of whom went so far as to maintain that an
                    elect person did not sin -even when he committed actions in themselves wicked.
                    Such were the Antinomians in England during the Protectorate. A doctrine so
                    extreme, and sanctioning so unmistakably an immoral life, is to be carefully
                    distinguished from the Antinomianism combated by Luther, which was a matter of
                    theory not necessarily affecting conduct. It is not easy to apprehend or to
                    state with clearness the precise views of Agricola as to the relation between
                    the Christian and the moral law. His own statements were more than once modified
                    or retracted in the course of discussion, and there can be no doubt that Luther
                    made him responsible for opinions which he did not hold. The exaggeration
                    characteristic of all controversies seems to have prevailed ’in this case to an
                    unusual extent on both sides, and neither disputant should always be taken
                    literally at his word, whether he speaks for himself or for his opponent. It was
                    probably a desire to establish Luther’s negation of the Roman Catholic doctrine
                    of good works on some firm ground of principle, that first led Agricola to
                    insist as he did on the essential incompatibihty between the law and the gospel.
                    The law of Moses, he taught, was for the Jews alone, and was not a rule of life
                    to Christians, who might with safety altogether neglect it. On the other hand,
                    he never denied that the Christian was under a moral government, with an
                    adequate sanction, which laid him under obligation to lead a holy life. What he
                    maintained was that the New Testament furnished all that was.necessary for
                    impulse and guidance in the path of Christian duty, hot in the form of positive
                    precepts so much as of principles and motives. Thus explained, the difference
                    between the orthodox and Agricola’s· party reduces itself within a comparatively
                    narrow compass, though, after the fullest explanation, it remains a real
                    difference and a standing subject of controversy.</p>
