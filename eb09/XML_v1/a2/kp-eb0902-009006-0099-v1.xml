                    Hyacinthe</hi></label>, an eminent Oriental scholar, brother of the subject of
                    the preceding article, was bom at Paris 7th Dec. 1731. He was a distinguished
                    student at the university of that city, and at first intended to enter the
                    church; but his taste for Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, and other languages of the
                    East, developed into a passion, and he discontinued his theological course to
                    devote himself entirely to them. His diligent attendance at the Royal Library,
                    and his ardour in the prosecution of his favourite studies, attracted the
                    attention of the keeper of the manuscripts, the Abbé Sallier, whose influence
                    procured for him a small salary as student of the Oriental languges. He had
                    scarcely received this appointment, when, lighting on some manuscripts in the
                    Zend, he formed the project of a voyage to India, with the view of discovering
                    the works of Zoroaster. Seeing no other means of accomplishing his plan, he
                    enlisted as a common soldier on the 7th of November 1754, in the Indian
                    expedition which was about to start from the port of L’Orient. His friends
                    procured his discharge; and the minister, affected by his romantic zeal for
                    knowledge, granted him a free passage, a seat at the captain’s table, and a
                    salary, the amount of which was to be fixed by the governor of the French
                    settlement in India. After a passage of nine months, Anquetil landed, on the
                    10th of August 1755, at Pondicherry. Here he remained a short time to master
                    modern Persian, and then hastened to Chandemagore, to acquire Sanscrit. Just
                    then war was declared between France and England; Chandemagore was taken; and
                    Anquetil resolved to return to Pondicherry by land. The journey was one of a
                    hundred days, and he had many adventures and suffered many hardships by the way.
                    He found one of his brothers at Pondicherry, and embarked with him for Surat;
                    but, with the view of exploring the country, he landed at Mahe, and proceeded on
                    foot. At Surat he succeeded, by perseverance and address in his intercourse with
                    the native priests, in acquiring a sufficient knowledge of the languages to
                    enable him to translate the dictionary called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vedidad-Sade,</hi> and some other works. Thence he proposed going to <pb

                    sacred laws of the Hindus; but the capture of Pondicherry obliged him to quit
                    India. Returning to Europe in an English vessel, he spent some time in London
                    and Oxford, and then set out for France. He arrived in Paris in May 1762,
                    without fortune or the desire of acquiring it, but esteeming himself rich in the
                    possession of one hundred and eighty Oriental manuscripts, besides other
                    curiosities. The Abbé Barthélémy procured for him a pension, with the
                    appointment of interpreter of Oriental languages at the Royal Library. In 1763
                    he was elected an associate of the Academy of the Belles Letters; and began to
                    arrange for the publication of the materials he had collected during hie Eastern
                    travels. In 1771 he published in three vols. 4to, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Zend-Avesta,</hi> containing collections from the sacred writings of the
                    Persians, a life of Zoroaster, and fragments of works ascribed to that sage. The
                    work was a very important accession to our stores of Oriental literature. Sir
                    John Malcolm <hi rend="italic">(Hist, of Persia,</hi> vol. i. p. 193, note)
                    refers to the <hi rend="italic">Zend-Avesta</hi> as the most authentic source of
                    information on the religion and institutions of the great Persian legislator. In
                    1778 he published his <hi rend="italic">Législation Orientale,</hi> in which he
                    controverted the system of Montesquieu, and endeavoured to prove that the nature
                    of Oriental despotism had been greatly misrepresented. His <hi rend="italic"
                    >Recherches Historiques et Géographiques sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ιlnde</hi>
                    appeared in 1786, and formed part of Thieffenthaler’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geography of India.</hi> The Revolution seems to have greatly affected him.
                    During that period he abandoned society, and shut himself up in literary
                    seclusion. In 1798 he published in 2 vols. 8vo, <hi rend="italic">Hinde</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">Rapport</hi><hi rend="italic">avec
                    l'Europe,</hi> a work remarkable for its invectives against the English, and its
                    numerous misrepresentations. In 1804 he published in 2 vols. 4to, a Latin
                    translation from the Persian of the <hi rend="italic">OupnePhat</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Upanischada, i.e.,</hi> secrets which must not be revealed. It is
                    a curious mixture of Latin, Greek, Persian, Arabic, and Sanscrit. (See <hi
                    rend="italic">Ed. Rev.,</hi> voL i. pp. 412-421). On the reorganisation of the
                    Institute, Anquetil was elected a member, but soon afterwards gave in his
                    resignation. He died at Paris 17th January 1805. Besides the works named above,
                    he was the author of several others on subjects connected with the history and
                    antiquities of the East. See <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle;</hi><hi
