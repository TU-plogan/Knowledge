                    (1804-1851), one of the great mathematicians of the present century, was born at
                    Potsdam, of Jewish parentage, December 10, 1804. He studied at Berlin
                    university, where he obtained the degree of doctor of philosophy in 1825, his
                    thesis being an analytical discussion of the theory of fractions. In 1827 he
                    became “extraordinary” and in 1829 “ordinary” professor of mathematics at
                    Königsberg; and this chair he filled till 1842, when he visited Italy for a few
                    months to recruit his health. On his return he removed to Berlin, where he lived
                    as a royal pensioner till his death, February 18, 1851. His investigations in
                    elliptic functions, the theory of which he established upon quite a new basis,
                    and more particularly his development of the Theta-function, as given in his
                    great treatise <hi rend="italic">Fundamenta Nova Theorise</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Functionum Ellipticarum</hi> (Königsberg, 1829), and in later papers in <hi
                    rend="italic">Crelle</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Journal,</hi> constitute his
                    grandest analytical discoveries. Second in importance only to these are his
                    researches in differential equations, notably the theory of the last multiplier,
                    which is fully treated in his <hi rend="italic">Vorlesungen über Dynamik,</hi>
                    edited by Clebsch (Berlin, 1866). It was in analytical development that Jacobi’s
                    peculiar power mainly lay, and he made many important contributions of this kind
                    to other departments of mathematics, as a glance at the long list of papers that
                    were published by him in <hi rend="italic">Crelle</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s
                    Journal</hi> from 1826 onwards will sufficiently indicate. Thus he was one of
                    the early founders of the theory of determinants; in particular, he invented the
                    functional determinant formed of the n <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi>
                    differential coefficients of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> given functions of <hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi> independent variables, which now bears his name (Jacobian),
                    and which has played an important part in many analytical investigations.
                    Valuable also are his papers on Abelian transcendents, and his investigations in
                    the theory of numbers, in which latter department he mainly supplements the
                    labours of Gauss, with whom as with the other great Continental mathematicians
                    of the day, Legendre, Bessel, Abel, &lt;fcc., he was on terms of the closest
                    intimacy. The planetary theory and other particular dynamical problems likewise
                    occupied his attention from time to time. He left a vast store of manuscript,
                    portions of which have been published at intervals in <hi rend="italic"
