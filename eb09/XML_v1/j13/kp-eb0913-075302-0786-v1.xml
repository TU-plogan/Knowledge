                    rend="smallcaps">Nicholas, Baron</hi></label> (1794-1865), the greatest and,
                    next to Jôkai, most prolific Hungarian novelist, was born 28th April 1794, at
                    Torda in Transylvania, of aristocratic and wealthy parents. After finishing the
                    usual course of legal studies at Kolozsvâr (Klausenburg), he in 1811 at the age
                    of seventeen entered the army, joining a cavalry regiment, with which he
                    subsequently took part in the Italian campaign. In 1813 he was promoted to the
                    grade of sub-lieutenant, and on the battlefield of Mincio (February 8, 1814) to
                    that of lieutenant. Elevated to the rank of captain, he served in the campaign
                    against Napoleon, and was present at the entry of the allied troops into Paris
                    (31st March 1814). In 1818 Jôsika resigned his commission in the army, returned
                    to Hungary, and married his first wife Elizabeth Kallai. The union proving an
                    unhappy one, Jôsika parted from his wife, settled on his estate at Szurdok in
                    Transylvania, and devoted himself to agricultural and literary pursuits. Drawn
                    into the sphere of politics, he took part in the memorable Transylvanian diet of
                    1834. At about this period Jôsika first began to attract attention as a writer
                    of fiction. In 1836 he brought out his <hi rend="italic">Abafi,</hi> 2 vols.,
                    which laid the foundation of his literary reputation. He was soon afterwards
                    elected member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and of the Kisfaludy
                    Society; of the latter he became, in 1841, director, and in 1842 vice-president.
                    In 1847 Jôsika appeared at the Transylvanian diet as second deputy for the
                    county of Szolnok, and zealously supported the movement for the union of
                    Transylvania with Hungary proper. In the same year he was converted to
                    Protestantism, was formally divorced from his wife, and married Baroness Julia
                    Podman iczky, with whom he continued to live happily until his death. So great
                    was Jôsika’s literary activity that by the time of the revolution (1848) he had
                    already produced about sixty volumes of romances and novels, besides numerous
                    contributions to literary and political periodicals. Both as magnate of the
                    upper house of the Hungarian diet and by his writings Jôsika aided the
                    revolutionary movement, with which he was soon personally identified, being
                    chosen one of the members of the committee of national defence. Consequently,
                    after the capitulation at Vilâgos (13th August 1849), he found it necessary to
                    flee the country, and settled first at Dresden and then, in 1850, at Brussels,
                    where he resumed his literary pursuits anonymously. In 1864 he removed to
                    Dresden, in which city he died on the 27th February 1865. The romances of
                    Jôsika, written somewhat after the style of Sir Walter Scott, are chiefly of a
                    historical and socialpolitical character, his materials being drawn almost
                    entirely from the annals of his own country. Among his more important works may
                    be specially mentioned, besides <hi rend="italic">Abafi —The Poet Zrinyi,</hi>

                    Many of Josika’s novels have been translated into German, the earlier ones by
                    Klein, Schwarz, Steinacker, and Kovàcs, and the later by Jôsika’s second wife
                    Julia, herself an authoress of considerable merit.</p>
