                <p><label type="entry">JONAH</label>. The Book of Jonah is so named from the
                    principal personage of the narrative, only mentioned elsewhere in 2 Kings xiv.
                    25. Jonah there appears as a native of Zebulun, and a contemporary of Jeroboam
                    II. (8th century B.c.). If the book of Jonah were written then, it has a claim
                    to rank as the oldest of the prophetic writings (Joel being in all probability
                    of post-exile origin). The problems connected with this little book are,
                    however, so great that <hi rend="smallcaps">ho</hi> judicious critic would think
                    of admitting such a date as proved. The problems are twofold :—(1) was the book
                    written at one jet? and (2) is it to be understood as a history, or as an
                    allegorical tale, and, if the latter, is it, or is it not, based at all upon
                    tradition, or upoi: a <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0913-0770-0737"/> nature-myth? Köhler thinks that he can trace “the
                    hand of a late reviser, who has made alterations, interpolations, and
                    transpositions of verses and sentences . . . . There is at the very beginning of
                    the story a perceptible lacuna in the second verse, where we are not told what
                    Jonah was to announce to the men of Nineveh.” He offers very plausible grounds
                    for preferring the reading of the Septuagint in iii. 4, “yet <hi rend="italic"
                    >three</hi> days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown,” and points out that the
                    alteration into “forty days” involves an interference with part of the details
                    of the narrative. He detects traces of interpolation in i. 8, ii. 2-10 (A. V.
                    1-9), iii. 9, iv. 1-4, and other passages, and regards the passage iv. 5-8 as
                    “full of insertions and variants.” After purging the text from later additions
                    and enlargements, we obtain a brief but simple and striking story, which,
                    according to Köhler, formed part of a book of prophetic narrations, and
                    therefore commenced with “And.” Later Jews, by very plausible conjectures, in
                    search of a lesson-book on penitence for reading in times of public calamity,
                    modified and interpolated it (comp. Mishna, <hi rend="italic">Taaniyyoth,</hi>
                    ii.). This is not the place to discuss this conjecture in detail; it is favoured
                    by analogy and cannot be rejected without consideration. It enables us to
                    account for comparatively primitive conceptions of the Godhead, and the naïveté
                    in the description of the heathen mariners, and supplies a <hi rend="italic"
                    >locus standi</hi> to the orthodox view of the book which would otherwise be
                    destroyed by acute rationalistic criticism. The additions may be later, but the
                    kernel of the narrative may be old.</p>
                <p>At the same time, it will be seen at once that to grant that the kernel of the
                    narrative may be pre-exile is not to grant that it is historical. From a purely
                    literary point of view it has been urged that “the marks of a story are as
                    patent in the book of Jonah as in any of the tales of the Thousand and One
                    Nights.” The greatest of the improbabilities is a moral one; can we conceive of
                    a large heathen city being converted by an obscure foreign prophet? “To judge of
                    the degree of this improbability, it is enough to read any inscription you
                    please of an Assyrian king. Fancy Sargon or Sennacherib in the presence of
                    Jonah. The case quoted by the <hi rend="italic">Speaker’s Commentary</hi> of a
                    Christian priest frightening a Mahometan town into repentance is not to the
                    point, for Christians and Moslems have a common basis in theism. How could the
                    Ninevites give credence to a man who was not a servant of Asshur?” It is obvious
                    that in New Testament times (see Matt. xii. 39-40, Luke xi. 29-30, and Matt.
                    xvi. 4) the symbolic meaning of the book was the most important part of it. Why
                    should it not have been originally composed with a symbolic or allegorical
                    object? For the hearers of Christ, one symbolic meaning was the most important,
                    but probably enough (for Scripture is many-sided) other ages saw different
                    meanings. The truths of the equality of Jews and heathen before God, the
                    prophetic and missionary-character of the people of Israel, and the conditional
                    character of prophecy, have all been suggested as possible meanings, and all
                    possess great plausibility.</p>
                <p>Mr Tylor <hi rend="italic">(Early History of Mankind,</hi> pp. 336, 337, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Primitive Culture,</hi> i. 306) has already pointed out the close
                    superficial resemblance between the story of Jonah and various solar myths; and
                    indeed the former was long ago connected with the myths of Hercules and Hesione,
                    and Perseus and Andromeda. To suppose a direct imitation of these Greek myths
                    is, indeed, quite gratuitous. Preller’s handbook will show that the most
                    circumstantial parallels to the Hebrew only occur in the narratives of later
                    writers. These late narratives, however, are not improbably derived in part from
                    earlier sources, and at any rate M. Lenormant and M. Clermont Ganneau have
                    pointed out Babylonian and Egyptian affinities for the Greek myths in question.
                    “In Mesopotamia the story is naturally more original and more transparent. In Mr
                    George Smith’s translation, Tiamtu the dragon opens its mouth to swallow Bel
                    Merodach, but in vain (Smith’s <hi rend="italic">Chaldaean</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Genesis,</hi> by Sayce, p. 111).” A remarkable passage in Jeremiah (li. 44),
                    evidently alluding to a popular mythic story, seems to supply a missing link
                    between the narrative of Jonah and the original myth. “Like the latter, it
                    describes the destroyer as the dragon, like the former, it converts both
                    destroyer and destroyed into symbols,” no uncommon phenomenon in poetical
                    passages of the Old Testament.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>It is worth noticing that the “fish” of Jonah is found five
                    or six times in paintings in the Roman catacombs assigned to the first two
                    centuries, and that it is distinctly a dragon.</p></note></p>
                <p>The evidences of date are difficult to seize. The use of the uncommon phrase,
                    Yahveh Elohim (iv. 6), points to a date synchronizing with that of Gen. ii.,
                    iii., but when those chapters were written is a debatable question. Many have
                    argued the exile or post-exile origin of the book from the supposed Aramaizing
                    character of the style; against this view, Pusey’s introduction deserves
                    reading. The arguments from internal evidence have been made best use of by
                    Kuenen, who couples it with the book of Ruth as a product of the opposition to
                    the strict and exclusive policy of <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> Ezra towards
                    heathen nations. Kalisch’s theory is that the book is a romance founded perhaps
                    on fact. “Why should not the substance of the story, though the historical
                    annals make no allusion to such enterprise, be founded on a real fact? Jonah,
                    being on intimate relations with his sovereign, might have been employed by him
                    for important offices; foreign embassies were not unusual, and some such
                    legation from the king of Israel to the king of Assyria is actually mentioned by
                    Jonah’s contemporary Hosea (v. 13)” <hi rend="italic">(Bible Studies,</hi> ii.
