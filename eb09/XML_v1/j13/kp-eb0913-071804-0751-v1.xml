                <p><label type="entry">JOHN <hi rend="smallcaps">of Salisbury</hi></label> (c.
                    1115-1180), a distinguished writer of the 12th century, was born at Salisbury in
                    Wiltshire between the years 1110 and 1120. From the cognomen <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parvus,</hi> which he applies to himself, and from the fact that he was of
                    Saxon, not of Norman race, it may be inferred that his name was Short, or Small,
                    or Little. Few details are known regarding his early life or rank in society;
                    but from his own statements it is gathered that he crossed to France about the
                    year 1131, and began regular studies in Paris under Abelard, who had there for a
                    brief period reopened his famous school on Mont St Geneviève. After Abelard’s
                    retirement, John carried on his studies under Alberich, Robert of Melun, and
                    Robert Pulleyn. Three years he spent at the great school of Chartres, mainly
                    under William of Conches, though it would seem that he had been a pupil of the
                    founder of the school, Bernard Silvester. Bernard’s teaching was distinguished
                    partly by its pronounced Platonic tendency, partly by the stress laid upon
                    literary study of the greater Latin writers; and the influence of the latter
                    feature is noticeable in all John of Salisbury’s works. Returning to Paris, he
                    spent some years there, partly as teacher, partly as pupil of Adam de Ponto
                    Parvo and Gilbert de la Porrée. Whether he attended any of the teachers of the
                    Victorin school is uncertain, but his mode of thinking in theological subjects
                    bears unmistakable traces of the peculiar views of these writers. Probably in
                    the year 1147 or 1148 he crossed to England, with a letter of recommendation
                    from Peter of Celli to Theobald, archbishop of Canterbury. For thirteen years he
                    acted as secretary to Theobald, and was frequently ambassador from the English
                    primate to the papal see. During this time he composed his greatest works,
                    published almost certainly in 1159, the <hi rend="italic">Policraticus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sive</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Nugis
                    Curialium et</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Vestigiis
                    Philosophorum</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Meta-logicus,</hi> writings
                    invaluable as storehouses of information regarding the matter and form of
                    scholastic education, and remarkable for their cultured literary style and
                    humanist tendency. After the death of Theobald in 1061, John continued to occupy
                    the post of secretary to his successor, the famous chancellor Thomas Becket, and
                    took an active part in the long disputes between the primate and his sovereign,
                    Henry II. His letters are of great value for the light they throw upon the
                    obscure course of the constitutional struggle then agitating the English world.
                    With Becket he withdrew to France during the king’s displeasure; he returned
                    with him in 1169, and was present at his assassination in 1170. In the following
                    years, during which he continued in an influential situation in Canterbury, but
                    at what precise date is unknown, he drew up the <hi rend="italic">Life of St
                    Thomas</hi><hi rend="italic">à</hi><hi rend="italic">Becket,</hi> and somewhat
                    later the <hi rend="italic">Life of St Anselm. In</hi> 1176 he was made bishop
                    of Chartres, where he passed the remainder of his life. The date of his death
                    has been variously given as 1182, 1181, or 1180; the strongest reasons are in
                    favour of the last.</p>
                <p>John’s writings are not in any strict sense philosophical, but they give much
                    information regarding the general currents of thinking at the time, and enable
                    us to understand with much completeness the literary and scientific position of
                    the 12th century. So far as his own views are concerned, they are such as one
                    might expect from a cultured intelligence well versed in practical affairs. His
                    doctrine, on the whole, is a kind of a utilitarianism, with a strong leaning, on
                    the side of speculative questions, to the modified, literary scepticism of
                    Cicero. For Cicero, indeed, he has unbounded admiration, and his Latin style,
                    unusually excellent when compared with the average Latinity of the scholastic
                    writers, is evidently moulded on that of Cicero. The remarkable feature of his
                    writings, apart from their value as giving information respecting studies in the
                    12th century, is their strongly marked humanist tendency. To <pb break="no"

                    predecessors in the school of Chartres, but no other writer seems to have
                    possessed so extensive and competent an acquaintance with the great works of
                    Latin classical literature. Of Greek writers he appears to have known nothing at
                    first hand, and very little in translations. The <hi rend="italic">Timaeus</hi>
                    of Plato in the Latin version of Chalcidius was known to him as to his
                    contemporaries and predecessors, and probably he had access to translations of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Phaedo</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Meno.</hi> Of Aristotle
                    he possessed, in Latin version, the whole of the <hi rend="italic">Organon</hi>;
                    he is, indeed, the first of the mediaeval writers of note to whom the whole was
                    known. Of other Aristotelian writings he appears to have known nothing.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ροlicraticus</hi> seems first to have been printed in 1476,
                    in folio; a quarto reprint reappeared in 1513, and an octavo in the same year,
                    but from different MS. sources; the most common edition is that of 1639. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Metalοg icus</hi> was first printed in 1610; the best known
                    edition is that of 1639. The <hi rend="italic">Eηtheticus,</hi> or more
                    correctly <hi rend="italic">Hutheticus,</hi> was first printed in 1843 by C.
                    Petersen. The collected editions of the works are by J. A. Giles, 5 vols.,
                    Oxford, 1848, and by Migne, in the <hi rend="italic">Patrologiae Cursus,</hi>
                    vol. 199,—neither accurate. The most complete study of John of Salisbury is the
                    monograph by Schaarschmidt, <hi rend="italic">Johannes Sarisberienis</hi><hi
