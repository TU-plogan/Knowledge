                <p><label type="entry">JAMES III</label>. (1452-1488), king of Scotland, son of
                    James II., was born 1st June 1452, and shortly after the death of his father was
                    crowned king at Kelso. The custody of the young prince was entrusted to Bishop
                    Kennedy of St Andrews, but in 1466 he was seized at Linlithgow by Lord Boyd, who
                    in this way succeeded in obtaining the governorship of the royal fortresses, and
                    also won the apparent friendship of the king. James was, however, as fickle and
                    faithless as he was weak and pliant, and while Lord Boyd’s eldest son, who had
                    been created earl of Arran, and had married the king’s sister, was absent in the
                    summer of 1469 on an embassy to bring home the king’s bride, Margaret of
                    Denmark, the enemies of the Boyds set agencies in motion for having them tried
                    for their seizure of the king. The earl of Arran, obtaining news of their
                    machinations before landing, returned to Denmark; Lord Boyd fled to England; but
                    Sir Alexander, brother of Lord Boyd, suffered execution, and the estates of the
                    family were forfeited. James, whether the fault was his own or not, was sadly
                    unfortunate in his connexion with his near relations. While his brother-in-law
                    was a fugitive from his vengeance, his two brothers were also, whether justly or
                    not, the objects of his animosity and dread. The earl of Mar, the younger
                    brother, died at <pb break="no"

                    that he was generally believed to have been murdered; and the duke of Albany the
                    elder, making his escape from Edinburgh castle to France, afterwards in 1482
                    came to an agreement with Edward IV. to hold the kingdom as his vassal. The
                    rivalry of Albany was the more formidable because James by the preference which
                    he showed for artists and musicians and by his retired and reserved manners had
                    alienated the majority of the nobility. While James in the summer of this year
                    was leading an army against England, the nobles, headed by Douglas, suddenly at
                    Lauder seized Cochrane and several of the king’s other favourites, and, having
                    hanged them before his eyes, returned with their royal captive to Edinburgh
                    castle. On this Albany suddenly made his appearance, and, having demanded and
                    received the king’s liberty, assumed with apparently no objection on the part of
                    James the sovereignty of the kingdom, until an accusation for treasonable
                    connexions with England compelled him to flee thither. For some years after this
                    Scotland enjoyed both outward and inward tranquillity, but the jealousy of the
                    nobles against the king’s favourites induced them jn 1488, along with the young
                    prince, afterwards James IV., to raise the standard of rebellion. The two armies
                    met at the stream of Sauchieburn, near Stirling, but hardly had they come to
                    blows when the king fled in panic from the field. In his flight he was thrown
                    from his horse, and being received into the cottage of a miller near
                    Bannockburn, was there (June 11) stabbed to death by a person unknown,
                    undoubtedly a straggler from the hostile army.</p>
