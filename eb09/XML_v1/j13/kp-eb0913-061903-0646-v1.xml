                    (1783-1859), a Parsee merchant and great public benefactor, was born of poor
                    parents in Bombay, July 15, 1783. Left an orphan while still very young, he had
                    many difficulties to overcome at the outset of the mercantile career he chose
                    for himself. On one occasion the ship in which he and all his goods were was
                    captured by the French, and the young merchant was landed penniless at the Cape
                    of Good Hope. Thence he procured a passage to Bombay through the charity of some
                    Dutch ladies; and, resolutely beginning life afresh, he rose to be one of the
                    most opulent Parsee merchants in India. His lavish benevolence, which recognized
                    no difference of nation, sect, or class, and extended even to the brute
                    creation, has won him enduring honour. In 1822 he paid the debts of all the poor
                    debtors in Bombay jail; he enriched his native city with a hospital and an
                    educational establishment for Parsee children, a school of art and other
                    benevolent institutions, and contributed largely to the Grant Medical College,
                    while to the public works at Bombay, Nowsaree, and elsewhere he gave large
                    grants, as well as to the patriotic fund and the Indian sufferers’ fund after
                    the mutiny. Eleven schools owe their foundation to his munificence, in which
                    2710 Parsee children are educated. It is estimated that he gave away upwards of
                    26 lakhs of rupees. Knighted in 1842, he was promoted to a baronetcy in 1857; a
                    statue was voted to him in 1856, and was unveiled in Bombay town-hall on August
                    1, 1859. At his death on April 15, 1859, his property was estimated at 8,550,000
                    rupees. According to an act of the legislative council of India, the name
                    Jamsetjee Jejeebhoy must be assumed by all his successors in the baronetcy. His
                    son (1811-1877) was prominent as the head of the Parsee community in Bombay, and
