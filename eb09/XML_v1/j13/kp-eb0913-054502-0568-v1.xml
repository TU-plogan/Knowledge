                    political superintendence of that agency and the Government of India, lying
                    between 26° 5' and 28° 24' N. lat. and between 69° 30' and 72° 50' E. long.,
                    with an area of 16,447 square miles, is bounded on the N. by Bahâwalpur, on the
                    E. by Bikaner and Jodhpur, on the S. by Jodhpur and Sind, and on the W. by
                    Khairpur state and Sind.</p>
                <p>Jâisalmir is almost entirely a sandy waste, forming a part of “the Great Indian
                    Desert.” The general aspect of the country is that of an interminable sea of
                    sandhills, of all shapes and sizes, some rising to a height of 150 feet. Those
                    in the west are covered with <hi rend="italic">phog</hi> bushes, those in the
                    east with tufts of long grass. Water is scarce, and generally brackish; the
                    average depth of the wells is said to be about 250 feet. There are no perennial
                    streams, and only one small river, the Kakni, which, after flowing a distance of
                    28 miles, spreads over a large surface of flat ground, and forms a lake or <hi
                    rend="italic">jhil</hi> called the Bhuj-Jhil. The climate is essentially dry and
                    healthy. The temperature is highest in May and J une; the coldest months are
                    from the middle of December to the middle of February. Throughout Jâisalmir,
                    only rain-crops, such as <hi rend="italic">lajra, jodr, moth, Cd,</hi> &lt;fcc.,
                    are grown; spring crops of wheat, barley, &amp;c., are very rare. Owing to the
                    scanty rainfall, irrigation is almost unknown.</p>
                <p>The main part of the population lead a wandering life, grazing their flocks and
                    herds. Large herds of camels, horned cattle, sheep, and goats are kept. The
                    principal trade is in wool, <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi> camels, cattle, and
                    sheep. The chief imports are grain, sugar, foreign cloth, piece-goods, &amp;c.
                    There is only one civil court. -Education is at a very low ebb. Jain priests are
                    the chief schoolmasters, and their teaching is very elementary. The income of
                    the state for 1873-74 was £11,854, the expenditure £15,911. The mahârâwal has a
                    force of 651 infantry and 155 cavalry, who have no drill or discipline, but are
                    very efficient as police. It has been estimated that the total number of
                    inhabitants does not exceed 72,000; 43,500 are said to be Hindus, 26,000
                    Mahometans, and 2500 Jains.</p>
                <p>The majority of the inhabitants are Yadu Bhati Rajputs, who take their name from
                    an ancestor named Bhati, renowned as a warrior, when the tribe were located in
                    the Punjab. Shortly after this the clan was driven southwards, and found a
                    refuge in the Indian desert, which was thenceforth their home. Deoraj, a famous
                    prince of the Bhati family, is esteemed the real founder of the present
                    Jaisalmir dynasty, and with him the title of <hi rend="italic">rdwαl</hi>
                    commenced. In 1156 Jaisal, the sixth in succession from Deoraj, founded the fort
                    and city of Jaisalmir, and made it his capital. Jâisal was succeeded by several
                    warlike princes, who were constantly engaged in battles and raids. In 1294 the
                    Bhatis so enraged the emperor Alä-ud-din that his army captured and sacked the
                    fort and city of Jaisalmir, so that for some time it was quite deserted. After
                    this there is nothing to record till the time of Räwal Sabal Sinh, whose reign
                    marks an epoch in Bhati history in that he acknowledged the supremacy of the
                    Delhi emperor Shah Jahan, and was the first of the Jaisalmir princes who held
                    his dominions as a fief of the Delhi empire. The Jaisalmir princes had now
                    arrived at the height of their power, but from this time till the accession of
                    Räwal Mulraj in 1762 the fortunes of the state rapidly declined, and most of its
                    outlying provinces were lost. In 1818 Mulraj entered into political relations
                    with the British. Since his death in 1820, no stirring events have occurred. The
                    present chief is Mahârâwal Bairi Sal, who was born in 1848, and is a Yadu Bhati
                    Rajput. The ruler of Jâisalmir is styled <hi rend="italic">mahârâwal,</hi> and
                    holds that position as head of the clan of Bhatis. The constitution may be
                    described as tribal suzerainty in process of conversion to the feudal stage.
                    Many of the tribal chiefs are to a great extent independent, insomuch that they
                    hold their estates rent free.</p>
