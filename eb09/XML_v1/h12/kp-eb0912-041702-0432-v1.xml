                <p><label type="entry">HUYSMANS</label>. Four painters of this family matriculated
                    in the Antwerp guild in the 17th century. Cornelis the elder, apprenticed in
                    1633, passed for a mastership in 1636, and remained obscure. Jacob, apprenticed
                    to Frans Wouters in 1650, wandered to England towards the close of the reign of
                    Charles II., and competed with Lely as a fashionable portrait painter. He
                    executed a portrait of the queen, Catherine of Braganza, now in the national
                    portrait gallery, and Horace Walpole assigns to him the likeness of Lady
                    Bellasys, now catalogued at Hampton Court as a work of Lely. His portrait of
                    Izaak Walton in the National Gallery shows a disposition to imitate the styles
                    of Rubens and Van Dyke. According to most accounts he died in London in 1696.
                    Jan Baptist Huysmans, born at Antwerp in 1654, matriculated in 1676-77, and died
                    there in 1715-16. He was younger brother to Cornelis Huysmans the second, who
                    was born at Antwerp in 1648, and educated by Gâspar de Wit and Jacob van Artois.
                    Of Jan Baptist little or nothing has been preserved, except that he registered
                    numerous apprentices at Antwerp, and painted a landscape dated 1697 now in the
                    Brussels museum. But for the signature critics would assign this piece to his
                    brother. Cornelis the second is the only master of the name of Huysmans whose
                    talent was largely acknowledged. He chanced to receive lessons from two artists,
                    one of whom was familiar with the Roman art of the Poussins, whilst the other
                    inherited the scenic style of the school of Rubens. He combined the two in a
                    rich, highly coloured, and usually effective style, which, however, was not free
                    from monotony. Seldom attempting anything but woodsidc views with fancy
                    backgrounds, half Italian, half Flemish, he painted with great facility, and
                    left numerous examples behind. At the outset of his career he practised at
                    Malines, where he married in 1682, and there too he entered into some business
                    connexion with Van der Meulen, for whom he painted some backgrounds. In 1706 he
                    withdrew to Antwerp, <pb break="no"

                    Malines, where he died on the 1st of June 1727.</p>
                <p>Though most of his pictures were composed for cabinets rather than churches, he
                    sometimes emulated Van Artois in the production of large sacred pieces, and for
                    many years his Christ on the Road to Emmaus adorned the choir of Notre Dame of
                    Malines. In the gallery of Nantes, where three of hissmall landscapes are
                    preserved, tι∣ere hangs an Investment of Luxembourg, by Van der Meulen, of which
                    lie is known to have laid in the background. The two national galleries of
                    London and Edinburgh contain each one example of his skill. Blenheim, too, and
                    other private galleries in England, possess one or more of his pictures. But
                    most of his works are on the Continent,—four a-piece in the Louvre, Augsburg,
                    and Stuttgart; three a-piece in Berlin, Brunswick, Cologne, and Munich; two in
                    Cassel and St Petersburg; one at Antwerp, Brussels, Carlsruhe, Copenhagen,
                    Dresden, and Hanover.</p>
