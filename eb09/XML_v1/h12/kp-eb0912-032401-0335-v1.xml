                <p><label type="entry">HOWELL, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1594-1666),
                    a voluminous English author, best known by his collection of letters <hi
                    rend="italic">(Epistoloe</hi><hi rend="italic">Ho-</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Elianae)</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Instructions for Forreine Travell,</hi>
                    which, in Mr Arber’s phrase, form our first handbook for the Continent. Howell,
                    as he was proud to acknowledge, was a Welshman; he was born probably at Abernant
                    in Carmarthenshire, where his father was minister. From the free grammar school
                    at Hereford he proceeded to Jesus College, Oxford, in 1610, and there he took
                    his degree of B.A. in 1613. About 1617 we find him holding the post of steward
                    in Sir Robert Mansell’s glass-works in Broad Street, and in the following year
                    he was commissioned to go abroad to procure the services of some high-class
                    workmen. It was not till 1622 that he returned home, having visited Holland,
                    France, Spain, and Italy; and these three or four years of foreign experience
                    made a lasting impression on his character and his career. Not long after his
                    return he was despatched to Spain in company with Lord Digby’s embassy to try
                    and settle a dispute about the unlawful seizure of an English vessel; but though
                    he remained till the end of 1624 he was obliged to return without success: the
                    Spaniards, irritated at the breaking off of the famous match, were in no mood
                    for concessions. For some time Howell had no stable employment, but at length,
                    in 1626, he went to York as secretary to Lord Scroop, lord president of the
                    north, and for a season he appears to have been wonderfully fortunate. In 1627
                    he was elected M.P. for Richmond; in 1632 he was sent as orator with the embassy
                    of the earl of Leicester to Denmark; and in 1642 the king appointed him one of
                    the clerks of the privy council. On suspicion of royalist leanings he was
                    committed to the Fleet prison by the Parliament in 1643, and, though he
                    professed himself most humbly submissive to its authority, he was allowed to
                    languish in confinement till 1648. He had acquired considerable fame by his
                    allegorical ∆evδpoλoγiα, published in 16 40, and his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Instructions for Forreine Travell,</hi> 1642; and now he was driven to maintain
                    himself by his pen. He edited and supplemented Cotgrave’s French and English
                    dictionary, compiled <hi rend="italic">Lexicon Tetraglotton, or an English,
                    French, Italian, and Spanish Dictionary</hi> (London, 1660), translated various
                    works from Italian and Spanish, and wrote a life of Louis XIII. In 1660 he
                    presented a petition for confirmation in the place of clerk of the privy
                    council; and, though this was not granted him, the post of historiographer royal
                    was created for his benefit. In 1661 he made application for the office of tutor
                    in foreign languages to the infanta Catherine of Braganza, and in the following
                    year published an <hi rend="italic">English Grammar translated into
                    Spanish.</hi> He died in 1666, having realized to the last his favourite motto,
                    “<hi rend="italic">Senesco</hi><hi rend="italic">non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >segnesco.”</hi> Howell had no small ability and learning; and all his writings
                    are imbued with a certain simplicity and quaintness. His elaborate allegories,
                    <hi rend="italic">Discourses of Trees</hi> and the like, are now dead to the
                    root; his linguistic labours, though of worth in their time, are a hundred times
                    superseded; but his <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> (10th ed., 1737) are still
                    almost models of their kind, and his <hi rend="italic">Instructions,</hi> with
                    their subtle observations and pithy parallels, are well worthy of their place in
                    Mr Arber’s series (London, 1869).</p>
