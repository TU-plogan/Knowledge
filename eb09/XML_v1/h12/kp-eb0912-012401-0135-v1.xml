                    (1795-1874), was born August 13, 1795, at Wolgast, a small town in Pomerania,
                    which at that time was still Swedish territory. After a four years’ stay in
                    Sweden, whither his father, a merchant, had tιken him in 1806, and where he may
                    have laid the foundation of that knowledge of the languages and laws of the
                    North which is so conspicuous in his later works, he was in 1810 received into
                    the house of his uncle Riihs, the learned historian, who had just been called to
                    the professorship of history at the newly-founded university of Berlin. He
                    subsequently went through the course of law study at the universities of Berlin,
                    Göttingen, and Heidelberg (1813— 1817). It was in Berlin especially that he was
                    introduced to the principles of the so-called historical school of the science
                    of law by Savigny and Eichhorn, who were his principal teachers. In 1821 he
                    settled as a privat-docent at the university of Berlin, where he was promoted to
                    an extraordinary professorship in 1824, and to the ordinary German law chair in
                    1827. His principal works are his edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sachsenspiegel</hi> (in 3 vols., containing also some other important sources
                    of Saxon or Low German law), which is still unsurpassed in accuracy and sagacity
                    of research, and his book on <hi rend="italic">Die</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Haus-und Hofmarken</hi> (1870), in which he has given a history of the use of
                    trademarks among all the Teutonic nations of Europe, and which is full of
                    important elucidations of the history of law and also contains valuable
                    contributions to the history of art and civilization. In 1850 Homeyer was
                    elected a member of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Transactions</hi> of which he published various papers exhibiting profound
                    learning (“Ueber die Heimath,” 1852; “Genealogie der Handschriften des
                    Sachsenspiegels,” 1859; “Die Stadtbücher des Mittelalters,” 1860; “Der
