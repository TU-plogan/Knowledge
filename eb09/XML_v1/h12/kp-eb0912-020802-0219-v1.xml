                <p><label type="entry">HORSLEY <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (c.
                    1685-1732), a distinguished antiquary of the last century, the date and place of
                    whose birth as well as his parentage are uncertain. The late Rev. Johu Hodgson,
                    the historian of Northumberland, in a short memoir of him published in 1831,
                    countenances the belief that he was born in 1685, at Pinkie, in the parish of
                    Inveresk and county of Midlothian. This statement he reconciles with Horsley’s
                    subsequent history, by supposing that his father was a Northumberland
                    Nonconformist, who had migrated to Scotland during the reign of Charles II. or
                    James II., but returned to England soon after the Revolution of 1688. On the
                    other hand, Mr J. H. Hinde, in “Notes” on the life of Horsley, printed in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Archoeologia Aeliana</hi> for February 1865, leans to the
                    opinion that he was a native of Newcastle-on-Tyne, and the son of Charles
                    Horsley, a member of the Tailors’ Company of that town, an opinion to which
                    colour is given by some expressions of Horsley’s own in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">Romana.</hi></p>
                <p>Horsley undoubtedly received his early education at the grammar school of
                    Newcastle, and completed it at the university of Edinburgh, where he was
                    admitted to the degree of master of arts on the 29th of April 1701. For years
                    afterwards nothing seems to be known of him, though some of them must have been
                    given to the study of theology in connexion with the body of dissenters to which
                    he belonged. There is some evidence tending to show that Horsley “was settled in
                    Morpeth as a Presbyterian minister as early as 1709.” Mr Hodgson, however,
                    thinks that up to 1721, at which time he was residing at Widdrington, “he had
                    not received ordination, but preached as a licentiate.” Even if he was ordained
                    then his stay at the latter place was probably prolonged beyond that date; for
                    he communicated to the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> notes
                    on the rainfall there in the years 1722 and 1723. Mr Hinde also shows that
                    during these years, in addition to his other duties, whatever their nature, “he
                    certainly followed a secular employment as agent to the York Buildings Company,
                    who had contracted to purchase and were then in possession of the Widdrington
                    estates.” Soon after settling at Morpeth, Horsley began to supplement his
                    professional income, probably slender, by opening a private school. The
                    enterprise was successful. Respect for his character and abilities attracted
                    pupils irrespective of religious connexion, one of them becoming afterwards Dean
                    of Westminster. He likewise found time to give courses of lectures on mechanics
                    and hydrostatics in Morpeth, Alnwick, and Newcastle; and it was doubtless in
                    recognition of his scientific tastes and attainments that he was elected on the
                    23d April 1730 a Fellow of the Royal Society.</p>
                <p>It is, however, in connexion with his archaeological researches that John Horsley
                    is now so well and so honourably known, though strangely enough no place appears
                    to have been hitherto found for his name in such works as the present. Among
                    those who have investigated the traces left by the Romans of their presence in
                    Britain he stands, and must ever stand, as in many respects the foremost. His
                    great work, <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">Romana,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">or the Roman Antiquities of Britain</hi> (London, 1732), one of
                    the scarcest and most valuable of its class, contains the result of an amount of
                    patient labour in this extensive field that in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n220/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0220-0209"/> case of a man in his position is truly
                    marvellous. Nor was the acuteness of his intellectual powers less remarkable;
                    for so accurately were his researches conducted and so solid was the judgment he
                    brought to bear upon them that a century and a half of subsequent inquiry has
                    invalidated only a few of the conclusions he came to.</p>
                <p>Horsley died suddenly, of apoplexy, on the 12th of January 1732, his constitution
                    having been in all likelihood prematurely worn out by the toil he had undergone
                    in the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Romana,</hi> then on the eve of publication. The following extract from the
                    burial register of the parish of Morpeth gives the date of his interment: “173
                    j, Jan. 15, Mr John Horsley;” but the site of his grave is unknown. Besides the
                    <hi rend="italic">Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">Romana,</hi> Horsley published
                    two sermons and a hand-book to his lectures on mechanics, &amp;c. He also
                    projected a history of Northumberland and Durham, collections for which were
                    found among his papers. By his wife, a daughter of the Rev. William Hamilton,
                    D.D., minister of Cramond, afterwards professor of divinity in the university of
                    Edinburgh, he had one son and two daughters.</p>
