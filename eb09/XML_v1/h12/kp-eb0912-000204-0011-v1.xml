                <p><label type="entry">HISSAR</label>, a state in Central Asia, lying between the
                    meridians of 66° 30' and 70° E. and the parallels of 39° 15' and 37° N., and
                    dependent on the amir of Bokhara. It forms that part of the basin of the Oxus
                    which lies on the north side of the river, opposite the Afghan province of
                    Balkh. The western prolongation of the Tian Shan, which divides the basin of the
                    Zarafshan from that of the upper Oxus, after rising in one peak to a height of
                    12,300 feet, bifurcates in 67° 45' E. long. Its two arms include between them
                    the province of Shahr-i-Sabz, with the towns of Shahr Sabz, Kitab, Yakobagh, and
                    Karchi. The main chain and the southern arm of its bifurcation, sometimes <pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n12/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0012-0003"/> called Koh-i-tan, form the N. and N.W. boundaries
                    of Hissar. On the W. it is wholly bounded by the desert; the Oxus limits it on
                    the S. and S.E.; and the states of Karategin and Darwaz complete the boundary on
                    the E. Until 1875 it was one of the least known tracts of Central Asia, but in
                    that year a Russian expedition from Tashkend traversed and surveyed a great
                    portion of it, and since then successive expeditions have explored various other
                    portions, so that it is now very fairly known. Hissar is traversed from north to
                    south by four important tributaries of the Oxus, viz., the Surkhab or Vakhsh,
                    Kafirnihan, Surkhan, and Shirabad-Daria, which descend from the snowy mountains
                    to the north and form a series of fertile valleys, disposed in a fan-shape,
                    within which lie embosomed the principal towns of Hissar. The two chief roads by
                    which Hissar is approached from Bokhara and Russian Turkestan lie through Karchi
                    and Shahr-i-sabz respectively. Both these routes unite at Ak-roba, on the crest
                    of the range between Khuzar and Baisun. There is also a difficult route, running
                    through fine forests from Yakobagh across the mountains to Sarijui. A little way
                    down the other side of the mountain chain between Khuzar and Derbend is situated
                    the famous defile formerly called Kohluga (Mong. “Barrier ”) and the Iron Gate,
                    but now styled Buzghol-khana or Goat’s House. This pass is described by ⅛e
                    Russians, who visited it and were vividly impressed with its solemnity, as a
                    huge but narrow chasm in a transverse range, whose frowning rocks overhang and
                    threaten to choke the tortuous and gloomy corridor (in places but 5 paces wide)
                    affording the only exit from the valley. In ancient times it was a vantage point
                    of much importance, and commanded the chief route between Turkestan and India.
                    Hwen-Tsang, who passed through it in the 7th century on his way southward,
                    states that there were then two folding doors or gates, cased with iron and hung
                    with bells, placed across the pass. Clavijo, the Spanish ambassador to the court
                    of Timur, heard of this when he passed through the defile 800 years after, but
                    the gates had then disappeared. Derbend, the first inhabited place met with, is
                    a poor village in the valley of the Shirabad-Daria, along which runs the road to
                    the Oxus and to Afghanistan. Shirabad town itself is a place claiming great
                    antiquity. It has a citadel and three rows of -walls, and with its surrounding
                    villages presents the aspect of a flourishing oasis. There are four ferries over
                    the Oxus in the Shirabad chiefship or district, viz., Chush-ka-guzar (boar’s
                    ferry), Patta-kissar, Shur-ab, and Kara-kamir.</p>
                <p>Baisun, a picturesque Uzbek town considered to be very healthy, lies on the road
                    from Derbend to Hissar town. Emerging from the somewhat complex mountain mass
                    which fills up this part of Hissar, the valley of the Surkhan is reached. This
                    large river is formed by several affluents from the snowy range to the north,
                    one of which, the Tupalan, formerly gave its name to the whole stream. The
                    valley in its upper part is between 40 and 45 miles wide; the banks of the river
                    are flat and reed-grown, and are frequented by wild hogs and a few tigers. The
                    Surkhan valley is highly cultivated, especially in its upper portion, where the
                    villages are crowded. It supplies Bokhara with corn and sheep, but its chief
                    products are rice and flax. When Hissar was independent the valley of the
                    Surkhan was always its political centre, the town of Hissar being simply an
                    outlying fortress. Passing by four fortified towns, Dehinau, Sarijui, Regar, and
                    Karatagh, all in the basin of the Surkhan, Hissar ( = fort) claims notice. Its
                    position at the entrance of the Pavi-dul-dul defile commanded the entrance into
                    the fertile valleys of the Surkhan and Kafirnihan, just as Kubadian at the
                    southern end of the latter stream defended them from the south. The famous
                    bridge of Pul-i-sanghin (stone bridge, Tash-kepri in Turkish) lies on the road
                    from Hissar and Kafirnihan to Baljuan and Kulab. It spans the Surkhab, which is
                    here hemmed in between lofty and precipitous cliffs barely 30 paces apart. The
                    bridge itself abuts on projecting rocks, and is ten paces wide. The next place
                    of importance is Kulab, in the valley of the Kichi Surkhab, so called from the
                    lakes or inundations-near which it stands. The district is part of that once
                    famous as Khotl. The town (which, strictly speaking, is the capital of Kulab
                    district as distinct from Hissar) contains about 500 houses and a poor citadel,
                    and from it there are roads to Badakhshan and Kurgan-tepe and Kubadian. These
                    two lie in the valleys of the Vaksh (or Surkhab) and Kafirnihan respectively.
                    Kulab produces wheat in great profusion, and gold is brought thither from the
                    surrounding districts. Kubadian is a large, silk-producing town, and is
                    surrounded with rice-fields. Formerly the two last-named valleys were densely
                    peopled, and a series of settlements extended southward from Dehinau, from which
                    town an arik or canal provided the city of Termez with water. Termez, or
                    Termedh, was an ancient and important city on the Oxus. After being destroyed by
                    Jenghiz Khan and lying for some time in ruins, it rose again into note in the
                    following century, and when visited by Ibn Batuta, and later by Clavijo, it had
                    grown again into a place of some importance. It is now a mass of ruins.</p>
                <p>The population of the districts of Hissar and Kulab consists principally of
                    Uzbeks and Tajiks, the former predominating, and, as in the valleys of the Sir
                    and ⅛rafshan, gradually pushing the aboriginal Tajiks into the hills. East of
                    Dushamba the Tajiks are the dominant race. On the banks of the Oxus there are
                    some tribes of Baigush Turkmans who work at the ferries, drive sheep, and
                    accompany caravans. Lyuli (gipsies), Jews, Hindus, and Afghans are also to be
                    found in Hissar. But the Uzbeks are the most numerous, and their influence is so
                    great that at Bokhara Hissar is known as Uzbekistan. The climate of the valleys
                    of Hissar and Kulab is pleasant, as they are shut in by mountains to the north
                    and open towards the Oxus to the south. Baisun (3410 feet) is the most elevated
                    town. Hissar and Kulab produce in abundance all the cereals and garden plants
                    indigenous to Central Asia. Cotton is grown in considerable quantities in the
                    district of Shirabad, whence it is exported by way of Khuzar to Karshi. The
                    difficulties of transport would prevent its being brought in any quantity from
                    other places. Dehinau, Hissar, and Dushamba export corn and flax to Bokhara.
                    From the vicinity of Khuzar is exported rock-salt, and sheep are brought to
                    Bokhara and Karshi from all parts of Hissar district, as well as from Baljuan,
                    Yurchi, and Afghanistan. A species of juniper, called archa, is used for timber.
                    Salt is found at Bash-kurd, in the mountains oi Hazret-Imam, and at other
                    places. There are numerous brine springs in various quarters, indicating
                    generally an inexhaustible supply of rock-salt. Auriferous sand has been
                    discovered in the Vaksh, and the inhabitants wash the sands after the floods in
                    spring. Merchandize is conveyed by means of camels, mules, and horses from
                    Hissar to Karshi and Bokhara. Not a single waggon is to be found in the
                    district, and the wooden <hi rend="italic">arba</hi> is not even known there.
                    Politically, Hissar now consists of seven sub-districts, governed by begs,
                    Shirabad, Baisun, Dehinau, Yurchi, Hissar, Kurgan-tepe, and Kubadian; and Kulab
                    of two, Baljuan and Kulab. The fact of the chief route between the Russian and
                    British possessions in Asia lying through Hissar has served oi late years to
                    bring it into prominence, and will always invest it with a certain
                    importance.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Our knowledge of the history of Hissar is most
                    fragmentary. In early written history this country was part of the Persian
                    empire of the Achaemenidae, and probably afterwards of the Graeco-Bactrian
                    kingdom, and then subject to the Eastern swarms who broke this up. In the time
                    of the Sassanian kings of Persia it was under thø Haiathalah, the Ephthalites or
                    White Huns of the Greeks, subdued by the Turks in the early part of the 7th
                    century, these soon to be displaced by the Mahometan power. Termedh, Kubadian,
                    and Chagaman are named as places of importance by the Arab geographers of the
                    10th century; the last name was also applied territorially to a great part of
                    the Hissar province, but is now obsolete. The country was successively subject
                    to the Mongol Chagatai dynasty and to Timur and his successors; it afterwards
                    became a cluster of Uzbek states of obscure history. Hissar was annexed by the
                    amir of Bokhara in 1869-70, soon after the Russian occupation of Samarcund. (θ∙
