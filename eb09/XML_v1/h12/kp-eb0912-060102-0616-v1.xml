                <p><label type="entry">HYTHE</label>, a municipal and parliamentary borough of Kent,
                    England, and one of the original Cinque Ports, is beautifully situated at the
                    foot of a steep cliff near the eastern extremity of Romney Marsh, about half a
                    mile from the sea, on a branch line of the South-Eastern Railway, 66 miles
                    E.S.E. of London, 16 S.W. of Dover, and 5 W. of Folkestone. It consists
                    principally of one long handsome street running parallel with the shore. On the
                    slope of the hill above the town stands the fine old church of St Leonard,
                    partly Late Norman and partly Early English, with a tower rebuilt about 1750. In
                    a vault under the chancel there is a collection of human skulls and bones
                    supposed to be the remains of ancient Britons and Saxons slain in a battle which
                    took place near Hythe in 456. Of late the church has been undergoing restoration
                    at a considerable cost, and it is proposed to complete the chancel, which was
                    originally left unfinished. At Lympne there are the remains of a Roman <hi
                    rend="italic">castmm,</hi> and excavations made some years ago brought to light
                    many interesting remains of the old Roman town, the <hi rend="italic">Portus
                    Lemanus.</hi> The site of the <hi rend="italic">castrum</hi> is now occupied by
                    the fine old castellated mansion of Studfall Castle, at one time the residence
                    of the archdeacons of Canterbury, but at present used as a farm-house. Norman
                    portions of the Lympne church originally built by Archbishop Lanfranc are still
                    standing; and a small distance east from it is Shipway or Shepway Cross, where
                    the great assemblies relating to the Cinque Ports used to be held until they
                    were removed to Romney. Several bronze implements and weapons were discovered
                    near Hythe in 1873, during the excavation of the railway line from Hythe to
                    Sandgate. A mile north from Hythe is Saltwood Castle, of very ancient origin,
                    but rebuilt in the time of Richard II. Hythe possesses a guild hall founded in
                    1794, and two hospitals, that of St Bartholomew founded by Haimo, bishop of
                    Rochester, in 1336, and that of St John, of still greater antiquity but unknown
                    date, and founded originally for the reception of lepers. A Government school of
                    musketry, in which instructors of musketry for the army are trained, was
                    established in 1854; and the Shorncliffe military camp is within 2∣ miles of the
                    town.’ On account of its pleasant situation and its picturesque and interesting
                    neighbourhood, Hythe has become a favourite watering-place. Baths were erected
                    in 1854 at a cost of £2000, and the sea wall and parade has lately been extended
                    eastwards to Sandgate, the total length being 3 miles. From the town to the
                    sea-shore there is a stately avenue of wych elms. The area of the municipal
                    borough is 1744 acres, and of the parliamentary borough 3571 acres. The
                    population of the municipal borough in 1871 was 3383, and of the parliamentary
                    borough 24,078. The latter includes the municipal borough of Folkestone.</p>
                <p>Hythe occurs in old documents as Hethe, and in Domesday Book as Hede. The word is
                    derived from the Saxon <hi rend="italic">Hyth,</hi> meaning a harbour. The
                    present town of Hythe rose to importance after the decay of West Hythe by the
                    withdrawal of the sea, West Hythe having previously succeeded to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Portus</hi><hi rend="italic">Lcmαnus,</hi> whose decay had been
                    due to a like cause. Since the reign of Elizabeth the harbour has been choked up
                    with sand. It is a theory of some writers that the landing place of Julius
                    C⅛esar on his first invasion of Britain was in the vicinity of Lympne. Anciently
                    Hythe, with the parish of West Hythe, was within a “hundred” of its own. Along
                    with Saltwood it was given in 1026 by Halfdan, a Saxon thane, to Christ Church
                    in Canterbury; and it was afterwards held for knight's service by Earl Godwine.
                    According to Leland, it at one time had a fine abbey and four parish churches.
                    It succeeded to the ancient privileges which West Hythe enjoyed as a Cinque
                    Port, its quota being 5 ships, 105 men, and 5 boys. When Earl Godwine ravaged
                    the coast of Kent in 1052 ho took several ships from the harbour of Hythe. In
                    1293 the inhabitants with great valour repulsed the attacks of the seamen of a
                    French man-of-war who had disembarked in the harbour and were beginning to
                    plunder the town. In the reign of Richard II. a great conflagration destroyed
                    200 of the houses and 5 of the ships 7n the harbour. Hythe and Saltwood were
                    given by Archbishop Cranmer to Henry VIII. in lieu of other estates, and they
                    continued vested in the crown until the 17th year of Elizabeth, when the town
                    received a charter of incorporation. It is now governed by 4 aidermen and 12
                    councillors, one of whom is mayor. From the 42d year of Edward III. it possessed
                    the privilege of returning two m∏mhers to parliament, but since 1832 it has
                    returned only one.</p>
