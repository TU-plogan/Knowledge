                <p><label type="entry">HOORN</label>, a town of Holland, at the head of an
                    arrondissement in the province of North Holland, 20 miles N.N.E. of Amsterdam
                    and 10 miles S.W. of Enkhuizen, with which it is connected by the road called De
                    Streek, or The Stroke. The Hoornerhop, a bay of the Zuyder Zee, forms a good
                    outer harbour, and the inner harbour is shut in by <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    sluice which can be opened only when the water within and without has nearly the
                    same level. Of the massive walls by which Hoorn was formerly surrounded few
                    indications are left except in the shape of promenades and gardens; but two of
                    the old gateways, the East Gate and the Cow Gate, and a few towers still remain.
                    The West Gate is gone, with its monument to the filial piety of Lambert
                    Meliszoon, a young man who by heroic exertions managed to bring his aged mother
                    to refuge within the town when the country around was overrun by the Spaniards
                    in 1579. Most of the ordinary houses are old-fashioned, and interesting from the
                    sculptures or carvings with which they are decorated; but the public buildings
                    have little to boast of in the way of architectural excellence or peculiarity.
                    It is enough to mention the town-house (formerly the state college), the
                    weigh-house, the old admiralty-house or princes’ court, the house of correction
                    (formerly the admiralty magazine), the old mint, occupied as barracks, the new
                    infirmary, the orphanage, and the old women’s hospital. Of the eight churches
                    the principal is the Groote Kerk, occupying the site of the famous 14th century
                    edifice of the same name, which perished by fire in 1838. A communal high
                    school, a Latin school, a medical and chemical society, and a branch of the
                    society <hi rend="italic">Tot nut van 't Algemeen</hi> are the main <pb

                    commerce which Hoorn enjoyed in the 16th and 17th centuries has almost entirely
                    vanished; but there is still a good trade with other parts of the Netherlands,
                    especially in cheese and cattle. The annual export of cheese is about 23,000
                    tons. Saw-mills and boat-building yards are the chief industrial establishments.
                    The population was 8780 in 1870, and 9763 in 1876. Of the 9391 inhabitants in
                    the commune in 1870, 5112 belonged to the Dutch Reformed Church, 2954 were Roman
                    Catholics, and 386 were Jews.</p>
                <p>Hoorn, Latinized as Horna or Hornum, has existed at least from the first part of
                    the 14th century, as it is mentioned in a document of the year 1311, five years
                    earlier than the date usually assigned for its foundation. It was at Hoorn in
                    1416 that the first great net was made for the herring fishery, an industry
                    which long proved an abundant source of wealth to the town. During the 15th
                    century Hoorn shared in the troubles occasioned by the different factions; in
                    1518 it was molested by Groote Pier, and in 1566 and 1567 by Henry of Brederode.
                    The Spanish forces entered the town in 1569; but in 1572 it cast in its lot with
                    the States of the Netherlands, and four years later it assisted in defeating the
                    duke of Alva’s admiral, Count de Bossu,who remained for some time a prisoner·
                    within its walls. The riot against the burgomaster Langewagen in 1672 was a
                    matter of purely local interest. A company of commerce and navigation was formed
                    at Hoorn in 1720; but on the other hand, in 1795, the admiralty offices and
                    storehouses were removed to Medemblik. The English under Abercromby took
                    possession of the town in 1799, and in 1811 it suffered severely from the
                    French. Among the celebrities of Hoorn are William Schonten, who discovered in
                    1616 the passage round Cape Horn or Hoorn, as he called it in honour of his
                    birthplace; Abel Janszoon Tasman, whose fame is associated with Tasmania; and
                    Jan Pieters Koen, the founder of Batavia.</p>
