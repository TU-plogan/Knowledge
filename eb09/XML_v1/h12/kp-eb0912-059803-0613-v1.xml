                <p><label type="entry">HYRAX</label>, a genus of diminutive plantigrade mammals, the
                    position of which in the mammalian series has, owing to their apparent affinity
                    with several widely different groups, given rise to considerable controversy.
                    Approaching the hare in their external appearance and habits, the rhinoceros in
                    their molar teeth and much of their skeleton, the hippopotamus in the form of
                    their lower incisors, and the sloth in the great number of their dorsal
                    vertebrae, they were at first classed with the rodents, and afterwards, by
                    Cuvier, with the pachyderms, where they remained until, on the breaking up of
                    that most heterogeneous of groups,</p>
                <p>Professor Huxley established the order <hi rend="italic">Hyracoidea</hi> for
                    their reception. They are small, rabbit-like creatures, the largest not
                    exceeding 18 inches in length, covered with a thick soft fur with numerous
                    bristles interspersed. Their ears and legs are short; the tail is represented
                    only by a small tubercle; and their toes, of which they have four on each foot
                    in front and three behind, are, with the exception of the inner one on each hind
                    foot, provided with flat hoof-like nails. They have twenty-one pairs of ribs—a
                    larger number than is possessed by any other mammals except the sloths, which
                    have twenty-three pairs. They are gregarious animals, dwelling in colonies in
                    the crevices of rocks and in the caverns which abound in the hilly regions they
                    frequent, and feeding on grass and other herbage, on roots, fruits, and the
                    tender shoots of plants. There are, according to Dr Gray, thirteen species of
                    <hi rend="italic">Hyrax,</hi> many of which are, however, regarded by other
                    authorities as merely varieties. They are all confined to the African continent
                    with the exception of the Syrian hyrax or daman <hi rend="italic">(Hyrax
                    syriaeus),</hi> whose range extends from Abyssinia into Arabia, <pb break="no"

                    regarded as the “shaphan,” rendered “conies” in the English Bible, which “are
                    but a feeble folk, yet make their houses in the rocks” (Prov. <hi rend="italic"
                    >xxx.</hi> 26). They measure about a foot in length and 11 inches in height, and
                    are of a greyish-brown colour above, fulvous on the flanks, and white beneath.
                    They are active little creatures, darting in and out of their rocky shelters
                    with remarkable agility. Bruce, who observed their habits in Abyssinia, states
                    that large numbers of them were frequently to be seen sitting on great stones at
                    the mouths of caves, basking in the sunshine, or enjoying the coolness of the
                    summer evening. Of timid and gentle disposition, they can be readily tamed,
                    although when roughly handled at first they are said to bite severely. The Cape
                    hyrax <hi rend="italic">{Hyrax capensis)</hi> or “badger” (dasse; Dutch, Das;
                    German, Dachs) is the largest known species, measuring about 18 inches in
                    length. It frequents situations similar to those occupied by the Syrian form,
                    and is exceedingly shy, peeping out of its rocky hiding places with a
                    circumspection which is by no means uncalled for, as it forms a favourite food
                    of lions, hyaenas, and the larger birds of prey. The latter, it is said, may
                    often be seen perched, for hours, like statues on the rocks, watching their
                    opportunity to dart upon the luckless “badger.” To guard against such surprises,
                    they are said, when feeding, to place one of their number, usually an old male,
                    as a sentinel, whose shrill prolonged cry gives timely notice of approaching
                    danger. Like the “conies,” they are readily tamed, and seem capable of
                    considerable attachment, although their natural timidity and suspicion cause
                    them to hide themselves on the appearance of a stranger. There are two species
                    of hyrax, one in the south and the other in the west of Africa, which are said
                    to be arboreal in their habits, making their abode in the holes of trees. Dr
                    Gray has placed these in a separate genus— <hi rend="italic">Dendrohyrax.</hi>
                    The island of Fernando Po possesses a species peculiar to itself, while the
                    genus is entirely wanting in Madagascar. No fossil remains of the hyrax have yet
                    been found.</p>
