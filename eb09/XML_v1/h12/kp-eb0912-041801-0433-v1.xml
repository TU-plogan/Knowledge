                <p><label type="entry">HUYSUM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jan van</hi></label>
                    (1682-1749), was born at Amsterdam in 1682, and died in his native city on the
                    8th of February 1749. He was the son of Justus van Huysum, whose practice
                    remained entirely local, but who is said to have been expeditious in decorating
                    doorways, screens, and vases. A picture by this artist is still preserved in the
                    gallery of Brunswick, representing Orpheus and the Beasts in a wooded landscape,
                    and here we have some explanation of his son’s fondness for landscapes of a
                    conventional and Arcadian kind; for Jan van Huysum, though skilled as a painter
                    of still life, believed himself to possess the genius of a landscape painter.
                    Half his pictures in public galleries are landscapes, views of imaginary lakes
                    and harbours with impossible ruins and classic edifices, and woods of tall and
                    motionless trees,—the whole very glossy and smooth, and entirely lifeless. The
                    earliest dated work of this kind is that of 1717, in the Louvre, a grove with
                    maidens culling flowers near a tomb, ruins of a portico, and a distant palace on
                    the shores of a lake .bounded by mountains. In the picture market these
                    landscapes are worth comparatively little, whilst the master’s fruit and flower
                    pieces are all the more appreciated, and good examples readily fetch from £800
                    tn £900. It is doubtful whether any artist in this peculiar walk of art ever
                    surpassed Van Huysum in representing fruit and flowers. It has been said that
                    his fruit has no savour and his flowers have no perfume,—in other words, that
                    they are hard and artificial,—but this is scarcely true. In substance fruit and
                    flower are delicate and finished imitations of nature in its more subtle
                    varieties of matter. The fruit has an incomparable blush of down, the flowers
                    have a perfect delicacy of tissue. Van Huysum too shows supreme art in relieving
                    flowers of various colours against each other, and often against a light and
                    transparent background. He is always bright, sometimes even gaudy. Great taste
                    and much grace and elegance are apparent in the arrangement of bouquets and
                    fruit in vases adorned with bas reliefs or in baskets on marble tables. There is
                    exquisite and faultless finish everywhere. But what Van Huysum has not is the
                    breadth, the bold effectiveness, and the depth of thought of De Heem from whom
                    he descends through Abraham Mignon.</p>
                <p>Some of the finest of Van Huysum’s fruit and flower pieces have been in English
                    private collections those of 1723 in the earl of Ellesmere’s gallery, others of
                    1730-32 in the collections of Hope and Ashburton. One of the best examples is
                    now in the National G tilery (1736-37), which came from Mr Wells of Redleaf and
                    Abraham Darby. No public museum has finer and more numerous specimens than the
                    Louvre, which boasts of four landscapes and six panels with still life; then
                    come Berlin and Amsterdam with four fruit and flower pieces; then St Petersburg,
                    Munich, Hanover, Dresden, The Hague, Brunswick, Vienna, Carlsruhe, and
                    Copenhagen.</p>
