                <p><label type="entry">HOOK, <hi rend="smallcaps">Theodore Edward</hi></label>
                    (1788-1841), novelist, dramatist, and improvisatore, was born in London 2 2d
                    September 1788. At Harrow he received but a scant education, and although he
                    subsequently matriculated at Oxford he never actually resided at the university.
                    Indeed he seems to have abandoned all thought of serious study about 1802, on
                    the death of his mother, <hi rend="italic">née</hi> Madden, a lady of singular
                    beauty and ability. The father, James Hook, a composer of some distinction, took
                    great delight in exhibiting the extraordinary musical and metrical gifts of the
                    stripling, and before many months the precocious Theodore had become “the little
                    pet lion of the green room.” At the age of sixteen he scored a dramatic success
                    with <hi rend="italic">The Soldier's Return,</hi> a comic opera, and this he
                    rapidly followed up with a series of over a dozen sparkling ventures, the
                    instant popularity of which was hardly dependent on the inimitable acting of
                    Liston and Mathews. But an overweening love of society withheld Hook from a
                    lucrative career as a dramatic author, and for some ten of the best years of his
                    life he gave himself up to the pleasures of the town, winning a foremost place
                    in the world of fashion by his matchless powers of improvisation and mimicry,
                    and startling the public by the audacity of his practical jokes. His unique gift
                    of impromptu minstrelsy “mystified” Sheridan, astonished Coleridge, and
                    eventually charmed the Prince Regent into a declaration that “something must be
                    done for Hook.” The prince was as good as his word, and the victim of social
                    success was appointed accountant-general and treasurer of the Mauritius with a
                    salary of £2000 a year. For five delightful years Hook was the life and soul of
                    the island, but in 1817, a serious deficiency having been discovered in the
                    treasury accounts, he was arrested and brought to England on a criminal charge.
                    It transpired that a sum of about &lt;£12,000 had been abstracted by a deputy
                    official, and for this amount Hook was held responsible.</p>
                <p>During the tardy scrutiny of the audit board he lived obscurely and maintained
                    himself by writing for magazines <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">John Bull,</hi> the champion of high Toryism and the virulent
                    detractor of Queen Caroline. Witty, incisive criticism and pitiless invective
                    secured a large circulation for the newspaper, and from this source alone Hook
                    derived, for the first year at least, an income of £2000. In the midst of his
                    labours, however, he was arrested for the second time on account of his debt to
                    the state, which he made no effort to defray. Confined for eight months in a
                    sponging-house, he issued thence the first series of his lively <hi
                    rend="italic">Sayings and Doings</hi> (3d series, 1828). On his liberation he
                    continued to work with his pen indefatigably, pouring forth in the remaining
                    twenty-three years of his life no fewer than thirty-eight volumes, besides
                    numberless articles, squibs, and sketches. His novels are not works of enduring
                    interest, but they are saved from mediocrity by frequent passages of racy
                    narrative and vivid portraiture. The best are <hi rend="italic">Maxwell</hi>
                    (1830), <hi rend="italic">Love and Pride</hi> (1833), the autobiographic <hi
                    rend="italic">Gilbert Gurney</hi> (1835), <hi rend="italic">Jack Brag</hi>
                    (1837), <hi rend="italic">Gurney Married</hi> (1839), and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Peregrine Bunce</hi> (1841). Incessant work had already begun to tell on his
                    health, when Hook returned to his old social habits, and a prolonged attempt to
                    combine industry and dissipation resulted in the sad confession that he was
                    “done up in purse, in mind, and in body too at last.” He died 24th August 1841.
                    His writings in great part are of a purely ephemeral character; the less
                    transient, touched though they be with a sparkling fancy, have long since passed
                    out of favour; while the greatest triumphs of the improvisatore may be said to
                    have been writ in wine. Putting aside, however, his claim to literary greatness,
                    Hook will be remembered as one of the most brilliant, genial, and original
                    figures of Georgian times.</p>
