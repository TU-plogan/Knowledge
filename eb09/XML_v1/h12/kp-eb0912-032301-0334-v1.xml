                    (1725-1799), English admiral, was born in 1725. By his father Emanuel Scrope
                    Howe, second Viscount Howe in the Irish peerage, he was descended from an old
                    family, several members of which attained distinction in war or in politics; and
                    his mother was the daughter of Baron Kielmansegge, master of the horse to George
                    I, when elector of Hanover. Leaving Eton at the age of fourteen, Howe entered
                    the navy as midshipman on board the “Severn,’’ which then formed one of a
                    squadron under Anson destined for an expedition against Spain in the Pacific.
                    Nothing is recorded as to the manner in which he conducted himself in the
                    actions in which the squadron engaged, but he at any rate succeeded in winning
                    the approval of his commander, and in his twentieth year was made lieutenant.
                    Shortly after this he was appointed to the command of a sloop-of-war, the
                    “Baltimore,” in which with the aid of the “Greyhound” frigate, commanded by
                    Captain Noel, he signalized himself by defeating ofi ’ the coast of Scotland two
                    French vessels, of greatly superior metal to his own, which were carrying
                    supplies and reinforcements to the Pretender. On his arrival in England he found
                    that previous to this action he had been raised to the rank of postcaptain, and
                    he served in this capacity on the coast of Guinea and on the Jamaica station. In
                    1748 he returned to England, and after spending three years chiefly in the study
                    of naval tactics, he was in 1751 appointed to the “Glory,” of 44 guns, and
                    employed on the coast of Africa. In May 1752 he was commissioned to the
                    “Dolphin” frigate, in which he was employed for some years in protecting the
                    trade in the vicinity of Gibraltar. Shortly after his return to England he was
                    appointed in 1755 to the “Dunkirk,” and joined the squadron of Admiral Boscawen,
                    bound for America. Tn the course of the voyage thither Howe took a prominent
                    part in capturing two French men-of-war, the “Alcide’’and the “Lys.” This action
                    was virtually the commencement of the seven years’ war with France, in the
                    course of which Howe in command of a small squadron succeeded in capturing from
                    the French the island of Chaussé, and, after obtaining a commission to the
                    “Magnanime,” distinguished himself in the attacks made on the Isle of Aix, St
                    Malo, and Cherbourg, manifested conspicuous courage and readiness of resource at
                    the disaster of St Cas, and in the action with the French fleet under De
                    Conflans disabled two of the enemy’s ships. Shortly before the close of the war
                    Howe had married, and by the death of his brother Viscount Howe had inherited
                    the family titles and estates. From 1758 till 1782 he represented Dartmouth in
                    parliament; in the latter year he was raised to the British peerage as Viscount
                    Howe. In 1763 he received a seat at the board of admiralty, and in June 1765 he
                    was appointed to the important office of treasurer of the navy, which he
                    retained till August 1770. In October of this latter year he was made
                    rear-admiral of the blue, and nominated commander in chief of the fleet intended
                    to be employed in the Mediterranean in view of a probable rupture with Spain,
                    which, however, did not take place. In 1775 he was promoted rear-admiral of the
                    white, and in the following year he received the command of the squadron
                    despatched to America, but owing to the insufficiency of his force he achieved
                    no exploit of importance. After his return to England he was in September 1782
                    appointed to the command of the Channel fleet, and ordered to proceed to the
                    relief of Gibraltar, then besieged by the combined land and sea forces of France
                    and Spain, when after sυe-ceeding in supplying the garrison with stores and
                    provisions <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0912-0335-0324"/> he engaged at long ranges the united fleet which
                    numbered 44 sail to his 34, and caused them to retreat to Cadiz. In January 1783
                    Howe succeeded Keppel as first lord of the admiralty, an office which he
                    resigned in the following April, but again accepted under the Pitt ministry,
                    holding it till July 1788. In July 1787 he was made admiral of the white, and
                    shortly afterwards was raised to an earldom. In 1790 he was appointed to the
                    command of a fleet intended to operate against the Spaniards, but peace was
                    concluded before any action took place. On the commencement of the war with
                    France after the Revolution he obtained the chief command in the Channel, and on
                    the 1st of June 1794 gained a great victory over the French fleet oflf Ushant,
                    dismasting ten of the enemy’s ships and taking seven, one of which, the
                    “Vengeur,” sank as she was being towed away. On the 9th August of the same year
                    he resumed the command of the Channel fleet, but in none of his cruises was he
                    fortunate enough to meet any of the enemy’s vessels; and during the greater part
                    of 1795 and 1796 ill health compelled him to remain on shore. In May 1797 he
                    resigned his command. In the same year he was appointed with full powers to
                    treat with the mutineers in the British fleet at Portsmouth and Spithead, and
                    completely succeeded, through the confidence they had in the friendliness of his
                    intentions, and by the firm and judicious measures he adopted, in eradicating
                    the causes of discontent. During the latter years of his life Lord Howe suffered
                    much from ill health; and he died under a violent attack of gout, August 5,
                    1799. A splendid monument was erected to Howe in St Paul’s Cathedral.</p>
                <p>Lord Howe is entitled to the exceptional praise of never having failed to bear
                    himself with credit and success in any of his enterprises. The qualities in
                    which he excelled were coolness, firmness, seamanship, and caution—an excess of
                    the latter virtue, however, tending perhaps on some occasions to diminish the
                    lustre and completeness of his victories. He introduced a new and thorough
                    system of naval tactics, evolutions, and signals, and bestowed careful and
                    minute attention on all the details of the service. In person he was tall and
                    well-proportioned. His countenance was strongly marked, somewhat harsh in
                    expression except when softened by his genial smile, and dark in
                    complexion—although the <hi rend="italic">sobriquet</hi> of Black Dick by which
                    he was known in the navy was not due to this circumstance, but to a mezzotinto
                    portrait of himself which hung in his cabin. The benevolent friendliness of his
                    disposition secured him the strong affection and confidence as well as respect
                    of his seamen, while no professional jealousy prevented him from doing full
                    justice to the achievements of his officers.</p>
