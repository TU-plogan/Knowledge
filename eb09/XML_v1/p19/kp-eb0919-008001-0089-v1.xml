                <p><label type="entry">PICKLES</label>. The term pickte was originally applied to
                    herrings preserved in salt brine, and by a pickle is still meant any
                    preservative solution for either animal or vegetable food, that for flesh and
                    fish being a brine of common salt, usually with saltpetre, sugar, and certain
                    spices added, while for vegetable substances vinegar is the principal pickling
                    medium. Preparations of the latter description—vegetables saturated with
                    vinegar—constitute the ordinary pickles of domestic use. Acid fruits and
                    succulent fleshy vegetables are the proper τpaterials for pickles.</p>
                <p>The vegetable substances principally treated in this way are—beetroot, cabbage,
                    cauliflower, gherkins (small cucumbers), capers, French beans, onions, shallots,
                    mushrooms, green peaches, mangoes, green walnuts, and several tropical fruits
                    besides those mentioned. These are variously dealt with. Such as are soft-and in
                    themselves hot and spicy require simply to have vinegar of the proper strength
                    poured over them, after the materials have been carefully selected, washed, and,
                    if necessary, shred. Vegetable substances of a harder and tougher character
                    require first tobe steeped in salt brine for some time, then washed, and the
                    vinegar poured over them hot; and yet more leathery and fibrous vegetables must
                    be softened with boiling brine,, and then prepared with boiling vinegar. The
                    vinegar employed may be either wood or strong malt vinegar; the. former, being
                    free from mucilage, has no tendency to fermentation, and can be obtained of
                    greater strength than that, prepared from malt. The vinegar is commonly
                    flavoured with spices or aromatic herbs, flavours being chosen with special
                    reference to the fruit or vegetable operated on. The·, flavouring materials, of
                    which pepper, allspice, red pepper, cloves, horse-radish, garlic, and ginger are
                    examples, are either added whole to the pickle or may be separately infused in
                    the vinegar. For the preservation of pickles it. is necessary that the jars in
                    which they are stored should be secured with stoppers tied over with bladder and
                    sealed; so as to render them as far as possible air-tight. It is of the utmost
                    consequence that in the compounding and storing of these acid preparations no
                    vessels or fittings of copper, brass, zinc, or lead, which yield, with acetic
                    acid, poisonous products, should be used. Contamination with copper is
                    especially to be avoided; yet, as small quantities of acetate of copper give to
                    pickled vegetables a fine, fresh green, natural colour, such an adulteration is
                    not unfrequently practised; and some of the older cookery books actually
                    recommend the use of copper vessels, and even the addition of small pieces of
                    verdigris, to improve the colour of the pickles. As food adjuncts, pickles
                    should be sparingly used, their chief merit being piquancy, though the acid they
                    contain exercises a solvent influence on the more directly nutritious
                    constituents of food, and, the added spices having a stimulating effect, they
                    thus aid the process of digestion.</p>
