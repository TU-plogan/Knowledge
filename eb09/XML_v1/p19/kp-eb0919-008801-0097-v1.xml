                <p><label type="entry">PIKE</label>, freshwater fishes generally distributed over
                    the rivers and lakes of Europe, northern Asia, and North America, and forming a
                    small family <hi rend="italic">(Esocidae)</hi> of Soft-rayed Fishes. They are
                    readily recognized by their elongate compressed body covered with small scales,
                    a long head, long and spatulate snout, and very large mouth armed with strong
                    and long teeth in the jaws and broad bands of smaller teeth on the palate and
                    tongue. The teeth point backwards or can be depressed so as to offer no
                    obstruction to any object entering the gape, but prevent its withdrawal in the
                    opposite direction. The dorsal and anal fins are placed far back on the tail,
                    thus greatly increasing the propelling power of the fish, and, although pike are
                    bad swimmers and lead rather a sedentary than a roving life, they are excelled
                    by no other freshwater fish in rapidity of motion when, by a single stroke of
                    the tail, they dash upon their prey or dart out of reach of danger. In the Old
                    World one species only is known <hi rend="italic">(Esox lucius),</hi> which
                    prefers lakes and sluggish reaches of rivers to strong currents or agitated
                    waters. Its eastward range in northern Asia is not known; it extends into
                    Lapland in the north and into central Italy <pb break="no"

                    but is absent in the Iberian Peninsula. The European species occurs also in
                    North America, and is common in the eastern United States southwards to northern
                    Ohio. But North America is tenanted by other species of pike besides, of which
                    the largest is the Muskelunge or Maskinonge of the Great Lakes <hi rend="italic"

                    other American pike are of smaller size, and generally named “Pickerel”; but
                    opinions as to the distinction of the species differ widely among American
                    ichthyologists. The European pike, like its brethren, is the most voracious of
                    freshwater fishes; it probably exceeds the shark, to which it has been compared
                    by many writers, in the relative quantity of food it consumes. Ponds would soon
                    be depopulated but for its cannibal propensities, no pike being safe from
                    another of its own kind large enough to swallow it. To the young of water-fowl
                    pike are most destructive, and large specimens will seize rats or rabbits when
                    they take to the water, and are said to attack even foxes and small dogs.
                    Individuals of from forty to fifty pounds are not scarce, but captures of much
                    larger ones are on record. Pike are wholesome food, and much esteemed in inland
                    countries,—the smaller (of 20 to 24 inches in length) being preferred to the
                    larger individuals. They are prolific, and not easily exterminated in a water in
                    which they have been once allowed to spawn. According to season and climate they
                    spawn in April or May, and sometimes as early as February.</p>
