                    >Puteoli,</hi><hi rend="italic">a</hi> city of Italy, on the northern shore of
                    the Bay of Pozzuoli (Sinus Puteolanus or Cumanus),—the western portion of the
                    Gulf of Naples, separated from the larger eastern portion by the promontory of
                    Posilliρo and from the open sea on the west by the peninsula which terminates in
                    Cape Miseno. It is a place of 11,967 inhabitants (1881) and the centre of a
                    commune, which, including Bacoli (3130; the ancient Bauli) and Nisida (1202),
                    numbers 17,269. Its small flat-roofed houses cluster picturesquely on a tongue
                    of land projecting south-west into the bay. The cathedral of St Proculus
                    occupies the site of a temple erected to Augustus by L. Calpurnius and contains
                    the tomb of Pergolesi. The harbour is still visited by 500 or 600 sailing
                    vessels in the course of the year. But the true riches of Pozzuoli are its
                    ruins. First in point of interest is the Serapeum or temple of Serapis. This
                    consisted of a rectangular court enclosed by forty-eight massive columns and
                    having in the centre a round temple with sixteen Corinthian pillars of African
                    marble. The three great columns of the portico, about 40 feet high, still stand.
                    The perforations of a boring mollusc show that they must for a time have been
                    submerged 13 feet in the sea. The new upheaval of the ground appears to have
                    begun before 1530 and to have been hastened by the great Monte Nuovo eruption of
                    1538. A gradual subsidence has again been observed since the beginning of the
                    19th century. The pillars of the round temple are now in Caserta, and the statue
                    of Serapis is in the National Museum at Naples. The amphitheatre (482 feet long
                    by 383 broad), erected in the time of the Flavian dynasty on the hill behind the
                    town, was seated for 30,000 spectators, and had an arena 286 feet long and 138
                    feet broad. Among the populace the building is known as the Prison of St
                    Januarius, because, according to the legend, that saint and his companions were
                    here condemned to fight with wild beasts. At an earlier date it had been the
                    scene of the spectacle in which Nero, in presence of King Tiridates of Armenia,
                    displayed his personal prowess. To the west of the Serapeum lie traces of
                    various minor ruins, a temple of Neptune, &lt;fcc., and especially the site of
                    Cicero’s villa (Puteolanum or Academia), which was afterwards occupied by a
                    temple in honour of the emperor Hadrian. The whole neighbourhood has proved rich
                    in epigraphic remains.</p>
                <p>Puteoli first appears under the name of Dicaearchia as a port of the people of
                    Cumae. The statement made by Stephanus of Byzantium and Eusebius, that the city
                    was founded by a colony of Samians, probably refers to some secondary accession
                    of population from that quarter. The Romans in 215 B.c. introduced a garrison of
                    6000 men to protect the town from Hannibal; and in 194 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.c.</hi> a Roman colony was established. In the Civil War the citizens sided
                    first with Pompey and afterwards with Brutus and Cassius. Augustus strengthened
                    the colony with a body of his veterans (hence <hi rend="italic">Colonia
                    Augusta),</hi> and Nero admitted the old inhabitants into it. The remains of
                    Hadrian, who died at the neighbouring town of Baiae, were burned at Puteoli, and
                    Antoninus Pius, besides erecting the temple to his memory already mentioned,
                    instituted sacred games to be held in the city every five years. It was mainly,
                    however, as a great commercial port that Puteoli was famous in ancient times. It
                    was one of the two places in Italy (Rome was the other) where the Tyrian
                    merchants had a regular-trading station; it trafficked with Syria (merchants
                    from Berytus are mentiorred among its residents), Egypt, Africa, arrd Spain, and
                    spices from the East, corn from Alexandria, iron from Populonium were stored in
                    its warehouses. Like Ostia, Puteoli was considered a special port of Rome, and,
                    on account of the great safeness and convenience of its harbour, it was
                    preferred to Ostia for the landing of the more costly and delicate wares. Like
                    Ostia, consequently, it was treated as practically part of Rome, and with it
                    enjoyed the peculiar distinction of being enrolled in the Palatine tribe. The
                    artificial mole was probably of earlier date than the reign of Augustus; and by
                    that time there were docks large enough to contain the vessels employed in
                    bringing the obelisks from Egypt. Remains of the piles of the mole still exist,
                    and are popularly known as Caligula’s Bridge, from the mistaken idea that they
                    belong to the temporary structure which that emperor flung across the bay from
                    the mole at Puteoli to the shore at Baiae. Alarie (410), Genseric (455), and
                    Totila (545) successively laid Puteoli in ruins. The restoration effected, by
                    the Byzantines was partial and short-lived. Sacked by Grimoald of Beneventum in
                    715, harassed by the Saraceus in the 10th century, captured by John duke of
                    Naples in 1014, and again sacked by the Turks in 1550, the city could hardly
                    have continued prosperous even apart from the earthquakes of 1198 and 1538.</p>
                <p>Works on Puteoli have been written by Mazzella (1594), Capaccio (1604),
                    Sarnellius (1691), Parrino (1709), Jorio (1817 and 1830). See the bibliography
