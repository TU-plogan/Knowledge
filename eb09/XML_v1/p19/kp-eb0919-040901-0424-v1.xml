                    Vitebsk, at the confluence of the Polota with the Dwina (Düna), 5 miles from the
                    Smolensk and Riga Railway, is one of the oldest towns of Russia. The continuous
                    wars, however, of which, owing to its position on the line of communication
                    between central Russia and the west, it was for many centuries the scene, have
                    allowed almost nothing of its remarkable antiquities to remain. The “upper
                    castle” which stood at the confluence of the rivers and had a stone-wall with
                    seven towers, is now in ruins, as also is the “lower castle,” formerly enclosed
                    with strong walls and connected with the upper by a bridge. The numerous
                    monasteries and convents also have disappeared. The cathedral of St Sophia in
                    the upper castle, built in the 12th century, and successively used as a place of
                    worship by the Greek, the Catholic, and the “United” Churches, fell to ruins in
                    the 18th century, when the “United” bishop Grebnicki substituted a modern
                    structure. The town is now of trifling importance, and the population (12,200 in
                    1880, against 13,800 in 1865) is decreasing. Upwards of two-thirds of the
                    inhabitants are Jews; the remainder have belonged mostly to the Greek Church

                <p>Polotesk or Poltesk is mentioned in 862 as one of the towns given by Rurik to his
                    men, together with Byelo-ozero and Rostoff. In 980 it had a prince of its own,
                    Rogvolod,‘whose daughter is the subject of many legends. It remained an
                    independent principality until the 12th century, resisting the repeated attacks
                    of the princes of Kieff; those of Pskoff, Lithuania, and the Livonian knights,
                    however, proved more powerful, and it fell under Lithuanian rule in the
                    following century. About 1385 its independence was destroyed by the Lithuanian
                    prince Witowt. It was five times besieged by Moscow in 1500-18, and was taken by
                    John the Terrible in 1563. Recaptured by Stephen Batory sixteen years later, it
                    became Polish by the treaty of 1582. It was then a populous city, which,
                    enjoying the privileges of “Magdeburg law” from 1498, carried on an active
                    commerce, and covered a large area. Pestilences and conflagrations were its
                    ruin; the plague of 1566 wrought great havoc among its inhabitants, and that ot
                    1600 destroyed 15,000. The castles, the town, and its walls were burned in 1607
                    and 1642. The Russians continued their attacks, burning and plundering the town,
                    and twice taking possession of it for a few years, in 1633 and 1705. It was not
                    definitively annexed, however, to Russia until 1772, after the first
                    dismemberment of Poland. In 1812 its inhabitants resisted the French invasion,
                    and the town was partially destroyed.</p>
