                <p><label type="entry">PIRON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexis</hi></label> (1689-1773),
                    the foremost epigrammatist of France, was born at Dijon on the 9th July 1689.
                    His father, Aimé Piron, was an apothecary, but was also a frequent writer of
                    verse in Burgundian patois. Alexis began life as clerk and secretary to a
                    banker, and then studied law without any success or much seriousness. As a young
                    man he made himself notorious by the composition of a piece of licentious verse
                    which might have brought him into serious difficulties but for the good nature
                    of a high legal official, the president Bouhier. His sarcastic tongue made him
                    unpopular in his neighbourhood, and at last in 1719, when nearly thirty years
                    old, he went to seek his fortune at Paris. His first experiences were not very
                    encouraging, and he had to put up with the unpleasant and not very honourable
                    position of literary adviser and corrector to the Chevalier de Belle Isle. An
                    accident, however, brought him money and notoriety. The jealousy of the regular
                    actors produced an edict restricting the Théâtre de la Foire, or licensed booths
                    at fair times, to a single character on the stage. None of the ordinary writers
                    for this theatre, not even Lesage, would attempt a monologue-drama for the
                    purpose, and Piron obtained a footing as a dramatic author, much applause, and
                    three hundred crowns, with a piece called <hi rend="italic">Arlequin</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Deucalion.</hi> Thenceforward he was constantly employed for this
                    theatre, and not seldom for the more dignified Comédie Française, but with the
                    exception of the excellent verse comedy of <hi rend="italic">La Métromanie</hi>
                    no one of his comedies and none of his tragedies at all deserve mention. His
                    real vocation was that of an epigram maker, and this, though it made him not a
                    few enemies, recommended him to not a few patrons who supplied his necessities.
                    His most intimate associates, however, during the middle period of his life were
                    two ladies of talent though not of position, Mademoiselle Quinault, the actress,
                    and her friend Mademoiselle Quenaudon or De Bar, companion to a lady of rank.
                    She was slightly older than Piron and not beautiful, but after twenty years
                    acquaintance he married her in 1741, lived happily enough with her for four
                    years, and nursed her tenderly during an attack of madness which in other two
                    years proved fatal. He long outlived her, dying on the 21st January 1773 in his
                    eighty-fourth year. The discredit of his early literary misdeed, and perhaps his
                    indiscriminate habits of lampooning, prevented his election to the Academy,
                    certain persons having induced the king to interpose his veto. But Piron was
                    pensioned, and during the last half century of his life was never in any want.
                    He was a complete literary free-lance, and lampooned Fréron and Desfontaines as
                    sharply as he lampooned Voltaire and the <hi rend="italic">philosophe</hi>
                    coterie. Socially he was a rather loose liver, though probably, except on paper,
                    not worse than most of his contemporaries. He was a member of the somewhat
                    famous convivial society of the <hi rend="italic">Caveau.</hi> But his true
                    title to remembrance lies in his epigrams, one of which, the burlesque epitaph
                    on himself but reflecting on the Academy (see vol. viii. p. 496), is known to
                    almost everybody, while many others equal or surpass it in brilliancy. Grimm
                    called him a “machine à saillies,” and probably no man who ever lived possessed
                    more of the peculiarly French faculty of sharply pointed verbal wit than he. It
                    is noteworthy too that he was as ready with conversational retort as with his
                    pen.</p>
                <p>Piron published, his own theatrical works in 1758, and after his death his friend
                    and literary executor Rigollot de Juvigny published his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Oeuvres Complètes.</hi> During the last thirty years a good deal of unpublished
                    work has been added by MM. Bonhomme, Lalanne, and others. But the epigrams,
                    which take up but little room and have been frequently reissued in various
                    selections, are alone of great importance.</p>
