                <p><label type="entry">PROVINS</label>, a town of France, at the head of an
                    arrondissement of the department of Seine-et-Marne, at the junction of the
                    Durtain with the Voulzie (an affluent of the Seine), 59 miles south-east of
                    Paris by a branch railway which rejoins the main line from Paris to Belfort at
                    Longueville (4 miles from Provins). While the town derives a certain reputation
                    from its mineral waters (which contain iron, lime, and carbonic acid, and are
                    used for bathing and drinking), and is also known from its trade in roses
                    (incorrectly called Provence roses) for certain minor industries (such as the
                    making of “conserves” and colouring bonbons), a far higher interest attaches to
                    it as a place which during the Middle Ages enjoyed great prosperity and still
                    preserves, in proof of its former import? ance, a number of historical
                    monuments. There still remains a great part of the 13th-century line of
                    fortifications, which makes a circuit of about 4 miles, encloses an area of
                    about 300 acres, ⅛ strengthened at intervals by towers, generally round, and
                    now, being bordered with fine trees, forms the principal promenade of the town.
                    The large tower, situated within this line and variously known as the king’s,
                    Caesar’s, or the prisoners’ tower, is one of the most curious of the
                    12th-century keeps now extant. The base is surrounded by a thick mound of
                    masonry added by the English in the 15th century when they were masters of the
                    town. The tower serves as steeple to the church of St Quiriace, which, dating
                    its foundation from the 12th century, presents some exquisite features and
                    preserves among its treasures the pontifical ornaments of St Edmund of
                    Canterbury. The palace of the counts of Champagne, some fragments of which also
                    belong to the 12th century, is occupied by the communal college. The old
                    tithe-barn is a strange erection of the 13th century with noteworthy fireplaces,
                    windows, and vaulting. Various portions of the church of St Ayoul date from the
                    11 th, 13th, 14th, and 16th centuries respectively; but it is in a state of
                    great dilapidation, and part of it is used as a fodder-store. Ste Croix belongs
                    partially to the 13th century. On Mont Ste Catherine opposite Provins the
                    general hospital occupies the site of an old convent of St Clare, of which there
                    remains a cloister of the 13th century. The population of the town in 1881 was
                    6949.</p>
                <p>Provins begins to figure in history in the 9th century. Passing from the counts
                    of Vermandois to the counts of Champagne it rapidly attained a high degree of
                    prosperity. Its fairs, attended by traders from all parts of Europe, were of as
                    much account as those of Beaucaire. They were held twice a year, in spring and
                    autumn, and fixed the price of provisions for the intervening months. In the
                    13th century the population of the town is said to have reached 60,000; but the
                    plague of 1348 and the famine of 1349 proved exceedingly disastrous. The War of
                    the Hundred Years, during which Provins was captured and recaptured, completed
                    the ruin of the unfortunate town. During the religious wars it sided with the
                    Catholic party and the League, and Henry IV. obtained possession of it in 1592
                    only after thirteen days’ siege.</p>
