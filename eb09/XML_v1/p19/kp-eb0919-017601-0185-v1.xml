                    name given to plants with broad palm-like leaves. This is the case with certain

                    <hi rend="italic">Musa,</hi> to all of which the term is popularly applied. Of

                    These are gigantic herbs, now diffused by cultivation throughout the tropics of
                    both hemispheres, and sending up from a short thick underground stem shoots with
                    a number of very large leaves, whose long, thick leafstalks are wrapped one
                    round another. The blades are usually oblong-obtuse, like the blade of an oar,
                    with a very thick midrib from which diverge on each side numerous parallel
                    densely arranged secondary ribs. The flowers are borne in huge pendulous spikes
                    provided with large boatshaped, often coloured, bracts, in whose axils the
                    whorls of flowers are produced; the lower ones are usually female or
                    hermaphrodite, those at the apex of the spike are male only. These flowers
                    consist of a perianth of six divisions partly united below, slightly two-lipped
                    above, and enclosing five perfect and one imperfect stamen. The ovary is
                    inferior and three-celled—ripening into a long oblong fruit filled with spongy
                    pulp, in which the numerous seeds are embedded. The accumulation of starch and
                    sugar in this pulp renders the fruit of vast importance as an article of diet in
                    the tropics. Corenwinder, cited by Pavy, says that, while starchy matter forms
                    more than 19 per cent, of the ripe fruit—there is also nearly 5 per cent, of
                    nitrogenous matter, about double that of the potato. The plant requires but
                    little attention, and the produce from a relatively small area is enormous;
                    hence it is one of the most valuable of all food-plants. After fruiting, the
                    stem dies down, but provision for new growth is made by the production from the
                    underground stock of numerous offsets. The number of varieties is very great, a
                    circumstance which in itself testifies to the long period during which the plant
                    has been cultivated. It is also the more remarkable in that perfect seeds are
                    comparatively rarely produced, the inference being that the different forms have
                    arisen from bud variations or “sports.” In spite of the vast number of varieties
                    grown in the tropics of both hemispheres—varieties mostly dependent on
                    diversities in the size, form, and flavour of the fruit—the general opinion
                    among botanists is that they have all sprung from one species, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Musa sapientum</hi> of Brown. Were it otherwise, it is presumed
                    that the varieties found in America would be different from the Asiatic ones,
                    and these again from those found in the South Sea Islands, &lt;fcc.; but, as a
                    matter of fact, there are no geographic limitations, the same varieties being
                    found in different quarters of the globe. The varieties are arranged under two
                    heads by Desvaux according to the size of their fruit —the bananas, with fruit
                    7-15 inches in length, and the fig bananas, with fruit from 1-6 inches long; but
                    these variations are not constant, and Schomburgk has recorded a case in which a
                    spike of the fig banana bore numerous fruits proper to that variety, and in
                    addition a large number of fruits like those of the Chinese dwarf-plantain, <hi
                    rend="italic">Musa chinensis,</hi> the Cavendish banana of gardens—a case
                    analogous to, but even more remarkable than, the not infrequent occurrence of
                    peaches and nectarines on the same branch. The plantain and the banana are
                    sometimes spoken of as distinct. The former has a green stem and yellow angular
                    fruit not fit for eating till cooked. The banana (J∕. <hi rend="italic"
                    >sapientum)</hi> has the stem marked with purple spots, and a shorter more
                    cylindric fruit which may be eaten without cooking, but the two run one into the
                    other so that no absolute distinction can be drawn between them. The species
                    have been found in a wild state in Chittagong and Khasia, in the Philippine
                    Islands, in Siam, and in Ceylon, but nowhere truly wild on the American
                    continent.</p>
                <p>Throughout tropical and subtropical Asia the plant has numerous and diverse
                    native names; and it was mentioned by old Greek and Latin authors. On the other
                    hand, there are no native names for the plant in Mexico, Peru, or Brazil. From
                    such considerations as these Alphonse de Candolle, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Origine</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes</hi><hi rend="italic">Cultivées,</hi>
                    sums up the evidence by asserting the Asiatic origin of the plantain and its
                    early introduction into America by the Spaniards or Portuguese. If it should
                    turn out that the banana or the plantain existed in America before the discovery
                    of that continent, then Μ. de Candolle would attribute that circumstance to some
                    fortuitous introduction at no very remote date rather than to the simultaneous
                    existence of the banana as an indigenous plant in both hemispheres.</p>
                <p>It is not only for their fruit that these plants are valuable. The leaves are
                    used for thatching, and the abundant fibre they contain forms a good substitute
                    for hemp. <hi rend="italic">Musa</hi><hi rend="italic">textilis</hi> is of
                    special value from this point of view. The Abyssinian banana, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Μ. Ensete,</hi> has dry capsular fruit, and very handsome foliage.</p>
