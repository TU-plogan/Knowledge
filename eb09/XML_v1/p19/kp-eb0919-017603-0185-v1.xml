                    (1514-1589), born in a village near Tours (probably Saint-Avertin) in 1514,
                    learned book-binding and book-selling at Caen, and, having married in that town,
                    settled in 1549 as bookbinder in Antwerp, then the principal commercial town of
                    the Netherlands, where he was soon known as the first in his profession. A bad
                    wound in the arm, which unfitted him for this occupation, seems to have been the
                    cause that first led him (about 1555) to apply himself to typography. The first
                    known book printed in his office was <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutione</hi><hi rend="italic">di una fanciulla nata nobilmente,</hi> by J.
                    Μ. Bruto, with a French translation, and this was soon followed by many other
                    works in French and Latin, which in point of execution rivalled the best
                    printing of his time, while the masters in the art of engraving then flourishing
                    in the Netherlands illustrated many of his editions. In 1562, Plantin himself
                    being absent in Paris, his workmen printed an heretical pamphlet, which caused
                    his movables to be seized and sold. It seems, however, that he recovered a great
                    deal of the'money, and in 1563 he associated himself with some friends to carry
                    on his business on a larger scale. Among them were two grand-nephews of Dan.

                    a position to spare no expense in printing his books with all the care he deemed
                    necessary; and his editions of the Bible in Hebrew, Latin, and Dutch, his <hi
                    rend="italic">Corpus Juris,</hi> Latin and Greek classics, and many other works
                    produced at this period are renowned for their beautiful execution and accuracy.
                    A much greater enterprise was planned by him in those years—the publication of a
                    <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi rend="italic">Polyglotta,</hi> which should fix
                    the original text of Old and New Testaments on a scientific basis. In spite of
                    clerical opposition he was supported by Philip II. king of Spain, who sent him
                    the learned Benedictus Arias Montanus to take the leading part in the work of
                    editorship. With his zealous help the work was finished in five years (1569-73,
                    8 vols. fol.). Plantin earned much renown by it, but little profit, or rather
                    less than none; but in compensation he received the privilege of printing all
                    liturgical books for the states of King Philip, and the office of
                    “prototypo-graphus regius,” which carried with it the oversight over all
                    printers in the Netherlands, a charge of which Plantin seems to have acquitted
                    himself indifferently. This need not surprise us, when we know that Plantin,
                    though outwardly a faithful son of the church, was till his death the partisan
                    of a mystical sect of heretics; and it is now proved that many of their books
                    published without the name of a printer came from his presses together with the
                    missals, breviaries, &amp;c., for the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
                <p>Besides the polyglott Bible, Plantin published in those years many other works of
                    note, such as editions of St Augustine and St Jerome, the botanical works of
                    Dodonaeus, Clusius, and Lobelius, the description of the Netherlands by
                    Guicciardini, &lt;fcc. In 1575 his printing-office reckoned more than twenty
                    presses and seventy-three workmen, besides a similar number that worked for the
                    office at home. But soon there came bad times for Antwerp. In November 1576 the
                    town was plundered and in part burnt by the Spaniards, and Plantin had to pay an
                    exorbitant ransom. A great many inhabitants of the once flourishing city
                    emigrated, and Plantin also thought of settling elsewhere. He established a
                    branch of his office in Paris; and when in 1583 the states of Holland sought a
                    typographer for the newly erected university at Leyden, and invited him to
                    occupy this place, he left his much reduced business in Antwerp to his
                    sons-in-law John Moerentorf (Moretus) and Francis van Ravel-inghen
                    (Raphelengius), and settled at Leyden. But he could not thrive, it seems, in
                    Holland. When in 1585 Antwerp was taken by the prince of Parma and affairs
                    became there more settled, he left the office in Leyden to Raphelengius and
                    returned to Antwerp, excusing himself for having served the states of the
                    revolted provinces by the difficulties of his situation. In Antwerp he laboured
                    till his death on the 1st July 1589. His son-in-law, John Moretus, and his
                    descendants continued to print many works of note “in officina Plantiniana,” but
                    from the second half of the 17th century the house began to decline. It
                    continued, however, in the possession of the Moretus family, which religiously
                    left all the old things in the office untouched, and when in 1876 the town of
                    Antwerp acquired the old buildings with all their contents, for 1,200,000
                    francs, the authorities were able with little trouble to create one of the most
                    remarkable museums in existence (Musée Plantin, opened 19th August 1877).</p>
