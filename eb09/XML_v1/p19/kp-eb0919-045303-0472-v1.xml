                    (1814-1867), French dramatist, was born at Vienne in Dauphiné on the 1st June
                    1814. He was bred a lawyer, and his first performance in literature was a
                    translation of <hi rend="italic">Manfred</hi> (1837). But the first important,
                    and indeed the most important, event of his life was the representation of his
                    play <hi rend="italic">Lucrèce</hi> at the Théâtre Français on the 1st April
                    1843. This date is a kind of epoch in literary and dramatic history, because it
                    has been supposed to mark a reaction against the romantic style of Dumas and
                    Hugo. In reality, however, Ponsard was only a romantic of a somewhat tamer
                    genius than those who had gone before him. It so happened that the tastes and
                    capacities of the most popular actress of the day, Rachel, suited his style of
                    drama, and this contributed greatly to his own popularity. He followed up <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucrèce</hi> with <hi rend="italic">Agnès de Méranie</hi> (1846),
                    <hi rend="italic">Charlotte Corday</hi> (1850), and others. Ponsard accepted the
                    empire, though with no very great enthusiasm, and received the post of librarian
                    to the senate, which, however, he soon resigned, fighting a bloodless<pb
                    break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0919-0473-0454"/> duel with a journalist on the subject. <hi
                    rend="italic">L'Honneur et L'Argent,</hi> one of his most successful plays, was
                    acted in 1853, and he became an Academician in 1855. For some years he did
                    little, but in 1866 he obtained great success with <hi rend="italic">Le</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Lion</hi><hi rend="italic">Amoureux.</hi> He died a year later at
                    Paris in July 1867, soon after his nomination to the commandership of the Legion
                    of Honour. His widow was pensioned. Ponsard is no doubt in some ways a
                    remarkable dramatist. Unlike most men who have achieved considerable success on
                    the stage, he did not overwrite himself, and most of his plays hold a certain
                    steady level of literary and dramatic ability. But, as has been said, his
                    popularity is in the main due to the fact that he found an actress ready to hand
                    for his pieces, and that his appearance coincided with a certain public
                    weariness of the grander but also more extravagant and unequal style of
                    1830.</p>
