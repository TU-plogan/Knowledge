                    Jaπya,</hi> sur-named lbn Eadja or Ibn Sayeg <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> son
                    of the goldsmith), whose name has been corrupted by the Latins into Avem-pace,
                    Avenpace, or Aben Pace, was the earliest and one of the most distinguished of
                    the Arab philosophers in Spain. Almost nothing is known of the events in his
                    life; he was born, probably at Saragossa, towards the close of the 11th century,
                    and died at Fez in 1138 at a not very advanced age. Like most of the Arab
                    philosophers, h√ was a physician by profession, and he is also said to have been
                    a man of wide general culture. He was a skilled musician, mathematician,
                    astronomer, and poet, and though he is now known only through his metaphysical
                    speculations, these do not seem to have been his favourite studies. His
                    writings, if we accept the report of Oceibia, were varied and numerous. Several
                    treatises on logical subjects are mentioned by Casiri as still among the MSS. at
                    the Escurial, and some smaller pieces are also found in other <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit03newyrich/page/n160/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0903-0160-0145"/> libraries. The most important of his works is
                    that noticed by Averroes, who promised a complete discussion of it, but
                    unfortunately neither the treatise nor the exposition has come down to us. Our
                    knowledge of it is almost entirely drawn from the notices given by Moses of
                    Narbonne, a Jewish writer of the 14th century, in his commentary on the somewhat
                    similar work of Ibn Tofail. The title of the work may be translated as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Régime</hi><hi rend="italic">or Conduct of the Solitary,</hi>
                    understanding by that the organised system of rules, by obedience to which the
                    individual may rise from the mere life of the senses to the perception of pure
                    intelligible principles, and may participate in the divine thought which
                    sustains the world. These rules for the individual are but the image or reflex
                    of the political organisation of the perfect or ideal state; and the man who
                    strives to lead this life is called the <hi rend="italic">solitary,</hi> not
                    because he withdraws from society, but because, while in it, he remains a
                    stranger to its ways, and guides himself by reference to a higher state, an
                    ideal society. Avempace does not develop at any length this curious Platonic
                    idea of the perfect state. His object is to discover the highest end of human
                    life, and with this view he classifies the various activities of the human soul,
                    rejects such as are material or animal, and then analyses the various spiritual
                    forms to which the activities may be directed. He points out the graduated scale
                    of such forms, through which the soul may rise, and shows that none are final or
                    complete in themselves, except the pure intelligible forms, the ideas of ideas.
                    These the intellect can grasp, and in so doing it becomes what he calls <hi
                    rend="italic">intellectus acquisitus,</hi> and is in a measure divine. This
                    self-consciousness of pure reason is the highest object of human activity, and
                    is to be attained by the speculative method. The intellect has in itself power
                    to know ultimate truth and intelligence, and does not require a mystical
                    illumination as Algazali taught. Avempace’s principles, it is clear, lead
                    directly to the Averroistic doctrine of the unity of intellect, but the
                    obscurity and incompleteness of the <hi rend="italic">Régime</hi> do not permit
                    us to judge how far he anticipated the later thinker. (See Munk, <hi
                    rend="italic">Mélanges</hi><hi rend="italic">de Phil.</hi><hi rend="italic"
