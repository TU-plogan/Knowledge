                <p><label type="entry">AYLMER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, Bishop of
                    London in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was born in the year 1521 at
                    Aylmer-hall, in the parish of Tilney, in the county of Norfolk. Whilst a boy, he
                    was noticed for his precocity by the marquis of Dorset, afterwards duke of
                    Suffolk, who sent him to the university of Cambridge. He afterwards proceeded to
                    Oxford, where he completed his studies and took his degree in divinity. He was
                    then made chaplain to the duke and tutor to his daughter, the accomplished and
                    unfortunate Lady Jane Grey, whose extraordinary proficiency in the Greek and
                    Latin languages reflects no small honour on her preceptor. His first preferment
                    was to the archdeaconry of Stow, in the diocese of Lincoln, which gave him a
                    seat in the Convocation held in the first year of Queen Mary, where he
                    resolutely opposed the return to Popery, to which the generality of the clergy
                    were inclined. He was soon after obliged to fly his country, and take shelter
                    among the Protestants in Switzerland. While there he wrote a reply to Knox’s
                    famous <hi rend="italic">Blast against the Monstrous Regiment of Women,</hi>
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">An Harborowe for Faithfull and</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Treue</hi><hi rend="italic">Subjects,</hi> &amp;c. On the
                    accession of Queen Elizabeth he returned to England. In 1562 he obtained the
                    archdeaconry of Lincoln, and was a member of the famous synod of that year,
                    which reformed and settled the doctrine and discipline of the Church of England.
                    In 1576 he was consecrated bishop of London, and while in that position made
                    himself notorious by the harsh manner in which he insisted on the Act of
                    Uniformity. His persecution of the Puritans, and of any clergymen suspected of
                    Puritanical leanings, with the extreme measures he used, made him unpopular even
