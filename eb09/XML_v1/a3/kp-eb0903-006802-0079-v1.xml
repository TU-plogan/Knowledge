                <p><label type="entry">AUCKLAND, <hi rend="smallcaps">William Eden,
                    Baron</hi></label>, an eminent diplomatist and politician, third son of Sir
                    Robert Eden, Bart., of West Auckland, was born in 1744. He was educated at Eton
                    and Oxford, and adopted the profession of the law. At the age of twenty-seven he
                    resigned his practice at the bar, and engaged in political life as
                    under-secretary to Lord Suffolk. By the favour of the duke of Marlborough, he
                    obtained a seat for Woodstock, and soon gave proof of his ability in the House.
                    He attached himself to Lord North’s party, and after serving under Lord Carlisle
                    on the unsuccessful commission to the colonists in America, acted as secretary
                    to that nobleman, when he held the post of viceroy in Ireland. During this time
                    he had obtained the offices of director and auditor of Greenwich Hospital, which
                    probably yielded him an income sufficient for carrying on his political career.
                    In 1783 he took a leading part in negotiating the remarkable coalition between
                    North and Fox, and was rewarded by being made vice-treasurer of Ireland. In 1784
                    he opposed Pitt’s proposal for commercial reciprocity with Ireland, but in so
                    doing contrived to separate himself to some extent from his own party, and
                    shortly after accepted from Pitt the office of plenipotentiary at Paris. Here he
                    successfully negotiated the important commercial treaty with France; and after
                    his appointment as ambassador to Spain, he rendered valuable service in settling
                    the dispute between the British and French Governments with regard to the
                    affairs of Holland. In 1789 he was made an Irish peer, with the title of Baron
                    Auckland, and in 1793 he was raised to the British peerage as Baron Auckland, of
                    West Auckland, Durham. For three years, 1798-1801, he held office as
                    postmaster-general. He died suddenly in 1814. In 1776 he married the sister of
                    the first earl of Minto, by whom he had a large family. Besides numerous
