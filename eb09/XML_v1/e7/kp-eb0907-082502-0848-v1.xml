                <p><label type="entry">ELBA</label>, the Αμαλία of the Greeks, and Ilvaof the
                    Romans, is an island in the Mediterranean Sea, forming part of the Italian
                    province of Livorno, and lying about 6 miles from the mainland of Italy, from
                    which it is separated by the channel of Piombino, and about 34 miles E. of
                    Corsica. It has a very irregular coast outline, is 18 miles long and 2∣ to 10⅜
                    miles broad, and has a total area of nearly 90 square miles. It is throughout
                    mountainous, and the highest point, Monte Capanne, is 2925 feet above sea-level.
                    The western portion of the island is granitic, the eastern consists mainly of
                    the sandstone locally known as <hi rend="italic">verrucano,</hi> which in some
                    places passes into a talc slate. In the vicinity of Porto Ferrajo the hills are
                    cretaceous. The climate is mild, and, except at some spots on the coast,
                    healthy. Springs are numerous, and the soil is not infertile; but agriculture
                    and cattle-rearing are neglected, and there are no manufactures. Wine, wheat,
                    aloes, dyer’s lichen, and olives and other fruits are produced. The sardine and
                    tunny fisheries, and the manufacture of sea-salt are of some importance; but the
                    principal industry is mining. The iron mines are mostly in the vicinity of Rio
                    Inferiore, and yield abundance of ore, chiefly hematite, of excellent quality.
                    On account of the lack of fuel the ore is not smelted on the island, but is
                    shipped direct to Follonica on the neighbouring coast of Italy, and to the ports
                    of France and England. Marble, alabaster, sulphur, and ores of tin, lead, and
                    silver are among the other mineral products. The principal places in Elba are
                    the chief town Porto Ferrajo, with about 5000 inhabitants, the residence of
                    Napoleon from May 4, 1814, to February 26, 1815, Rio Ferrajo, San Pietro, Porto
                    Longone, and the village of Capoliveri. The population of the island in 1871 was
                    21,755.</p>

                    subsequently by Apelles, who is stated to have subjugated it. In the 10th
                    century it became a possession of the Pisans, from whom it was taken by the
                    Genoese in 1290. It fell eventually into Spanish hands, came in 1736 under the
                    jurisdiction of Naples, and in 1801 was ceded to the king of Etruria by the
                    treaty of Lunéville. It was united to France in 1803, made over to Napoleon by
                    the Treaty of Paris in 1814, restored to Tuscany in the following year, and in
                    1860 annexed to Italy.</p>
