                    (1793-1865), an eminent painter who became president of the Royal Academy in
                    London, was born on 17th November 1793 in Plymouth, where his father, a man of
                    uncommon gifts but of indolent temperament, was solicitor to the Admiralty and
                    judge advocate of the Admiralty Court. Charles was educated (like Sir Joshua
                    Reynolds) at the Plympton grammar-school, and in London at the Charterhouse.
                    Towards 1809, partly through the influence of his fellow-Devonian Haydon, of
                    whom he became a pupil, he determined to be a painter; he also studied in the
                    Royal Academy school. In 1813 he exhibited in the British Institution his first
                    picture, a work of considerable size, Christ restoring life to the Daughter of
                    Jairus. In 1814 he was commissioned to copy some of the paintings collected by
                    Napoleon in the Louvre; he returned to England iu 1815, and practised
                    portrait-painting at Plymouth. Here he saw Napoleon a captive on the
                    “Bellerophon ;” from a boat he made some sketches of the emperor, and he
                    afterwards painted, from these sketches and from memory, a life-sized
                    full-length portrait of him, which was pronounced a good likeness; it belongs to
                    the marquis of Lansdowne. In 1817 Eastlake went to Italy; in 1819 to Greece; in
                    1820 back to Italy, where he remained altogether fourteen years, sojourning
                    chiefly in Rome and in Ferrara. Subjects of banditti and peasantlife engaged his
                    pencil mostly from 1820 onwards. In 1827 he exhibited at the Royal Academy his
                    picture of the Spartan Isidas—who (as narrated by Plutarch in the life of
                    Agesilaus), rushing naked out of his bath, performed prodigies of valour against
                    the Theban host. This was the first work that attracted much notice to the name
                    of Eastlake, who in consequence obtained his election as A.R.A.; in 1830, when
                    he returned to England, as R.A. In 1850 he succeeded Shee as P.R.A. (his only
                    worthy competitor being Landseer, with the elder Pickersgill and George Jones
                    besides, to mark the poor estate of British art, or of its official
                    representatives), and, as usual, he was knighted. Prior to this, in 1841, he had
                    been appointed secretary to the Royal Commission for decorating the Houses of
                    Parliament, and he retained this post until the commission was dissolved in
                    1862. In 1843 he was made keeper of the National Gallery, a post which he
                    resigned in 1847 in consequence of an unfortunate purchase that roused much
                    animadversion; in 1855, director of the same im stitution, with more extended
                    powers. During his directorship he purchased for the gallery 155 pictures,
                    mostly of the Italian schools. He became also a D.C.L. of Oxford, F.R.S.,
                    Chevalier of the Legion of Honour, and member of various foreign academies. In
                    1849 he married Miss Elizabeth Rigby, a lady of some literary distinction. In
                    1865 he fell ill at Milan; he died at Pisa on 24th December in the same year,
                    and lies buried at Kensal Green.</p>
                <p>As a painter, Eastlake was gentle, harmonious, diligent, and correct; lacking
                    fire of invention or of execution; eclectic, without being exactly imitative;
                    influenced rather by a love of ideal grace and beauty than by any marked bent of
                    individual power or vigorous originality. Among <pb break="no"

                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0637-0616"/> his principal works (which were not numerous, 51
                    being the total exhibited in the Academy) are:—1828, Pilgrims arriving in sight
                    of Rome (repeated in 1835 and 1836, and perhaps on the whole his <hi
                    rend="italic">chef d</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oeuvre)·,</hi> 1829, Byron’s Dream (in the National Gallery); 1834, the Escape
                    of Francesco di Carrara (a duplicate in the National Gallery); 1841, Christ
                    Lamenting over Jerusalem (ditto); 1843, Hagar and Ishmael; 1845, Cornus; 1849,
                    Helena; 1851, Ippolita Torelli; 1853, Violante; 1855, Beatrice. These female
                    heads, of a refined semi-ideal quality, with something of Venetian glow of tint,
                    are the most satisfactory specimens of Eastlake’s work to an artist’s eye. He
                    was an accomplished and judicious scholar in matters of art, and published, in
                    1840, a translation of Goethe’s <hi rend="italic">Theory of Colours;</hi> in
                    1847 (his chief literary work) <hi rend="italic">Materials for a History of
                    Oil-Painting,</hi> especially valuable as regards the Flemish school; m 1848,
                    <hi rend="italic">Contributions to the Literature of the Pine Arts;</hi> in 1851
                    and 1855, translated editions of Kugler’s <hi rend="italic">History of the
                    Italian School of Painting,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Handbook of
                    Painting.</hi></p>
                <p>Sir Charles Eastlake was a man of middle height, spare form, reddish complexion,
                    bright hair (scanty in advanced life); of unassuming and rather courtier-like
                    bearing; reluctant to oppose or offend, but with a strong sense of official
                    duty. He was a neat and appropriate speaker, and filled his presidential and
                    other offices with great credit in the eyes of all who appreciate moderation and
                    cultured finish in the speech and bearing of a public man.</p>
