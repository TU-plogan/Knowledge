                    of Northumbria, was the son of Aella, king of Deira, and was born about 586, At
                    the death of Aella, in 588, Ethelfrid, king of Bernicia, Aella’s brother-in law,
                    usurped the throne of Deira, and. united the two kingdoms Deira and Bernicia,
                    under the name of Northumbria. Edwin ultimately found shelter with Raedwald of
                    East Anglia, who, in 617, defeated and slew Ethelfrid near the river Idle, and
                    enabled Edwin to mount the Northumbrian throne. In 625 Edwin married
                    Ethelburgha, daughter of Edbert, king of Kent. She had been converted to
                    Christianity, and, at her desire, Paulinus, a Christian missionary, was allowed
                    to enter Northumbria. Not long after Paulinus’s arrival, Eumer, an envoy of the
                    king of Wessex, made an attempt to''assassinate Edwin, who was only saved by
                    Lilla, one of his thanes, throwing himself between him and the assassin’s
                    weapon. The thane was killed, and the sword passing through his body inflicted
                    also a dangerous wound on the king. The queen about the same time was seized by
                    the pangs of childbirth, and was so alarmed on account of what had happened that
                    she and her infant were for a time in imminent danger. Paulinus offered up
                    prayers for their recovery, and Edwin was so much impressed by the seeming
                    answer to the petition, that, though he did not at once adopt the Christian
                    faith, he permitted the infant and twelve of his household to be baptized. He
                    also declared to Paulinus that if he should succeed in overthrowing the West
                    Saxons, against whom he had determined to make war, he would himself become a
                    Christian, and receive the rite of baptism. After his victorious return he
                    renounced his heathen gods, but it required all Paulinus’s powers of persuasion
                    to get him finally to adopt Christianity, and to give it his sanction as the
                    religion of Northumbria. Ultimately, however, he convened a council of his
                    nobles to ask their advice, and when they unanimously declared for the new
                    religion, Coifi, the high priest, at once offered to destroy all the heathen
                    places of worship throughout the land. This was done, and in 628 the
                    Northumbrians flocked in crowds to be baptized by Paulinus. While the
                    introduction of Christianity into Northumbria is the circumstance most worthy of
