                    (989-1016), son of Ethelred. and the last of the line of West Saxon kings,
                    called on account of his boldness and great strength Ironside, was, on the death
                    of Ethelred the Unready, in April 1016, proclaimed king by the citizens of
                    London and such of the Witan as were in the city. At that very time Canute the
                    Dane was preparing an expedition against London, and he was proclaimed king by
                    the Witan of England, which met at Southampton. In command of a magnificent
                    fleet he anchored before London, and by cutting a ditch round that part of the
                    city not washed by the Thames, completely surrounded it; but the citizens,
                    fighting with great valour, repulsed all his attacks. Meanwhile Edmund was
                    acknowledged by the West Saxons, who flocked from every quarter to his standard;
                    and determining to make a diversion in favour of London, he met and defeated the
                    enemy at Pen, near Gillingham, in Dorsetshire. Canute was forced to raise the
                    siege of London, and encountering Edmund at Sceorstan, in Wilts, would have been
                    signally defeated, had not the traitor ealderman Edric raised the head of a
                    fallen thane which resembled that of the king, and called to the Saxons to flee,
                    for their king was dead. Edmund, who was on the top of a hill, saved his
                    subjects from flight by taking off his visor and showing his countenance; .but
                    from the disorder into which they had been thrown by the untoward incident they
                    were unable to follow up their victory. Canute retained possession of the field
                    of battle, but stole a vs ay during the night and resumed the siege of London.
                    Afterwards the Danes were defeated at Brentford on the Thames, and at Otford in
                    Kent, and fled to the Isle of Sheppey; but being recruited, they met Edmund at
                    Assandun (Ashdown, in Essex), where a battle was fought which virtually decided
                    the fate of the West Saxon kings. Through a second act of treachery on the part
                    of Edric, who fled at the decisive moment of the battle, with the portion of the
                    army that he commanded, the Saxons were signally defeated, and their chief
                    nobles left dead on the field. Edmund, undaunted by his great losses, wished
                    still to continue the struggle, but Edric and the Witan persuaded him to be
                    reconciled to Canute, and to consent to a division of the kingdom. Edmund
                    retained London and all Emrlapd south of the Thames, together with East Anglia
                    and Essex, Canute taking possession of the other and larger portion. Edmund died
