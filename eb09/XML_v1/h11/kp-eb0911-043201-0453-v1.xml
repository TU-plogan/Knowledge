                <p><label type="entry">HAMPSTEAD</label>, a suburb of London, is situated in the
                    county of Middlesex, on the slope of Hampstead Hill, 4 miles N.W. of the city.
                    The village is irregularly built, and the streets are narrow and tortuous, but
                    it has preserved more than any other London suburb its sylvan appearance, and is
                    etill noted for its fine groves and avenues. From the side of the hill there
                    issue chalybeate springs, whose virtue was first discovered in the 17th century,
                    and which at the beginning of last century rivalled those of Tunbridge Wells and
                    Epsom in popularity. Their reputation, however, gradually declined after the
                    middle of the century, and now the supply of mineral water has been greatly
                    diminished by the cutting of deep drains and of railway tunnels. Hampstead
                    Heath, an irregular sandy tract occupying the summit and northern slope of the
                    hill, and extending to 240 acres, is much frequented by excursionists and picnic
                    parties. The hill is the highest in the vicinity of the metropolis, being 443
                    feet above the level of the Thames, or 36 feet higher than the cross of St
                    Paul’s. At one time the village was a favourite resort of poets and other men of
                    letters; and among the more famous of its old taverns was the Flask Inn, now
                    converted into a private residence, the meeting place of the Kit-Cat club, of
                    which the more celebrated members were Addison, Steele, Richardson, Marlborough,
                    and Walpole. The parish church of St John, consecrated in 1747 and enlarged in
                    1844, is a plain brick structure in the Italian style with a picturesque tower.
                    The graveyard contains a number of monuments of eminent persons, including those
                    of Sir James Mackintosh, Joanna Baillie, and Constable the artist. Near the
                    village a large militia barracks was erected in 1863, and there are a number of
                    charitable institutions, including a soldiers’ daughters’ home, a sailors’
                    daughters’ home, an orphan working school, and the North London Consumptive
                    Hospital. The population of the parish in 1871 was 32,281.</p>
