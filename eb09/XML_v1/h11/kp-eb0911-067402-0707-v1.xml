                <p><label type="entry">HENRY <hi rend="smallcaps">of Ghent</hi></label>. The
                    scholastic writer generally known by this name was born probably about 1217 in
                    the district of Mude, near Ghent. His family name seems to have been Goethals,
                    but he is always described as Henry of Mude or of Ghent. Little is known of the
                    details of his life. He studied at Ghent and then at Cologne under Albertus
                    Magnus. After obtaining the degree of doctor he returned to Ghent, and is said
                    to have been the first to lecture publicly in that city on philosophy and
                    theology. Like most of the great doctors of the age, he was drawn to Paris by
                    the fame of the university there. In 1247 he is known to have taught at Paris;
                    and he was distinguished by the title of <hi rend="italic">doctor solennis.</hi>
                    He took an active part in some of the many disputes between the orders and the
                    secular priests, and warmly defended the latter. He died at Tournay, of which
                    place he was archdeacon, in 1293. His most important works, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Quodlibeta</hi><hi rend="italic">Theologica</hi> and Nwwιwα <hi rend="italic"
                    >Theologice</hi> have been printed, the first in 1518, the second in 1520.
                    Several other writings remain in MS. Henry of Ghent occupies a somewhat
                    remarkable place in the history of scholasticism. A contemporary of the great
                    Aquinas, he opposed several of the dominant theories of the time, and united
                    with the current Aristotelian doctrines a strong infusion of Platonism and
                    mysticism. Only a few of the salient points of his doctrine can here be given;
                    the line of thinking by which they are reached is elaborate and complex. He
                    distinguishes between knowledge of natural objects and the divine inspiration or
                    intuition by which we cognize the being and existence of God. The first,
                    according to Henry, throws no light upon the second. Individuals are not
                    constituted by the material element in them, but by the fact of their
                    independent existence, 7.e., ultimately by the fact that they are created as
                    separate objects. Universals must be distinguished according as they have
                    reference to our minds or to the Divine mind. In the divine intelligence exist
                    exemplars or types of the genera and species of natural objects. On this
                    subject, however, Henry is far from clear; but it deserves notice that he
                    defends Plato against the current Aristotelian criticism, and endeavours to show
                    that the two views are in harmony. In psychology, his view of the intimate union
                    of soul and body is truly remarkable. The body he regards as forming part of the
                    very substance of the soul; through this union the soul is more perfect and
                    complete.</p>
