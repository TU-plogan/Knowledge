                <p><label type="entry">HENRY V</label>. (1387-1422), king of England, eldest son of
                    Henry IV. and Alary Bohun, was born August 19, 1387. Early bred to arms, his
                    first military effort was not successful, for at the age of thirteen he
                    commanded an expedition to Wales which was defeated by Glendower. Three years
                    later he was present at the battle of Shrewsbury, and in 1408 he revenged
                    himself on Glendower by driving him back to Snowdon. At the same time his
                    position in the council, at the head of which he appears after 1410, gave him
                    experience in affairs, and proves the confidence already felt in his political
                    ability. The stories of his youthful extravagance and dissoluteness are
                    unfounded, and, as the above facts show, improbable. Although his father appears
                    to have been jealous of his popularity, he was practically at the head of
                    affairs for some years before the death of Henry IV. Three weeks after that
                    event he was crowned (April 9, 1413), and entered upon his inheritance with the
                    good-will of all classes of the nation, So unanimous was the support he met with
                    in parliament that constitutional affairs cease to have any interest during his
                    reign. In his ecclesiastical policy he followed the lines laid down in 1401,
                    with much greater heartiness than his father had shown. His persecution of
                    heretics caused a conspiracy to surprise him and his brothers, which was
                    discovered and put down with some severity (January 1414). Sir John Oldcastle,
                    the head of the Lollards, was condemned to be burnt, and though he escaped for
                    the time, he was again taken in 1417, and put to death. Henry’s orthodoxy
                    brought him into connexion with the emperor Sigismund, then engaged in settling
                    the affairs of the church at the council of Constance, and his assistance was
                    very instrumental in the healing of the great schism. But the great work of his
                    life was the conquest of France. It was with this object that he issued a kind
                    of general amnesty on his accession, and appealed to the nation as a whole to
                    support him. War was resolved on by parliament, and Henry laid claim to the
                    French crown. This demand was afterwards reduced to one for all the districts
                    which the English kings had ever held in France. Such claims as these, of
                    course, precluded all negotiation. The expedition was not delayed by a
                    conspiracy to carry off the earl of March, which was discovered before it was
                    ripe, and on August 14, 1415, the English army landed at Havre. Harfleur was
                    soon taken, but the English losses were so great that Henry resolved to retreat
                    to Calais. On October 25th the French army that opposed his march was cut to
                    pieces at Agincourt. The next two years were spent in preparations for
                    continuing the war. In 1417 Henry again invaded France, took Rouen (1419), and
                    with the assistance of the Burgundian party forced Charles VI. to grant his
                    demands. By the treaty of Troyes (1420) it was arranged that he should marry
                    Catherine, take the government in hand at once, and succeed on Charles’s death.
                    This disgraceful treaty had, however, the effect of reviving the national party
                    in France, and during Henry’s absence in 1421 the English began to lose ground.
                    He hurried back to France, but before he had had time to recover his position,
                    he died at the castle of Vincennes, August 31, 1422. A great soldier, an able
                    politician, a skilful diplomatist, a generous, pure, and high-minded man, he was
                    one of the noblest and most popular of English kings. But these good qualities
                    should not blind one to the fact that he was a religious persecutor, and that he
                    plunged his country into an unjust and hopeless war.</p>
