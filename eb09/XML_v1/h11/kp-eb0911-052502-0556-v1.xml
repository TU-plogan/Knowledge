                    (1795-1857), an eminent British soldier, was the second of four brothers (all of
                    whom entered the army), and was born at Ford Hall, Bishop-Wearmouth, Sunderland,
                    on the 5th of April 1795. His parents were William Havelock, a wealthy
                    shipbuilder in Sunderland, and Jane, daughter of John Carter, solicitor at
                    Stockton-on-Tees. When about five years old Henry accompanied his elder brother
                    William to Mr Bradley’s school at Swanscombe, whence at the age of ten he
                    removed for seven years to Charterhouse School. In accordance with the desire of
                    his mother, who had died in 1811, he entered the Middle Temple in 1813, studying
                    under Chitty the eminent special pleader. His legal studies having been abridged
                    by a misunderstanding with his father, he in 1815 accepted a second lieutenancy
                    in the Rifle Brigade (95th), procured for him by the interest of his brother
                    William. During the following eight years of service in Britain he read
                    extensively and acquired a good acquaintance with the theory of war. In 1823,
                    having exchanged into the 21st and thence into the 13th Light Infantry, he
                    followed his brothers William and Charles to India, first qualifying himself in
                    Hindustani under Dr Gilchrist, a celebrated Orientalist. At the close of
                    twenty-three years’ service he was still a lieutenant, and it was not until 1838
                    that, after three years’ adjutancy of his regiment, he became captain. Before
                    this, however, he had held several staff <pb break="no"

                    assistant-adjutantgeneral of the forces in Burmah till the peace of Yandabo, of
                    which he, with Lumsden and Knox, procured the ratifications at Ava from the
                    “Golden Foot,” who bestowed on him the “gold leaf” insignia of Burmese nobility.
                    His first command had been at a stockade capture in the war, and he was present
                    also at the battles of Napadee, Patanago, and Paghan. He had also held during
                    his lieutenancy various interpreterships and the adjutancy of the king’s troops
                    at Chinsurah. In 1828 he published at Serampore <hi rend="italic">Campaigns in
                    Ava,</hi> and in 1829 he married Hannah Shepherd, daughter of Dr Marshman, the
                    eminent missionary. About the same time he became a Baptist, being baptized by
                    Mr John Mack at Serampore. During the first Afghan war he was present as
                    aide-de-camp to Sir Willoughby Cotton at the capture of Ghazni, July 29, 1839,
                    and at the occupation of Cabul. After a short absence in Bengal to secure the
                    publication of his <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the Afghan Campaign,</hi> he
                    returned to Cabul in charge of recruits, and became interpreter to General
                    Elphinstone. In 1840, being attached to Sir Robert Sale’s force, he took part in
                    the Khurd-Cabul fight, in the celebrated passage of the defiles of the Ghilzees
                    (1841), and in the fighting from Tezeen to Jellalabad. Here, after many months’
                    siege, his column in a sortie <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >masse</hi> defeated Akbar Khan, April 7, 1812. He was now made deputy
                    adjutant-general of the infantry division in Cabul, and in September he assisted
                    at Jugdulluk, at Tezeen, and at the release of the British prisoners at Cabul,
                    besides taking a prominent part at 1staliff. Having obtained a regimental
                    majority he next went through the Mahratta campaign as Persian interpreter to
                    Sir Hugh (Viscount) Gough, and distinguished himself at Maharajpιir in 1843, and
                    also in the Sikh campaign at Mudki, Firozeshah, and Sobraon in 1845. For these
                    services he was made deputy adjutant-general at Bombay. He exchanged from the
                    13th to the 39 th, then as second major into the 53d at the beginning of 1849,
                    and soon afterwards left for England, where he spent two years. In 1854 he
                    became quartermaster-general, then full colonel, and lastly adjutant-general of
                    the troops in India. In 1857 he was selected by Sir James Outram for the command
                    of a division in the Persian campaign, during which he was present at the
                    actions of Mohummarah and Ahwaz. Peace with Persia set him free just as the
                    mutiny broke out; and he was chosen to command a column “to quell disturbances
                    in Allahabad, to support Lawrence at Lucknow and Wheeler at Cawnpore, to
                    disperse and utterly destroy all mutineers and insurgents.” At Futtehpιir, July
                    12th, at Aong and Pandoonudee on the 15th, at Cawnpur on the 16th, at Onio on
                    the 29th, at Buserutgunge on the 29th and again on August 5th, at Boorhiya on
                    August 12th, and at Bithoor on the 16th, he defeated overwhelming forces. Twice
                    he advanced for the relief of Lucknow, but twice prudence forbade a reckless
                    exposure of troops wasted by battle and disease in the almost impracticable
                    task. Reinforcements arriving at last under Oαtrιm, he was enabled by the
                    generosity of his superior officer to crown his successes on the 25th of
                    September 1857 by the capture of Lucknow. There he died, November 24, 1857, of
                    dysentery, brought on by the anxieties and fatigues connected with his
                    victorious march, and with the subsequent blockade of the British troop3. He
                    lived long enough to receive the intelligence that he had been created K.C.B.
                    for the first three battles of the campaign; but of the major-generalship which
                    was shortly afterwards conferred he never knew. On November 2δ, before tidings
                    of his death had reached England, letters-patent were directed to create him a
                    baronet, and a pension of £1000 a year was voted at the assembling of
                    parliament. The baronetcy was afterwards bestowed upon hi3 eldest son; while to
                    his widow, by royal order, was given the rank to which she would have been
                    entitled had her husband survived and been created a baronet. To both widow and
                    son pensions of £1000 were awarded by parliament. See Marshman’s <hi
