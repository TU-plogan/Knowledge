                    rend="smallcaps">der,</hi> was born at Gorcum in 1637, and died at Amsterdam on
                    the 12th of September 1712. He was an architectural landscape painter, a
                    contemporary of Hobbema and Jacob Ruysdael, with the advantage, which they
                    lacked, of a certain professional versatility; for, whilst they painted
                    admirable pictures and starved, he varied the practice of art with the study of
                    mechanics, improved the fire engine, and died superintendent of the lighting and
                    director of the firemen’s company at Amsterdam. Till 1672 he painted in
                    partnership with Adrian van der Velde. After Adrian’s death, and probably
                    because of the loss which that event entailed upon him, he accepted the offices
                    to which allusion has just been made. At no period of artistic activity had the
                    system of division of labour been more fully or more constantly applied to art
                    than it was in Holland towards the close of the 17th century. Van der Heyden,
                    who was perfect as an architectural draughtsman in so far as he painted the
                    outside of buildings and thoroughly mastered linear perspective, seldom turned
                    his hand to the delineation of anything but brick houses and churches in streets
                    and squares, or rows along canals, or “moated granges,” common in his native
                    country. He was a travelled man, had seen the Hague, Ghent, and Brussels, and
                    had ascended the Rhine past Xanten to Cologne, where he copied over and over
                    again the tower and crane of the great cathedral. But he cared nothing for hill
                    or vale, or stream or wood. He could reproduce the rows of bricks in a square of
                    Dutch houses sparkling in the sun, or stunted trees and lines of dwellings
                    varied by steeples, all in light or thrown into passing shadow by moving cloud.
                    He had the art of painting microscopically without loss of breadth or keeping.
                    But he could draw neither man nor beast, nor ships nor carts; and this was his
                    disadvantage. His good genius under these circumstances was Adrian van der
                    Velde, who enlivened his compositions with spirited figures; and the joint
                    labour of both is a delicate, minute, transparent work, radiant with glow and
                    atmosphere, and most pleasant to look at. Almost all Van der Heyden’s pieces are
                    inscribed with his name alone, as if Van der Velde had been but a sleeping
                    partner in his w ork. Like Heusch, he formed the first letters of his name into
                    a monogrammatic interlacement. Very few of his pictures are dated. One, a street
                    in a Dutch town, of 1666, is in the Hope collection in London. Two of 1667, a
                    bridge on a canal, lined with houses casting their reflexions into the water,
                    and the town-house at Amsterdam, are in the galleries of the Hague and Florence.
                    Another view of the dam and town-hall at Amsterdam, dated 1668, is in the
                    Louvre. A church and houses in the museum of Dresden is inscribed 1673. In all
                    there are seventy or more of Van der Heyden’s works fairly accessible to the
                    public—those which are least so being chiefly in English private collections.
                    Eight capital examples are in the Hermitage at St Petersburg, two of which are
                    views in Cologne. Four are in the London National Gallery, four at Amsterdam and
                    Dresden. Munich and Cassel have two apiece, and two very fine ones are in
                    Buckingham Palace. The rest are in public and private galleries in Vienna,
                    Paris, Frankfort, and Carlsruhe.</p>
