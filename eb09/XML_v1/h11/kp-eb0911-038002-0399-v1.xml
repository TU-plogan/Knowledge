                <p><label type="entry">HALBERSTADT</label>, the chief town of a circle in the
                    government district of Magdeburg, Prussian province of Saxony, is situated in a
                    beautiful and fertile country on the Holzemme, a tributary of the Eode, and at
                    the junction point of four railways, 29 miles S.W. of Magdeburg. It has an
                    antique appearance, and in a large number of the buildings the mediaeval
                    wood-architecture is still preserved. About a mile and a half distant from
                    Halberstadt are the <hi rend="italic">Spiegel'sche Berge,</hi> from which there
                    is obtained a fine view of the surrounding country. The town possesses a
                    cathedral in the Pointed style, dating from the 13th and 14th centuries, and
                    restored between 1850 and 1871, containing a rich Gothic screen of the date of
                    1510, other interesting antiquities, beautiful glass windows, and several
                    valuable paintings. Of the remaining churches the only one of special interest
                    is the Liebfrauenkirche, a basilica in the later Romanesque style, dating from
                    the 12th and 13th centuries, and restored in 1848, containing noteworthy wall
                    paintings and figures in relief. Among the other old buildings may be mentioned
                    the town-house, dating from the 14th century and restored in the 17th century;
                    the town hall orypt, dating from the 15th century; and the Petershof, formerly
                    the residence of the bishop, but now used as a custom house. The principal
                    educational establishments are the gymnasium—the new buildings for which were
                    opened in 1875—with a library of 30,000 volumes; the real-school of the first
                    order; the normal school, connected with which there is a deaf and dumb
                    institute; and the provincial trade school. Near the cathedral is a building
                    called the temple of friendship which contains a collection of the portraits of
                    the friends of the poet Gleim, who was a resident in the town, and whose house
                    was the resort of a large circle of poets and scholars. In the same
                    neighbourhood a beautiful monument in the Early Pointed style has been elected
                    to the memory of those who fell in the late Franco-German war. The principal
                    manufactures of the town are linen and woollen cloth, leather, paper, gloves,
                    wadding, cigars, soap, oil, sugar, chemical products, brandy, and liqueurs. The
                    population in 1875 was 27,757.</p>
                <p>Halberstadt owes its origin to the foundation in the 9th century of the bishopric
                    of which it became the seat. It received town rights from Bishop Arnulf in 998.
                    It was burnt down in 1113 by the emperor Henry V., and in 1179 by Henry the
                    Lion. At the peace of Westphalia in 1648 the bishopric was united as a
                    principality to Brandenburg. At the Tilsit peace in 1807 it was joined to
                    Westphalia, but in 1813 it again came into the possession of Prussia.</p>
