                <p><label type="entry">HAKODADI, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hakodate</hi></label>, a
                    seaport town of Japan, in the old province of Hokukaido, on the southern coast
                    of the island of Yezo or Yesso, in 41° 49' N. lat. and 140° 47' E. long. Its
                    general position, as has been frequently remarked, is not unlike that of
                    Gibraltar, as the town is built along the north-western base of a rocky
                    promontory (1100 feet in height) which forms the eastern boundary of a spacious
                    bay, and is united to the mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus. At the time of
                    Captain Perry’s visit in 1851 few of the buildings of Hakodadi, with the
                    exception of its temples and fire-proof warehouses, were more than one story
                    high, and the roofs were made of slight shingles protected against the effects
                    of wind-storms by heavy stones.</p>
                <p>Since that date the town has increased considerably in extent, and many of the
                    more modern buildings, such as the new custom-house and the residences of the
                    Government officials, have been erected in a more solid European style. In 1870
                    there were four European hotels. A new bund or embankment has been constructed
                    along the shore, and several quarters of the town have been laid out in better
                    fashion by the local authorities. Hakodadi is the residence of the governor of
                    Yezo, and the seat of an arsenal. There are four Buddhist and three Shinto
                    temples,—the most important of the former being the Zhioghen-zhi, or Country’s
                    Protector, built about 1830. A medical college is maintained in connexion with
                    the Government hospital, and in the neighbourhood of the town an agricultural
                    college has been erected since 1873. The Bay of Hakodadi, says Sir Rutherford
                    Alcock, is completely land-locked, easy of access, and spacious enough for the
                    largest navies to ride in it, with deep water almost up to the shore, and good
                    holdingground. The Russians have for a considerable time used it as a winter
                    station for their ships, because their own harbours on the coast of Kamchatka
                    are annually frozen up. Their establishment formerly comprised a handsome
                    consular residence, a hospital, warehouses, and workshops, but the consulate was
                    removed from the port in 1871. Hakodadi has a large local trade; but neither its
                    exports nor its imports are very extensive, and as a commercial centre it will
                    not improbably be superseded by Endermo. The exports comprise awabi, cuttlefish,
                    sea-weed, bêche-demer (iriko), sea-otter skins, and deer horns; as many as
                    30,000 pairs of the last being sometimes shipped in a year. Lead and coal mines
                    exist in the neighbourhood. There is telegraphic communication with Tokio
                    (Yedo); and a new road has been made to Sapporu (Satsuporu). The population of
                    the town is estimated at 30,000; in 1872 the foreign settlement had 22
                    residents. Hakodadi, originally a fishing village belonging to a local daimio,
                    was purchased by the Government and incorporated in the imperial fief of
                    Matsmai. It was opened to American commerce in 1854; and there are now also
                    Danish, German, and English consuls. In 1868 the town was taken by the rebel
                    fleet, but it was recovered by the mikado in 1869.</p>
