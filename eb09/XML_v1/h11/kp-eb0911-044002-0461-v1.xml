                <p><label type="entry">HANKOW</label> (that is, the “Mouth of the Han”), the great
                    commercial centre of the middle portion of the Chinese empire, and since 1858
                    one of the principal places opened to foreign trade. It is situated on the
                    northern side of the Yang-tse-kiang at its junction with the Han river, about
                    450 miles west of Shanghai in 30° 32' 5Γ' N. lat. and 114° 19' 55'' E. long., at
                    an absolute height of 150 feet. By the Chinese it is not considered a separate
                    city, but as a suburb of the now decadent city of Hanyang; and it may almost be
                    said to stand in a similar relation to Wu-chang the capital of the province of
                    Hupeh, which lies immediately opposite on the southern bank of the
                    Yang-tse-kiang. Hankow extends for about a mile along the main river and about
                    two and a half along the Han. It is protected by a wall 18 feet high, which was
                    erected in 1863 at an expense of £250,000, and has a circuit of about 4 miles.
                    In 1861 the port was declared open by Jame3 Hope and Sir Harry S. Parkes, C.B.,
                    and the site of a British settlement was selected in the east end of the town,
                    with a river frontage of 2400 feet, and a depth of from 1200 to 1500. The
                    building area, divided into 108 lots, was quickly bought up, and houses after
                    the Shanghai style were erected. Leases were granted to foreigners as well as to
                    British subjects. A municipal council was formed, and by 1863 a great embankment
                    and a roadway were completed along the river, which has the awkward fashion of
                    rising as much as 50 feet or more above its ordinary levels, and not
                    unfrequently, as in 1849 and 1866, lays a large part of the town under water. On
                    the former occasion little was left uncovered but the roofs of the houses. The
                    success of the foreign settlement has not been so great as was anticipated: even
                    in 1866 the number of foreign residents was 125 instead of 150 as in 1863.
                    Chinese merchants have rapidly got even the foreign trade into their hands: in
                    1873 they began to run steamers on the river; in 1875 they purchased the
                    property of the Shanghai Steam Navigation Company; and in 1876 they had 57
                    steamers flying the national flag. Besides tea, which is the staple, the exports
                    of Hankow are leaf tobacco, of which 6,700,000 ft&gt; was sent to Europe in
                    1876, raw silk mainly obtained from Szechuen, rhubarb, gall-nuts, and musk. Of
                    this last the quantity was as much as 2937 Bt&gt; at £20 sterling per lb. Tea
                    was first sent direct to London in 1864-65; in 1876 this market received from
                    Hankow no less than 34,540,000 lb out of a total export of 86,402,271 lb. The
                    Russian merchants, who are fixing their brick-tea factories in the town,
                    obtained 12,844,476 lb in the same year. They send their goods by water to
                    Tientsin, and thence to Kalgan partly by land and partly by water. A public
                    assay office was established at Hankow in 1864. The Roman Catholics, the London
                    Missionary Society, and the Wesleyans have all missions in the town; and there
                    are two missionary hospitals. Before the Taiping wars, the full brunt of which
                    fell on this part of the country, the sister cities of Hankow, Hanyang, and
                    Wu-chang-fu had a population, it is said, of over 5,000,000. At present Hankow
                    has from 600,000 to 800,000 (Sossnoffsky says only 300,000), and the other two
                    from 400,000 to 700,000.</p>
