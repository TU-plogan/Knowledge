                    in Frisian <hi rend="italic">Harns,</hi> an important trading town and seaport
                    in the province of Friesland in the Netherlands, is situated 17 miles W. of
                    Leeuwarden with which it lias been connected by rail since 1863. Besides its
                    dilapidated fortifications, and the town-house, which was erected between 1730
                    and 1733 and is adorned with a statue of the historian Simon Stijl, the only
                    noteworthy buildings are the Great or New church, the West church, which was
                    formerly part of the castle, the Roman Catholic church, and the J ewish
                    synagogue. The school of navigation and school of design may also be mentioned.
                    Harlingen is the seat of the Frisian Navigation Company, and it has regular
                    steam communication, not only with Amsterdam and Nieuwe Diep, but also with
                    London and Hull. Besides an inner harbour protected from the high tides by
                    powerful sluices, it has an outer harbour of modern construction for the
                    accommodation of large vessels. One of the chief departments of its trade is the
                    export to England of Frisian produce—corn, cattle, butter, cheese, and flax.
                    Wharves, saw-mills, anchor forges, rope-yards, and a canvas factory represent
                    the auxiliary industries of the place. In the middle of the last century,
                    Harlingen had 7000 inhabitants, which increased in the course of the next
                    hundred years to about 8000. In 1860, before the new harbour works, they
                    numbered 9800, and in 1878 they were 10,800.</p>
                <p>Originally Harlingen was only a part of the village of Alrnenum, and lay at some
                    distance inland, but the Zuyder Zee, which had already in 1134 destroyed an
                    intervening town, made another inroad in 1566 and attained its present limits.
                    The Spanish lieutenant Caspar Robles de Belly, whose monument, the “Man of
                    Stone,” now stands on the sea-dyke, took care to protect the site of the town by
                    further embankments. In 1579 it was surrounded by walls and fosses; a new castle
                    had been built in 1502. During the civil broils of 1787 Harlingen was blockaded
                    by the patriots of Franeker. In November 1776 and February 1825 it suffered from
                    severe inundations.</p>
