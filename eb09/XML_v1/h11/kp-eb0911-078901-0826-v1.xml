                    a learned English divine of the nonjuring party, and an eminent Anglo-Saxon
                    scholar, was born at Newsham near Thirsk, Yorkshire, on June 20, 1642. In 1659
                    he entered St John’s College, Oxford, whence after the Restoration he removed
                    first to Magdalen College and subsequently to Magdalen Hall. In 1664 he was
                    chosen fellow of Lincoln College, and in the following year proceeded Μ. A. On
                    his return from a Continental tour in 1673 he graduated in divinity, and in 1675
                    he was appointed rector of St Ebbe’s, Oxford; in the following year he as
                    private chaplain accompanied the duke of Lauderdale, the royal commissioner, to
                    Scotland; and shortly afterwards he received the degree of D.D. from the
                    university of Glasgow. In 1680 he became vicar of All Hallows, Barking, London;
                    and after having been made chaplain to the king in 1681, he was in 1683 promoted
                    to the deanery of Worcester. At the revolution of 1688, having declined to take
                    the oath of allegiance to William and Mary, he was first suspended and
                    afterwards deprived,— he meanwhile affixing to the cathedral doors a
                    “protestation and claim of right” that he was, and still did “continue to be,
                    the only rightful and legal dean of this cathedral church of Worcester.” After
                    remaining some time in concealment in London, he was employed by San croft and
                    the other nonjurors on a mission to the Continent on matters connected with the
                    proposed action of his party relative to the continuance of their episcopal

                    later years were largely occupied in controversies the interest of which has now
                    almost wholly passed away; but to them we owe the two works which constitute his
                    chief claim to an enduring reputation, the learned <hi rend="italic"

                    Campbell and Gadderar to consecrate Jeremy Collier, Samuel Hawes, and Nathaniel
                    Spinkes to be bishops in the nonjuring church. He died December 15, 1715.</p>
                <p>Even apart from the two works already mentioned, Hickes was a very voluminous and
                    laborious author. His earliest performances, which were anonymous, were
                    suggested by contemporary events in Scotland that gave him great
                    satisfaction,—the execution of Mitchel on a charge of having been implicated in
                    the murder of Archbishop Sharp, and that of Kid and King, Presbyterian
                    ministers, “for high treason and rebellion” <hi rend="italic">(Rαvillαc</hi><hi
