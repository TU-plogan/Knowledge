                    Friedrich</hi></label> (1793-1862), a minister of state in Hesse-Cassel,
                    celebrated as a reactionary, was born at Hanau, in the electorate of Hesse, in
                    1793. He studied law at Göttingen, and was appointed by the elector Frederick
                    William I. (then acting as regent) to a subordinate post in that university. He
                    rose rapidly, and proved himself a man of great resolution and energy. From the
                    first he adopted that line of policy which made him so disliked throughout his
                    career. He exercised, that is to say, a suspicious censorship over the press; he
                    reduced to a shadow the power of the legislative chambers; he introduced new and
                    harsh measures of army discipline, and contended relentlessly with all disciples
                    of free thought. In the matter of education he showed praiseworthy zeal, and
                    promoted as far as he could the national schools of Hesse. But the services he
                    rendered in this way were not sufficient to induce the mass of the people to
                    pardon the reactionary tendency of his general policy, and he was obliged in
                    1837 to flee from the general hatred he had encountered. He found shelter in
                    Prussia, where the Government entrusted him with the discharge of various
                    judicial offices, and he remained in Prussia till the full tide of reaction had
                    set in after the year 1848, He then (1850) returned to Hesse Cassel, the
                    ministry of the revolution of 1848 having been dismissed. Despite the fact that
                    Hassenpflug had never freed himself from a charge of peculation brought against
                    him in the performance of his judicial duties in Prussia, he was appointed by
                    the elector of Hesse to the head of the new ministry. He acted at once on the
                    old lines, levying taxes without the consent of the chambers, dissolving them
                    when they protested, and finally proclaiming martial law. The soldiers rose, the
                    officers being on the side of the people; the Government was in so precarious a
                    condition that it seemed wise to the elector to flee with his court to
                    Wilhelmsbad. Partly by the influence of Hassenpflug the German bundesrath (or
                    council of all the states) espoused the cause of the elector against his
                    subjects, and by the end of the year (1850) the astute minister had the
                    satisfaction of seeing the reactionary Government (with himself as minister of
                    finance) reinstated in power. His position was, however, difficult, owing to his
                    great unpopularity among all classes. When in 1852 the brother of the elector
