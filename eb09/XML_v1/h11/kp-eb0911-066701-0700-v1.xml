                <p><label type="entry">HENRY III</label>. (1017-1056), Holy Roman emperor, was the
                    son of Conrad II., the founder of the Franconian dynasty. He was born in 1017,
                    and his father, anxious to make the succession secure and to strengthen the
                    authority of the crown, caused him to be elected German king in 1026, creating
                    him in 1027 duke of Bavaria, and in 1038 duke of Swabia and king of Burgundy. He
                    became the reigning sovereign of Germany in 1039, at the age of twenty-two. Of
                    an upright and resolute temper, he soon made his power felt both in church and
                    state.’ The policy he pursued was that which had been followed by Otto I. during
                    the early part of his reign: that is, he granted as many of the duchies as
                    possible either to members of his own family or to vassals on whose loyalty he
                    could rely. Duke Gottfried of Lower Lorraine, who laid claim to Upper Lorraine
                    also, was the only prince who gave him serious trouble, and even this impetuous
                    opponent could not effectually resist the great emperor. Henry was as
                    distinguished in his wars as in his home government. Duke Bretislaus of Bohemia,
                    who gave signs of aspiring to an independent position, invaded Poland, plundered
                    its chief cities, anl as a mark of his triumph carried away the body of St
                    Adalbert from Gnesen to Prague. Henry proceeded against him in 1041, and forced
                    him to appear in the following year at Ratisbon in penitent’s garb, and to
                    accept Bohemia in fief of the German crown. Having settled this difficulty, he
                    began in 1042 a series of campaigns in Hungary, where for the first time he
                    asserted the supremacy of Germany. In Italy he was equally successful, not only
                    maintaining his right to the Lombard crown, but establishing supremacy over the
                    Normans in Apulia and Calabria. At this time the moral condition of the church
                    was regarded with regret and concern by every serious nature, and Henry, who was
                    of a deeply religious tendency, associated himself heartily with the movement
                    for reform which proceeded from Cluny. At a council of prelates in Sutri in
                    1046, he caused the rival popes, Benedict IX., Sylvester II., and Gregory VI.,
                    to be deposed, and raised to the papal see, as Clement II., Suitger, bishop of
                    Bamberg. Three other German bishops, one after the other, were appointed to the
                    same position; and as all of them were devout men and energetic administrators,
                    they did much to purify the ecclesiastical system of Europe. During their rule
                    the papacy was held in strict subjection to the empire; but the very earnestness
                    with which Henry applied himself to the task of making the church worthy of its
                    mission created grave dangers for the state, since it was improbable that a pope
                    of proud and independent spirit would be content with a subordinate position.
                    The magnitude of the peril soon revealed itself when Hildebrand became pope
                    during the reign of Henry IV., Henry III.’s son and successor. Henry died in the
                    prime of life in 1056 at Botfeld.</p>
