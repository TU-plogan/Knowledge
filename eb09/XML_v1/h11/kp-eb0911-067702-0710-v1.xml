                <p><label type="entry">HENRY, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label> (1775-1836),
                    a distinguished chemist, son of Thomas Henry, an apothecary and author of some
                    works on chemistry, was born at Manchester, December 12, 1775. After completing
                    his education at an academy in Manchester, he was for some years private
                    secretary to a physician, and in 1795 he began the study of medicine at the
                    university of Edinburgh. Prudential considerations compelled him, however, to
                    interrupt his studies at the conclusion of his first session, and he did not
                    resume them till 1805, two years after wdιich he received the diploma of M.D.
                    For some time he practised as a physician in Manchester, but on account of
                    delicate health, caused by an accident, he was ultimately compelled to retire
                    from his profession. He nevertheless carried on his original researches in
                    chemistry, for which he found great facilities in connexion with his father’s
                    business, and from 1797 till his death he continued to enrich the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Royal Society with contributions on his
                    favourite science, especially in regard to aeriform bodies. His first
                    communication was an attempt, in opposition to Austin, Beddoes, and others, to
                    establish the title of carbon to rank among the elementary bodies, but
                    discovering afterwards a fallacy in his reasoning he corrected it in a
                    subsequent paper. In 1800 he published in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi> his experiments on muriatic acid gas, made with the view of
                    disengaging an imaginary unknown element supposed to be associated with oxygen
                    in the composition of the gas; but after the discovery of the real nature of the
                    acid by Davy he was one of the earliest converts to the new theory. In 1803 he
                    published his elaborate experiments on the quantity of gases absorbed by water
                    at different temperatures and under different pressures, with the result of
                    establishing the law that “water takes up of gas, condensed by one, two, or more
                    additional atmospheres, a quantity which would be equal to twice, thrice,
                    &amp;c., the volume absorbed under the common pressure of the atmosphere.” In
                    1808 he described in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> a
                    form of apparatus adapted to the combustion of larger quantities of gases than
                    could be fired in eudiometric tubes. In the same year he was chosen a fellow of
                    the Royal Society; and in 1809, for his valuable contributions to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the society, he was awarded the Copley gold
                    medal. For the next fifteen years he continued his experiments on the gases,
                    making known the results of them from time to time to the society. In his last
                    communication, in 1824, he claimed the merit of having conquered the only
                    difficulty that remained in a series of experiments on the gaseous substances
                    issuing from the destructive distillation of coal and oil, and proved the exact
                    composition of the fire-damp of mines. But though Henry’s experiments had
                    reference chiefly to aeriform bodies, his acquaintance with general chemistry is
                    proved by his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Experimental Chemistry,</hi> a work
                    which combines great literary elegance with the highest standard of scientific
                    accuracy. He had also collected materials for a history of chemical discovery
                    from the middle of last century, but did not live to carry out the project. It
                    is indeed to be regretted that he did not contribute more to the literature of
                    science. His biographical notices of Priestley, Wollaston, and Davy may be
                    regarded as models in that species of composition. At intervals during his
                    lifetime Henry suffered much from neuralgic pains. These became so severe as to
                    render the extirpation of the principal nerves of the hand necessary, but this
                    failed to afford the expected relief; and ultimately the irritation of the whole
                    nervous system deprived him of sleep, and caused his death on September 2,
                    1836.</p>
