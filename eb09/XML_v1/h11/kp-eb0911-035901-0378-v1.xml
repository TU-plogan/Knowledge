                <p><label type="entry">HABINGTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>
                    (1605-1654), one of the most pleasing of English minor poets, was born at
                    Hendlip in Worcestershire, on the 4th of November 1605. His father, Thomas
                    Habington, was a prominent Catholic; to his mother, Lady Mary Habington, was
                    attributed the revelation of the Gunpowder Plot. The poet was educated first at
                    St Omer, and refusing to become a Jesuit was removed to Paris. On his return to
                    England he met and fell in love with Lady Lucy Herbert, second daughter of Lord
                    Powis, whom he celebrated under the poetical name of Castara. After some
                    opposition he won her hand, and they were married about the year 1632. In 1634
                    he first published his famous volume of lyrical poems entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Castara,</hi> which was reprinted in 1635 and 1640. In the latter year he also
                    published a prose <hi rend="italic">History of King Edward IV.</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">The Queen of Arragon,</hi> a tragi-comedy. This play was published
                    at the request of his kinsman, the earl of Pembroke; it was afterwards revived
                    by Samuel Butler. The last work printed by Habington was <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations upon History,</hi> 1641. In 1647 his father died; and during the
                    Commonwealth, as we learn from Anthony Wood, the poet “did run with the times,
                    and was not unknown to Oliver the usurper.” He died November 30, 1654, and was
                    buried in the family vault at Hendlip. Habington possesses all the faults of his
                    age except its impurity; he is honourably known as the chastest of the Royalist
                    lyrists. His genius was gently fantastic, mild in its play of fancy, delicately
                    ingenious, and of an unruffled stately dignity. He never rises to sublimity or
                    passion, but he is always gentlemanlike and often extremely graceful. His best
                    verses have a very modern tone, and remind the reader of the 18th rather than of
                    the 17th century.</p>
                <p>The works of Habington have not been collected. An excellent edition of <hi
