                <p>On the murder of Caracalla (217 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> Julia Maesa was
                    forbidden the court by the new emperor Macrinus. She retired to her ancestral
                    city Emesa with her daughters and grandsons. Varius Avitus, though still only a
                    boy, was appointed high priest of the Syrian sun-god Elagabalus, one of the
                    chief seats of whose worship was Emesa. His beauty, and the splendid ceremonials
                    at which he presided, made him a great favourite with the troops stationed in
                    that part of Syria, and Maesa increased his popularity by spreading reports that
                    he was in reality the illegitimate son of Caracalla. Macrinus was very unpopular
                    with the army; an insurrection w as easily raised, and Varius under his adopted
                    name Heliogabalus was proclaimed emperor. The troops sent to quell the revolt
                    joined the new emperor, and Macrinus, advancing in person against him, was
                    defeated and soon afterwards slain (218). Heliogabalus was at once recognized by
                    the senate as emperor. After spending the winter in Nicomedia, he proceeded in
                    219 to Rome. He made it his business to exalt the honour of the deity whose
                    priest he was. . The Syrian god was proclaimed the chief deity in Rome, and all
                    other gods his servants; splendid ceremonies in his honour were celebrated, at
                    which Heliogabalus danced in public; and it w as believed that secret rites
                    accompanied by human sacrifice were performed in his honour. The shameless
                    profligacy of the emperor’s life was such as to shock even a Roman public. His
                    popularity with the army declined, and Maesa perceiving that the liking of the
                    soldiers inclined to Alexander Severus, persuaded him to raise his cousin to the
                    dignity of Caesar(221). Heliogabalus soon repented of this step. An attempt to
                    murder Alexander was frustrated by the watchful Maesa. Another such attempt in
                    222 produced a mutiny among the soldiers, in which Heliogabalus and his mother
                    Soaemias were slain.</p>
