                    (1620-1681), Dutch scholar, was the son of Daniel Heinsius, and scarcely less
                    illustrious than his father. While, however, Daniel was the type of the
                    stationary scholar, Nikolaes was by temperament restless and peripatetic. He was
                    born at Leyden, July 20, 1620, and early displayed an extraordinary precocity.
                    His boyish Latin poem of <hi rend="italic">Breda Expuynata</hi> was printed in
                    1637, and attracted much attention. In 1642 he began his wanderings with a visit
                    to England in search of MSS. of the classics; it is unhappily recorded that he
                    met with great discourtesy from the English scholars. In 1644 he was sent to Spa
                    to drink the waters; his health restored, he set out once more in search of
                    codices, passing through Louvain, Brussels, Mechlin, Antwerp, and so back to
                    Leyden, everywhere collating MSS. and taking philological and textual notes.
                    Almost immediately he set out again, and arriving in Paris was welcomed with
                    open arms by the French savants. After investigating all the classical texts he
                    could lay hands on, he proceeded southwards, and visited on the same α <hi

                    Rome. Next year, 1647, found him in Naples, from which he fled during the reign
                    of Masaniello; he pursued his labours in Leghorn, Bologna, Venice, and Padua, at
                    which latter city he published in 1648 his volume of original Latin verse
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Italica.</hi> He proceeded to Milan, and worked for a
                    considerable time in the Ambrosian library; he was preparing to explore
                    Switzerland in the same patient manner, when the news of his father’s illness
                    recalled him hurriedly to Leyden. He was soon called away to Stockholm at the
                    invitation of Queen Christina, at whose court he waged war with Salmasius, who
                    accused him of having supplied Milton with facts from the life of that great but
                    irritable scholar. Heinsius paid a flying visit to Leyden in 1650, but
                    immediately returned to Stockholm. In 1651 he once more visited Italy; the
                    remainder of his life was divided between Upsala and Holland. He collected his
                    Latin poems into a volume in 1653. His latest labours were the eliting of
                    Velleius Paterculus in 1678, and of Valerius Flaccus in 1680. He died at the
                    Hague, October 7,1681. Nikolaes Heinsius was one of the purest and most elegant
                    of modern Latinists, and if his scholarship was not quite so perfect as that of
                    his father, he displayed higher gifts as an origiml writer.</p>
