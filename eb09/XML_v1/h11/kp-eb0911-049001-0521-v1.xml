                <p><label type="entry">HARPER’S FERRY</label>, a post village of Jefferson county,
                    West Virginia, United States, is grandly situated at the foot of Bolivar heights
                    and at the confluence of the Shenandoah and Potomac rivers, where they intersect
                    the Blue Ridge, 45 miles N.W. of Washington. It is the junction-point of the
                    Baltimore and Ohio and the Winchester and Potomac railways; and the Ohio and
                    Chesapeake canal passes along the Maryland side of the Potomac river. The
                    village since the civil war has been in a decaying condition. It is the seat of
                    Stover college, for students of colour. Previous to the war Harper’s Ferry
                    contained an extensive arsenal and armoury, and during the war it was the scene
                    of several exploits which have given it a name in history. On the 16th October
                    1859 it was seized by John Brown, the celebrated abolitionist, and a small
                    handful of followers, but as he was unsupported by a rising of the slaves he was
                    overpowered on the morning of the 18th and taken prisoner. On the 18th April
                    1861 it was captured by the Confederates, who on evacuating it in the following
                    June destroyed the arsenal and armoury and the bridge across the Potomac. The
                    village was afterwards held by a Union garrison of 12,000 men, who, however, on
                    the 15th September 1862, after a brave resistance of several days, surrendered
                    to a strong Confederate force under Jackson and A. P. Hill. After the battle of
                    Antietam, on the 17th of the same month, it was reoccupied by the army of the
                    Potomac under General M'Clellan,who left a strong garrison in the place. In June
                    1863 it was again abandoned to the Confederates on their march to Pennsylvania.
                    After their defeat at Gettysburg, the town again fell into the hands of the
                    Federal troops, who held it until the demonstration against Washington in July
                    1864. After the battle of Monocacy on July 9th it was occupied by the United
                    States forces, and held by them until the end of the war. The most flourishing
                    part of the town was nearly destroyed by a flood in the Shenandoah, October
                    1878. The population is about 2000.</p>
