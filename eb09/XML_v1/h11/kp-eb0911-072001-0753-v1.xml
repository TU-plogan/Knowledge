                    rend="smallcaps">d’</hi> (1625-1695), Orientalist, was born December 4, 1625, at
                    Paris. As soon as he had completed the ordinary course in classics and
                    philosophy at the university of his native city, he devoted himself to the study
                    of the Oriental languages, and went to Italy to perfect himself in them by
                    converse with the Orientals who frequented its seaports. There he made the
                    acquaintance of his fellow-savants Lucas Holstenius and Leo Allatius, and
                    attracted the favourable notice of the cardinals Grimaldi and Bamberini. On his
                    return to France after a year and a half, he was received into the house of
                    Fouquet, superintendent of finance, who gave him a pension of 1500 livres.
                    Losing this on the disgrace of Fouquet in 1661, he was appointed secretary and
                    interpreter of Eastern languages to the king. A few years later he again visited
                    Italy, when the grand-duke Ferdinand IT. of Tuscany presented him with a large
                    number of valuable Oriental MSS., and tried to attach him to his court.
                    Herbelot, however, was recalled to France by Colbert, and received from the king
                    a pension equal to the one he had lost. In 1692 he succeeded D’Auvergne in the
                    chair of Syriac, in the Collège de France. He died at Paris, December 8, 1695.
                    His great work is the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Orientale,</hi> ow <hi
                    rend="italic">dictionnaire universel contenant tout ce qui fait connaître les
                    peuples de</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Orient,</hi> which
                    occupied him nearly all his life, and was published in 1697 by Galland. It is
                    based on the immense Arabic dictionary of Hajji Khalfa, of which indeed it is
                    largely an abridged translation, but it also contains the substance of a vast
                    number of other Arabic and Turkish compilations and manuscripts. With all his
                    learning, the author seems to have been deficient in critical <hi

                    the inhibendum falling to the smaller presentation <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is
                    the fourth term of the proportion <hi rend="italic">α + b: a:: b: --∙</hi> and
