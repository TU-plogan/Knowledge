                    Hildegard, abbess, “prophetess,” and a figure of some consequence in the history
                    of mediaeval mysticism, was born of noble parents at Böckheleim in the countship
                    of Sponheim, diocese of Mainz, in 1098 (or 1099), and from her eighth year was
                    educated at the Benedictine cloister of Disiboden-berg (Mons Disibodi) in the
                    principality of Zweibrücken, now in Rhenish Bavaria, where Jutta, sister of the
                    count of Sponheim, was at that time abbess. From earliest childhood, we learn
                    from Hildegard herself, she was accustomed to see visions which increased in
                    frequency and vividness as she approached the age of womanhood; these, however,
                    she for many years, though with great pain, kept almost wholly secret, nor was
                    it until she had reached her forty-third year (1141) that she felt constrained
                    at last to divulge them. Committed to writing by her intimate friend the monk
                    Godefridus, they now form the first and most important of her printed works,
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Scivias</hi> (probably an abbreviation for “sciens
                    vias” or “nosce vias Domini ”) &amp; <hi rend="italic">Visionum et Revelationum

                    completed in 1151. In 1147 St Bernard of Clairvaux, having come to Bingen while
                    engaged in preaching the new crusade throughout Germany, chanced to hear of
                    Hildegard’s revelations, and on inquiry became so convinced of their reality
                    that he not only wrote to her a letter cordially acknowledging her as a
                    prophetess of God, but also successfully advocated her recognition as such by
                    his friend and former pupil Pope Eugenius III. in the synod of Trêves (1148). In
                    the same year Hildegard, who meanwhile had succeeded Jutta as abbess at
                    Disibo-denberg, and had attracted overflowing numbers to that <pb break="no"

                    nuns to a new convent at Rupertsberg near Bingen, over which she pre-eided
                    during the remainder of her life. By means of voluminous correspondence, as well
                    as by extensive journeys, in the course of which she was unwearied in the
                    exercise of her gift of prophecy, she wielded for many years an increasing
                    influence upon her contemporaries,—an influence doubtless due to the fact that
                    she herself was so fully imbued with the most widely diffused feelings and
                    beliefs, fears and hopes, of her time. Amongst her correspondents were Popes
                    Anastasius IV. and Hadrian IV., the emperors Conrad III. and Frederick I., and
                    also the theologian Guibert of Gembloux, who submitted numerous questions in
                    dogmatic for her determination. It deserves to be specially mentioned to her
                    credit that, though zealously opposed to the Catharists, she stood almost alone
                    in maintaining that the image of God ought to be respected even in them, and
                    that therefore they ought not to be killed. She died in 1179, but has never been
                    canonized; her name, however, was received into the Roman martyrology in the
                    15th century, September 17th being the day fixed for her commemoration. Her
                    biography, which was written by two contemporaries, Godefridus and Theodoricus,
                    was first printed at Cologne in 1566, and has frequently been reproduced in
                    various forms since that date.</p>

                    insanity, it is impossible to deny all ethical or religious value to her earnest
                    denunciations of the corruptions of the clergy and mendicant orders, or to the
                    intense expressions (however ignorant and imperfect) of the life-long
                    aspirations of a mind so singularly unselfish and unworldly as hers. The <hi
