                <p><label type="entry">HANSARD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Luke</hi></label> (1752-1828),
                    English printer, whose mm3 is familiar in connexion with the parliamentary
                    reports, was born July 5, 1752, in St Mary’s parish, Norwich. Reverses in
                    business compelled his father, a manufacturer there, to apprentice him to Mr
                    Stephen White, printer. Immediately on the expiry of his apprenticeship Hansard
                    started for London with only a guinea in his pocket, and obtained there in 1772
                    a situation as compositor in the office of Mr Hughs, printer to the House of
                    Commons. There his ability and energy commended him so well to his master that
                    in two years’ time he was made a partner, and undertook almost the entire
                    conduct of the business, which in 1800 was resigned completely into his hands,
                    through the retirement of Mr Hughs. Among those whose acquaintance Hansard made
                    in the exercise of his profession and retained by his amiable private qualities,
                    were Orme, Burke, and Dr Johnson; while Pυrson eulogized him as the most
                    accurate printer of Greek. The promptitude and accuracy with which Hansard
                    printed parliamentary papers were often of the greatest service to
                    Government,—notably on one occasion when the proof-sheets of the report of the
                    Secret Committee on the French Revolution were submitted to Pitt twenty-four
                    hours after the draft had left his hands. On the union with Ireland in 1801, the
                    increase of parliamentary printing was so great that Hansard was forced to give
                    up all private printing except when parliament was not sitting. He devised
                    numerous expedients for reducing the expense of publishing the reports; and in
                    1805, when his workmen struck at a time of great pressure, he and his sons did
                    not scruple themselves to work as compositors, and to instruct the new hands
                    they had procured. Shortly after printing the report of the session that rose in
                    July 1828, Hansard’s health, which had been failing, completely gave way, and he
                    died on October 29th of the same year. See the <hi rend="italic"
