                    a popular religious writer of the 18th century, was born at Hardingstone, near
                    Northampton, on February 26, 1714, and was educated at the grammar school of
                    Northampton, whence in 1731 he passed to Lincoln College, Oxford. At the
                    university he came under the influence of John Wesley and o <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> thers of that school, and for some time manifested an
                    inclination towards their theology; ultimately, however, while retaining his
                    regard for the men and his sympathy with their religious aims, he adopted a
                    thoroughly Calvinistic creed, and resolved to retain connexion with the
                    Established Church. Having taken holy orders in 1737, he became curate to his
                    father in the family livings of Weston Favell and Colling-tree, to which he
                    himself succeeded in 1752. There, under the disadvantage of very weak health, he
                    laboured with great diligence in the discharge of his parochial duties, and also
                    wrote numerous religious works, which, though of but slight literary or
                    theological value, rapidly became highly popular, and in many English and
                    Scottish houses, especially of the humbler class, took a place on the same shelf
                    with the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Progress</hi> and
