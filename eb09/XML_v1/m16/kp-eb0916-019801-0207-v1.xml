                <p><label type="entry">METRONOME</label>, an instrument for denoting the speed at
                    which a musical composition is to be performed. Its invention is generally, but
                    falsely, ascribed to Johann Nepomuk Maelzel, a native of Ratisbon (1772-1838).
                    It consists of a pendulum swung on a pivot; below the pivot is a fixed weight,
                    and above it is a sliding weight that regulates the velocity of the oscillations
                    by the greater or less distance from the pivot to which it is adjusted. The
                    silent metronome is impelled by the touch, and ceases to beat when this impulse
                    dies; it has a scale of numbers marked on the pendulum, and the upper part of
                    the sliding weight is placed under that number which is to indicate the
                    quickness of a stated note, as Μ. Μ. (Maelzel’s Metronome) A = 60, or ∙ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> l</hi> = 72, or · = 108, or the like. The number 60</p>
                <p>I I I/</p>
                <p>implies a second of time for each single oscillation of the pendulum,—numbers
                    lower than this denoting slower, and higher numbers quicker beats. The scale at
                    first extended from 50 to 160, but now ranges from 40 to 208. A more complicated
                    metronome is impelled by clock-work, makes a ticking sound at each beat, and
                    continues its action till the works run down; a still more intricate machine has
                    also a bell which is struck at the first of any number of beats willed by the
                    person who regulates it, and so signifies the accent as well as the time.</p>
                <p>The earliest instrument of the kind, a weighted pendulum of variable length, is
                    described in a paper by Étienne Loulié (Paris, 1696; Amsterdam, 1698). Attempts
                    were also made by Enbrayg (1732) and Gabory (1771). Harrison, who gained the
                    prize awarded by the English Government for his chronometer, published a
                    description of an instrument for the purpose in 1775. Davaux (1784), Pelletier,
                    Abel Burja (1790), and Weiske (also 1790) described their various experiments
                    for measuring musical time. In 1813 Gottfried Weber, the composer, theorist, and
                    essayist, proposed a weighted ribbon graduated by inches or smaller divisions,
                    which might be held or otherwise fixed at any desired length, and would
                    infallibly oscillate at the same speed so long as the impulse lasted; this, the
                    simplest, is also the surest, the most enduring, the most portable, and the
                    cheapest invention that has come before the world, and one can but wonder that
                    it has not been universally accepted. Stöckel and Zmeskall produced each an
                    instrument; and Maelzel made some slight modification of that by the former,
                    about the end of 1812, which he announced as a new invention of his own, and
                    exhibited from city to city on the Continent. It was, as nearly as can be
                    ascertained, in 1812 that Winkel, a mechanician of Amsterdam, devised a plan for
                    reducing the inconvenient length of all existing instruments, on the principle
                    of the double pendulum, rocking on both sides of a centre and balanced by a
                    fixed and a variable weight. He spent three years in completing it, and it is
                    described and commended in the <hi rend="italic">Report of the Netherlands A
                    cademy of Sciences,</hi> August 14,1815. Maelzel thereupon went to Amsterdam,
                    saw Winkel and inspected his invention, and, recognizing its great superiority
                    to what he called his own, offered to buy all right and title to it.</p>
                <p>Winkel refused, and so Maelzel constructed a copy of the instrument, to which he
                    added nothing but the scale of numbers, took this copy to Paris, obtained a
                    patent for it, and in 1816 established there, in his own name, a manufactory for
                    metronomes. When the impostor revisited Amsterdam, the inventor instituted
                    proceedings against him for his piracy, and the Academy of Sciences decided in
                    WinkeΓs favour, declaring that the graduated scale was the only point in which
                    the instrument of Maelzel differed from his. Maelzel’s scale was needlessly and
                    arbitrarily complicated, proceeding by twos from 40 to 60, by threes from 60 to
                    72, by fours from 72 to 120, by sixes from 120 to 144, and by eights from 144 to
                    208. Dr Crotch constructed a time-measurer, and Henry Smart (the violinist, and
                    father of the composer of the same name) made another in 1821, both before that
                    received as Maelzel’s was known in England. In 1882 James Mitchell, a Scotsman,
                    made an ingenious amplification of the Maelzel clock-work, reducing to
                    mechanical demonstration what formerly rested wholly on the feeling of the
                    performer. Although <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> Maelzel’s metronome” has
                    universal acceptance, the silent metronome and still more Weber’s graduated
                    ribbon are greatly to be preferred, for the clock-work of the other is liable to
                    be out of order, and needs a nicety of regulation which is almost impossible <hi
                    rend="italic">; for</hi> instance, when Sir George Smart had to mark the
                    traditional times of the several pieces in the Dettingen Te Deum, he tested them
                    by twelve metronomes, no two of which beat together. The value of the machine is
                    exaggerated, for no living performer could execute a piece in unvaried time
                    throughout, and no student could practise under the tyranny of its beat; and
                    conductors of music, nay, composers themselves, will give the same piece
                    slightly slower or quicker on different occasions, according to the
                    circumstances of performance.</p>
