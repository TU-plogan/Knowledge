                    rend="smallcaps">Santiago de,</hi> the capital of the republic of Uruguay (Banda
                    Oriental) in South America, lies on the eastern side of a nearly semicircular
                    bay on the northern shore of the estuary of the La Plata, 120 miles from Buenos
                    Ayres, with which communication is maintained by a daily service of steamers.
                    The small peninsula on which the city is built does not rise more than 95 feet
                    above the level of the sea; but the headland of Cerro, 505 feet high, which
                    forms the western side of the bay, is notable enough on that low-lying coast to
                    justify the name Montevideo; it is crowned by a lighthouse, and by an old
                    Spanish fort, once of considerable strength. About 620 acres is the area
                    occupied by the city proper; the suburbs stretch for miles into the country. The
                    plan both of the old and the new town is regular; they are separated by the
                    Calle de la Ciudadela on the line of the old ramparts. A somewhat Oriental
                    appearance is produced by the low houses with their flat terraced roofs and <hi
                    rend="italic">miradors</hi> or watchtowers, from which the merchants look out
                    for ships. As a whole, the city is overbuilt, and immense wealth has been
                    squandered in Italian marbles and other forms of architectural decoration. The
                    streets are for the most part well paved, and there is an extensive tramway
                    system. Mare’s grease was for some time employed to make gas for lighting; but
                    an epidemic having commenced at the gas-yard the works were for a time closed,
                    and when they were reopened coal-gas was substituted. Previous to 1870, when
                    water was introduced from a distance of 40 miles, the whole supply was dependent
                    on the rainfall. In the old town the principal square is the Plaza de la
                    Constitucion, the south side of which contains the “cathedral,” and the north
                    side the <hi rend="italic">cabildo</hi> (law-courts, senate-house, and prison).
                    The cathedral (as it is usually called, though the bishop is a bishop <hi
                    rend="italic">in partibus,</hi> and takes his title from Megaera in Asia Minor)
                    is a somewhat imposing building, consecrated 21st October 1804, with a dome and
                    two side towers 133 feet high, which form one of the best landmarks of the bay.
                    In the line of the old ramparts formerly stood the old Spanish citadel, which
                    was built by the seven years’ forced labour of 2000 Guarani Indians. From 1835
                    to 1868 it served as the principal market in the city; in 1877 it was removed
                    and the area united with the fine Plaza de la Independencia at the south-western
                    end of the Calle del 18 Julio, a broad street which runs in a straight line
                    right through the new town. The new market, covering 2 acres, was built in 1867
                    at a cost of £86,000, and there are besides the Port market (cost £55,320) and
                    the Mercado Chico. The exchange, constructed after the style of the house at
                    Bordeaux, dates from 1864, and cost £32,000. Of note also are the custom-house,
                    the post office (1866), the museum, the public library (founded in 1830 by Dr J.
                    Μ. Perez Castellano), the university (dating from 1849), the Solis theatre
                    (1856), the British hospital (established in 1857, present building 1867), the
                    Hospital de Caridad (founded by Francisco A. Macil in 1825), having an average
                    of 300 patients, the new lunatic asylum (1877), the Basque church (1858), and
                    the English church (1845), built on the site of a battery taken in 1807 by Sir
                    Samuel Auchmuty’s forces. Since the beginning of the century the depth of water
                    in the bay has been allowed to diminish 5 feet, and the area has been reduced by
                    the construction (1868) of an embankment to carry the railway across it.
                    Dredging has been tried from time to time, but on too limited a scale. The
                    so-called harbour is a space of less than half a mile square off the north-west
                    face of the town; in 1870 it was reported to be yearly becoming smaller and less
                    safe, and vessels are now obliged to anchor farther out. Among modern
                    improvements in the port the most noteworthy are the Maua dry docks, opened in
                    1873, and the larger docks, erected in 1877 at a cost of 2,000,000 dollars, at
                    the foot of the Cerro on the other side of the bay. The trade of Montevideo
                    consists mainly in the export of the raw products of the slaughter-house (horns,
                    hides, hair, tallow, wool, bones), with a certain quantity of live stock and
                    preserved meat, and in the import of European manufactures. During the five
                    years 1877-1881 the average value of the exports was £2,303,061, and that of the
                    imports £3,469,997. Of the 1044 vessels (tonnage 780,870) which entered in 1879,
                    285 were English, 157 Spanish, 145 Italian, 112 German, and 99 French. The
                    population is largely of foreign origin, Italian, Spanish, Basque, and French.
                    In 1874 the Italians, who had rapidly increased after the siege, were about
                    40,000 strong, and in several quarters of the city nothing was to be heard save
                    North-Italian dialects. Even in 1880, after the exodus caused by the
                    confiscations of 1875, they numbered 36,300. The greater proportion are engaged
                    as petty traders. In 1879 the total population of the town was 73,879; it had
                    been 92,260 in 1878, and 105,296 in 1871, and now (1883), including the
                    environs, is 110,167.</p>
                <p>Montevideo owes its origin not to the commercial advantages of its position but
                    to the jealousy of the Spaniards towards the Portuguese, which led Zabala,
                    viceroy of Buenos Ayres, to erect a fort at this point in 1717. In 1726 the
                    first settlers were introduced from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, and more
                    than fifty <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit16newyrich/page/n816/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0916-0816-0787"/> years passed before the settlement was declared a
                    port; but by 1781 it had 6460 inhabitants, and by 1792 was importing to the
                    value of 2,993,267 dollars, and exporting to the value of 4,150,523. In 1808 the
                    governor of Montevideo was the first to revolt against the Spanish authorities,
                    and to establish an independent junta; twenty years later, after much disastrous
                    confusion and conflict, the city became the recognized capital of the
                    newly-formed republic of Banda Oriental. Its population, which had been about
                    36,000 at the opening of the century, was reduced to 9000 by 1829; and it had
                    hardly recovered its ground in this respect (31,189) when, in 1843, Rosas,
                    dictator of Buenos Ayres, wishing to compel annexation to Buenos Ayres,
                    commenced the siege which was irregularly maintained till 1852, and left the
                    city and the country exhausted and almost ruined. By 1860, however, the
                    population had increased to 49,548; and though the Brazilians blockaded the port
                    in 1864-5 and reinstated ex-president Flores the prosperity of the place was but
                    little impaired. During the Paraguayan war, which lasted till 1864, Montevideo
                    grew rapidly rich, attracting a large share of the trade diverted from Buenos
                    Ayres. Immigrants flocked from all quarters, and excessive investments were made
                    in all kinds of real property. The valuation of the city and suburbs, which was
                    14,156,000 dollars in 1860, reached the sum of 74,000,000 dollars in 1872.
                    Reckless speculation, political dissension, and the financial mismanagement of
                    the Government have told heavily; the value of house property has greatly
                    diminished, and commercial activity has been grievously restricted. Since 1881,
                    however, Montevideo has been rapidly recovering, and its natural advantages are
                    so great that, with better political circumstances, a future of yet higher
                    prosperity may be anticipated.</p>
