                    (1615-1668), a royalist poet, who has won a place among the foremost British
                    authors more by a happy accident than by any decided genius, was the only son of
                    Sir John Denham, lord chief baron of the Exchequer in Ireland, and was born in
                    Dublin in 1615. In 1617 his father was promoted to the rank of baron of the
                    Exchequer in England, and removed to London with his family. The future poet
                    attended a grammar school in London, and in Michaelmas term 1631 was removed to
                    Oxford, where be was entered a gentleman commoner of Trinity College. Having
                    taken his degree of B.A., be began the study of the law at Lincoln’s Inn in
                    1634; but the character he had <pb break="no"

                    young man,” gave way to a scandalous reputation for gambling, by which he
                    beggared himself and seriously embarrassed his father. We learn that, by way of
                    penance, he wrote at this time an <hi rend="italic">Essay against Gaming,</hi>

                    became still more dominant, and he squandered a fortune. It was a surprise to
                    every one, therefore, when in 1642 he suddenly, as Waller said, “broke out like
                    the Irish rebellion, threescore thousand strong, when no one was aware, nor in
                    the least expected it,” by publishing in that year two most successful volumes
                    of verse. The first of these was <hi rend="italic">The Sophy,</hi> a tragedy in
                    five acts, a thin folio, the theme of which was a Turkish tale of blood and
                    intrigue, drawn from Sir Thomas Herbert’s travels. This, Denham’s only dramatic
                    performance, is tame and correct, without passion, but free from the faults of
                    some of the minor authors of the time. It was successful, but it enjoyed nothing
                    of the unparalleled popularity of his simultaneous venture, the descriptive poem
                    of <hi rend="italic">Cooper's Hill,</hi> the first edition of which in quarto
                    was anonymous. In this famous piece no entirely new style was attempted, for Ben
                    Jonson had led the way in theme and Cowley in manner; but it had a smooth grace
                    and a polished antithesis that were doubtful merits in poetry, but extremely
                    dear to the rising generation. One quatrain, out of the three or four hundred
                    lines of reflection and description, has been universally praised, and forms one
                    of our most familiar quotations. Addressing the Thames, the poet says—</p>
                <p>“0 could I flow like thee, and make thy stream My great example, as it is my
                    theme!</p>
                <p>Though deep, yet clear; though gentle, yet not dull;</p>
                <p>Strong without rage, without o’erflowing full.”</p>
                <p>Brought into royal notice by his poems, Denham was appointed high sheriff for
                    Surrey and governor of Farnham Castle; but he showed no military talent, and
                    soon followed the king to Oxford. During the civil war he served the queen
                    mother, and was intrusted with the letters in cipher that Cowley wrote to the
                    king, which he managed to deliver into Charles’s hands. Being detected, however,
                    he was obliged to escape into France. In April 1648 he is said to have conveyed
                    the young duke of York from St James’s to Paris; it is certain that, later in
                    that year, he was sent in company with Lord Crofts, as ambassador to Poland, to
                    obtain money for the king, and he succeeded in bringing back £10,000. In 1652 he
                    returned, a ruined man, to England, and resided as the guest of the earl of
                    Pembroke at Wilton for a year. He now disappears until the Restoration. When
                    Charles II. returned, Denham was made surveyor-general and Knight of the Bath,
                    and seems to have been well provided for; but his subsequent life was far from
                    happy, for his second wife, a young woman of great beauty, was seduced by the
                    duke of York, and became his mistress. This catastrophe, which is abundantly
                    noticed in the current literature of that day, shattered the old poet’s reason;
                    and he recovered from his insanity only to die, at his house near Whitehall, on
                    the 10th of March 1668. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. In the same year,
                    1668, his works were collected in a single volume, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poems and Translations.</hi> This included, besides <hi rend="italic">Cooper's
                    Hill</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Sophy,</hi> a fragment of an epic on the
                    destruction of Troy, some beautiful lines on the death of Cowley, written a few
                    months before his own decease, a didactic poem on the progness of learning, and
                    some translations. Notwithstanding the fame of <hi rend="italic">Cooper's
                    Hill,</hi> which Pope imitated in his <hi rend="italic">Windsor Forest,</hi>
                    Denham’s poems have not been edited in modern times. He was one of the very
                    first to note the tendency towards rhetorical and gallicized forms in public
                    taste, and to gratify the new fashion. But to speak of him, as was once
                    customary, as a great reformer of metre and fashioner of language, is to fail to
                    realize the limitations of his talent.</p>
