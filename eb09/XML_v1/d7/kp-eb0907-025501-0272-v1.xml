                    (1673-1734), a German theologian and alchemist, who assumed as an author the
                    name “Christianus Democritus,” was born at the castle of Frankenstein, near
                    Darmstadt, his father being a Lutheran clergyman. He studied at Giessen, where
                    he took the degree of master in philosophy in 1693. After a short visit to
                    Wittenberg he went to Strasburg, where he delivered lectures on astrology and
                    chiromancy, and occasionally preached. He gained considerable popularity, but
                    was obliged after a time to quit the city, owing to his irregular manner of
                    living, and the suspicion attaching to him of having been concerned in a murder.
                    He had up to this time espoused the cause of the orthodox as against the
                    pietists, and had justified his gay and worldly habits on the ground that he
                    intended to make a practical protest against pietism; but in his two first
                    published works, <hi rend="italic">Orthodoxia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Orthodoxorum</hi> (1697) and <hi rend="italic">Papismus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vapulans</hi><hi rend="italic">Protestantium</hi> (1698), he assailed
                    vehemently the fundamental positions of the Lutheran theology, denying the
                    inspiration of Scripture, the efficacy of the sacraments, and the doctrine of
                    justification by faith. He held that religion consisted not in dogma but
                    exclusively in love and selfsacrifice. To avoid persecution he was compelled to
                    wander from place to place, and he resided successively in various towns of
                    Germany, Holland, Denmark, and Sweden. He took the degree of doctor of medicine
                    at Leyden in 1711. From 1698 he devoted himself to experiments in alchemy, which
                    wasted a considerable fortune, and he was frequently imprisoned for debt. He
                    made several valuable discoveries in chemistry, one being Prussian blue, and
                    another an oil, still known as Dippel’s animal oil, which he offered as a
                    panacea, and which has useful medicinal properties of a more limited kind.
                    Provoked by false reports of his death, he published in 1733 an intimation that
