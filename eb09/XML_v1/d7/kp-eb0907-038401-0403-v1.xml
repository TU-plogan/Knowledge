                <p><label type="entry">DOXOLOGY</label>, a hymn in praise of the Almighty. The name
                    is often applied to the Trisagion, or “Holy, Holy, Holy,” the scriptural basis
                    of which is found in Isaiah vi. 3; to the Hallelujah of several of the Psalms
                    and of Rev. xix.; and to the last clause of the Lord’s Prayer according to Saint
                    Matthew, which critics are generally agreed in regarding as an interpolation. It
                    is used, however, more definitely as the designation of two hymns distinguished
                    by liturgical writers as the Greater and Lesser Doxologies. The origin and
                    history of these it is impossible to trace fully. The germ of both is to be
                    found in the Gospels; the first words of the Greater Doxology, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Gloria in</hi><hi rend="italic">Excelsis,</hi> being taken from
                    Luke ii. 14, and the form of the Lesser Doxology, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gloria</hi><hi rend="italic">Patri,</hi> having been in all probability first
                    suggested by Matt, xxviii. 19. The Greater Doxology, in a form approximating to
                    that of the English prayer-book, is given in the <hi rend="italic">Apostolical
                    Constitutions</hi> (vii. 47). This is the earliest record of it, unless, indeed,
                    the <hi rend="italic">Apostolical Constitutions</hi> be taken to be of a later
                    date than the Alexandrine Codex, where the hymn also occurs. Alcuin attributes
                    the authorship of the Latin form—the <hi rend="italic">Gloria in</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Excelsis</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> to St Hilary of Poitiers
                    (died 368), but this is at best only a plausible conjecture. The quotations from
                    the hymn in the <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Virginitate</hi> of
                    Athanasius, and in Chrysostom <hi rend="italic">(Hom.</hi> 69 <hi rend="italic"
                    >in</hi><hi rend="italic">ΛfattJιf),</hi> include only the opening words (those
                    from St Luke’s gospel), though the passage in Athanasius shows by an <hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">caetera</hi> that only the commencement
                    of the hymn is given. These references indicate that the hymn was used in
                    private devotions; as it does not appear in any of the earliest liturgies,
                    whether ‘Eastern or Western, its introduction into the public services of the
                    church was probably of a later date than has often been supposed. Its first
                    introduction into the Roman liturgy is due to Pope Symmachus (498-514), who
                    ordered it to be sung on Sundays and festival days. The Mozarabic liturgy
                    provides for its eucharistie use on Sundays and festivals. In these and other
                    early liturgies the Greater Doxology occurs immediately after the commencement
                    of the service; in the English prayer-book it is introduced at the close of the
                    communion office, but it does not occur in either the morning or evening
                    service. The Lesser Doxology, or <hi rend="italic">Gloria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Patri,</hi> combines the character of a creed with that of a hymn. In its
                    earliest form it ran simply—“Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the
                    Holy Ghost, world without end, Amen,” or “Glory be to the Father, in or by the
                    Son, and by the Holy Ghost.” Until the rise of the Arian heresy these forms were
                    probably regarded as indifferent, both being equally capable of an orthodox
                    interpretation. When the Arians, however, finding the second form more
                    consistent with their views, adopted it persistently and exclusively, its use
                    was naturally discountenanced by the Catholics, and the other form became the
                    symbol of orthodoxy. To the influence of the Arian heresy is also obviously due
                    the addition of the clause—“as it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall
                    be,” the use of which was, according to some authorities, expressly enjoined by
                    the Council of Nicaea. There is no sufficient evidence of this, but there exists
                    a decree of the second Council of Vaison (529), asserting its use as already
                    established in the East <hi rend="italic">propter</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >haereticorum, astutiam,</hi> and ordering its adoption throughout the churches
                    of the West. In the Western Church the <hi rend="italic">Gloria</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Patri</hi> is repeated at the close of every psalm, in the Eastern
                    church at the close of the last psalm.</p>
