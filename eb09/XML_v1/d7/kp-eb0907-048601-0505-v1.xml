                    specially as an Orientalist and exegete, was bom at Oudenarde, in Flanders, on

                    philosophy at Louvain; but his father having been outlawed for his religion, and
                    deprived of his estate, retired to England, where the son followed him in 1567.
                    He found an admirable teacher of Hebrew in Chevalier, the celebrated
                    Orientalist, with whom he resided for some time at Cambridge. In 1572 he became
                    professor of Oriental languages at Oxford. Upon the pacification of Ghent (1576)
                    he returned with his father to their own country, and was appointed professor of
                    Oriental languages at Leyden in the following year. In 1585 he removed to
                    Friesland, and was admitted professor of Hebrew in the university of Franeker,
                    an office which he discharged with great honour till his death, which happened
                    in February 1616 He acquired so extended a reputation as a professor that his
                    class was frequented by students from all the Protestant countries of Europe.
                    His works prove him to have been well skilled in Hebrew and in Jewish
                    antiquities; and in 1600 the States-general employed him, at a salary of 400
                    florins a year, to write notes on the most difficult passages in the Old
                    Testament; but, as he was frequently interrupted in prosecuting this
                    undertaking, it was not published until after his death. As the friend of
                    Arminius, he was charged by the orthodox and dominant party with unfairness in
                    the execution of this task, and the last sixteen years of his life were,
                    therefore, somewhat embittered by controversy. He carried on an extensive
                    correspondence with the learned in different countries; for, beside letters in
                    Hebrew, Greek, and other languages, there were found amongst his papers upwards
                    of 2000 written in Latin. He had a son, John, who died in England at the age of
                    twenty-one, and was accounted a prodigy of learning. He had mastered Hebrew at

                    father. He wrote a large number of letters in Hebrew, besides notes on the
                    Proverbs of Solomon and other works.</p>
