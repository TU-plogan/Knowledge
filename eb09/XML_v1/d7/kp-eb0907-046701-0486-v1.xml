                    (1595-1669), an eminent minister of the French Calvinistic church, was born at
                    Sedan on the 10th July 1595. He studied first at the university of his native
                    town, and afterwards at Saumur under the celebrated Professor Mark Duncan. In
                    June 1618 he undertook the charge of the French Protestant church at Langres,
                    where his ministrations were highly appreciated. The church, however, failed to
                    receive the necessary royal sanction, and early in 1620 Drelincourt <pb

                    of the church at Charenton. He was a popular and eloquent preacher,
                    distinguished especially by his power of practically applying the words of
                    Scripture. He was the author of a large number of works in devotional and
                    polemical theology, several of which had great influence, and attained a very
                    extensive circulation. His <hi rend="italic">Catechism</hi> and his <hi
                    rend="italic">Consolations against the Fear of Death (Consolations</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">contre les frayeurs de la mort)</hi> became well known in England
                    by means of translations, which were very frequently reprinted. It has been said
                    that Defoe wrote his fiction of Mrs Veal, who came from the other world to
                    recommend the perusal of Drelincourt on death, for the express purpose of
                    promoting the sale of an English translation of the work. His controversial
                    works were very numerous. Directed entirely against Roman Catholicism, they did
                    much to strengthen and consolidate the Protestant party in France. Drelincourt
                    died on the 3d November 1669. In 1625 he had married the only daughter of a
                    wealthy merchant, by whom he had a family of sixteen. Several of his sons were
