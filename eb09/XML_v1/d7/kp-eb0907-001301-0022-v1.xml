                <p><label type="entry">DEAL</label>, a municipal and parliamentary borough and
                    market town of England, in the county of Kent, eight miles N.N.E. of Dover and
                    five miles by rail S.S.E. of Sandwich. It consists of three divisions :—Lower
                    Deal, which is the most important, on the coast; Middle Deal; and, about a mile
                    inland, Upper Deal. Though largely frequented as a sea-bathing place, the town
                    derives its importance mainly from its vicinity to the Downs, a fine anchorage
                    about eight miles long and six miles wide between the shore and the Goodwin
                    Sands, in which large fleets of wind-bound vessels may lie in safety. The trade
                    consequently consists largely in the supply of provisions and naval stores;
                    though boat-building and a few other industries are carried on. The Deal pilots,
                    limited by statute to the number of 56, are famous for their skill and daring.
                    Among the public buildings in the town the most remarkable are St Leonard’s
                    Church in Upper Deal, which dates from the Norman period; the Baptist chapel in
                    Lower Deal, founded by Captain Taverner, governor of Deal Castle, in 1663; the
                    Deal and Walmer Institute, established in 1864; the military and naval hospital;
                    and the barracks, whjch date from 1795. The site of the old navy yard is now
                    occupied by villas; and the esplanade has been improved by the construction of a
                    promenade pier. At the-south end of the town is Deal Castle, erected by Henry
                    VIII.; and about a mile to the east is Sandoun Castle, which ow es its origin to
                    the same monarch, and is of interest as the prison in which Colonel Hutchinson
                    died in 1664. Walmer Castle, the official residence of the warden of the
                    Cinque-Ports, is about a mile to the south. It has become intimately associated
                    with the memory of the duke of Wellington, who died within its walls in 1852.
                    Deal was possibly the site of a Roman station, but it has not received any
                    definite identification. In the 13th century it was regarded as a subordinate
                    member of the Cinque-Port guild; but even as late as the time of Henry VIII. it
                    was still but a small village. Perkin Warbeck landed at this point in 1495. The
                    castle was vainly besieged by the royalists in 1648; and in 1652 the Downs were
                    the scene of Blake’s victory over Van Tromp. Mrs Elizabeth Carter was a native
                    of Deal. The population of the borough, which unites with Sandwich and Walmer in
                    sending one member to Parliament, was, in 1871, 8009. The area is 1124
                    acres.</p>
