                    Earl</hi></label> and <hi rend="smallcaps">First Duke of</hi> (1640-1707),
                    distinguished as a statesman and patriot, born in 1640, was the eldest son of
                    the third earl. After completing his education he made the tour of Europe
                    according to the custom of young men of his rank, being accompanied on his
                    travels by Dr Killigrew. On his return he obtained, in 1661, a seat in
                    Parliament for the county of Derby, and soon became conspicuous as one of the
                    most determined and daring opponents of the general policy of the court. In 1678
                    he was one of the committee appointed to draw up articles of impeachment against
                    the lord-treasurer Danby. In 1679 he was re-elected for Derby, and made a privy
                    councillor by Charles II.; but he soon withdrew from the board with his friend
                    Lord Russell, when he found that the Romish interest uniformly prevailed. He
                    carried up to the House of Lords the articles of impeachment against Lord
                    ChiefJustice Bcroggs, for his arbitrary and illegal proceedings in the Court of
                    King’s Bench; and when the king declared his resolution not to sign the bill for
                    excluding the duke of York, afterwards James IL, he moved in the House of
                    Commons that a bill might be brought in for the association of all his majesty’s
                    Protestant subjects. He also openly denounced the king’s counsellors, and voted
                    for an address to remove them. He appeared in defence of Lord Russell at his
                    trial, at a time when it was scarcely more criminal to be an accomplice than a
                    witness. After the condemnation he gave the utmost possible proof of his
                    attachment by offering to exchange clothes with Lord Russell in the prison,
                    remain in his place, and so allow him to effect his escape. In November 1684 he
                    succeeded to the earldom on the death of his father. He opposed arbitrary
                    government under James II. with the same consistency and high spirit as during
                    the previous reign. He was withdrawn from public life for a time, however, in
                    consequence of a hasty and imprudent act of which his enemies knew how to avail
                    themselves. Fancying that he had received an insulting look in the presence
                    chamber from Colonel Colepepper, a swaggerer whose attendance at court the king
                    encouraged, he immediately avenged the affront by challenging the colonel, and,
                    on the challenge being refused, striking him with his cane. This offence was
                    punished by a fine of £30,000, which was an enormous sum even to one of the
                    earl’s princely fortune. Not being able to pay he was imprisoned in the King’s
                    Bench, from which he was released only on signing a bond for the whole amount.
                    This was afterwards cancelled by King William. After his discharge the earl went
                    for a time to Chatsworth, where he occupied himself with architectural
                    improvements on his mansion. The Revolution again brought him into prominence.
                    He was one of the seven who signed the original paper inviting the Prince of
                    Orange from Holland, and was the first nobleman who appeared in arms to receive
                    him at his landing. He received the Order of the Garter on the occasion of the
                    coronation, aud was made lord high stewart of the new court. In 1691 he
                    accompanied King William on his visit to Holland. He was created marquis of
                    Hartington and duke of Devonshire in 1694 by William and Mary, on the same day
                    on which the head of the house of Russell was created duke of Bedford. Thus, to
                    quote Macaulay, “the two great houses of Russell and Cavendish, which had long
                    been closely connected by friendship and by marriage, by common opinions, common
                    sufferings, and common triumphs, received on the same day the highest honour
                    which it is in the power of the Crown to confer.” His last public service was
                    assisting to conclude the union with Scotland, for negotiating which he and his
                    son, the marquis of Hartington, had been appointed among the commissioners by
                    Queen Anne. He died on the 18th August 1707, and ordered the following
                    inscription to be put on his monument :—</p>
