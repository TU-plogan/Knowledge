                <p><label type="entry">DELFT</label>, a town of Holland, in the province of South
                    Holland, on the Schie, nearly ten miles from Rotterdam, and in the line of the
                    canal between that city and the Hague. It is well and regularly built in the
                    form of a square, but has a rather gloomy appearance from its streets being
                    traversed by narrow stagnant canals. The public buildings comprise the
                    Prinsenhof, or palace, where William of Orange was assassinated in 1584; the
                    town-house, erected in 1618, with antiquarian and artistic collections; the Old
                    Church, dating from the 11th century, and containing monuments to Van Tromp and
                    Piet Hein, and the tomb of Leeuwenhoek, the naturalist; the New Church, founded
                    in 1381, and interesting both for its chime of 500 bells, and as the
                    burial-place of the princes of the house of Orange from the days of the
                    Liberator down to the present century; the arsenal, originally erected as a
                    warehouse for the East India Company; and the polytechnic school, with the fine
                    collection of mechanical models formerly preserved in the dockyard at Amsterdam.
                    It is sufficient to mention the powder-magazine, the school of military
                    engineering, the theatre, the municipal school for the education of civil
                    service students for the colonies, the school of design, the lunatic asylum, and
                    Madame Renswonde’s orphanage. For a long time the name of Delft was associated,
                    not only in Holland, but even abroad, with the manufacture of excellent
                    earthenware; but this industry, as well as the beer-brewing which was of great
                    importance last century, has become almost extinct. The present branches are
                    carpet-weaving, cooperage, dyeing, and distilling. The town was founded about
                    1075 by Duke Geoffrey of Lorraine after his conquest of Holland from Count
                    Thierry. It was almost totally ravaged by fire in 1536; and in 1654 it lost
                    about 1200 of its population by the explosion of a powder-magazine. In 1797 the
                    <hi rend="italic">Christo Sacrum</hi> Society was founded by Onder van
                    Vyngaard-Ceanzius, the burgomaster of the city, for the utopian purpose of
                    uniting in one community all the various branches of the Christian church. Of
                    the celebrities of the town the most famous is Grotius, whose tomb is shown in
                    the New Church. Population in 1874, 23,900.</p>
