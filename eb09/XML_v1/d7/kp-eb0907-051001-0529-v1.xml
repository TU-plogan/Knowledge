                <p><label type="entry">DUDLEY</label>, a parliamentary and municipal borough of
                    England, in a detached portion of the county of Worcestershire surrounded by the
                    county of Stafford. It lies in the centre of the “Black Country,” about eight
                    miles W.N.W. of Birmingham, at a junction on the Great Western railway. The town
                    is generally well-built, its streets are well-paved, and there is a fair supply
                    of water. The principal buildings are the parish church of St Thomas, rebuilt in
                    1819 at a cost of .£23,000, and restored in 1862; several other churches, of
                    which the most recent is St Luke’s, erected in 1876; the town-hall, the county
                    court, the Guest hospital (formerly the blind asylum), endowed (1868) by Joseph
                    Guest,.with a legacy of £20,000 (1861), the school of art, the new dispensary
                    (1868), and the mechanics’ institute (1861). Among the educational
                    establishments are a free grammar-school, a subscription library, and a
                    geological society with a small scientific museum. On a hill to the north are
                    the extensive remains of an ancient castle, surrounded by beautiful grounds; and
                    in the market-place stands a fountain, erected by the earl of Dudley at a cost
                    of £3000, on the occasion of his marriage. The presence of coal, iron-ore, and
                    limestone gives its peculiar character to the industries of the place. According
                    to the census of 1871, 5442 men were engaged in the iron manufacture, 1040 as
                    makers of engines or machines, and 3501 in the coal-mines; while the nail
                    manufacture alone gave employment to 1267 males and 3019 females. Among the
                    various articles produced are fire-irons, stoves, shovels, edge tools, chains,
                    anchors, and especially anvils and vices. The glass-works, brass foundries, and
                    brickworks are also of importance; and tanning, brewing, and malting are
                    extensively carried on. The parliamentary borough has an area of 7715 acres, and
                    returns one member to Parliament. In 1871 the population of the municipal
                    borough, which has an area of 3680 acres, was 43,782; that of the parliamentary
                    borough was 82,249.</p>

                <p>Dudley castle, according to an unfounded tradition preserved by Camden, was first
                    built about 700 by a Mercian prince called Dodo. It is mentioned in Domesday
                    book as belonging after the conquest to William Fitz Ansculf. Being held in 1138
                    for the empress Maud by Ralphe Paganel, it was burnt by Stephen. In 1161
                    Gervase, Ralphe’s son, founded a priory for Cluniac monks, about a quarter of a
                    mile to the west of the castle, at a spot still distinguished by a few ruins.
                    The lordship was afterwards held by the Somerys, and the Suttons; and from the
                    latter family it was transferred by marriage to the Wards of Bixley. John Ward,
                    sixth Baron Dudley, was in 1763 created Viscount Dudley and Ward; and in 1827
                    John William, the fourth viscount, was created Earl Dudley. The title died with
                    him in 1833, but was restored in 1860 in favour of William, his second cousin.
                    The description Sir Amyas Pawlet gives of the town in 1585 is—“one of the
                    poorest towns 1 have seen in my life.” On its surrender to the Parliament in
                    1646-7 the fortifications of the castle were demolished, but it continued
                    habitable to 1750, when a fire broke out which reduced it to its present ruinous
                    state. Dudley was enfranchised in 1832 by 2 Will. IV. c. 45; and it received
                    incorporation in 1865. See Booker’s <hi rend="italic">History of Dudley,</hi>
