                    presidency of Bombay, situated between 14° 6' and 15’ 53' N. lat., and 74° 50'
                    and 75° 58' E. long. It contains a total area of 4536 square miles, and a
                    population of 988,037 inhabitants. The district is about 116 miles long, with an
                    average width of 77 miles. It is bounded on the N. by the Belgaum and Kaládgi
                    districts, on the E. by the Nizám’s territory and Bellári district, on the S. by
                    Mysore, and on the W. by Belgaum and North Kanara districts. The western
                    portions of the district, in the neighbourhood of the Sabyádri range, are rugged
                    and hilly; but towards the east, the land falls away into plains of black soil
                    in many parts very fertile and well suited to the growth of cotton, with
                    occasionally a detached peak or group of hills. The chief rivers are the
                    Malprabhá on the north and the Tungbhadrá on the south. The hills are
                    principally composed of hornblende and chloritic schists, gneiss, and mica
                    slate, large interstratified beds of silicious and ferruginous schists (as at
                    and near Dhárwár) often forming their ridges. Seams and beds of a crystalline
                    white marble occur, which, near their junction with the hornblende slate, are
                    often coloured green. Gold is found sparingly in the Dumbal hills, and chick
                    mulgund, and also iron pyrites. Iron ore is worked to a small extent at Tegur.

                    influential classes of the community are Brahmans and Lingáyats. The Lingáyats
                    number 380,919, or 44 per cent, of the Hindu population; they worship the symbol
                    of Siva, and males and females both carry this emblem about their person in a
                    silver case. The manufactures of the district are not numerous; they consist of
                    cotton and silk cloth, glass bracelets, and articles of ironware. In four towns
                    of the district cotton and mixed silk and cotton fabrics, for male and female
                    attire, are delicately and tastefully woven, Agriculture is the chief industry
                    of the district, the principal products being cotton, exotic and native <hi
                    rend="italic">jawári,</hi> molasses, and oil of various kinds. Of a total of
                    1,662,040 acres of Government arable and assessed land, 1,530,235 acres were in
                    1874 under cultivation as follows :—Rice, 90,896 acres; cotton, 283,810; <hi
                    rend="italic">jawári,</hi> 497,312; <hi rend="italic">bájri,</hi> 6126; wheat,
                    112,169; sugar-cane, 2909; tobacco, 790; <hi rend="italic">til</hi> seed,
                    29,647; linseed, 7966; gram, 23,411; miscellaneous products, 294,491; fallow
                    land, 182,869 acres. The cotton trade of Dhárwár has great commercial
                    importance. The land revenue realized in 1875 amounted to £196,064. The district
                    contains six municipalities.</p>
                <p>The territory comprised within the district appears at the earliest recorded
                    period to have formed part of the Brahmanical realm of Vijayanagar. On the
                    overthrow of its king at Talikot in 1565, the lands of Dhárwár became part of
                    the Mussulman kingdom of Bijápur. In 1675 the district seems to have been
                    overrun and partially conquered by Siváji, becoming thereby subject to the king
                    of Satára, and subsequently to the Peshwá. In 1776 the province was overrun by
                    Hyder Ah, the usurping sultan of Mysore. In 1778 Dhárwár was taken from the
                    Marhattás by Hyder Ali, and in 1791 retaken by a British force. On the final
                    overthrow of the Peshwá in 1818, Dhárwár was incorporated with the territory of
                    the East India Company.</p>
