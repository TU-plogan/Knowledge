                <p><label type="entry">DISMAL SWAMP</label>, the name given to two extensive
                    stretches of morass on the eastern seaboard of North America. The larger of the
                    two, distinguished as the Great Dismal, lies in the peninsula between the James
                    River on the north and Albemarle Sound on the south, and thus belongs partly to
                    Virginia and partly to North Carolina. Its length from north to south is about
                    40 miles and its breadth about <hi rend="italic">'25.</hi> The greater part of
                    the area is covered with a thick stratum of spongy vegetable soil, without any
                    mixture of earthy particles, which at once supports and is augmented by a
                    luxuriant growth of aquatic plants, brushwood, and timber. The prevailing trees
                    are cypress, juniper, and white cedar, and on the higher ridges oak and beech.
                    By a curious arrangement, minutely described by Sir Charles Lyell in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Travels in North America,</hi> the surface of the swamp is
                    actually higher, in some parts by as much as 12 feet, than that of the
                    surrounding country; so that, except on the western side, where it receives a
                    few small streams, the waters flow outwards. The centre is occupied by
                    Drummond’s Lake, an oval basin about 6 miles long and 3 wide, with perpendicular
                    banks and an extreme depth of 15 feet; the water is clear and abounds with fish.
                    The swamp has long furnished large supplies of timber, much of which has been
                    obtained by excavation from the peaty soil in which it was preserved. The
                    transit is facilitated by means of canals, of which the two most important are
                    the Dismal Swamp Canal, uniting the western branch of Elizabeth river with the
                    Pasquotank, and the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal, connecting the eastern
                    branch of Elizabeth river with Currituck Sound. The former is flanked by a stage
                    road, which terminates in the south at Elizabeth City, and in the north at
                    Norfolk. Two lines of railway pass through the outskirts of the Virginian
                    portion of the swamp.</p>
                <p>The Little Dismal is of much less importance. It lies in North Carolina, in the
                    peninsula between Albemarle Sound and Pamlico Sound; and in the days when
                    slavery was still legal, it was a noted harbour of runaway negroes.</p>
