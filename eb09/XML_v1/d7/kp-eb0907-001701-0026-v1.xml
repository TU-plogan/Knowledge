                    (1803-1860), one of the foremost painters of the modern French school, was born
                    in Paris on the 3d March 1803. He received his artistic training from Abel de
                    Pujol, but set himself free at an early period of his career from academic
                    trammels. He asserted his originality in his choice of subjects as well as in
                    his style of treatment. In his youth he travelled in the East, and reproduced
                    Oriental life and scenery with a bold fidelity to nature that made his works the
                    puzzle of conventional critics. His powers, however, soon came to be recognized,
                    and he was ranked along with Delacroix and Vernet as one of the leaders of the
                    French school. At the Paris Exhibition of 1855 he received the grand or council
                    medal. Most of his life was passed in the neighbourhood of Paris. He was
                    passionately fond of animals, especially dogs, and indulged in all kinds of
                    field sports. He died on the 22d August 1860 in consequence of being thrown from
                    a vicious horse while hunting at Fontainebleau. The style of Decamps was
                    characteristically and intensely French. It was marked by vivid dramatic
                    conception, by a manipulation bold and rapid, sometimes even to roughness, and
                    especially by original and startling use of <pb break="no"
                    facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n27/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0907-0027-0018"/> decided contrasts of colour and of light and
                    shade. His subjects embraced an unusually wide range; He availed himself of his
                    travels in the East -in dealing with scenes from scripture history, which he was
                    probably the first of European painters to represent with their true and natural
                    local background. Of this class were his Joseph sold by his Brethren, Moses
                    taken from the Nile, and his scenes from the life of Samson, nine vigorous
                    sketches in charcoal and white. Perhaps the most impressive of his historical
                    pictures is his Defeat of the Cimbri, representing with wonderful skill the
                    conflict between a horde of barbarians and a disciplined army. Decamps produced
                    a number of genre pictures, chiefly of scenes from French and Algerine domestic
                    life, the most marked feature of which is humour. The same characteristic
                    attaches to most of his numerous animal paintings. He painted dogs, horses,
                    &lt;fcc., with great fidelity and sympathy; but his favourite subject was
                    monkeys, which he depicted in various studies and sketches with a grotesque
                    humour that could scarcely be surpassed. Probably the best known of all his
                    works is The Monkey Connoisseurs, a clever satire of the jury of the French
                    Academy of Painting, which had rejected several of his earlier works on account
                    of their divergence from any known standard. The pictures and sketches of
                    Decamps were first made familiar to the English public through the lithographs
                    of Eugène la Roux. See Moreau’s <hi rend="italic">Decamps</hi><hi rend="italic"
