                    (1602-1650), antiquarian, chronicler, and collector of historical records, was
                    bom at Coxden, in the parish of Chard stock, in Dorsetshire, on the 18 th
                    December 1602. His father, one of the six clerks of Chancery, possessed a large
                    official income, and gave him a liberal education at the grammar-school of Bury
                    St Edmunds, and at St John’s College, Cambridge. Called to the bar in 1623, he
                    did not enter upon practice, being possessed of independent means, and having
                    already resolved to devote himself to historical research. His intention seems
                    to have been to compile a history of Britain from original documents, and in
                    endeavouring to carry it out he spent much of his time in examining historical
                    records, which he describee as “the most ravishing and satisfying part of human
                    knowledge,” in the Tower of London and elsewhere. The chief results of this
                    labour were his valuable collection of records—originals and transcripts—which
                    now form part of the Harleian collection in the British Museum, and his <hi

                    Bowes, in 1682. His means had been considerably increased by his marriage with
                    an heiress in 1626, soon after which he procured the honour of knighthood. One
                    of his many foibles was a desire to establish for himself an aristocratic
                    lineage, and his efforts to do this, in spite of the fact he is forced to admit,
                    that he does not know who his great-grandfather was, are very amusing. In 1639
                    he became high sheriff of Suffolk, and in 1641 he was made a baronet. In the
                    intervening year he entered the Long Parliament as member for Sudbury. Here he
                    obtained a peculiar place for himself by his whimsicality, and his parade of his
                    knowledge of records, which he quoted at first in nearly every debate, sometimes
                    relevantly, but oftener not. He was treated for a time with a sort of amused
                    tolerance, but ultimately his innumerable interferences with the conduct of
                    business had to be checked. He was not a very warm adherent of the cause of the
                    Parliament against the king. Belonging to the Presbyterian section of the
                    Puritan party, he was excluded from the House of Commons by “Pride’s Purge” in
                    1648. He died on the 18th April 1650. The <hi rend="italic">Autobiography and
                    Correspondence of Sir Simonds D’Ewes,</hi> edited by J. O. Halliwell, was
                    published in 1845, and possesses considerable historical value. Much more
                    important, however, are his manuscript notes of the Long Parliament, describing
                    its sittings between 1640 and 1645 with great graphic power and minuteness of
                    detail. They form five volumes of the Harleian manuscripts in the British
                    Museum, and have been largely drawn upon by John Forster and other writers on
                    the period of the Long Parliament.</p>
