                <p><label type="entry">DRUM</label>, a musical instrument of percussion, which is
                    supposed to have been introduced into Europe from the East by the Moors or after
                    the Crusades. In certain forms, however, it was known in Europe in classical
                    times. The Greek and Roman <hi rend="italic">tympanum</hi> seems from
                    descriptions and pictorial representations to have included not only tambourines
                    but kettledrums of a small size, or at least instruments convex on one side like
                    the kettledrum. The instrument designated in Scripture a timbrel (Heb. <hi
                    rend="italic">tοph)</hi> was undoubtedly a kind of tambourine, such as might be
                    conveniently played by females. In India and Egypt the use of drums in a
                    considerable variety of forms may be traced back to the earliest historic times.
                    The tam-tam or tom-tom of India, a cylindrical drum of some size beaten with the
                    fingers, had its counterpart in Egypt at least as early as 1600 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.o.</hi> Among savage races, whose music has not risen above
                    the primitive or percussive stage, the drum is naturally the chief, and in many
                    cases the sole instrument employed. Three principal forms of drum are in general
                    use in the modern orchestra,—the common or side drum, the base or Turkish drum,
                    and the kettledrum. The first is composed of a cylinder of wood, or, more
                    generally, of metal, covered at each end with vellum or parchment, the tension
                    of which is regulated by strings. As its name indicates, it is worn at the side
                    of the performer, who beats upon the upper end with two sticks. Its distinctive
                    though not its exclusive use is to accompany the military fife band. The base
                    drum is a larger instrument of the same kind» the cylinder being composed of
                    oak. It is beaten at both ends with drum-sticks furnished with leather pads. It
                    is an important constituent of a full military band, but it is also employed in
                    the orchestra, especially by more recent composers. The kettledrum is the most
                    important form of the instrument in orchestral as distinct from military music.
                    It is composed of a basin of brass or copper, almost hemispherical in shape,
                    covered with vellum attached to an iron ring, and it is usually placed upon an
                    iron tripod. By means of screws it is capable of being tuned within certain
                    necessarily narrow limits. Kettledrums are always used in pairs, one being tuned

                    in the key of C; and the key in which it is to be played, if different, is

                    percussive instruments, such as the gong and the tam-tam, are sometimes
                    introduced for the sake of particular effects.</p>
