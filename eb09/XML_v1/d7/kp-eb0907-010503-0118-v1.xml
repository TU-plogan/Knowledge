                <p><label type="entry">DERBEND, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Derbent</hi></label>, a town
                    of Russia, in the government of Daghestan, on the western shore of the Caspian,
                    about 170 miles E.N.E. of Tiflis, in 42’ 4' N. lat. and 47’ 53' E. long. It
                    occupies a narrow strip of land lying between the sea and a mountain ridge of
                    moderate elevation, which is crowned by the citadel, or Narin Kalé; and on all
                    sides except towards the east, where it projects into the water, it is
                    surrounded by strong walls built of porous limestone. Its general aspect is
                    decidedly Oriental, owing to the flat roofs of its two-storied houses. Besides
                    the governor’s residence, which stands in the neighbourhood of the citadel, the
                    town possesses a fine Russian church, 3 Jewish synagogues, 17 mosques (including
                    one belonging to the Sunna sect), 3 bazaars, and a number of caravanserais. The
                    upper part of the town is supplied with water from a reservoir in the citadel,
                    fed by a fountain in the mountain behind; but the Dubar, or lower town along the
                    shore, communicates by an aqueduct with the Rubas-Chai, a small river to the
                    south. The environs are occupied by vineyards, gardens, and orchards, in which
                    madder, saffron, and tobacco, as well as figs, peaches, pears, and other fruits
                    are cultivated. The madder is a valuable export, and the saffron is in high
                    repute. Earthenware, weapons, and silk and cotton fabrics, are the principal
                    products of the manufacturing industry. To the north of the town is the monument
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Kirk Lar,</hi> or Forty Heroes of Daghestan, whose
                    valour is commemorated in Arabic inscriptions; and to the south lies the seaward

                    still entire, had a height of 29 feet and a thickness of about 10, and with its
                    iron gates and numerous watch-towers formed a valuable defence of the Persian
                    frontier. Derbend is a place of great antiquity, and is usually identified with
                    Albana, the capital of the ancient Albania. The modern name, which is the
                    Persian word for a gateway, probably came into use about the end of the 5th or
                    the beginning of the 6th century, when the city was re-founded by Kobod of the
                    Sassanid dynasty. The walls and the citadel are believed to belong to the time
                    of Kobod’s son, Nushirvan Chosroes. In 728 the Arabs entered into possession,
                    and established a khanate in the city, which they called either Bab-el-abwab,
                    “the principal gate,” Bab-el-Khadid, “the iron gate,” or Seril-el-Dagab, “the
                    golden throne.” The celebrated caliph, Haroun-al-Rashid, lived in Derbend at
                    different times, and brought it into great repute as a seat of arts and
                    commerce. In 1220 it was captured by the Mongolians, and in the course of the
                    succeeding centuries it frequently changed masters. In the reign of Feodor
                    Ivanovitch, the Persian Government promised to make it over to Russia in reward
                    for assistance against the Turks, but the surrender was never completed. In 1722
                    Peter the Great took advantage of the disturbances in Persia, seized the town,
                    established a garrison, and intrusted the government to Imam Kuli-Beg; but in
                    1733 the supremacy of the Persian Nadir Shah was again recognized. Captured in
                    1760 by Fut Ali Khan, and governed after his death by his brother Sheikh Ali,
                    the town was in 1796 besieged by the Russians both by land and sea, and in 1813
                    formally incorporated by the treaty of Gulistan with the Russian empire. In 1831
                    it was vainly attacked by Kazi-mulL Population in 1873, 15,739.</p>
