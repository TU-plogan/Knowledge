                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Morel,</hi> a distinguished mediaeval poet of France, was
                    born at Vertus, in Champagne, early in the 14th century. The date of his birth
                    has been approximately given as 1328, 1340, and 1345, according to the
                    interpretation put upon certain vague statements of his own. It is certain that
                    he lived under four kings—Philip VI., John, Charles V., and Charles VI. He
                    studied the seven liberal arts at the university of Orleans. Early in life he
                    proceeded to the court of France, and, after first entering the service of a
                    prelate whose name he has not recorded, for more than thirty years took an
                    active and prominent part in the joyous society of the day. Charged with a
                    succession of honourable offices, he served nearly all the princes his
                    contemporaries. His life was a long and romantic series of tournaments, feasts,
                    and battles, and he was one of the most popular persons of his time. But before
                    settling down to this life, he had a stormy youth of vicissitude. He was an
                    eye-witness of the English invasion in 1358; he was in the siege of Rheims, and
                    witnessed the march on Chartres; he was present also at the signing of the
                    treaty at Bretigny. In 1360, as Châtelain of Vertus, he became the vassal of the
                    young princess Isabella, to whom he paid great poetic homage. But he was then
                    already a travelled man; he had visited Italy, Germany, and Hungary. Later on he
                    took a part in the Flemish wars, and it was on this occasion that, about 1385,
                    he received the surname, or nickname, of Morel, which he sometimes himself
                    adopted in later life. He is believed, but not on very strong evidence, to have
                    travelled in Syria and Egypt, and to have been captured and imprisoned by the
                    Saracens. In France he lived the true life of a <hi rend="italic">trouvère,</hi>
                    wandering from castle to castle with his poems. He had. a violent hatred for the
                    English nation, fostered no doubt by the experiences of his youth; and this he
                    has expressed very abundantly in his writings, particularly in the famous
                    prophecy that England would be destroyed so thoroughly that no one should be
                    able to point to her ruins. He was <hi rend="italic">huissier d'armes</hi> to
                    King Charles V., and by him appointed bailli of Senlis and governor of Fismes.
                    It was with great reluctance that, when he felt himself growing old, he retired
                    from public life and went into a modest seclusion, where he occupied himself in
                    the composition of a splenetic satire against women, entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le Miroir de Mariage;</hi> though 12,500 lines of this exist, he left it
                    unfinished at his death, which took place about 1420. Eustache Deschamps was an
                    accomplished courtier, but he was extremely ugly; he disarms criticism by
                    calling himself “Le Roi de Laidure.” His poems remained unprinted until our day,
                    the great fount of them being a manuscript in the Royal Library at Paris,
                    containing 1175 ballads, 171 rondeaux, 80 virelays, 14 lays, 28 farces, and
                    various epistles and satires. This bulk of MSS. was edited and published in 4to
                    by Μ. G. A.</p>

                <p>Crapelet in 1832, preceded, by a literary and historical monograph. The value of
                    his writings being recognized, another and more critical edition was brought
                    out, in 1849, by Μ. Prosper Tarbé. The same editor published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le Miroir de Mariage</hi> in 1865, and a long poem entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le</hi><hi rend="italic">Lay</hi><hi rend="italic">des douze</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Estats du Monde,</hi> in 1870. Deschamps excelled in the use of
                    the ballad and chanson royal. In each of these forms of verse he was the
                    greatest master of his time. One of his ballads is addressed to the English poet
                    “Geoffroy Chaucier,” to whom he says—</p>
                <p>Tu es d’amours mondains dieux en Albie Et de la Rose en la terre Angélique.</p>
                <p>In Eustache Deschamps the modem language of France first found a pure lyrical
                    expression; his long life seems to connect the literature of Theobald IV. with
                    that of Charles of Orleans.</p>
