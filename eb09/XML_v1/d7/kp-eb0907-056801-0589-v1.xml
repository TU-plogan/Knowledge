                    (1752-1817), an eminent American divine, was born at Northampton, Massachusetts,
                    14th May 1752. His father, though educated at Yale College, was a merchant, and
                    his mother the third daughter of Jonathan Edwards. His mother began to instruct
                    him almost as soon as he was able to speak, and it is said that he learned the
                    alphabet at a single lesson, and before he was four years old was able to read
                    the Bible. In 1765 he entered Yale College, and received his B.A. degree in
                    1769, shortly after which he went to take charge of a grammar school at
                    Newhaven,, where he remained two years. In September 1771 he was appointed tutor
                    in Yale College, where he distinguished himself by the skill with which he
                    taught the higher mathematics. In the same year he began an epic poem entitled
                    the <hi rend="italic">Conquest of Canaan,</hi> which was published in 1785. He
                    received his degree of M.A. in 1772, and afterwards pursued his studies with the
                    view of adopting law as his profession, but, changing his intention, was
                    licensed as a preacher of the gospel in 1777, and accepted the office of
                    chaplain to the forces, which post he held for some time. In 1783 he was
                    ordained minister of Greenfield in Connecticut, when he opened an academy which
                    speedily acquired a very high reputation, and attracted scholars from all parts
                    of the Union. He received the degree of D.D. from Princeton College in 1785, and
                    that of LL.D. from New Jersey in 1810. In 1795 he was elected president of Yale
                    College, and by his judicious management restored that institution to the high
                    place from which it had fallen before his appointment. He died at Philadelphia
                    on the 11th January 1817. Dr Dwight was the author of a considerable number of
                    essays and sermons; and hi3 <hi rend="italic">Theology Explained and Defended in
                    a series of Sermons</hi> was published in 5 vols., with a life of the author, in
