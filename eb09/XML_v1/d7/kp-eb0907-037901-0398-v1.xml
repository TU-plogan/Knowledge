                    (1613-1680), a celebrated Flemish painter, was born at Leyden on the 7th April
                    1613. His first instructor in drawing and design was Bartholomew Dolendo, an
                    engraver; and he afterwards learned the art of glass-painting under Peter
                    Kouwhoorn. At the age of fifteen he became a pupil of Rembrandt, with whom he
                    continued for three years. From the great master of the Flemish school he
                    acquired his skill in colouring, and in the more subtle effects of chiaroscuro;
                    and the style of Rembrandt is reflected in several of his earlier pictures,
                    notably in a portrait of himself at the age of twenty-two, in the Bridgewater
                    Gallery, and in the Blind Tobit going to meet his Son, at Wardour Castle. At a
                    comparatively early point in his career, however, he had formed a manner of his
                    own distinct from, and indeed in some respects antagonistic to, that of his
                    master. Gifted with unusual clearness of vision and precision of manipulation,
                    he cultivated a minute and elaborate style of treatment; and probably few
                    painters ever spent more time and pains on all the details of their pictures
                    down to the most trivial. He is said to have spent five days in painting a hand;
                    and his work was so fine that he found it necessary to manufacture his own
                    brushes. Notwithstanding the minuteness of his touch, however, the general
                    effect was harmonious and free from stiffness, and his colour was always
                    admirably fresh and transparent. He was fond of representing subjects in lantern
                    or candle light, the effects of which he reproduced with a fidelity and skill
                    which no other master has equalled. He frequently painted by the aid of a
                    concave mirror, and to obtain exactness looked at his subject through a frame
                    crossed with squares of silk thread. His practice as a portrait painter, -which
                    was at first considerable, gradually declined, sitters being unwilling to give
                    him the time that he deemed necessary. His pictures were always small in size,
                    and represented chiefly subjects in still life. Upwards of two hundred are
                    attributed to him, and specimens are to be found in most of the great public
                    collections of Europe. His <hi rend="italic">chef d’oeuvre</hi> is generally
                    considered to be the Woman sick of the Dropsy, in the Louvre. The Evening
                    School, in the Amsterdam Gallery, is the best example of the candle-light scenes
                    in which he excelled. In the National Gallery favourable specimens are to be
                    seen in the Poulterer’s Shop and a portrait of himself. Douw’s pictures brought
                    high prices, and it is said that President Van Spiring of the Hague paid him
                    1000 florins a year simply for the right of preemption. Douw died in 1680. His
                    most celebrated pupil was Francis Mieris.</p>
