                <p><label type="entry">OSWEGO</label>, a city and port of entry of the United
                    States, capital of Oswego county, New York, stretches between 2 and 3 miles
                    along the south-east shore of Lake Ontario, on the low bluffs and hilly ground
                    near the mouth of the Oswego river, which divides it into two nearly equal
                    portions, and is spanned by three iron drawbridges. By the Delaware, Lackawanna,
                    and Western Railroad it is 305 miles from New York, and by the New York,
                    Ontario, and Western Railway 326 miles. The Oswego Canal connects at Syracuse
                    with the Erie Canal. The situation of the city is a beautiful and healthful one:
                    most of the streets are 100 feet wide, and there .are two finely-shaded public
                    parks, one on each side of the river. Among the more conspicuous buildings are
                    the conjunct custom-house, postoffice, and United States court-house, erected in
                    1858 at a cost of $120,000, the city-hall, the county court-house, the State
                    armoury, the church of the Evangelists, the large Roman Catholic church in
                    Mohawk Street, the public library (10,000 volumes), the normal and training
                    schools, the city almshouse (2 miles outside the city limits), and the orphan
                    asylum. Falling 34 feet in its passage through the city, Oswego river furnishes
                    a good supply of waterpower, rendered available by a canal on each side. Besides
                    the Oswego starch factory (founded in 1848, and now probably the largest in the
                    world, occupying 10 acres of ground, partly with fireproof buildings seven
                    stories high, and producing 35 tons of starch daily), the manufactories of
                    Oswego comprise flour-mills, large iron-works (making steam-engines,
                    steam-shovels, dredges, &amp;c.), knitting works, shade-cloth factories, railway
                    carriage works and repair shops, box factories, planing-mills, and a large
                    number of subsidiary establishments. In the extent of its trade Oswego is the
                    principal United States port on Lake Ontario, importing vast quantities of grain
                    and timber, and exporting coal, flour, and salt. The annual duties on imports
                    average over $1,000,000. The inner harbour, formed by the river mouth
                    beingenclosed by jettie: has about 3 miles of wharfage, and a depth at low water
                    of from 9 to 13 feet; and the outer harbour, formed by the construction since
                    1871 of a breakwater 5700 feet long, has about 4 miles of wharfage, and a depth
                    of 20 feet. Fort Ontario, rebuilt by the United States Government in 1839,
                    guards the entrance to the harbour; it is a place of some strength. The
                    population of Oswego was 12,205 in 1850, 20,910 in 1870, and 21,112 in 1880.</p>
                <p>Oswego was visited by Champlain in 1615, by the Jesuits Le Mayne in 1654, and by
                    other early explorers. In 1722 the English established a trading post here, and
                    in 1727 Governor William Burnet (son of Bishop Burnet) erected Fort Oswego. A
                    body of about 700 men, left here by Governor Shirley, oonstructed in 1755-56 two
                    other forts—Fort Ontario on the east and Oswego New Fort on the west side of the
                    river. In 1756 the place was bombarded and captured by Montcalm; but between
                    1757 and 1759 new works were constructed by the English, who kept possession
                    till Oswego was transferred to the United States by the Jay treaty in 1796. In
                    1814 Sir James Yeo took the fortress after a bombardment of three hours. The
                    little hamlet of Oswego, commenced by Neil Μ‘Mullen, rapidly increased after the
                    introduction of steam navigation on the lake (1816) and the construction of the
                    Welland and the Oswego Canal (1828). In 1828 it was incorporated as a village,
                    in 1848 as a city.</p>
