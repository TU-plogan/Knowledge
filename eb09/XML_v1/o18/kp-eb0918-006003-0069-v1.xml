                    mouth of the Tiber, from which circumstance it obviously derived its name. Owing
                    to this position it became from an early period the port of Rome, but its
                    foundation as a regular colony of that city is ascribed by ancient authors to
                    Ancus <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit18newyrich/page/n70/mode/1up"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0918-0070-0061"/> Marcius, who is said to have at the same time
                    established there extensive salt works, which long continued to supply Rome and
                    its neighbourhood with that necessary article. As the wealth and importance of
                    Rome itself increased, the prosperity of Ostia naturally rose with it, and it
                    continued throughout the period of the Roman republic to be at once the
                    principal emporium of trade in this part of Italy and the permanent station of
                    the Roman fleet. It was, however, at no period a really good port, and the
                    natural disadvantages of its position were not merely felt the more keenly as
                    its commercial importance increased, but they were continually aggravated by
                    natural causes,—the alluvial matter continually brought down by the Tiber having
                    filled up the port, and at the same time in great measure blocked the mouth of
                    the river, so as to render it inaccessible to the larger class of vessels.
                    Strabo gives a lively picture of the difficulties with which these bad to
                    contend in his time, and which were only surmounted on account of the great
                    pecuniary advantages arising from its proximity to the capital. The necessity of
                    taking some steps to obviate these evils had indeed already presented itself to
                    the dictator Caesar, who had proposed to construct an artificial port at Ostia,
                    with all the appurtenances requisite for so extensive a trade, but no steps were
                    taken towards the execution of this project till the reign of the emperor
                    Claudius, who constructed an entirely new basin or artificial port at a distance
                    of about two miles north of Ostia, and communicating by an artificial channel
                    with the Tiber on one side and the sea on the other. These works were afterwards
                    largely augmented by Trajan, so that the port came to be known as the Portus
                    Trajani, and the channel from thence to the sea was called the Fossa Trajani.
                    This was undoubtedly the same with what is now become the right branch of the
                    Tiber, entering the sea at Fiumicino. From this time the great mass of the trade
                    was transferred to the new port, while that of Ostia continually diminished,
                    though the city itself continued to be a populous and flourishing place
                    throughout the period of the Roman empire. It was not till the close of the
                    western empire that Ostia itself, which was unprotected by walls, and
                    consequently exposed to the attacks of the barbarians, fell into decay; and
                    after it was plundered by the Saracens in the 9th century the site became
                    altogether abandoned, the modern village of Ostia (a very poor place) being
                    situated at a distance of about half a mile from the ruins of the ancient city.
                    The extent and variety of these, as well as the beauty of the works of art
                    discovered on the site, confirm the accounts given by ancient writers of the
                    opulence and prosperity of Ostia in the days of the empire; while those of
                    Porto, as the port of Trajan is still called, are of great interest as
                    exhibiting not only the artificial basin of the port, with its quays and the
                    remains of the surrounding magazines, but a large part of the circuit of walls
                    and towers by which it was protected. Such was the importance of Portus under
                    the Roman empire that it became an episcopal see, and still gives that title to
                    one of the cardinals of Rome.</p>
                <p>The continual advance of the coast-line, owing to the alluvial deposits brought
                    down by the Tiber, has left the ruins of Ostia more than two miles from the sea.
                    Those of Portus are separated from it by an eqtfal interval, and even the tower
                    of Fiumicino, which was built in the last century at the entrance of the right
                    branch of the Tiber— the only one now navigable—is already a considerable
                    distance inland.</p>

                    neighbouring Portus, as well as of the changes in the coast-line and channel of
