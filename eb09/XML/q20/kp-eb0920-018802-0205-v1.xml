                    above the sea. In ancient times it was connected with Cuzco by a paved highway,
                    portions of which still exist; but under Spanish rule it was allowed to relapse
                    almost into the natural isolation of its position. Since 1870, however, <pb

                <p>two carriage roads have been constructed from Quito to Milagro on the Guayaquil
                    river and to the province of Manabi respectively. The railway projected between
                    the city of Guayaquil and Quito has as yet advanced inland only to Chimbo bridge
                    at the foot of the Andes, so that the really difficult part of the enterprise
                    remains untouched; a telegraph line, however, has been opened. The distance
                    between these two leading cities of the republic is 200 miles by road, and the
                    transit of goods takes fourteen days and costs from 10 to 14 dollars per cargo
                    of 250 lb. Though built on the eastern skirts of the magnificent volcano of
                    Pichincha (15,827 feet) and within 5 miles of its crater, Quito is not within
                    sight of the summit, a secondary eminence known to the Incas as Yavird, and now
                    as Panecillo, rising between. The site is an irregular plain traversed by two
                    ravines running down from the mountain, one of which is arched over so as not to
                    interfere with the alignment of the streets. Though the streams flow east at
                    first, they really belong to the system of the Perucho which discharges into the
                    Pacific near Esmeraldas. The houses, mostly of sun-dried brick, are usually low
                    and squat, and not a chimney is to be seen. The public buildings are also of a
                    massive and heavylooking Spanish type. In the principal square are the
                    cathedral, with a fine marble porch, the Government house, with a colonnade
                    running the whole length of the façade, and the palace of the nuncio. But the
                    finest building in Quito is the college of the Jesuits, part of which is
                    occupied by the university, an institution long rendered interesting to
                    Englishmen by the presence of the venerable botanist Dr William Jameson. There
                    is a public library in the city of 20,000 volumes, and a polytechnic school was
                    instituted in 1872. The local manufactures are confined to coarse cotton and
                    woollen stuffs, thread, lace, hosiery, silk, and a certain amount of jewellery.
                    About 1870 the population was estimated by Dr Jameson at between 30,000 and
                    40,000; the <hi rend="italic">Almanach</hi><hi rend="italic">de Gotha</hi> for
                    1885 states it as 80,000.</p>
                <p>Quito (the city of the Quitus, a race akin to the Quichuas of Peru) was
                    peacefully conquered by the Spanish captain Sebastian Benalcazar in 1533. It
                    received the rank of a Spanish city in 1541 from Charles V., and became the
                    capital of the province of Quito in the viceroyalty of New Granada. More than
                    once it has suffered severely from earthquakes: in 1797, for example, 40,000 of
                    its inhabitants were thus destroyed; and in March 22, 1859, property was damaged
                    to the value of $3,000,000.</p>
