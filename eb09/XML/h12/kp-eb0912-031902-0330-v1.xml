                <p><label type="entry">HOVEDON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Roger of</hi></label>, an old
                    English chronicler, was in all probability born at Howden, in the East Riding of
                    Yorkshire, and was possibly a member of a family which had taken its name from
                    the place. The date neither of his birth nor his death is known, and the first
                    notice we have of him is as being sent in 1174 by Henry II., on whom he was in
                    attendance in France, to endeavour to induce the lords of Galloway to withdraw
                    from their allegiance to the king of Scotland. He appears to have been
                    recommended to the notice of Henry from his knowledge of law, and to have
                    occupied a place in his household. It has been conjectured, but without much
                    evidence, that he was a student of Oxford; and the ascription to him of a volume
                    of lectures is also without ground to support it. From the interest manifested
                    in his history regarding the dispute between Archbishop Roger of York and Bishop
                    Hugh of Durham in regard to synodal fees, it has been supposed that he himself
                    held for some time the living of Howden, but this is likewise wholly devoid of
                    direct corroboration. In 1175 he was employed by Henry in the delicate mission
                    of inducing the monastic houses to send deputations to Woodstock for the purpose
                    of choosing their rulers. In 1189, the last year of Henry’s reign, he was
                    appointed a justice itinerant for the forests in Northumberland, Cumberland, and
                    Yorkshire; and it is probable that after Henry’s death he retired to Howden,
                    since from the number of his references to Yorkshire disputes it is evident that
                    he must have been living in that county during the time that he compiled the
                    latter portion of his Chronicle. As the Chronicle closes abruptly in 1201, it is
                    probable that he did not live long beyond that date.</p>
                <p>The work of Roger of Hovedon, which commences with the close of the Chronicle of
                    Bede in 732, is divided by Professor Stubbs into four parts the 1st ending with
                    1148, and consisting chiefly of the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">post B dam,</hi> with a few alterations and additions; the 2d
                    ending with 1169, based principally^ on the <hi rend="italic">Melrose
                        Chronicle,</hi> and from 1163 composed mainly of the A Beckett letters
                    contained in the collection made by John of Salisbury and Alan of Tewkesbury;
                    the 3d ending with 1192, and virtually a condensation of Benedict’s Chronicle,
                    with the occasional addition of unimportant details and several variations, many
                    of which are inaccurate and of such a kind as to show that he wrote from memory;
                    the 4th ending in 1201, and evidently a narrative of contemporary events. The
                    work of Roger of Hovedon was cited in 1291 by Edward I., when claiming the
                    lordship of Scotland, as one of the authorities in regard to the homage done by
                    the earlier kings to his ancestors. The independent value of the work belongs
                    almost wholly to the last portion, although various documents of interest to be
                    found nowhere else are incorporated in the 2d and 3d portions.</p>
                <p>The Chronicle was first printed in 1596 in Sir Henry Saville’s collection of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Scriptore»</hi><hi rend="italic">post Bedam,</hi> and was
                    reprinted at Frankfort in 1601. A translation of it by H. F. Riley, B.A.,
                    appeared in 1852, and forms part of Bohn's Antiquarian Library; and it has been
                    published in 4 vols., 1868-71, in the series of the Master of the Rolls, under
                    the editorship of Professor Stubbs, whose preface contains an elaborate
                    criticism, of the work and a full account, of the various MSS.</p>
