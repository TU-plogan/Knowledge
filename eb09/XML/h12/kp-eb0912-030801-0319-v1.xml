                <p><label type="entry">HOTCH-POT</label> (or <hi rend="smallcaps">Hotch-potch,
                        Hodge-podge),</hi> in law, is the name given to a rule of equity whereby a
                    person, interested along with others in a common fund, and having already
                    received something ih the same interest, is required to surrender what has been
                    so acquired into the common fund, on pain of being excluded from the
                    distribution. The following is an old example given in Coke on Littleton: —“If a
                    man seized of 30 acres of land in fee hath issue only two daughters, and he
                    gives with one of them 10 acres in marriage to the man that marries her, and
                    dies seized of the other 20; now she that is thus married, to gain her share of
                    the rest of the land, must put her part given in marriage into hotch-pot; <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> she must refuse to take the profits thereof, and
                    cause her land to be so mingled with the other that an equal division of the
                    whole may be made between her and her sister, as if none had been given to her;
                    and thus for her 10 acres she shall have 15, or otherwise the sister will have
                    the 20.” In the common law this seems to have been the only instance in which
                    the rule was applied, and the reason assigned for it is that, inasmuch as
                    daughters succeeding to lands take together as coparceners and not by
                    primogeniture, the policy of the law is that the land in such cases should be
                    equally divided. The law of hotchpot applies only to lands descending in
                    fee-simple. The same principle is noticed by Blackstone as applying in the
                    customs of York and London to personal property, It is also expressly enacted in
                    the Statute of Distributions (§ 5) that no child of the intestate, except his
                    heir-at-law, who shall have any estate in land by the settlement of the
                    intestate, or who shall be advanced by the intestate in his life time by
                    pecuniary portion equal to the distributive shares of the other children, shall
                    participate with them in the surplus; but if the estate so given to such child
                    by way of advancement be not equivalent to their shares, then such part of the
                    surplus as will make it equal shall be allotted to him. It has been decided that
                    this provision applies only to advancements by <hi rend="italic">fathers,</hi>
                    on the ground that the rule was founded on the custom of London, which never
                    affected a widow’s personal estate. The heir-at-law is not required to bring any
                    land which he has by descent or otherwise from the deceased into hotch-pot, but
                    advancements made to him out of ehe personal property must be brought in. The
                    same principle is to be found in the <hi rend="italic">collatio bonorum</hi> of
                    the Roman law: emancipated children, in order to share the inheritance of their
                    father with the children unemancipated, were required to bring their property
                    into the common fund. It is also found in the law of Scotland. “It seemeth,”
                    says Littleton, “that this word <hi rend="italic">hotch-pot</hi> is in English a
                    pudding; for in a pudding is not commonly put one thing alone, but one thing
                    with other things together.”</p>
