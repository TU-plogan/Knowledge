                    (1805-1878), an eminent Chinese and Japanese scholar, was born at Würzburg on
                    the 16th of February 1805. After studying in the philosophical department of the
                    Würzburg university, the young man took to the stage in 1825; and it was only by
                    an accidental meeting with the German traveller, Dr Siebold, in July 1830, that
                    his interest was diverted to Oriental philology. From Siebold himself he
                    acquired the rudiments of Japanese; and in order to take advantage of the
                    instructions of Ko-ching-chang, a Chinese teacher whom Siebold had brought home
                    with him, he made himself acquainted with Malay, the only language except
                    Chinese which the Chinaman could understand. Such rapid advance did Hoffmann
                    make that in a few years he was able to supply the translations for Siebold’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Nippon;</hi> and the high character of his work soon
                    attracted the attention of older scholars. Stanislas Julien invited him to
                    Paris; and he would probably have accepted the invitation, as a disagreement had
                    broken out between him and Siebold, had not M. Baud, the Dutch colonial
                    minister, appointed him Japanese translator with a salary of 1800 florins or
                    &lt;£150. The Dutch authorities were slow in giving him further recognition; and
                    he was too modest a man successfully to urge his claims. It was not till after
                    he had received the offer of the professorship of Chinese in King’s College,
                    London, that the authorities made him professor at Leyden, and the king allowed
                    him a yearly pension. In 1875 he was decorated with the order of the Netherlands
                    Lion, and in 1877 he was elected corresponding member of the Berlin Academy. But
                    these honours came almost too late; for a disease of the lungs from which he had
                    long suffered terminated fatally on the 19th of January 1878.</p>
                <p>Hoffmann’s chief work is his Japanese Dictionary. Though begun in 1839 it is
                    still unfinished, for the difficulties against which he had to contend were
                    immense. Unable at first to procure the necessary type, he set himself to the
                    cutting of punches; and even when the proper founts were obtained he had to act
                    as his own compositor as far as Chinese and Japanese were concerned. His
                    Japanese grammar is a standard work; it was published in Dutch and English in
                    1867, and in English and German in 1876. Of his miscellaneous productions it is
                    enough to mention “Japan’s Bezüge mit der Komischen Halbinsel und mit Schina” in
