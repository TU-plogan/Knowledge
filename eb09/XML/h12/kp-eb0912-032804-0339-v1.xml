                        rend="smallcaps">Régis</hi> (1813-1860), a celebrated French
                    missionary-traveller, was born at Toulouse, 1st August 1813. In his
                    twenty-fourth year he entered the congregation of the Lazarists at Paris, and
                    shortly after receiving holy orders in 1839 set forth fired by missionary zeal
                    for China. At Macao he spent some eighteen months in the Lazarist seminary
                    preparing himself under the instruction of Perboyre for the regular work of a
                    missionary in the interior. Having at last acquired a sufficient command of the
                    Chinese tongue, and modified his personal appearance in accordance with Chinese
                    taste, he started from Canton clad in the flowing costume of the natives, with
                    his skin dyed yellow, and wearing the inevitable queue. He at first
                    superintended a Christian mission in the southern provinces, and then passing to
                    Peking, where he perfected his knowledge of the language, eventually settled in
                    the Valley of Black Waters or He Shuy, a little to the north of the capital, and
                    just within the borders of Mongolia. There, beyond the Great Wall, a large but
                    scattered population of native Christians had found a refuge from the
                    persecutions of Kia-King, to be united half a century later in a vast but vague
                    apostolic vicariate. The assiduity with which Hue devoted himself to the study
                    of the dialects and customs of the Tartars, for whom at the cost of much labour
                    he translated various religious works, was an admirable preparation for
                    undertaking in 1844, at the instigation of the vicar apostolic of Mongolia, an
                    expedition whose object was to dissipate the obscurity which hung over the
                    country and habits of the Tibetans. September of that year found the missionary
                    at Tolon-noor occupied with the final arrangements for his journey, and shortly
                    afterwards, accompanied by his fellow-Lazarist, Joseph Gabet, and a young
                    Tibetan priest who had embraced Christianity, he set out. To escape attention
                    the little party assumed the dress of lamas or priests. Crossing the Hoang-ho at
                    Shagan-Kooren, they advanced into the terrible sandy tract known as the <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0340-0329"/> Bteppes of the Ortoos. After suffering
                    dreadfully from want of water and fuel they entered Kansu, having recrossed the
                    flooded Hoang-ho, but it was not till January 1845 that they reached Tang-Kiuul
                    on the boundary. Rather than encounter alone the horrors of a four months’
                    journey to Lhassa they resolved to wait for eight months till the arrival of a
                    Tibetan embassy on its return from Peking. Under an intelligent teacher they
                    meanwhile studied the Tibetan language and Buddhist literature, and during three
                    months of their stay they resided in the famous Kounboum Lamasery, which was
                    reported to accommodate 4000 persons. Towards the end of September they joined
                    the returning embassy, which comprised 2000 men and 3700 animals. Crossing the
                    deserts of Koko-nur, they passed the great lake of that name, with its island of
                    contemplative lamas, and, ascending with difficulty and hardship the tortuous
                    snow-covered mountains of Chuga and Baylen-Bharat, they at last entered Lhassa
                    on the 29th January 1846. Favourably received by the regent, they opened a
                    little chapel, and were in a fair way to establish an important mission, when
                    the Chinese ambassador interfered and had the two missionaries conveyed back to
                    Canton, where they arrived in October of the same year. For nearly three years
                    Hue remained at Canton, but Μ. Gabet, returning to Europe, proceeded thence, to
                    Rio de Janeiro, and died there shortly afterwards. Hue returned to Europe in
                    shattered health in 1852, visiting India, Egypt, and Palestine on his way, and,
                    after a prolonged residence in Paris, died 31st March 1860. His writings
                    comprise, besides numerous letters and memoirs in the <hi rend="italic"

                    which has secured for them an unusual degree of popularity. The narrative of one
                    of the most remarkable feats of modern travel, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Souvenirs</hi> contain passages of so singular a character as in the
                    absence of corroborative testimony to stir up a feeling of incredulity. That Hue
                    was suspected unjustly has been amply proved by the later research of Bushnell,
                    David, Prejevalski, Richthofen, and Colonel Montgomerie’s “Pundits.” But
                    although his credibility has been firmly established, and although in his heroic
                    enterprise he gathered a vast amount of novel and curious information, the fact
                    remains that Hue was by no means a practical geographer, and that the record of
                    his travels loses greatly in value from the want of precise scientific data.</p>
