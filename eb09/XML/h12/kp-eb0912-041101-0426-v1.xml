                    (1616-1664), a Puritan soldier, son of Sir Thomas Hutchinson, was born at
                    Nottingham in September 1616. After completing his education at Cambridge
                    University he entered Lincoln’s Inn, but soon became tired both of the study of
                    law and the amusements of London, and was meditating travel on the Continent
                    when he accidentally made the acquaintance of Lucy, daughter of Sir Allan
                    Apsley, whom he married in 1638. After his marriage he returned to Owthorpe,
                    where the study of divinity and politics gradually led to a change of his
                    sentiments in regard to the dispute between the parliament and the king At first
                    he did not find a clear call to join the Parliamentary army, but the efforts of
                    the Royalists to seize him as a disaffected person soon dissipated his
                    neutrality, and, becoming governor of Nottingham, he with great firmness and
                    courage held the town and castle against internal treachery and external attacks
                    till the triumph of the parliamentary cause. Having bet n chosen to represent
                    Nottingham in the new parliament, he became a member of the high court of
                    justice for the trial of the king, and gave his vote for his execution, but,
                    disapproving of the subsequent political conduct of Cromwell, he took no further
                    part in politics during the lifetime of the Protector. After the Restoration he
                    became member for the county of Nottingham, and he was included in the Act of
                    Amnesty passed in favour of certain of the regicides. Subsequently, however, he
                    was arrested upon suspicion of being concerned in a treasonable conspiracy; and
                    after an imprisonment of ten months in the Tower of London, and of one month in
                    Sandown Castle, Kent, he died 11th September 1664. The life of Colonel
                    Hutchinson is now only of interest from the manner in which it is narrated in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> written by his wife, and first published in
                    1806, a w ork not only valuable for the picture which it gives of the time in
                    which he lived, but for the simple beauty of its style, and the naïveté with
                    Which the writer records her sentiments and opinions, and details the incidents
                    of her private life.</p>
