                <p><label type="entry">HYAeNA</label><hi rend="italic">(flyoenidoe),</hi> a family

                    pouch beneath the anus, and therefore usually classed as a transition group
                    between these two families. It comprises a single genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Hyoenf),</hi> and three species, which resemble each other and differ from
                    all other carnivores in having both pairs of feet with four toes each. They are
                    further characterized by the greater length of their fore legs as compared with
                    those behind, by their well-developed although non-retractile claws, by their
                    prickly cat-like tongue, and by the enormous strength of their jaws and teeth,
                    which enables them to break open the hardest bones, and to retain what they have
                    seized with the most unrelaxing grip.</p>

                    India, Persia, Asia Minor, and the northern half of Africa, while, if the strand

                    variety of this species, as many naturalists suppose, its range will be thereby
                    extended to the southern extremity of the African continent. It resembles a wolf
                    in size, and is of a greyish-brown colour, marked with indistinct longitudinal
                    stripes of a darker hue, while the legs are transversely striped as in the
                    zebra. The hairs on its body are long, especially on the ridge of the neck and
                    back, where they form a distinct mane, which is continued along the tail. The
                    hyaena is nocturnal in its habits, preferring by day the gloom of caves and
                    ruins, or of the burrows which it occasionally forms, but coming forth at sunset
                    to make night hideous with its unearthly howling, which, when the <pb break="no"

                    compared to demoniac laughter, and hence the name of “laughing hyaena,” by which
                    it is also known. The food of those creatures consists chiefly of carrion, and
                    they thus perform a highly useful service in hot countries by devouring the
                    remains of dead animals which might otherwise pollute the air. So ravenous,
                    however, are they that even the bodies of the buried dead are not safe from
                    their attacks, their powerful claws enabling them to gain access to the newly
                    interred bodies in the Eastern cemeteries, which they are said habitually to
                    frequent. They also feed on the flesh of animals, which they hunt in packs. When
                    driven by hunger they have thus been frequently known to enter villages by night
                    and to carry off such domestic animals as they might chance to find. Bruce, the
                    African traveller, states that everywhere in Abyssinia they were a plague.
                    “Gondar,” he says, “was dull of them from the time it turned dark till the dawn.
                    In short, the hyaena was the plague of our lives, the terror of our night walks,
                    the destruction of our mules and asses, which above all others are his favourite
                    food.” Although, in proportion to its size, possessing probably the most
                    powerful teeth and jaws in the whole mammalian series, the pusillanimity of the
                    hyaena is such as to prevent its attacking animals greatly inferior to itself in
                    strength. The</p>
                <p>Arab, for this reason, holds it in contempt; and, when be condescends to hunt the
                    hyaena, he does not waste his ammunition upon it, but runs it down with dogs. It
                    has usually been regarded as untameable; this, however, is not the case, for
                    when properly treιted in captivity, it has been known to exhibit the greatest
                    docility and attachment to its keepers; and Colonel Sykes states that in certain
                    districts of Central India where those creatures abound they are as susceptible
                    of domestication as ordinary dogs.</p>
                <p>The Spotted Hyaena <hi rend="italic">{Hyaena</hi><hi rend="italic">crocata)</hi>
                    takes the place of the striped species in the southern half of the African
                    continent, to which it is confined. It resembles the other in size, but differs
                    from it considerably in appearance, the stripes of the one being replaced by
                    dark brown spots on a yellowish ground in the other, while in the “tiger-wolf,”
                    as this species is called at the Cape, the mane is much less distinct. According
                    to Schweinfurth, who met with it in the heart of Africa, it is a much more
                    powerful and savage animal than the northern form. Although averse to hunting
                    living prey, it takes to the chase when carrion is not to be had, and the same
                    traveller was on one occasion startled by a spotted hyaena which darted past
                    him, like lightning, in pursuit of an antelope. At the Cape it was formerly very
                    common, and occasionally committed great havoc among the cattle, while it did
                    not hesitate to enter the Kaffre dwellings at night and carry off the child
                    sleeping by its mother’s side. By persistent trapping and shooting, its numbers
                    have now been considerably reduced, with the result, however, of making it, like
                    the hippopotamus of the same regions, exceedingly wary, so that it is not
                    readily caught in any trap with which it has had an opportunity of becoming
                    acquainted. Like the northern species, the spotted hyaena has been tamed, and
                    has occasionally been trained to take the place of the dog. Its skin exhibits a
                    considerable variety of colour and marking, and Schweinfurth found many skins in
                    use among the Niam-niams of Central Africa, in the form of aprons. The brown
                    hyaena <hi rend="italic">{Hyaena</hi><hi rend="italic">rufa)</hi> is also a
                    native of South Africa.</p>
                <p>Although hyaenas are now confined to the warmer regions of the Old World, their
                    fossil remains show that they had a much more northerly range during Tertiary
                    times. Abundant remains of a larger species than any now living have been found
                    in the caves of England, France, and Germany. This species, known as the cave
                    hyaena <hi rend="italic">{Hyaena spelaed),</hi> is supposed to have been most
                    nearly allied to the spotted hyaena of South Africa, but does not appear to have
                    extended farther south than the middle of Europe. Remains which have been
                    doubtfully identified as belonging to the striped species have also been found
                    in the south of France, and others in Sicily and Algeria, undoubtedly belonging
                    to the spotted form of South Africa, which must thus have had a much more
                    northerly extension in Tertiary times. No remains of the hyaena are known to
                    occur in the New World.</p>
