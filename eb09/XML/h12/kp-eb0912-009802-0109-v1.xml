                    (1788-1873), physician and author, was born at Knutsford, Cheshire, on the 27th
                    October 1788. He could claim relationship to three persons who have attained
                    eminence in careers entirely different both from one another and from his own:
                    his maternal grandmother was the sister of Josiah Wedgwood, whose grandson was
                    Charles Darwin; and his paternal aunt was the mother of Mrs Gaskell. After
                    spending some years at a private school at Knutsford, he was sent to a school at
                    Newcastle-on-Tyne, whence after four years he was transferred to Dr Estlin’s
                    school near Bristol. There he at once took the position of head boy, in
                    succession to John Cam Hobhouse, afterwards Lord Broughton, an honour which
                    required to be maintained by physical prowess. On leaving <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit12newyrich/page/n110/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0912-0110-0099"/> school he became articled clerk to a
                    mercantile firm in Liverpool, but, as the privilege was reserved to him of
                    passing two sessions at Glasgow university, he at the close of his second
                    session sought relief from his articles, and in 1806 began the study of medicine
                    in the university of Edinburgh, where he graduated in 1811. After several years
                    spent in foreign travel, he began practice in 1816 as a physician in
                    London,—according to his own statement, “with a fair augury of success speedily
                    and completely fulfilled.” This “success,” he adds, “was materially aided by
                    visits for four successive years to Spa, at the close of that which is called
                    the London season.” It must also, however, be in a great degree attributed to
                    his happy temperament and his gifts as a conversationalist—qualities the
                    influence of which, in the majority of cases belonging to his class of practice,
                    is often of more importance than direct medical treatment. In 1816 he was
                    elected a fellow of the Royal Society, and in 1828 a fellow of the Royal College
                    of Physicians. He became physician in ordinary to Prince Albert in 1840, and was
                    appointed in 1852 physician in ordinary to the Queen. In April 1853 he was
                    created a baronet. He was also a D.C.L. of Oxford and a member of the principal
                    learned societies of Europe. He was twice married, his second wife being a
                    daughter of Sydney Smith, a lady of considerable literary talent, who published
                    a biography of her father. Sir Henry Holland at an early period of his practice
                    resolved to devote to his professional duties no more of his time than was
                    necessary to secure an income of £5000 a-year, and also to spend two months of
                    every year solely in foreign travel. By the former resolution he secured leisure
                    for a wide acquaintance with general literature, and for a more than superficial
                    cultivation of several branches of science; and the latter enabled him, besides
                    visiting, “and most of them repeatedly, every country of Europe,” to make
                    extensive tours in the other three continents, journeying often to places little
                    frequented by European travellers. As, moreover, he procured an introduction to
                    nearly all the eminent personages in his line of travel, and knew many of them
                    in his capacity of physician, his acquaintance with “men and cities” was of a
                    species without a parallel. The <hi rend="italic">London Medical Record,</hi> in
                    noticing his death, which took place on his eighty-fifth birthday, October 27,
                    1873, remarked that it “had occurred under circumstances highly characteristic
                    of his remarkable career.” On his return from a journey in Russia he was
                    present, on Friday, October 24th, at the trial of Marshal Bazaine in Paris,
                    dining with some of the judges in the evening. He reached London on the
                    Saturday, took ill the following day, and died quietly on the Monday
                    afternoon.</p>
