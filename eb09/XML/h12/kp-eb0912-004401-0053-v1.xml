                <p><label type="entry">HOFER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Andreas</hi></label> (1767-1810),
                    a Tyrolese patriot, was born October 2,1767, at St Leonhard, in the Passeyr
                    valley. There his father kept a tavern called the Sandhof, which Hofer
                    inherited, and on that account he was popularly known as the “Sandwirth.” In
                    addition to this he carried on a trade in wine and horses with the north of
                    Italy, acquiring a high reputation for intelligence and honesty. On the outbreak
                    of the war in 1796, he commanded a company of riflemen against the French at
                    Lake Garda, and after the peace of Lunéville he took an active part in
                    organizing the Tyrolese militia. After the treaty of Presburg (1805), by which
                    Tyrol was transferred from Austria to Bavaria, Hofer was chosen a member of the
                    secret Tyrolese deputation which went to Vienna to confer with the emperor on
                    the condition of their country; and when, on the advice of Austria, the whole of
                    Tyrol in April 1809 rose in arms, Hofer was chosen to the command of a large
                    division of the insurgents, and inflicted an overwhelming defeat on the
                    Bavarians at Sterzing. Reinforcements sent by Napoleon defeated the Austrians at
                    Woergl and the Tyrolese at Feuersinger, but Hofer coming to the rescue of his
                    country repulsed the Bavarians with great loss at Innsbruck. Notwithstanding
                    also that Austria after Napoleon’s victory at Wagram agreed to evacuate Tyrol,
                    Hofer resolved to maintain the struggle, and on the 13th August, at Berg Isel,
                    routed with great slaughter a combined French and Bavarian force, and completely
                    freed his country from foreign dominion. For some time the internal affairs of
                    Tyrol were administered by an independent Government of which Hofer was the
                    head, but after the peace of Vienna the Bavarians again endeavoured to assert
                    their supremacy, and after a heroic resistance Hofer was compelled to flee for
                    safety to the mountains. A price was set upon his head, and on account of the
                    treachery of one of his most trusted followers, he was captured, January 27,
                    1810, in a chalet in the Passeyr valley. He was sent to Mantua for trial, and on
                    the 20th February, by the orders of Napoleon, was executed twenty-four hours
                    after his condemnation. In 1823 his remains were removed from the place of
                    sepulture at Mantua to Innsbruck, where they were interred in the Franciscan
                    church, and in 1834 a marble statue was erected over his tomb. In 1819 the
                    patent of nobility decreed for him by Austria in 1809 was conferred upon his
                    family by the title· of Von Passeyr.</p>
