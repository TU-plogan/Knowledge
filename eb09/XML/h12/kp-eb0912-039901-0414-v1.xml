                        of</hi></label> (1707-1791), leader of a sect of Calvinistic methodists,
                    known as the Countess of Huntingdon’s Connexion, was the daughter of Washington
                    Shirley, second Earl Ferrers. She was born at Stanton Harold, a mansion near
                    Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire, August 24, 1707, and in her twenty-first
                    year was married to Theophilus, ninth earl of Huntingdon. The religious
                    influence of her husband’s sisters, and a dangerous illness soon after her
                    marriage, tended to deepen the serious impressions which the young countess had
                    experienced from childhood; and on the death of her husband in 1746, coming
                    under the influence of the religious revival in which Wesley and Whitfield were
                    at that time conspicuous, she resolved to join these preachers in actively
                    furthering their aims. In 1748 she gave Whitfield a scarf as her chaplain, and
                    in that capacity he frequently preached in her town house to the most
                    fashionable audiences, in which sometimes such men as Chesterfield, Walpole, and
                    Bolingbroke were found. Reducing her personal expenditure, and disregarding the
                    sneers of her aristocratic acquaintances, Lady Huntingdon spent her ample means
                    in building chapels in different parts of England, and appointed ministers to
                    officiate in them, under the impression that as a peeress she had a right to
                    employ as many chaplains as she would. In 1768 she converted the old mansion of
                    Trevecca, near Talgarth, in South Wales, into a theological seminary for
                    training young ministers for the Connexion; and this, which she made her chief
                    residence, she continued to support alone till her death. Up to 1779 Lady
                    Huntingdon and her chaplains continued members of the Church of England, but in
                    that year the prohibition of her chaplains by the consistorial court from
                    preaching in the Pantheon, a large building in London rented for the purpose by
                    the countess, compelled her in order to evade the injunction to take shelter
                    under the Toleration Act. This reluctant step, which placed her legally among
                    dissenters, had the effect of severing from the. Connexion several eminent and
                    useful members. Till her death in London, June 17, 1791, Lady Huntingdon
                    continued to exercise an active, and even autocratic, superintendence over her
                    chapels and chaplains, and maintained her leading position as well by her
                    genuine earnest piety and force of character as by her high social station and
                    generous liberality. Her chapels and college were bequeathed to trustees; and in
                    1792 the latter was removed to Cheshunt, in Hertfordshire, where it has since
                    flourished. Several congregations of the Connexion have become nominally as well
                    as virtually Congregational chapels; while, even by those which retain the
                    original name, the Congregational polity is practically adopted.</p>
