                    1495-1555), bishop and martyr, was a native of Somersetshire, and was born about
                    1495. He was educated at Merton College, Oxford, and after taking his degree of
                    bachelor of arts in 1518 joined the order of Cistercian monks at Gloucester.
                    Subsequently, “ -while living too much of a court life in the palace of the
                    king,” his attention was directed to the writings of Zwingli, and the result of
                    his perusing them was that after a diligent study of the Scriptures he became a
                    zealous advocate of the principles of the Reformation. For a short time he was
                    chaplain to Sir Thomas Arundel, but, being warned of the danger to which his
                    opinions exposed him, he in 1539 made his escape to France. Returning to England
                    shortly afterwards, he found that plots were again being laid for his life, and
                    escaped to Ireland disguised as a sailor. From Ireland he again went to France,
                    passing thence to Germany, where he married, probably in 1546. After his
                    marriage he settled in Zurich till March 1549, when he set out for England.
                    Immediately on arriving in London he began to apply himself to the work of
                    instructing the masses, and so successful were his labours that the churches in
                    which he lectured were crowded by eager audiences, and that the king specially
                    requested him to remain in London to further the progress of the Reformation. In
                    1550 he was presented to the bishopric of Gloucester; but, refusing it on
                    account of objections to the oath and vestments, he was summoned before the
                    council, and ultimately was imprisoned for some time in the Fleet, till he
                    intimated that his scruples had been removed. The duties of his episcopate he
                    discharged with a diligence, zeal, and self-sacrifice that have been rarely
                    equalled. He preached three or four times a day in the towns and villages of his
                    diocese, and so regardless was he of fatigue that his wife wrote Bullinger to
                    “recommend Master Hooper to be more moderate in his labour,” lest his
                    “overabundant exertions should cause a premature decay;” he made minute inquiry
                    into the knowledge, doctrine, conduct, and worldly condition of his clergy,
                    whose impoverished livings he petitioned the council to be allowed to augment
                    out of his own income; and he supplied a free dinner in his hall to the poor of
                    the city daily, sitting down and sharing it with them. In 1552 he was created
                    bishop of Worcester <hi rend="italic">in comrnendαrn.</hi> On the accession of

                    February 9th, the martyr enduring the agonies of the stake, which on account of
                    the accidental use of green wood were unusually protracted, with great
                    fortitude. Hooper’s opinions were more decidedly auti-Romish than those of
                    Cranmer or Ridley, and very nearly identical with those afterwards promulgated
                    by the Puritans. He was the author of various sermons and controversial
