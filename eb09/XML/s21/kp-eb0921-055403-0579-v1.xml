                            Samuel Johnson was touched by Queen Anne in 1712, and the same
                            prerogative of royalty was exercised by Prince Charles Edward in
                            1745.</p></note>), a constitutional morbid condition generally
                    exhibiting itself in early life, and characterized mainly by defective nutrition
                    of the tissues and by a tendency to inflammatory affections of a low type with
                    degenerative changes in their products. The subject has been considered in most
                    of its features under <hi rend="smallcaps">Pathology</hi> (vol. xviii. p. 405),
                    and only a further brief reference is here necessary. Scrofula may be either
                    inherited or acquired. Heredity is of all causes the most potent, and naturally
                    operates with greater certainty where both parents possess the taint. As in all
                    hereditary diseases, however, the liability may be scarcely perceptible for one
                    or two generations, but may then reappear. Other causes referable to parentage
                    may readily produce this constitutional state in children, as weakness or ill
                    health in one or both parents, and, as seems probable, marriages of
                    consanguinity. But, apart altogether from hereditary or congenital influences,
                    the scrofulous habit is frequently developed, especially in the young, by such
                    unfavourable hygienic conditions as result from overcrowded, cold, and dark
                    dwellings, insufficient and improper food, exposure, and debauchery. Even among
                    the old in such circumstances the evidences of scrofula may be seen to present
                    themselves where before they had been absent.</p>
                <p>There are two well-marked types of the scrofulous constitution to be often
                    observed, especially among the young. In the one the chief features are a fair
                    complexion with delicate thin skin, blue eyes, dilated pupils, long eyelashes,
                    soft muscles, and activity of the circulatory and nervous system; while in the
                    other the skin is dark, the features heavy, the figure stunted, and all the
                    functions, physical and mental, inactive. In many instances, however, it will be
                    found that both types are more or less mixed together in one individual. The
                    manifestations of scrofula generally appear in early life, and are often
                    exhibited in young children during the first dentition by inflammatory skin
                    eruptions of obstinate character on the face and other parts; later on in youth
                    there appear glandular swellings either externally, as on the neck, or affecting
                    the gland structures of the chest or abdomen, while at the same time mucous
                    membranes and bones may become implicated. The distinctive features of the
                    scrofulous inflammatory affections are their tendency to chronicity and to
                    suppurative and degenerative changes, the affected parts either healing slowly
                    with resulting disfigurement, as on the neck, or continuing to retain traces of
                    the products of the diseased action, which may set up serious disturbance of the
                    health at some future time. Further, the scrofulous constitution always
                    influences the duration and progress of any disease from which the individual
                    may suffer, as well as its results. Thus in pneumonia, to which the scrofulous
                    would seem to be specially liable, the products of the inflammation are not
                    readily absorbed as in previously healthy persons, but, remaining in the
                    lung-tissues, are apt to undergo caseous degenerative changes, which may issue
                    in phthisis (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Pneumonia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Phthisis).</hi> The connexion of scrofula with tubercle is pointed out in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Pathology</hi><hi rend="italic">(loc.
                        cit.).</hi></p>
                <p>Scrofula may under favourable circumstances tend to improvement as age advances,
                    and it occasionally happens that persons who in early life showed unmistakable
                    evidences of this condition appear ultimately to outgrow it, and become in all
                    respects healthy and vigorous. The treatment is essentially similar to that
                    described for rickets or phthisis, and is partly preventive and partly curative.
                    It consists mainly in hygienic measures to promote the health and nutrition of
                    the young, and of suitable diet, tonics, &amp;c., where evidences of the disease
                    have declared themselves. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rickets, Phthisis.</hi></p>
