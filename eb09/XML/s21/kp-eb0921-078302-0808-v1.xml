                    (1770-1850), portraitpainter, and president of the Royal Academy, was born in
                    Dublin on the 23d of December 1770. He was sprung from an old Irish family, and
                    his father, while he exercised the trade of a merchant, regarded the profession
                    of a painter as in no sense a fit occupation for a descendant of the Shees.
                    Young Shee became, nevertheless, a student of art in the Dublin Society, and
                    came early to London, where he was, in 1788, introduced by Burke to Reynolds, by
                    whose advice he studied in the schools of the Royal Academy. In 1789 he
                    exhibited his first two pictures, the Head of an Old Man and Portrait of a
                    Gentleman. During the next ten years he steadily increased in practice, and
                    gradually gained ground among the aristocracy, with whom his suavity and good
                    manners were great recommendations. He was chosen an associate of the Royal
                    Academy in 1798, shortly after the illustrious Flaxman, and in 1800 he was made
                    a Royal Academician. In the former year he had married, removed to Romney’s
                    house in Cavendish Square, and set up as the legitimate successor of that
                    artist. Shee continued to paint with great readiness of hand and fertility of
                    invention, although his portraits were eclipsed by more than one of his
                    contemporaries, and especially by Lawrence, Hoppner, Phillips, Jackson, and
                    Raeburn. In addition to his portraits he executed various subjects and
                    historical works, such as Lavinia, Belisarius, his diploma picture Prospero and
                    Miranda, and the Daughter of Jephthah. In 1805 he published a poem consisting of
                        <hi rend="italic">Rhymes on Art,</hi> and it was succeeded by a second part
                    in 1809. Although Byron spoke well of it in his <hi rend="italic">English Bards
                        and Scotch Reviewers,</hi> and invoked a place for “Shee and genius” in the
                    temple of fame, yet, as nature had not originally conjoined these two, it is to
                    be feared that even a poet’s invocation could not materially affect their
                    relations. Shee published another small volume of verses in 1814, entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">The Commemoration of Sir Joshua Reynolds, and other
                        Poems,</hi> but this effort did not greatly increase his fame. He now
                    produced a tragedy called <hi rend="italic">Alasco,</hi> of which the scene was
                    laid in Poland. The play was accepted at Covent Garden,<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit21newyrich/page/n809/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0809-0784"/> and in the fertile fancy of the poet the play
                    had already gained for him a great dramatic fame, when Colman, the licenser,
                    refused it his sanction, on the plea of its containing certain treasonable
                    allusions, and Shee, in great wrath, resolved to make his appeal to the public.
                    This violent threat he carried out in 1824, but unfortunately the public found
                    other business to mind, and <hi rend="italic">Alasco</hi> is still on the list
                    of unacted dramas. On the death of Lawrence in 1830, Shee was chosen president
                    of the Royal Academy, and shortly afterwards he received the honour of
                    knighthood. He was excellently qualified by his gentlemanly manners, business
                    habits, and fluent speech for the position; and in the dispute regarding the use
                    of rooms to be provided by Government, and in his examination before the
                    parliamentary committee of 1836, he ably defended the rights of the Academy. He
                    continued to paint till 1845, and died on the 13th of August 1850 in his
                    eightieth year.</p>
                <p>The earlier portraits of the artist are carefully finished, easy in action, with
                    good drawing and excellent discrimination of character. They show an undue
                    tendency to redness in the flesh painting,—a defect which is still more apparent
                    in his later works, in which the handling is less “square,” crisp, and
                    forcible.</p>
