                    frequently called “the Queen of Watering Places,” situated on the east coast of
                    Yorkshire, in the North Riding, 40 miles from York, and between 54° 15' 0" and
                    54° 17' 15" N. lat. and 0° 22' 25'' and 0° 26' 24'' W. long. Its two parts,
                    north and south, each with a fine stretch of sand and bay, are divided by a
                    rocky promontory 300 feet above the sea, on which stand the remains of the
                    castle. The cliff is much exposed to denudation by the sea, which has been
                    proceeding during the present century at the rate of 1 yard in 17 years. The
                    plateau forming the castle yard in 1190, according to William of Newburgh,

                    10 perches, or 43 acres, including store yards, dykes, and holms. The first
                    castle was built in the Anglo-Norman period, and is referred to as being in
                    decay in 1154—a fact which throws back its origin earlier than 1136, the date
                    assigned for its erection by William Le Gros, earl of Albemarle and Holderness,
                    its first known governor. The list of its governors stretches from that date to
                    1832. The streets of the older part of the town, immediately south of the castle
                    hill, come down to the sea, but the newer parts of the south as well as the
                    north side are built upon rising ground. A deep valley (Ramsdale) which divides
                    the south side is bridged from St Nicholas Cliff to the South Cliff. The
                    approach by rail is through the upper part of this valley, by the side of which
                    there is a marsh known as the Mere. The town is thus situated in a kind of
                    basin, which opens out to the north towards extensive and lofty moorland ranges.
                    The modern period of its history dates from 1620, when Mrs Farren, a lady
                    resident, first discovered its mineral springs. The town contained 30,504
                    inhabitants in 1881, but during the season, which lasts from May to October, its
                    population is augmented by from ten to twenty thousand visitors, for whose
                    convenience there is increasingly ample accommodation. The Grand Hotel, fronting
                    the sea on the south bay, stands on St Nicholas Cliff, at the north side of the
                    Ramsdale valley, and is one of the largest in England. An aquarium (1877) stands
                    beneath the Cliff Bridge, and close by is the museum, a Roman-Doric rotunda,
                    built in 1828. The spa saloon, opened in 1800, contains a hall in the
                    Italian-Renaissance style, a theatre, and refreshment rooms. There is a
                    promenade in front protected by a sea wall. The south spring is aperient but
                    contains some iron, while the north or chalybeate spring is more tonic in its
                    properties. The waters, however, are seldom taken now, the town being mainly
                    frequented for the sea-bathing. The grounds of the present spa are tastefully
                    laid out. A foreshore road, made in 1878 by the corporation, and shortly to be
                    extended round the castle cliff to the north side, makes an excellent drive or
                    promenade. The north side has fine sands, a hoist, and a promenade pier, but is
                    not so attractive as the south side, nor are the houses there of so good a
                    character and style. The salubrity of Scarborough is attested by its vital
                    statistics. The mean annual mortality from 1873 to 1882 was 18·4 per 1000. The
                    death-rate from consumption in all England is 2·4 per 1000; amongst the
                    indigenous population of Scarborough from 1873 to 1882 it was 1·7 per 1000. The
                    mean annual temperature is 47·9 Fahr. In December, January, and February it is
                    only 0·6° colder than Brighton, whilst in the summer months Brighton is 3·6
                    warmer.</p>
                <p>The town is a royal borough, its charter of incorporation dating from 1161. It
                    returned two members to parliament from 1283 to 1885, when one of the seats was
                    taken away. The limits of the municipal and parliamentary boroughs coincide,—the
                    area being 2348 acres, the population 24,259 in 1871 and 30,504 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Shipbuilding, salt-manufacture, and knife-making were formerly common, but the
                    only craft now remaining is jet-manufacture. The fishing trade is, however, very
                    considerable. Disputes about dues for the old pier and the fish-tithe occupy a
                    conspicuous place in the town records; the pier seems to have suffered greatly
                    in the various sieges to which the town, after it was walled, became exposed.
                    The old town-hall in St Nicholas Street, the new town-hall in Castle Road, the
                    market-hall in St Helen’s Square, in the Tuscan style, and the new post office
                    in Huntriss Row are conspicuous amongst the public buildings. There are two
                    theatres. Of the monastic buildings belonging to the Grey Friars, Dominicans,
                    and Carmelites there are no remains, but the parish church of St Mary,
                    conspicuously situated on a mound to the south of Castle Hill, occupies the site
                    of the old Cistercian monastery. The old church was made the site of a battery
                    in the siege of the castle in 1644, and one of its towers fell in 1659. The
                    restoration of the present building took place in 1850. There are other churches
                    and chapels of a much more recent date, including a Roman Catholic church. The
                    racecourse is on the top of a <hi rend="underline">bil</hi> l, commanding fine
                    views of the moors and of the sea.</p>
                <p>The old name of the town was written Skardeburge. It is not mentioned in Domesday
                    Book, but it was probably waste, as Tosti, count of Northumberland, had ravaged
                    and burnt it some time previously. Thorklen mentions it as having been ravaged
                    by Adelbrecht, king of Northumberland, and by Harold Hardrada. Douglas, the
                    Scottish chief, also burnt it in 1318. Henry II. compelled the count of Aumale
                    to surrender the castle in 1155. King John visited the castle in 1206 and 1216,
                    and the “house and castle of Scarborough” are mentioned in 1223. When not used
                    as a temporary royal residence the castle was a royal prison. In 1312 the earl
                    of Pembroke besieged it, and in the Pilgrimage of Grace insurrection (1536) it
                    was unsuccessfully besieged by Sir Robert Aske. A detailed survey of it, made in
                    1538, is still extant, the castle yard and land therein described, with the
                    buildings, corresponding with a survey made in 1839. It was again besieged in
                    1644-45 and in 1648. In 1655 George Fox the Quaker was imprisoned in the castle.
                    In 1645 the town was captured by assault, and in later years its inhabitants
                    were much impoverished by military exactions and expenses. A view of the town
                    and castle in 1485 is still extant. The precise date when the town-walls were
                    dismantled is not known. In 1730 Daniel Defoe, writing from the place, said:
                    “The town is well-built, pleasant, and populous, and we found a great deal of
                    company here, drinking the waters, who have not only come from the north of
                    England but from Scotland.”</p>
