                        rend="italic">c.</hi> 1600-1661), a leading painter of the later Roman
                    school, was born in Rome in 1600, or perhaps as early as 1598. His father,
                    Benedetto, a painter of undistinguished position, gave him his earliest
                    instruction in the art; Andrea then passed into the studio of Albani, of whom he
                    was the last and the most eminent pupil, and under Albani he made his reputation
                    early. The painter of Sacchi’s predilection was Raphael; he was the jealous
                    opponent of Pietro da Cortona, and more especially of Bernini. In process of
                    time he became one of the most learned designers and one of the soundest
                    colourists of the Roman school. He went to Venice and to Lombardy to study
                    Venetian colour and the style of Correggio; but lie found the last-named master
                    unadaptable for his own proper methods in art, and he returned to Rome. Sacchi
                    was strong in artistic theory, and in practice slow and fastidious; it was his
                    axiom that the merit of a painter consists in producing, not many middling
                    pictures, but a few and perfect ones. His works have dignity, repose, elevated
                    yet natural forms, severe but not the less pleasing colour, a learned treatment
                    of architecture and perspective; he is thus a painter of the correct and
                    laudable academic order, admired by connoisseurs rather than by ambitious
                    students or the large public. His principal painting, often spoken of as the
                    fourth best easel-picture in Rome— in the Vatican Gallery—is St Romuald relating
                    his Vision to Five Monks of his Order. The pictorial <hi rend="italic">crux</hi>
                    of dealing with these figures, who are all in the white garb of their order, has
                    often been remarked upon; and as often the ingenuity and judgment of Sacchi have
                    been praised in varying the tints of these habits according to the light and
                    shade cast by a neighbouring tree. The Vatican Gallery contains also an early
                    painting of the master,—the Miracle of St Gregory, executed in 1624; a mosaic of
                    it was made in 1771 and placed in St Peter’s. Other leading examples are the
                    Death of St Anna, in S. Carlo ai Catinari; St Andrew, in the Quirinal; St
                    Joseph, at Capo alle Case; also, in fresco, a ceiling in the Palazzo
                    Barberini—Divine Wisdom—reckoned superior in expression and selection to the
                    rival work of Pietro da Cortona. There are likewise altar-pieces in Perugia,
                    Foligno, and Camerino. Sacchi, who worked almost always in Rome, left few
                    pictures visible in private galleries: one, of St Bruno, is in Grosvenor House.
                    He had a flourishing school: Nicholas Poussin and Carlo Maratta were his most
                    eminent scholars; Luigi Garzi and Francesco Lauri were others, and Sacchi’s own
                    son Giuseppe, who died young, after giving very high hopes. This must have been
                    an illegitimate son, for Andrea died unmarried. This event took place in Rome in
                    1661.</p>
