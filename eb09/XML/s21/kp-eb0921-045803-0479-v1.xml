                    an honourable place among the scholars of the 18th century. The first and most
                    important, <hi rend="smallcaps">Albert Schultens</hi> (1686-1750), was born at
                    Groningen in 1686. He studied for the church at Groningen and Leyden, applying
                    himself specially to Hebrew and the cognate tongues. His dissertation on <hi
                        rend="italic">The Use of Arabic in the Interpretation of Scripture</hi>
                    (1706) indicates the point of view which prevailed with the school of Arabists
                    of which he was founder, and which differentiates his aims from those of <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Reiske</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> After a visit to
                    Reland in Utrecht, he returned to Groningen (1708); then, having taken his
                    degree in theology (1709), he again went to Leyden, and devoted himself to the
                    study of the MS. collections there till in 1711 he became pastor at Wassenaer.
                    Parochial work was little to his taste, and in 1713 he took the Hebrew chair at
                    Franeker, which he held till 1729, when he was transferred to Leyden as rector
                    of the <hi rend="italic">collegium</hi><pb break="no"

                    seminary for poor students. From 1732 till his death (at Leyden on 26th January
                    1750) he was professor of Oriental languages at Leyden. Schultens was the chief
                    Arabic teacher of his time, and in some sense a restorer of Arabic studies, but
                    he differed from Reiske and De Sacy in mainly regarding Arabic as a handmaid to
                    Hebrew. His chief work was to vindicate the value of comparative study of the
                    Semitic tongues against those who, like Gousset, regarded Hebrew as a sacred
                    tongue with which comparative philology has nothing to do. Schultens, on the
                    other hand, certainly went much too far in his appeals to Arabic for the
                    interpretation of the Old Testament; the laws of comparative Semitic philology
                    were not yet known, so that the comparison of roots was often guesswork, and the
                    value of the exegetical tradition in Hebrew was not accurately determined. Hence
                    he did not leave so much of permanent value for Hebrew grammar and lexicography
                    as might have been expected from his learning; but the systematic illustration
                    of phrases and modes of thought from Arabic literature, <hi rend="italic"

                    which has been too much overlooked in the reaction against the extravagances of
                    the school he founded.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
