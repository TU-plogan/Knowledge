                            of</hi></label> (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1619-1690), marshal of France
                    and English general, was descended from an old family of the Palatinate, and was
                    born about 1619. He began his military career under Frederick Henry, prince of
                    Orange, and after his death in 1659 entered the service of France, acquiring
                    ultimately a reputation as a general second only to that of Turenne and the
                    prince of Condé. In Paris he made the acquaintance of Charles II., who according
                    to his own account “admitted him to great familiarities with him.” In 1660 he
                    was sent to Portugal, and on his way thither passed through England to concert
                    with Charles measures for supporting that country in the contest with Spain. For
                    his services to Portugal he was in 1668 made a grandee, and received a pension
                    of £5000 a year. In 1673 he was invited by Charles to England, with the view of
                    taking command of the army, but so strong was the general sentiment against the
                    appointment as savouring of French influence that it was not carried into
                    effect. He therefore again entered the service of France, and after his capture
                    of Bellegarde, 29th July 1675, received the rank of marshal. In subsequent
                    campaigns he continued to add to his reputation until the revocation of the
                    edict of Nantes (22d October 1685) compelled him as a Protestant to quit his
                    adopted country. Ultimately he was chosen commanderin-chief of the forces of the
                    elector of Brandenburg, and with the elector’s consent he joined the prince of
                    Orange on his expedition to England in 1688, as second in command to the prince.
                    The following year he was made a knight of the Garter, created successively
                    baron, marquis, and duke, and received from the House of Commons a vote of
                    £100,000. In August he was appointed commander-in-chief of the expedition to
                    Ireland against James IL After capturing Carrickfergus he marched unopposed
                    through a country desolated before him to Dundalk, but, as the bulk of his
                    forces were raw and undisciplined as well as inferior in numbers to the enemy,
                    he deemed it imprudent to risk a battle, and entrenching himself at Dundalk
                    declined to be drawn beyond the circle of his defences. Shortly afterwards
                    pestilence broke out, and when he retired to winter quarters in Ulster his
                    forces were in a more shattered condition than if they had sustained a severe
                    defeat. At the same time competent authorities were agreed that the policy of
                    masterly inactivity which he pursued was the only one open to him. In the spring
                    he began the campaign with the capture of Charlemont, but no advance southward
                    was made until the arrival of William. At the Boyne (July 1, 1690) Schömberg
                    gave his opinion against the determination of William to cross the river in face
                    of the opposing army. In the battle he held command of the centre, and, while
                    riding through the river without his cuirass to rally his men, was surrounded by
                    a band of Irish horsemen and met instantaneous death. He was buried in St
                    Patrick’s cathedral, Dublin, where there is a monument to him, with a Latin
                    inscription by Dean Swift. Schömberg was generally regarded in Eng<pb break="no"
