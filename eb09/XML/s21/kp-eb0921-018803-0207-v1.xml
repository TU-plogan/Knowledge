                <p><label type="entry">ST PAUL</label>, a city of the United States, second city of
                    Minnesota, a port of entry and the capital of the State and of Ramsey county, is
                    situated in 44° 52' 46" N. lat. and 93° 5' W. long., on the Mississippi river,
                    2150 miles from its mouth, 10 below the falls of St Anthony, the natural head of
                    navigation, and 360 north-west of Chicago. The ground on which the city is built
                    rises from the river in a series of terraces, the ascent being in many places
                    precipitous and not easily adapted to urban uses. The city is mainly confined to
                    the second and third terraces, but is gradually spreading over the elevated
                    plateau beyond. The difficulties of the situation have much increased the cost
                    of erecting large business structures, circumscribed the business quarter, and
                    impeded the railway companies in securing convenient and adequate facilities.
                    The city site is underlaid with a thick stratum of bluish limestone, which comes
                    near the surface, and which, while it renders excavation expensive, furnishes
                    unlimited supplies of building material of a fair quality. The streets of the
                    older portions are uncomfortably narrow, but the newer streets are better laid
                    out. The chief public buildings are the State capitol (built in 1882), the
                    United States custom-house and postoffice, the city-hall, and the city-market. A
                    handsome opera-house and a chamber of commerce building are conspicuous
                    features. In 1885 there were seventy-one church organizations,—9 Episcopal, 7
                    Presbyterian, 4 Congregational, 12 Methodist, 12 Lutheran, 2 Jewish, 7 Baptist,
                    11 Roman Catholic, 1 Unitarian, 4 Evangelical, 1 Swedenborgian, and 1 Disciples
                    of Christ. Besides the charitable institutions connected with the church
                    organizations there are an orphan asylum, a home for the friendless, a Swedish
                    hospital, a women’s Christian home, and a Magdalen home. Of periodical
                    publications there were issued in 1885 5 dailies, 17 weeklies, and 7 monthlies.
                    The city has (1886) eleven banks, of which six are national with an aggregate
                    paid-up capital of $5,200,000, and five State institutions with a paid-up
                    capital of $1,150,000. St Paul is an important railway centre, dividing with
                    Minneapolis the terminal and distributing business of no less than fifteen lines
                    owned by six different corporations and having an aggregate length of 15,818
                    miles. The navigation of the upper Mississippi acts as a check upon the rates
                    charged by the<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0208-0189"/> railway companies. The traffic at the port of
                    St Paul in 1884 was—tons landed, 45,800; tons shipped, 13,300; passengers
                    carried, 34,625. Two lines of steamers ply between St Paul and St Louis and
                    intermediate points. The average season of navigation lasts six and a half
                    months. The city has within its corporate limits, but removed some miles from
                    the city proper, two colleges— Macalester (Presbyterian) and Hamline
                    (Methodist)—both only partially endowed or supplied with buildings. There are
                    twenty-two public school buildings, built at an aggregate cost of $663,000.
                    There are also several academies and seminaries under private or denominational
                    management. The public park system of St Paul is as yet undeveloped, but an area
                    of 250 acres has been secured near Lake Como to be laid out as pleasure-grounds.
                    Rice Park and Smith Park are public squares in the central portion of the city,
                    tastefully adorned with walks and shrubbery. The population of St Paul,
                    according to the United States census, was 840 in 1850, 10,600 in 1860, 20,300
                    in 1870, and 41,473 in 1880 (males 22,483, females 18,990). According to the
                    State census, it was 111,334 in 1885.</p>
                <p>St Paul is a commercial rather than a manufacturing city. The jobbing trade for
                    the year 1884 reached a total of about 865,000,000, an increase of 50 per cent.
                    in four years. In the same year manufactures valued at $20,000,000 were
                    produced, the principal items being agricultural implements, boots and shoes,
                    machinery, sash, doors, and blinds, waggons and carriages. There is a large
                    flourmill, capable of producing 700 barrels daily. The lack of waterpower and
                    the high cost of fuel are drawbacks to the growth of manufactures. The main
                    thoroughfares have recently been paved, for the most part with blocks of white
                    cedar, and stone sidewalks are rapidly replacing wooden ones. The water-supply
                    is obtained from a group of small lakes lying north of the city limits, and the
                    works are owned and managed by the city. The drainage is excellent. For
                    governmental purposes the city consists of eight wards, each of which elects
                    three members of council. The chief of police and all subordinate members of the
                    force are appointed by the mayor, who is elected by popular vote in May of each
                    alternate year. The aggregate assessed valuation of real and personal property
                    in St Paul was $60,463,000 in 1884. The total bonded debt of the city on 31st
                    March 1885 was officially stated at $3,027,141.</p>
                <p>The first settlement on the site of St Paul was in 1838, when an unimportant
                    trading-post was established there by adventurers. In 1841 a Jesuit missionary
                    built a log chapel and dedicated it to St Paul (whence the name of the hamlet).
                    The site of the future city was surveyed and laid out in 1849-50. About this
                    time (1851) the Sioux Indians ceded to the United States all lands held by them
                    between the Mississippi and Big Sioux rivers. Prior to this cession the white
                    population in the then Territory of Minnesota had not reached a total of 6000,
                    but the removal of the aborigines was promptly followed by a notable influx of
                    white settlers. With a population of some 2800 in 1854 the town obtained a fully
                    organized city government. Upon the admission of Minnesota to the Union in 1858
                    St Paul was designated as the capital. The city was originally confined to the
                    east bank of the river, but in 1874 by popular vote a portion of Dakota county
                    was transferred to Ramsey county, and West St Paul on the west bank of the
                    Mississippi, then containing some 3000 inhabitants, became a part of St Paul
                    proper. In 1884 an Act of the State legislature extended the geographical
                    boundaries of the city so as to embrace all territory in Ramsey county westward
                    to the line of Hennepin county, and virtually to the corporate limits of the
                    “sister” city Minneapolis, 10 miles distant.</p>
