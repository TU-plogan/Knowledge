                <p><label type="entry">SAXO GRAMMATICUS</label>, the celebrated Danish historian and
                    poet, belonged to a family of warriors, his father and grandfather having served
                    under king Valdemar I. (d. 1182). He himself was brought up for the clerical
                    profession, entered about 1180 the service of Archbishop Absalon as one of his
                    secretaries, and remained with him in that capacity until the death of Absalon
                    in 1201. At the instigation of the latter he began, about 1185, to write the
                    history of the Danish Christian kings from the time of Sven Estridsön, but later
                    Absalon prevailed on him to write also the history of the earlier, heathen
                    times, and to combine both into a great work, <hi rend="italic">Gesta
                        Danorum.</hi> The archbishop died before the work was finished, and
                    therefore the preface, written about 1208, is dedicated to his successor
                    Archbishop Andreas, and to King Valdemar II. Nothing else is known about Saxo’s
                    life and person; a chronicle of 1265 calls him “mine et urbanae eloquentiai
                    clericus;" and an epitome of his work from about 1340 describes him as “egregius
                    grammaticus, origine Sialandus that he was a native of Zealand is probably
                    correct, inasmuch as, whereas he often criticizes the Jutlanders and the
                    Scanians, he frequently praises the Zealanders. The surname of “Grammaticus” is
                    probably of later origin, scarcely earlier than 1500, apparently owing to a
                    mistake. The title of “provost (dean) of Roskilde,” given him in the 16th
                    century, is also probably incorrect, the historian being confounded with an
                    older contemporary, the provost of the same name. Saxo, from his apprenticeship
                    as the archbishop’s secretary, had acquired a brilliant but somewhat euphuistic
                    Latin style, and wrote fine Latin verses, but otherwise does not seem to have
                    had any very great learning or extensive reading. His models of style were
                    Valerius Maximus, Justin, and Martianus Capella, especially the last.
                    Occasionally he mentions Bede, Dudo, and Paulus Diaconus, but does not seem to
                    have studied them or any other historical works thoroughly, and he neither
                    understands nor is interested in scientific research, in general history, or
                    even in chronology. He wrote because he<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0372-0351"/> did not like his countrymen to be behind
                    other nations through the want of an historian, and because he washed to
                    perpetuate the record of the exploits of the Danes. His sources are partly
                    Danish traditions and old songs, partly the statements of Archbishop Absalon,
                    partly the accounts of Icelanders, and, lastly, some few earlier, but scanty,
                    sources, being lists of Danish kings and short chronicles, which furnished him
                    with some reliable chronological dates. He considered traditions as history, and
                    therefore made it his chief business to recount and arrange these, by the help
                    of the lists of the kings, into a connected whole. His work, therefore, is a
                    loosely connected series of biographies of Danish kings and heroes; he dwells
                    with predilection on those periods during which Danish kings were said to have
                    made great conquests, and he represents these conquerors as the paragons of
                    their times.</p>
                <p>The first nine books comprise “Antiquity,” that is, traditions of kings and
                    heroes of the half-mythical time up to about 950. Here we have traditions about
                    Fredfrode, about Amleth (Hamlet) and Fenge, about Rolf Krake, Hadding, the giant
                    Starkather, Harald Hildetann, and Ragnar Lodbrok. In this earlier history Saxo
                    has also embodied myths of national gods who in tradition had become Danish
                    kings, for instance, Balder and Hother, and of foreign heroes, likewise
                    incorporated in Danish history, as the Gothic Jarmunrik (A. S. Eormenríc), the
                    Anglian Vermund (A. S. Garmund) and Uffe (A. S. Offa), the German Hedin and
                    Hild, &amp;c. Frequently the narrative is interrupted by translations of poems,
                    which Saxo has used as authentic sources, although they are often only a few
                    generations older than himself. In the later books (x.-xvi.) of his work he
                    follows to a greater extent historical accounts, and the more he approaches his
                    own time the fuller and the more trustworthy his relation becomes; especially
                    brilliant is his treatment of the history of King Valdemar and of Absalon. But
                    his patriotism often makes him partial to his countrymen, and his want of
                    critical sense often blinds him to the historical truth.</p>
                <p>Saxo’s work was widely read during the Middle Ages, and several extracts of it
                    were made for smaller chronicles. It was published for the first time, from a
                    MS. afterwards lost, in Paris, 1514, by the Danish humanist Christiern Pedersen;
                    this edition was reprinted at Basel, 1534, and at Frankfort, 1576. Of later
                    editions may be mentioned that of Stephen Stephanius, Sorö, 1644, that of C. A.
                    Klotz, Leipsic, 1771, and that of P. E. Müller and J. M. Velschow, Copenhagen,
                    1839. No complete MS. any longer exists; yet of late small fragments have been
                    found of three MSS. The most remarkable of these is the fragment found at
                    Angers, in France, written shortly after 1200, perhaps by Saxo himself or under
                    his superintendence; here several corrections are found above the lines, showing
                    how the author varied and polished his Latin style.</p>
