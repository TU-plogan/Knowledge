                    (1804-1871), a painter of the romantic school, was born in Vienna in 1804. He
                    received rudimentary training and led a joyous careless life in that gay
                    capital; among his companions was the musician Schubert, whose songs he
                    illustrated. In 1828 he removed to Munich, and had the advantage of the
                    friendship of the painter Schnorr and the guidance of Cornelius, then director
                    of the academy. In 1834 he received the commission to decorate King Louis’s new
                    palace with wall paintings illustrative of the poet Tieck. He also found in the
                    same palace congenial sport for his fancy in a “Kinderfries”; his ready hand was
                    likewise busy on almanacs, &amp;c., and by his illustrations to Goethe and other
                    writers he gained applause and much employment. In the revival of art in Germany
                    Schwind held as his own the sphere of poetic fancy. To him was entrusted in
                    1839, in the new Carlsruhe academy, the embodiment in fresco of ideas thrown out
                    by Goethe; he decorated a villa at Leipsic with the story of Cupid and Psyche,
                    and further justified his title of poet-painter by designs from the <hi
                        rend="italic">Niebelungenlied</hi> and Tasso’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gerusalemme</hi> for the walls of the castle of Hohenschwangau in Bavarian
                    Tyrol. From the year 1844 dates his residence in Frankfort; to this period
                    belong some of his best easel pictures, pre-eminently the Singers’ Contest in
                    the Wartburg (1846), also designs for the Goethe celebration, likewise numerous
                    book illustrations. The conceptions for the most part are better than the
                    execution. In 1847 Schwind returned to Munich on being appointed professor in
                    the academy. Eight years later his fame was at its height on the completion in
                    the castle of the Wartburg of wall pictures illustrative of the Singers’ Contest
                    and of the History of Elizabeth of Hungary. The compositions received universal
                    praise, and at a grand musical festival to their honour Schwind himself played
                    among the violins. In 1857 appeared his exceptionally mature “cyclus” of the
                    Seven Ravens from Grimm’s fairy stories. In the same year he visited England to
                    report officially to King Louis on the Manchester art treasures. And so
                    diversified were his gifts that he turned his hand to church windows and joined
                    his old friend Schnorr in designs for the painted glass in Glasgow cathedral.
                    Towards the close of his career, with broken health and powers on the wane, he
                    revisited Vienna. To this time belong the “cyclus” from the legend of Melusine
                    and the designs commemorative of chief musicians which decorate the foyer of the
                    new opera-house. Cornelius writes, “You have here translated the joyousness of
                    music into pictorial art.” Schwind’s genius was lyrical; he drew inspiration
                    from chivalry, folk-lore, and the songs of the people; his art was decorative,
                    but lacked scholastic training and technical skill. Schwind died at Munich in
                    1871, and his body lies in the old Friedhof of the same town.</p>
