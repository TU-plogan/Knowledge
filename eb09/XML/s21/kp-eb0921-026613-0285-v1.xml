                    of Forlì and Pesaro-Urbino, and consists of part of the eastern spurs of the
                    Apennines. Monte Titano, the central and culminating summit, has three peaks (M.

                    through Rimini to the sea have their head-waters partly in the north and west of
                    San Marino, while its south-eastern valleys are drained by the sources of the
                    Marano. Farming and stock-raising occupy the bulk of the population (total, 5700
                    in 1850, 7816 in 1874), and their wines and oxen are both highly prized. The
                    city of San Marino (1600 inhabitants), formerly reached only by a mule-track but
                    since 1875 by a good carriage-road, is a quaint little place with steep and
                    narrow streets and picturesque but gloomy houses of undressed stone, and
                    containing five churches, a council-hall, an audience chamber, a law court, a
                    little theatre, a museum, and a library. In the centre of the principal square
                    (Pianello) stands a white marble statue of Liberty, presented by the duchess of
                    Acquaviva. At the foot of the city-hill lies the Borgo di San Marino (the
                    commercial centre of the republic); and other municipal villages are Serravalle,
                    Faetano, and Montegiardino, each with remains of its castle and
                    fortifications.</p>
                <p>The republic is governed by a great council <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Generale-Consiglio-Principe)</hi> of 60 members (20 nobles, 20 burgesses,
                    20 rural landowners) named for life by the council itself. From this body is
                    elected the Council of Twelve, which with the assistance of a legal adviser
                    decides in the third and last resort. Two captains-regent elected every six
                    months (one from the nobles, one from the other two classes) represent the
                    state, which also has its home secretary, its minister of foreign affairs, its
                    chancellor of the exchequer, an army of 950 men, and a regular budget. By treaty
                    with Italy (1872) San Marino, instead of maintaining a customs line of its own,
                    receives a certain proportion of the Italian customs revenue, and, agreeing not
                    to grow tobacco, is allowed to purchase foreign tobacco duty free. To avoid any
                    difficulty about copyright there is no printing press in the republic.</p>
                <p>San Marino derives its name from a certain Dalmatian mason who, along with a
                    comrade immortalized by the neighbouring castle and cathedral of San Leo,
                    settled in this region in the 3d century. The bones of Marinus are said to have
                    been removed to Pavia by the Lombard king Astolphus and restored to the little
                    city on Mount Titanus by Pippin; but the first authentic document proving the
                    existence of the community dates from 885. Situated as a bulwark between the
                    hostile houses of Montefeltro and Malatesta, San Marino fortunately attached
                    itself to the stronger party, which in the 15th century placed its
                    representative on the ducal throne of Urbino. The assistance which it rendered
                    Duke Federigo and his allies, the king of Naples and the pope, against
                    Sigismondo Malatesta was rewarded in 1463 with the castles and territories of
                    Serravalle, Faetano, and Montegiardino. On the annexation of Urbino to the
                    States of the Church (1631), the independence of San Marino was acknowledged;
                    and the unauthorized assertion of papal jurisdiction by Alberoni in 1739 was
                    disallowed by Clement XII. on February 5th 1740. In 1797 Napoleon I. decided to
                    preserve this “échantillon de république;” and in 1854 it was protected from the
                    designs of Pius IX. by the interference of Napoleon III. At the unification of
                    Italy, Cibrario, a citizen in the service of the house of Savoy, helped to
                    secure excellent terms for San Marino.</p>
