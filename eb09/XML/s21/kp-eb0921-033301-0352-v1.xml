                <p><label type="entry">SAVONA</label>, a city of Italy, in the province of Genoa,
                    25½ miles west of that town, and 91 miles south of Turin by rail, is after Genoa
                    and Nice the most important of the cities of the Riviera. The greater part of
                    the town is now modern, consisting of handsome gardens, boulevards, and
                    well-paved broad streets lined with massive arcades and substantial houses,
                    built in enormous square blocks from four to five stories high. It is surrounded
                    with green-clad hills and luxuriant orange groves. On the Rock of St George
                    stands the castle built by the Genoese in 1542, now used as a military prison.
                    The cathedral (1589-1604) is a late Renaissance building with a dome of modern
                    construction. In the Cappella Sistina stands the magnificent tomb erected by
                    Sixtus IV. to his parents. Facing the cathedral is the Della Rovere palace
                    erected by Cardinal Giulio della Rovere (Julius II.) as a kind of university,
                    and now occupied by the prefecture, the post-office, and the courts. San
                    Domenico (or Giovanni Battista) built by the Dominicans, occupies the site of
                    the very ancient church of Sant’ Antonio Abate. Several of the churches have
                    paintings of some merit, and there is a municipal picture-gallery occupying part
                    of the extensive buildings of the civil hospital of St Paul. The Teatro
                    Chiabrera, erected in 1853 in honour of the lyric poet Chiabrera, who was born
                    in Savona, and is buried there in the church of San Giacomo, has its façade
                    adorned with statues of Alfieri, Goldoni, Metastasio, and Rossini. The
                    town-house (with the public library founded by the bishop of Savona, Maria di
                    Mari, in 1840), the episcopal palace, and the harbour tower surmounted by a
                    colossal figure of the Virgin also deserve mention. As early as the 12th
                    century, the Savonese built themselves a sufficient harbour; but in the 16th
                    century their rivals the Genoese, fearing that Francis I. of France intended to
                    make it a great seat of Mediterranean trade, rendered it useless by sinking at
                    its mouth vessels filled with large stones. The modern harbour, dating from
                    1815, has since 1880 been provided with a dock excavated in the rock, 986 feet
                    long 460 wide and 23 feet deep; and other extensions are in progress. In 1884
                    1012 vessels (349,462 tons) entered and 988 (346,337 tons) cleared—the steamers
                    being respectively 298 (273,237 tons) and 294 (270,953). The opening of the
                    railway to Bra (1878) at once gave Savona an advantage over Genoa as a port for
                    supplying Turin and Piedmont. A large import trade has since grown up,
                    especially in coals (300,000 tons from Great Britain and France), which can be
                    loaded directly from the ship into the trucks. The exports are confined to the
                    products of the local industries, fruit, hoop-staves, Ac. The potteries which
                    have been long established at Savona export their earthenware to all parts of
                    Italy; and there are glass-</p>
                <p>works, soap-works, and one of the largest iron-foundries in North Italy.
                    Shipbuilding is also carried on. The population of the commune, which includes
                    the suburbs of Fornaci, Lavagnola, Legino and Zinola, and San Bernardo, was
                    19,611 in 1861 and 29,614 in 1881, that of the city at the latter date being
                    19,120.</p>
                <p>Savona is the <hi rend="italic">Savo</hi> where, according to Livy, Mago stored
                    his booty in the Second Punic War. In 1191 it bought up the territorial claims
                    of the Marquises Del Carretto. lts whole history is that of a long struggle
                    against the preponderance of Genoa. In 1746 it was captured by the king of
                    Sardinia, but it was restored to Genoa by the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle.
                    Columbus, whose ancestors came from Savona, gave the name of the city to one of
                    the first islands ho discovered in the West Indies.</p>
