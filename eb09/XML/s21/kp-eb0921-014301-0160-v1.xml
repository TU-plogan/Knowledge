                    (1507-1587), English statesman, was the son of Henry Sadler, steward to the
                    proprietor of the manor of Gillney, near Great Hadham, Hertfordshire, and was
                    born at Hackney in Middlesex in 1507. While a mere child he obtained a situation
                    in the family of Thomas Cromwell, earl of Essex. Through him he was introduced
                    to Henry VIII., who conferred on him various appointments and employed him in
                    connexion with the dissolution of the monasteries, in the rich spoils of which
                    he was a large sharer. So much was the king impressed by Sadler’s ability and
                    address that he made choice of him for his subsequent important negotiations
                    with Scotland. In 1537 he was sent thither to strengthen the English interest;
                    in 1539-40 he was commissioned to persuade the Scottish king James V. to cast
                    off the supremacy of the pope; in 1541 he went back to enforce the same counsel;
                    and in 1542 he was appointed to settle the proposed match between Edward prince
                    of Wales and Mary the infant queen of Scots. Although not successful in any of
                    these missions, he continued to retain the full confidence of the king, who, in
                    recognition of his zealous services, conferred on him in 1543 the honour of
                    knighthood. On Henry’s death in 1547 Sadler’s name was found in the royal will
                    as one of the councillors to the sixteen nobles who were entrusted with the
                    guardianship of the young king. In the same year he was appointed treasurer to
                    the army sent against Scotland, and for his great services in rallying the
                    repulsed cavalry he was created a knight-banneret on the battlefield of Pinkie.
                    During the reign of Mary he lived in retirement on his estate near Hackney; but
                    on the accession of Elizabeth in 1558 he came once more into a sphere of active
                    employment. He immediately became a member of parliament for the county of
                    Hertford and a privy councillor.<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0921-0161-0144"/> Not long afterwards his strong Protestant
                    sympathies and his acquaintance with Scottish affairs recommended him as a fit
                    person to be employed by Elizabeth in her intrigues with the Scottish lords of
                    the congregation against Queen Mary. In 1584 he was appointed keeper of Mary
                    queen of Scots in the castle of Tutbury; but on account of “age and infirmity”
                    he was permitted to resign his charge some time before the death of the queen.
                    His last service was to repair to Scotland to pacify the king’s indignation on
                    account of Mary’s death. He died after his return home at Standon in
                    Hertfordshire, 30th March 1587.</p>
