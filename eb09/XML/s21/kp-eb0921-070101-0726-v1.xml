                        Alexander</hi></label>, Roman emperor from 222 to 235, was of Syrian
                    parentage, and was born at Area near the Syrian Tripolis (now 'Irka; Yákút, iii.
                    653; <hi rend="italic">cf.</hi> Gen. x. 17), probably in the year 205. His
                    father Gessius Marcianus held office more than once as an imperial procurator;
                    his mother Julia Mamaea was the daughter of Julia Maesa, the scheming and
                    ambitious lady of Emesa who had succeeded in raising her grandson Elagabalus to
                    the throne of the Caesars; see the genealogical table in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Heliogabalus.</hi> His original name was Alexius Bassianus, but he changed
                    it in 221, when Maesa persuaded Elagabalus to adopt his cousin as successor and
                    create him Caesar. In the next year Elagabalus was murdered, and Alexander was
                    proclaimed by the Praetorians and accepted by the senate. He was then a mere
                    lad, amiable, well-meaning, but somewhat weak, and entirely under the dominion
                    of his mother, a woman of many virtues, who surrounded her son with wise
                    counsellors, watched over the development of his character, and improved the
                    tone of the administration, but on the other hand was inordinately jealous of
                    her influence, and alienated the army by extreme parsimony, while neither she
                    nor her son had a strong enough hand to keep tight the reins of military
                    discipline. Mutinies became frequent in all parts of the empire: to one of them

                    command (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Dion).</hi> On the whole, however, the reign
                    of Alexander Severus was prosperous till he was summoned to the East to face the
                    new power of the Sásánians (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Persia,</hi> vol. xviii. p.
                    G07). Of the war that followed we have very various accounts; Mommsen (vol. v.
                    p. 420 <hi rend="italic">sqj)</hi> leans to that which is least favourable to
                    the Romans. At all events, though the Persians were checked for the time, the
                    conduct of the Roman army showed an extraordinary lack of discipline. The
                    emperor returned to Rome and celebrated a triumph (233), but next year he was
                    called to face German invaders in Gaul, and there was slain with his mother in a
                    mutiny which was probably led by Maximinus, and at any rate purchased him the
                    throne. Whatever the personal virtues of Alexander were, and they have not lost
                    by contrast with his successor’s brutal tyranny, he was not of the stuff to rule
                    a military empire.</p>
