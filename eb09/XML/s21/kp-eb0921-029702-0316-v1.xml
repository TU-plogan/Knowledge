                    (Λευκάδα, ancient Λευκάς), one of the Ionian Islands, with an area of 110 square
                    miles and a population (1880) of 25,000 (20,892 in 1870), lies off the coast of
                    Acarnania (Greece), immediately south of the entrance to the Gulf of Arta. It
                    first appears in history as a peninsula <hi rend="italic">(Odyssey,</hi> xxiv.
                    378), and, if the statements of ancient authorities be accepted literally, it
                    owed its existence as an island to the Corinthians, whose canal across the
                    isthmus was again, after a long period of disuse opened up by the Romans. But it
                    is probable rather that Leucas was then as now separated from the mainland by a
                    shallow lagoon (two feet or less). During the English occupation a canal for
                    boats of four to five feet draught was formed from Fort Santa Maura to the town,
                    but the 16-feet-deep ship canal which it was proposed (1844) to carry right
                    across the lagoon or submerged isthmus to Fort Alexander was only partially
                        excavated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As a six
                            hours’ shortening of the steam-passage between the Levant and the

                            taken up. According to M. Pyat, the engineer employed to report, the
                            dredging could be done for 1,200,000 francs.</p></note> Santa Maura,
                    measuring about 20 miles from north to south and 5 to 8 miles in breadth, is a
                    rugged mass of limestone and bituminous shales (partly Tertiary), rising in its
                    principal ridges to heights of 2000 and 3000 feet, and presenting very limited
                    areas of level ground. The grain crop suffices only for a few months’ local
                    consumption; but olive oil of good quality is produced to the extent of 30,000
                    to 50,000 barrels per annum; the vineyards (in the west especially) yield
                    100,000 barrels of red wine (bought mainly by Rouen, Cette, Trieste, and
                    Venice); the currant, introduced about 1859, has gradually come to be the
                    principal source of wealth (the crop averaging 2,500,000 lb); and small
                    quantities of cotton, flax, tobacco, valonia, &amp;c., are also grown. The salt
                    trade, formerly of importance, has suffered from Greek customs regulations.
                    Though to a large extent unlettered and superstitious, the inhabitants are
                    industrious and well-behaved. The chief town (5000 inhabitants) properly called
                    Amaxikhi, but more usually Santa Maura, after the neighbouring fort, is situated
                    at the north-east end of the island opposite the lagoon. In the south-west is
                    the village of Vasiliki, where a wharf protected by a mole was built in 1877-78
                    for shipping the currant crop. Remains of Cyclopean and polygonal walls exist at
                    Kaligoni (south of Amaxikhi), probably the site of the ancient acropolis of
                    Neritus (or Nericus), and of the later and lower Corinthian settlement of
                    Leucas. From this point a Roman bridge seems to have crossed to the mainland.
                    Between the town and Fort Santa Maura extends a remarkably fine Turkish aqueduct
                    partly destroyed along with the town by the earthquake of 1825. Forts Alexander
                    and Constantine commanding the bridge are relics of the Russian occupation; the
                    other forts are of Turko-Venetian origin. The magnificent cliff, some 2000 feet
                    high, which forms the southern termination of the modern island still bears the
                    substructions of the temple of Apollo Leucatas (hence the modern name Capo
                    Ducato). At the annual festival of Apollo a criminal was obliged to plunge from
                    the summit into the sea, where, however, an effort was made to pick him up; and
                    it was by the same heroic leap that Sappho and Artemisia, daughter of Lygdamis,
                    are said to have ended their lives.</p>
