                <p><label type="entry">SAXE-ALTENBURG</label> (Germ. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sachsen-Altenburg),</hi> a duchy in Thuringia, and an independent member of
                    the German empire, consists of two detached and almost equal parts, separated
                    from each other by a portion of Reuss (junior line), and bounded on the S. and
                    W. by the grandduchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, on the N. by Prussia, and on the
                    E. by the kingdom of Saxony. There are in addition 12 small exclaves. The total
                    area is 510 square miles (about half the size of Cheshire in England), of which
                    254 are in the east or Altenburg division and 256 in the west or Saal-Eisenberg
                    division. The former district, traversed by the most westerly offshoots of the
                    Erzgebirge and watered by the Pleisse and its tributaries, forms an undulating
                    and fertile region, containing some of the richest agricultural soil in Germany.
                    The western district, through which the Saale flows, is rendered hilly by the
                    beginnings of the Thuringian Forest, and in some measure makes up by its fine
                    woods for the comparatively poor soil. The mineral wealth of Saxe-Altenburg is
                    scanty; lignite, the chief mineral, is worked mainly in the eastern
                    district.</p>
                <p>According to the returns for 1883, 58½ per cent. of the entire duchy was occupied
                    by arable land, and 27½ per cent. by forests, of which four-fifths were
                    coniferous. The chief crops were rye (42,317 acres, yielding 20,412 tons), oats
                    (36,807 acres, 22,996 tons), barley (21,390 acres, 13,912 tons), wheat (17,490
                    acres, 9724 tons), and potatoes (19,870 acres, 113,209 tons). The cattleraising
                    and horse-breeding of the duchy are of considerable importance. In 1883 the
                    duchy contained 9934 horses, 60,335 cattle, 20,996 sheep, 46,387 pigs, and
                    12,420 goats. About 35 per cent. of the population are directly supported by
                    agriculture. The manufactures of the duchy are very varied, but none is of any
                    great importance; woollen goods, gloves, hats, porcelain and earthenware, and
                    wooden articles are the chief products. Trade in these, and in horses, cattle,
                    and agricultural produce, is tolerably brisk. The chief seats of trade and
                    manufacture are Altenburg the capital (29,422 inhabitants in 1885), Ronneburg
                    (5485 inhabitants in 1880), Schmölln (6394), Gössnitz (4949), and Meuselwitz
                    (3402) in the Altenburg division; and Eisenburg (6277), Roda (3465), and Kahla
                    (2999) in the Saal-Eisenburg division. Besides these there are the towns of
                    Lucka (1505) and Orlamünde (1461), and 449 villages, of which Russdorf (1781),
                    in an exclave, is the largest.</p>
                <p>Next to the two principalities of Reuss, Saxe-Altenburg is the most densely
                    peopled part of Thuringia. In 1880 the population was 155,036, or 304 per square
                    mile. Of these 154,187 were Protestants, 741 Roman Catholics, 33 Jews, and 75 of
                    other sects. The population in 1885, according to a provisional return of the
                    census of that year, was 161,129. In the west division the population (49,788)
                    is wholly Teutonic, but in the east (111,341) there is a strong Wendish or
                    Slavonic element, still to be traced in the peculiar manners and costume of the
                    country-people, though these are gradually being given up. The farmers and
                    peasant-proprietors of the east division (Altenburger Bauern) are an industrious
                    and well-to-do class, but like similar classes in other countries they are said
                    to be avaricious and purse-proud. Their holdings are seldom divided; a custom
                    corresponding to <hi rend="smallcaps">Borough-English</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.)</hi> though not supported by law, obtains among them; and sometimes
                    the elder brothers are employed by the youngest as servants on the paternal
                    farm. The destitution to which the disinherited children are often reduced by
                    this custom is seriously prejudicial to morality. The Altenburg peasants are
                    pleasure-loving, and in spite of their avarice are said to gamble for very high
                    stakes, especially at the complicated card-game of “skat,” now universal in
                    Germany, which many believe to have been invented here.</p>
                <p>Saxe-Altenburg is a limited hereditary monarchy, its constitution resting on a
                    law of 1831, subsequently modified. The diet consists of 30 members, elected for
                    3 years, of whom 9 are returned by the highest taxpayers, 9 by the towns, and 12
                    by the country districts. The franchise is enjoyed by all males over 25 years of
                    age who pay taxes. The duke has considerable powers of initiative and veto. The
                    government is carried on by a ministry of three members, of whom two administer
                    justice and finance respectively, and the third all the other departments of
                    home and foreign affairs. The budget for 1884-86 estimated the yearly income at
                    £127,180 and the yearly expenditure at £125,530. The Altenburg troops are united
                    with the contingents of Schwarzburg, Rudolstadt, and the two Reusses to form the
                    7th Thuringian infantry regiment of the imperial army. Saxe-Altenburg has one
                    vote in the Reichstag and one in the federal council.</p>
                <p>After the conquest of the Wends, the present Altenburg district became an
                    imperial possession, lying partly in the Pleissengau and partly in the
                    Voigtland, while the west district was divided among a number of small nobles.
                    The margrave of Saxony obtained permanent possession of Altenburg about 1329,
                    and the west division was also early incorporated with his dominions. Both
                    districts were among the lands assigned to the Ernestine line of the house of
                    Saxony by the convention of Wittenberg in 1547 (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Saxony).</hi> From 1603 till 1672 there existed an independent duchy of
                    Altenburg; but in 1826, when the present division into the four Saxon duchies
                    was made, both Altenburg and Eisenburg belonged to Gotha. Duke Frederick, who
                    exchanged Saxe-Hildburghausen for the present duchy of Saxe-Altenburg in 1826,
                    was the founder of the reigning line. A constitution was granted in 1831 in
                    answer to popular commotion; and greater concessions were extorted by more
                    threatening disturbances in 1848. The second duke (Joseph) abdicated in 1848 in
                    favour of his brother George. Under Ernest, who succeeded his father as fourth
                    duke in 1853, a period of violent reaction set in, so that even now the
                    constitution is considerably less liberal than it was in 1849. In 1873 the
                    long-disputed question as to the public domains was settled, two-thirds of these
                    being now regarded as belonging to the duke in <hi rend="italic"
                        >fideicommissum</hi> and in lieu of a civil list.</p>
