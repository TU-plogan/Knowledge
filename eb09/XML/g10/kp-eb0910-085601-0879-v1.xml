                    (1700-1766), a German author and critic of considerable influence in his own
                    time, was born, 2d February 1700, at Judithenkirch, near Königsberg. He studied
                    philosophy and literature at Königsberg, was appointed professor, first of
                    poetry (1730), afterwards of logic and metaphysics (1734), at Leipsic, filled
                    various other important offices in connexion with the university, and died 12th
                    December 1766. His chief works were a tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">Der
                        sterbende</hi><hi rend="italic">Cato</hi> (Leipsic, 1732) —poor enough
                    rubbish, though it had great but shortlived popularity; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Deutsche Schaubühne</hi> (1740-45), a collection of plays, some of which
                    were written by himself, his wife, J. C. Schlegel, and their friends, whilst
                    others were translated from the French classical dramatists; <hi rend="italic"
                        >Xothiger</hi><hi rend="italic">Vorrath zur Gesichte der deutschen
                        dramatischen Dichtkunst</hi> (1757-1765), intended to contain an account of
                    all previous German plays Though not complete, the last is a very valuable and
                    important work. Besides these, Gottsched wrote a number of educational works,
                    and edited several journals devoted to literary criticism. He was a pedant, but
                    there is no doubt that he did good and lasting service to German literature.
                    When he began to write, the stage was occupied by plays in which extravagant
                    rant did duty for eloquence, coarse vulgarity for wit, and the wildest
                    improbabilities for inventive incident. In the writings of the second Silesian
                    school the utmost extent of absurdity was reached. Gottsched set his face
                    against such productions. He enunciated rules by which the playwright must be
                    bound; he insisted on the observance of the dramatic unities, and pointed to the
                    French drama as the best possible model for the German stage; moreover, his
                    criticism did much to regulate and purify the German language. Unfortunately he
                    went too far. He placed himself in opposition to the Swiss writers Bodmer and
                    Breitinger, who were bringing before the German public several of the great
                    English writers, more especially Milton; he refused to recognize the rising
                    genius of Klopstock and Lessing, and still went on enunciating rules when the
                    time for that was past, and praising mediocre writers as if they had been great
                    geniuses. So it came to pass that his influence speedily declined, and that
                    before his death his name became almost proverbial for pedantic folly. Of all
                    lots his was the hardest, for he outlived his own reputation. His wife, Luise
                    Adelgunde Victorie Kulmus (1713— 1762), was his faithful helper in his literary
                    labours, and herself an authoress of reputation. Among other works she
                    translated the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> (9 vols., 1739-43) and Pope’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Raf)e of the Lock</hi> (1744, new ed. 1772). After her
                    death her husband edited her <hi rend="italic">Gedichte,</hi> with a memoir
                    (1763). See DanzeΓs <hi rend="italic">Gottsched und</hi><hi rend="italic"
