                    (1712-1769), an Italian writer on philosophy and political economy, was born in
                    November 1712, at Castiglione, near Salerno. At an early age he was destined by
                    his father for the church and began the study of philosophy and theology. He
                    distinguished himself highly by his acuteness and diligence, and after some
                    struggles, caused by his disinclination for an ecclesiastical life, he took
                    orders at Salerno in 1736. He had not been long in this position when the
                    archbishop of the town, recognizing his rare abilities, nominated him to the
                    chair of rhetoric in the theological seminary. During this period of his life
                    Genovesi began the study of philosophy as it existed outside the limits of
                    theology. He read with eagerness the works of the chief modern philosophers, and
                    was particularly attracted by Locke.</p>
                <p>Apparently still dissatisfied with ecclesiastical life, Genovesi, resigning his
                    post at Salerno, proceeded to Rome, undertook the study of law, and qualified as
                    an advocate. The details of legal practice, however, proved as distasteful as
                    theology, and for some years he gave himself entirely to the study of
                    philosophy, attending most of the distinguished lecturers at the university of
                    Naples. At this place, after having obtained the appointment of extraordinary
                    professor of philosophy, he opened a seminary or private college for students.
                    His reputation as a teacher was increased by the publication in 1743 of the
                    first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Metaphysics,</hi> and in 1745
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Logic.</hi> Both works are imbued with the spirit and
                    principles of the empirical school of philosophy, and the latter, an eminently
                    practical treatise, had long a recognized position as one of the best logical
                    text-books written from the point of view of Locke. On account of the
                    accusations of infidelity and heresy naturally excited by his discussion of
                    metaphysical principles, he had some difficulty . in obtaining the professorship
                    of moral philosophy, and failed to be appointed to the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0170-0159"/> chair of theology; but this did not prevent
                    him from following out his philosophical studies. He published a continuation of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Elements of Metaphysics',</hi> but with every new volume
                    he experienced fresh opposition from the partisans of scholastic routine. Among
                    these were Cardinal Spinelli, archbishop of Naples, and an Abbé Magli, whom
                    Genovesi covered with ridicule in his work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lettere</hi><hi rend="italic">ad un</hi><hi rend="italic">Amico</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Provinciale.</hi> In spite of this, Genovesi obtained the
                    approbation of Pope Benedict XIV., of several cardinals, and of most of the
                    learned men of Italy. Of this number was Intieri, a Florentine, who founded at
                    his own expense, in the university of Naples, the first Italian chair of
                    political economy, under three conditions—namely, that the lectures should be in
                    Italian, that Genovesi should be the first professor, and that, after his death,
                    no ecclesiastic should succeed him.</p>
                <p>Genovesi commenced his first course of lectures on the 5th of November 1754 with
                    great success,—the novelty and the interest of the subject, and the eloquent
                    style and agreeable manner of the professor, attracting a crowd of auditors. He
                    afterwards published his <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Commerce,</hi> and
                    Carey’s <hi rend="italic">Account of the Trade of England,</hi> translated into
                    Italian by his brother, with notes by himself. The <hi rend="italic">Lezioni
                        di</hi><hi rend="italic">Commercio</hi> is the first complete and systematic
                    work in Italian on the science which Italians have done much to advance. On the
                    whole it is to be included among works of the Mercantile school, but in
                    treatment of fundamental problems, such as labour and money, it is distinguished
                    by fairness and breadth of view. Specially noteworthy are the sections on human
                    wants as foundation of economical theory, on labour as the source of wealth, on
                    personal services as economic factors, and on the united working of the great
                    industrial functions. Gioja’s more important treatise owes much to Genovesi’s
                    lectures.</p>
                <p>Till his death in 1769 Genovesi continued his labours at the university of
                    Naples, which owes much of its celebrity to the solidity and excellence of his
                    teaching. It cannot be said that Genovesi takes a high rank in philosophy, but
                    he did much to introduce into Italy the new order of ideas, and his exposition
                    of philosophical doctrines is fair and lucid. His work on <hi rend="italic"
                        >Metaphysics,</hi> divided into the four rubrics, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ontosophy, Cosmosophy, Theosophy, Psychosophy,</hi> distinguished by its
                    solid erudition, is an excellent specimen of the precritical or dogmatic method
                    of handling speculative problems. His merits in political economy have been
                    indicated above. (For list of works see Fabroni’s <hi rend="italic"
