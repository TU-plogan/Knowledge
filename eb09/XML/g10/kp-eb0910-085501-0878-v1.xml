                    prominent figure in one of the most important theological controversies of the
                    9th century, was the son of Berno, a Saxon count, and, having been devoted
                    (oblatus) from infancy by his parents to the monastic life, was trained at the
                    monastery of Fulda, during the abbacy of Hrabanus Maurus, and while Walafridus
                    Strabus was a member of the fraternity. At the approach of manhood he made
                    strenuous efforts to be released from his vows; and he actually succeeded in
                    obtaining from a synod held at Mainz in 829 the necessary dispensation; but
                    through the hostile influence of his abbot this was afterwards cancelled by
                    Louis the Pious, though as a slight mitigation of the harshness of this
                    treatment he was permitted to remove to the monastery of Orbais, in the diocese
                    of Soissons. Here he devoted himself to ardent study of the writings of
                    Augustine, with the result that he became an enthusiastic believer in the
                    doctrine of absolute predestination, in one point going even beyond his
                    master—Gottschalk believing in a predestination to condemnation as well as in a
                    predestination to salvation, while Augustine had contented himself with a
                    doctrine of preterition as complementary to his doctrine of election. While
                    returning from a pilgrimage to Rome in the year 847, Gottschalk, happening to
                    pass a night at a hospice in Friuli, came into contact with Notting, the newly
                    elected bishop of Verona, and expounded to him his peculiar views. The bishop,
                    apparently without saying much at the time, carried word to Hrabanus Maurus,
                    who, meanwhile, had become archbishop of Mainz; the latter lost no time in
                    issuing two letters, one to his informant and another to Count Eberhard of
                    Friuli, in both which he denounced the opinions of Gottschalk with some
                    recklessness and great violence. On the one hand, he accused his adversary of
                    neglecting the distinction between foreknowledge and foreordination; on the
                    other hand, he himself refused to recognize any difference between
                    predestination to punishment and predestination to sin. At a synod held in Mainz
                    in presence of the emperor in 848, Gottschalk presented himself with a written
                    explanation and defence of his views; he was, however, very summarily found
                    guilty of heresy, and handed over to his ecclesiastical superior, Hincmar of
                    Rheims, to be dealt with as his crime might deserve. Having again assumed the
                    defensive in an assembly at Chiersy in 849, he was once more condemned, —on this
                    occasion not only as a heretic, but also as a despiser of authority, and as a
                    disturber of the church’s peace, —and sentenced to be whipped severely and
                    rigorously imprisoned (durissimis verberibus castigari et secundum
                    ecclesiasticas regulas ergastulo retrudi). The place selected for his captivity
                    was the monastery of Hautvilliers in the diocese of Rheims, and here he
                    languished throughout the remainder of his life, a period of twenty years,
                    notwithstanding the efforts of influential friends and his own pitiful appeals.
                    Prudentius of Troyes, Wenilo of Sens, and Florus of Lyons successively expressed
                    opinions more or less in favour of his views; nor did Hincmar derive much real
                    aid from the dialectical skill of Erigena, whom he had called in as an authority
                    on the other side. Various synods met, reached widely discrepant opinions on the
                    burning question, and ultimately postponed its settlement to a future council in
                    less troubled times. The summons of Pope Nicholas I., in 863, calling Hincmar to
                    account for his harsh conduct, unfortunately never took effect; and the result
                    was that, after many renewed attempts at conviction and persuasion on the part
                    of Gottschalk—he even proposed to settle the question by ordeal of fire—he was
                    suffered to die unheeded in 868, and, by orders of his inhuman adversary, was
                    buried in unconsecrated ground. It may be added that Gottschalk had attempted to
                    establish a counter charge of heresy against Hincmar, on account of the latter’s
                    substitution <pb break="no"

                    current hymn. This was thought to savour of Sabellianism; but the orthodox
                    archbishop succeeded at once in purging himself from such an imputation of
                    heretical pravity.</p>
