                    (1783-1817), Sweden’s greatest historian, was born at Ransäter in Värmland,
                    January 12, 1783, of a family that had immigrated from Austria iu the time of
                    Gustavus Adolphus. At sixteen he left Carlstad gymnasium for the university of

                    others, whose simplicity and earnestness, warm feeling, and strong patriotic
                    spirit are dearer to his nation for fine melodies to which he set them. About
                    the same time he issued a volume of hymns (1812), of which several are inserted
                    in the Swedish Psalter. Geijer’s lyric muse was soon after silenced by his call
                    to be assistant to Fant, professor of history of Upsala (1815), whom he
                    succeeded in that chair in 1817. In 1824 he was elected to the Swedish Academy.
                    A single volume of a great projected work, <hi rend="italic">Svea Rikes
                        Häfder,</hi> itself a masterly critical examination of the sources of
                    Sweden’s legendary history, appeared in 1825. Geijer’s researches in its
                    preparation had severely strained his health, and he went the same year on a
                    tour through Denmark and part of Germany, his impressions from which are
                    recorded in his <hi rend="italic">Minnen</hi> (1834). In 1832-36 he published
                    three volumes of his <hi rend="italic">Svenskafolkets</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >historia,</hi> a clear view of the political and social development of
                    Sweden down to the close of Queen Christina’s reign. The acute critical insight,
                    just thought, and finished historical art of these two incomplete works of
                    Geijer entitle him to the first place among Swedish historians. His chief other
                    historical and political writings are his <hi rend="italic">Kort teckning αf

                    led to a controversy with the historian Fryxell regarding the part played in
                    history by the Swedish aristocracy. Geijer also edited, with the aid of
                    Schröder, a continuation of Fant’s <hi rend="italic">Scriptores</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">svecicarum</hi><hi rend="italic">medii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >oevi</hi> (1818— 25), and, by himself, Thorild’s <hi rend="italic">Samlade

                    1843-45). Geijer’s academic lectures, of which the last three, published in
                    1845, under the title <hi rend="italic">Cm var tids inre samhaUsforhαllaηdeη, i
                        synnerhet med afseende pa Faderηes-landet,</hi> involved him in another
                    controversy with Fryxell, exercised a great influence over his students, who
                    especially testified to their attachment after the failure of the prosecution
                    for alleged anti-Trinitarian heresies in his <hi rend="italic">Thorild,
                        tillika</hi><hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">philosophisk eller
                        ophilosophisk</hi><hi rend="italic">bekännelse</hi> (1820). A number of his
                    extempore lectures, recovered from notes, were published by Ribbing in 1856.
                    Failing health forced Geijer to resign his chair in 1846, after which he removed
                    to Stockholm for the purpose of completing his <hi rend="italic">Svenska
                        folkets</hi><hi rend="italic">historia,</hi> and died there 23d April 1847.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Samlade skrifter</hi> (13 vols. 1849-55; new ed. 1873-75)
                    include a large number of philosophical and political essays contributed to
                    reviews, particularly to <hi rend="italic">Literal·ivrbladet</hi> (1838-39), a
                    periodical edited by himself, which attracted great attention in its day by its
                    pronounced liberal views on public, questions, a striking contrast to those he
                    had defended in 1828-30, when, as again in 1840-41, he represented Upsala
                    university in the Swedish diet.</p>
                <p>Geijer’s style is strong and manly. His genius bursts out in sudden flashes that
                    light up the dark corners of history. A few strokes, and a personality stands
                    before us instinct with life. His language is at once the scholar’s and the
                    poet’s; with his profoundest thought there beats in unison the warmest, the
                    noblest, the most patriotic heart. Geijer came to the writing of history fresh
                    from researches in the whole field of Scandinavian antiquity, researches whose
                    first-fruits are garnered in numerous articles in <hi rend="italic">Idηna,</hi>
                    and his masterly treatise <hi rend="italic">Cm den gamla nordiska
                        folk-visan,</hi> prefixed to the collection of <hi rend="italic">Svenska
                        folkvisor</hi> which he edited with A. A. Afzelius (3 vols. 1814-16). The
                    development of freedom is the idea that gives unity to all his historical
                    writings. This idea is not subjective; he traces it in the darkest annals of his
                    country. Sweden, he repeats, is the only European land that has not been trod by
                    foreign armies, that has never accepted the yoke of serfdom. There, on the
                    whole, the king has ever been the people’s faithfullest ally, and all his great
                    designs for the country’s external and internal gain have been carried out “by
                    the help of God and Sweden.” Throughout life Geijer was what he professed to be,
                    a seeker; and to no philosophic system did he yield absolute allegiance. Yet his
                    writings mark a new era in Swedish history, the rise of a “critical school”
                    whose aim is to draw the truth without distortion, and present reality without a
                    foil.</p>
