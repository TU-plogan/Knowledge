                    (1646-1715), Orientalist and archaeologist, the first European translator of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Arabian Nights,</hi> was born in 1646 at Rollot, in the
                    department of Somme. The completion of his school education at Noyon wa3
                    followed by a brief apprenticeship to a trade, from which, however, he soon
                    escaped, to pursue his linguistic studies at Paris. After having been employed
                    for some time in making a catalogue of the Oriental manuscripts at the Sorbonne,
                    he was, in 1670, attached to the French embassy at Constantinople; and in 1673
                    he also accompanied his chief (De Nointel) to Syria and the Levant, where he
                    availed himself of the opportunity to copy a great number of inscriptions, and
                    also to sketch, in some cases even to remove, historical monuments. After a
                    brief visit to France, where his collection of antiquities attracted some
                    attention, Galland returned to the Levant in 1676; and in 1679 he undertook a
                    third voyage, being commissioned by the French East India Company to collect for
                    the cabinet of Colbert; on the expiry of this commission he was instructed by
                    the Government to continue his researches, and had the title of “antiquary to
                    the king” conferred upon him. During his prolonged residences abroad he acquired
                    a thorough knowledge of the Arabic, Turkish, and Persian languages and
                    literatures, which, on his final return to France, enabled him to render
                    valuable assistance to Thevenot, the keeper of the royal library, and to
                    D’Herbelot. After their deaths he lived for some time at Caen under the roof of
                    Foucault the intendant, himself no mean archaeologist; and there he began the
                    publication (1704-17) of <hi rend="italic">Les Mille et Une Nuits,</hi> a
