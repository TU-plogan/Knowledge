                    (1583-1625), like Johann Sebastian Bach, was the most illustrious of a family of
                    musicians all more or less able. We know of at least three generations of
                    musical Gibbons, for Orlando’s father, William Gibbons, having been one of the
                    waits of Cambridge, may be assumed to have acquired some proficiency in the art.
                    His three sons and at least one of his grandsons inherited and further developed
                    his talent. The eldest, Edward, was made bachelor of music at Cambridge, and
                    successively held important musical appointments at the cathedrals of Bristol
                    and Exeter; Ellis, the second son, was organist of Salisbury Cathedral, and is
                    the composer of two madrigals in the collection known as the <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Triumphs of</hi><hi rend="italic">Oriana.</hi> Orlando Gibbons, the
                    youngest and by far the most celebrated of the brothers, was born at Cambridge
                    in 1583. Where and under whom he studied is not known, but in his twenty-first
                    year he was sufficiently advanced and celebrated to receive the important post
                    of organist of the Chapel Royal. His first published composition “Fantasies in
                    three parts, composed for viols,” appeared in 1610. It seems to have been the
                    first piece of music printed in England from engraved plates, or “cut in copper,
                    the like not heretofore extant.” In 1622 he was created doctor of music by the
                    university of Oxford. For this occasion he composed an anthem for eight parts,
                        <hi rend="italic">0 clap your Hands,</hi> still extant. In the following
                    year he became organist of Westminster Abbey. Orlando Gibbons died before the
                    beginning of the civil war, or it may be supposed that, like his eldest brother,
                    he would have been a staunch royalist. In a different sense, however, he died in
                    the cause of his master; for having been summoned to Canterbury to produce a
                    composition written in celebration of Charles’s marriage, he there fell a victim
                    to small-pox on June 5, 1625. Of his life very little is known, but that little
                    is well summed up in the article contributed by Mr W. H. Husk to Dr Grove’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Dictionary of Music and Musicians,</hi> where a complete list
                    of his compositions is also given. His portrait may be found in Hawkins’s
                    well-known <hi rend="italic">History.</hi> The works of Gibbons may be divided
                    into secular and sacred compositions, the latter being by far the most important
                    portion. His vocal pieces, madrigals, motets, canons, songs, &amp;c., are
                    admirable specimens of part-writing, and prove him to have been a perfect master
                    of polyphonous treatment. Many of them are for five voices, a very common number
                    in those days; but pieces for four and for six voices also are by no means rare.
                    To the first-named class belong a <hi rend="italic">Te</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Deum</hi> in D minor, two sets of <hi rend="italic">Preces</hi> and other
                    compositions for church service, also most of the madrigals. We have also some
                    specimens of his instrumental music, such as the six pieces for the virginals
                    published in <hi rend="italic">Parthenia,</hi> a collection of instrumental
                    music produced by Gibbons in conjunction with Dr Bull and Byrd.</p>
