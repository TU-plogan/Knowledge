                <p><label type="entry">GOETZ, <hi rend="smallcaps">Hermann</hi></label> (1840-1876),
                    a musical composer, presents one of those instances, too frequent in the history
                    of art, of success long sought for, and cut short by death when achieved at
                    last. He was born at Königsburg in Prussia in 1840, and began his regular
                    musical studies at the comparatively advanced age of seventeen. He entered the
                    music-school of Professor Stern at Berlin, and studied composition chiefly under
                    Ulrich and Hans von Bülow. In 1863 he was appointed organist at Winterthur in
                    Switzerland, where he lived in obscurity for a number of years, occupying
                    himself with composition during his leisure hours. One of his works was an
                    opera, <hi rend="italic">The Taming of the Shrew,</hi> the libretto skilfully
                    adapted from Shakespeare’s play. After much delay it was produced at Mannheim
                    (October 1874), and its success was as instantaneous as it has up to the present
                    proved lasting. It rapidly made the round of the great German theatres, and
                    spread its composer’s fame over all the land. But Goetz did not live to enjoy
                    this happy result for long. In December 1876 he died at Zurich from overwork. A
                    second opera, <hi rend="italic">Francesca da Rimini,</hi> on which he was
                    engaged at the time of his death, remained a fragment; but it has since been
                    finished according to his directions by a friend,. and was performed for the
                    first time at Mannheim a few months after the composer’s death. Besides his
                    dramatic work, Goetz also wrote various compositions for chambermusic, of which
                    a trio (Op. 1) and a quintet (Op. 16) have been given with great success at the
                    London Monday Popular Concerts. Still more important is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Symphony in F,</hi> on which the composer’s great reputation in England is
                    mainly founded. As a composer of comic opera Goetz lacks the sprightliness and
                    artistic <hi rend="italic">savoir faire</hi> so rarely found amongst Germanic
                    nations. His was essentially a serious nature, and passion and pathos were to
                    him more congenial than humour. The more serious sides of the subject are

                    Petruchio’s eccentricities. There are, however, very graceful passages, <hi

                    disguised lover. Goetz’s style, although influenced by Wagner and other masters,
                    shows signs of a distinct individuality. The design of his music is essentially
                    of a polyphonous character, and the working out and interweaving of his themes
                    betray the musician of high scholarship. But breadth and beautiful flow of
                    melody also were his, as is seen in the symphony, and perhaps still more in the
                    quintet for pianoforte and strings above <pb break="no"

                    posthumous works are a setting of the 137th Psalm for soprano solo, chorus, and
                    orchestra, a “Spring” overture (Op. 15), and a pianoforte sonata for four hands
                    (Op. 17).</p>
