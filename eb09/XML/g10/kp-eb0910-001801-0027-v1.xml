                <p><label type="entry">GALASHIELS</label>, a parliamentary burgh and manufacturing
                    town of Scotland, built on both sides of the river Gala, about a mile above its
                    confluence with the Tweed, and 33 miles south of Edinburgh. It is situated
                    partly in Roxburghshire and partly in Selkirkshire, but for all judicial
                    purposes it is held, by special Act of Parliament passed in 1867, as entirely
                    within the county of Selkirk. The “forest-steading of Galashiels” is first
                    mentioned in history shortly after the beginning of the 15th century, when it
                    was the occasional residence of the Douglases, who at that time held the office
                    of keeper of Ettrick forest. In 1599 it was erected into a burgh of barony, when
                    it contained 400 inhabitants. For the next 200 years Galashiels remained a mere
                    village, as the population in 1778 had only grown to 600. At that time, however,
                    we find its inhabitants engaged—though in a limited way—in those manufactures by
                    which it has since so greatly prospered. There were 30 looms and 3 waulk (or
                    fulling) mills; and the cloth manufactured was a coarse woollen texture which
                    sold at from Is. 6d. to 2s. a yard. In 1790 the quantity of wool used annually
                    was 2916 stones, and the value of goods manufactured was about £1000. In the
                    same year the first factory was erected, and advantage taken of the Gala wäter
                    as a motive power; and from this time forward the woollen trade in Galashiels
                    underwent steady progress, until, in 1879, the town contains about 20 factories
                    with 100 sets of carding engines, using annually 220,000 stones of wool, and
                    producing goods to the value of £750,000.</p>
                <p>The wool chiefly used is imported from Australia and the Cape of Good Hope. The
                    manufacture was at one time of a more diversified character than now, and
                    embraced tweeds, shawls, tartans, &amp;c., but it is now almost exclusively
                    devoted to the production of tweeds. The Galashiels manufacturers have long been
                    united in a corporation called by their name, which was instituted in 1777, and
                    of which the minutes during the whole intervening period are still preserved. In
                    addition to its woollen trade Galashiels has also a large skinnery, capable of
                    manufacturing into leather 35,000 skins per week. In recent years the external
                    aspect of the town has been very much improved by the erection of several
                    handsome public buildings, and the introduction of a better style of
                    architecture for shops and dwelling-houses. It was made a parliamentary burgh in
                    1868, and unites with Hawick and Selkirk in returning a member to parliament.
                    Municipally, it is governed by a provost, four bailies, and ten councillors. In
                    1876 an Act was passed for the extension of the burgh and the introduction
                    (since effected) of a water supply. As significant of the rapid growth of
                    Galashiels it may be mentioned that, while in 1851 the population was only 5921,
                    in 1871 it was 9678, and that of the extended burgh is now estimated to be
                    nearly 15,000; while the annual assessable rental, which in 1864 was £21,000, is
                    now £49,000.</p>
