                <p><label type="entry">GANJAM</label>, a district of Madras, situated between 18°
                    18' and 19° 40' 30" N. lat., and between 83° 51' 30" and 85° 10' 30" E. long,
                    bounded on the N. by Puri district in Orissa; on the E. by the Bay of Bengal, on
                    the S. by Vizagapatam district, and on the W. by the estates of Kalahandi,
                    Patnâ, and Jâipur. The district is exceedingly mountainous and rocky, but is
                    interspersed with open valleys and fertile plains. Pleasant groves of trees in
                    the plains give to the scenery a greener and less Indian appearance than is
                    usually met with in the districts to the south. The mountainous tract known as
                    the Mâliyâs, or chain of the eastern <hi rend="italic">ghats,</hi> has an
                    average height of about 2000 feet, —its principal peaks being Singhârâj (4,976
                    feet), Mahen-dragiri (4923), and Deodanga (4534). The chief rivers are the
                    Rushikuliyâ (with its tributary the Mahânadi), the Vamsadâri, and the Lânguliyâ;
                    besides numerous mountain streams and torrents. The sea and river fisheries
                    afford a livelihood to a considerable section of the population. The hilly
                    region abounds in forests consisting principally of <hi rend="italic">säl,</hi>
                    with satin-wood, ebony, and sandal-wood in smaller quantities. The district
                    abounds in game both large and small.</p>
                <p>Ganjam formed part of the ancient kingdom of Kalinga. Its early history is
                    involved in obscurity, and it was not till after the Gajapati dynasty ascended
                    the throne of Orissa, that this tract became even nominally a part of their
                    dominions. Owing to the nature of the country, the rising Mahometan power was
                    long kept at bay; and it was not till nearly a century after the first invasion
                    of Orissa that a Mahometan governor was sent to govern the Chikakol Sarkârs,
                    which included the present district of Ganjam. In 1753 Chikakol, with the
                    Northern Sarkârs, were made over to the French by Salabat Jang for the
                    maintenance of his French auxiliaries. In 1759 Masulipatam was taken by an
                    English force sent from Bengal, and the French were compelled to abandon Ganjam
                    and their other factories in the north. In 1765 the Northern Sarkârs (including
                    Ganjam) were granted to the English by imperial firman, and in August 1768 an
                    English factory was founded at Ganjam, protected by a fort. The present district
                    of Ganjam was constituted in 1802. In the earlier years of British rule
                    considerable difficulty was experienced in administering the district. The
                    country was continually in a state of confusion and disturbance; and on more
                    than one occasion, the refractory large lan ’.holders had to be coerced by means
                    of regular troops. In 1816 Ganjam was overrun by the Pindâris; and in 1836
                    occurred the Gùmsur campaign, when the British first came into contact with the
                    aboriginal Kandhs, the suppression of whose practice of human sacrifice was
                    successfully accomplished. A petty rising of a section of the Kandhs occurred in
                    1865, which was, however, suppressed without the aid of regular troops.</p>
                <p>The census of 1872 gives the area at 8500 square miles, including 3359 square
                    miles occupied by the Mâliyâ or mountain region, and the population at 779,112
                    males and 740,976 females,—total, 1,520,088 (with 4562 villages, and 341,404
                    houses), classified thus according to religion Hindus, 1,513,673; Mahometans,
                    4826; Christians, 1043; Buddhists or Jains, 45; “others,” 501. The <pb

                    inhabiting the mountains. Of the plains population two-thirds are estimated as
                    belonging to the Urugâ race, the remainder being mostly Telegus. Of the plains
                    country, with an area of 5141 square miles, or 3,290,240 acres, about one-third
                    is under cultivation, one-third cultivable, and one-third waste. A considerable
                    extent of land is under cultivation in the Maliyas, but no revenue is derived
                    from this tract. Rice forms the staple product, and is largely exported. The
                    other crops are cereals of various sorts, pulses and oilseeds, fibres, sugarcane
                    (said to be the best in India), tobacco, indigo, chilies, &amp;c. Holdings are
                    small, and the peasantry are generally poor and in debt to the village
                    money-lender. Five towns contain a population exceeding 5000 :—Berhampur,
                    21,670; Parla Kimidi, 15,958; Chikakol, 15,587; Bâruvâ, 6739; Takkali
                    Raghunandapuram, 5206. Ganjam town, the former administrative headquarters of
                    the district, has a population of only 4163. The means of internal communication
                    consist of 661 miles of road in the plains, and 323 miles of hill roads, besides
                    a short tidal canal 9 miles long, connecting the Chilkâ lake with the
                    Rushikuliyâ river. Salt manufacture is a Government monopoly, yielding about
                    £200,000 annually. The revenue has rapidly increased of late years, having
                    advanced from £216,196 in 1860-61 to £338,705 in 1875-76. The chief receipts are
                    the salt and land revenue, which yielded £196,396 and £117,348 respectively in
                    1875-76. The expense of administering the district amounted to £23,970 in
                    1860-δl, and to £28,123 in 1875-76. For the protection of person and property
                    there were, in 1875-76, 27 magisterial and 13 civil and revenue courts. Murder
                    is unusually prevalent in Ganjam, no less than 26 caseshaving occurred in 1875.
                    Education is backward, only about 3 ’ 3 per cent, of the population of the
                    plains being able to read and write. In 1875 there were 334 Government or aided
                    schools in the plains, attended by 6909 pupils, besides 17 schools in the hills,
                    with 860 pupils.</p>
