                <p><label type="entry">GIORDANO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Luca</hi></label> (1632-1705),
                    a painter of great immediate celebrity, was born in Naples, son of a very
                    indifferent painter, Antonio, who imparted to him the first rudiments of
                    drawing. Nature predestined him for the art, and at the age of eight he painted
                    a cherub into one of his father’s pictures, a feat which was at once noised
                    abroad, and which induced the viceroy of Naples to recommend the child to
                    Spagnoletto. His father afterwards took him to Rome, to study under Pietro da
                    Cortona. He acquired the nickname of Luca Fa-presto (Luke Work-fast). One might
                    suppose this nickname to be derived merely from the almost miraculous celerity
                    with which from an early age and throughout his life he handled the brush; but

                    we are told, poverty-stricken and greedy of gain, was perpetually urging his boy
                    to exertion with the phrase, “Luca, fà presto.” The youth obeyed his parent to
                    the letter, and would actually not so much as pause to snatch a hasty meal, but
                    received into his mouth, while he still worked on, the food which his father’s
                    hand supplied. He copied nearly twenty times the Battle of Constantine by Julio
                    Romano, and with proportionate frequency several of the great works of Raphael
                    and Michelangelo. His rapidity, which belonged as much to invention as to mere
                    handiwork, and his versatility, which enabled him to imitate other painters
                    deceptively, earned for him two other epithets, “The Thunderbolt” (Fulmine), and
                    “The Proteus,” of Painting. He shortly visited all the main seats of the Italian
                    school of art, and formed for himself a style combining in a certain measure the
                    ornamental pomp of Paul Veronese and the contrasting compositions and large
                    schemes of chiaroscuro of Pietro da Cortona. He was noted also for lively and
                    showy colour. Returning to Naples, and accepting every sort of commission by
                    which money was to be made, he practised his art with so much applause that
                    Charles II. of Spain towards 1687 invited him over to Madrid, where he remained
                    thirteen years. Giordano was very popular at the Spanish court, being a
                    sprightly talker along with his other marvellously facile gifts, and the king
                    created him a cavalière. One anecdote of his rapidity of work is that the queen
                    of Spain having one day made some inquiry about his wife, he at once showed Her
                    Majesty what the lady was like by painting her portrait into the picture on
                    which he was engaged. After the death of Charles in 1700 Giordano, gorged with
                    wealth, returned to Naples. He spent large sums in acts of munificence, and was
                    particularly liberal to his poorer brethren of the art. He again visited various
                    parts of Italy, and died in Naples on 12th January 1705, his last words being “0
                    Napoli, sospiro mio” (0 Naples, my heart’s love !). One of his maxims was that
                    the good painter is the one whom the public like, and that the public are
                    attracted more by colour than by design.</p>
                <p>At the present day, when the question is not how quickly Giordano could do his
                    work, but what the work itself amounts to, his reputation has run down like the
                    drops of heavy rain off a window, or like one of the figures in his own
                    paintings, in which he was wont to use an excessive quantity of oil. His
                    astonishing readiness and facility must, however, be recognized, spite of the
                    general commonness and superficiality of his performances. He left many works in
                    Rome, and far more in Naples. Of the latter one of the most renowned is Christ
                    expelling the Traders from the Temple, in the church of the Padri Girolamini, a
                    colossal work, full of expressive lazzaroni; also the frescos of S. Martino, and
                    those in the Tesoro della Certosa, including the subject of Moses and the Brazen
                    Serpent; and the cupola-paintings in the Church of S. Brigida, which contains
                    the artist’s own tomb. In Spain he executed a surprising number of
                    works,—continuing in the Escorial the series commenced by Cambiasi, and painting
                    frescos of the Triumphs of the Church, the Genealogy and Life of the Madonna,
                    the stories of Moses, Gideon, David, and Solomon, and the Celebrated Women of
                    Scripture, all works of large dimensions. His pupils, Aniello Rossi and Matteo
                    Pacelli, assisted him in Spain. In Madrid he worked more in oilcolour, a
                    Nativity there being one of his best productions. Another superior example is
                    the Judgment of Paris in the Berlin Museum. In Florence, in his closing days, he
                    painted the Cappella Corsini, 'the Galleria Riccardi, and other works. In youth
                    he etched with considerable skill some of his own paintings, such as the
                    Slaughter of the Priests, of Baal. He also painted much on the crystal
                    borderings of looking-glasses, cabinets, &amp;c., seen in many Italian palaces,
                    and was, in this form of art, the master of Pietro Garofolo. His best pupil, in
                    painting of the ordinary kind, was Paolo de Matteis.</p>
