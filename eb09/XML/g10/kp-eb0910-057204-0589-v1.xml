                <p><label type="entry">GIB, <hi rend="smallcaps">Adam</hi></label> (1714-1788), the
                    leader of the Antiburgher section of the Scottish Secession Church, was born
                    April 14, 1714, in the parish of Muckhart, Perthshire, and, on the completion of
                    his literary and theological studies at Edinburgh and Perth, was licensed as a
                    preacher in 1740. In the following year he was ordained minister of the large
                    Secession congregation of Bristo, Edinburgh, being the first in the city
                    inducted into such a charge; and there his powerful intellect and his intensity
                    of character soon secured for him a position of considerable prominence. In 1742
                    he caused some stir by the publication of an invective entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">A learning against countenancing the ministrations of Mr
                        George Whitefield',</hi> and in 1745 he was almost the only minister of
                    Edinburgh who continued to preach, and to preach against rebellion, while the
                    troops of Charles Edward were in occupation of the town. When in 1747 “the
                    Associate Synod,” by a narrow majority, decided not to give full immediate
                    effect to a judgment which had been passed in the previous year against the
                    lawfulness of the “Burgess Oath,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>This was an oath imposed upon all burgesses of
                            Edinburgh, Glasgow, Perth, and some other towns, by which they
                            “professed and allowed the true religion presently professed within this
                            realm, and authorized by the laws thereof.” The question was whether
                            these words implied an approbation of the Established Church, with all
                            its “corruptions.”</p></note> Gib led the protesting minority, who
                    forthwith separated from their brethren and formed the Antiburgher Synod. It was
                    chiefly under his influence that it was agreed by this ecclesiastical body at
                    subsequent meetings to summon to the bar their “Burgher” brethren, and finally
                    to depose and excommunicate them for contumacy. In 1765 he made a vigorous and
                    able reply to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, which had
                    stigmatized the Secession as “threatening the peace of the country ;” and this
                    apology was further developed in his <hi rend="italic">Display of the Secession
                        Testimony,</hi> published in 1774. From 1753 (when after protracted
                    litigation he was compelled to leave the Bristo church) till within a short
                    period of his death, which took place June 18, 1788, he preached regularly in
                    Nicolson Street church, which is said to have been filled every Sunday with an
                    audience of 2000 persons. Besides other publications, he wrote a volume of <hi
                        rend="italic">Sacred Contemplations</hi> (1786), to which was appended an
                    “Essay on Liberty and Necessity” in reply to Lord Kames.</p>
