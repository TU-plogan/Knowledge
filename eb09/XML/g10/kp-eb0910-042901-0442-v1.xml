                <p><label type="entry">GEORGE <hi rend="smallcaps">of Cappadocia</hi></label>, who
                    from 356 to 361 was Arian archbishop of Alexandria, was born about the beginning
                    of the 4th century. According to Ammianus (xxii. 11), he was a native of
                    Epiphania, in Cilicia; but universal tradition makes him a Cappadocian. Gregory
                    Nazianzen tells us that his father was a fuller, and that he himself soon became
                    notorious as a parasite of so mean a type that he would “sell himself for a
                    cake.” By his powers of insinuation he succeeded in obtaining a lucrative
                    contract for sup plying bacon to the army, but fulfilled its terms so ill that
                    he was soon compelled to abscond after he had with difficulty escaped death at
                    the hands of the indignant soldiers. After many wanderings, in the course of
                    which he seems to have lived for some time at Constantinople, and to have
                    amassed a considerable fortune as receiver of taxes, he ultimately reached
                    Alexandria. It is not known how or when he obtained ecclesiastical orders; but,
                    after Athanasius had been banished in 356, George was promoted by the influence
                    of the then prevalent Arian faction to the vacant see. His persecutions and
                    oppressions of the orthodox ultimately raised a rebellion which compelled him to
                    flee for his life; but his authority was restored, although with difficulty, by
                    a military demonstration. Untaught by experience he resumed his course of
                    selfish tyranny over Christians and heathen alike, and raised the irritation of
                    the populace to such a pitch that, within a few days after the accession of
                    Julian, they rose <hi rend="italic">en</hi><hi rend="italic">masse,</hi> dragged
                    him out of prison, where he had been placed by the magistrates for safety,
                    paraded him with every indignity through the streets on the back of a camel,
