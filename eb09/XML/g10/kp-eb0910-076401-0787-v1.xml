                    (1821-1872), an eminent Sanskrit scholar, was born of Jewish parents at
                    Königsberg on the 18th of January 1821, and, after passing through a prolonged
                    course of study at the gymnasium, entered the university in 1836, where he
                    attended the lectures of Lobeck, Rosenkranz, and Von Bohlen, under the last of
                    whom he began the study of Sanskrit. In 1838 he removed to Bonn, where he heard
                    W. von Schlegel, Lassen, and <pb break="no"

                    in 1840, lie proceeded to Paris, where he heard the lectures and enjoyed the
                    friendship of Burnouf, and where in 1842 he edited a German translation of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Prabodha Chandrodaya.</hi> From 1846 to 1850 he resided at
                    Berlin, where his talents and scholarship were recognized by A. von Humboldt; in
                    the latter year he was induced, for the further prosecution of his Sanskrit
                    researches, to remove to London, where in 1851 he was appointed professor of
                    Sanskrit in University College. He now began to devote himself to the execution
                    of a new Sanskrit dictionary, of which the first instalment appeared in 1856. In
                    1861 he published an important monograph, entitled <hi rend="italic">Panini: his
                        Place in Literature</hi>; and from 1866 he was one of the chief promoters of
                    the Sanskrit Text Society, which had been founded in that year; he was also an
                    active member of the Philological Society, and of other learned bodies. His
                    literary productiveness was not, however, proportionate to the extent and
                    accuracy of his reading; he had “allowed his learning to stifle his creative
                    faculty,” and a morbid dread of the risk of making inaccurate or defective
                    statements made him unduly reluctant to communicate to the world the results of
                    his laborious collecting and collating. The dictionary, —so copious as almost to
                    deserve the name of a cyclopaedia of Indian archaeology,—was never advanced
                    further than to about the middle of the first letter (1864); aud whatever else
                    he may have written was published anonymously in various periodicals and works
                    of reference. He died on the 6th of March 1872.</p>
