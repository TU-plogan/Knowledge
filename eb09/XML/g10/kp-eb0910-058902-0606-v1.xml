                        Ludwig</hi></label> (1792-1854), one of the most distinguished of the modern
                    school of scientific writers on church history, was born at Petershagen, near
                    Minden, where his father, a man of considerable vigour and independence of
                    character, was minister, on the 3d of March 1792. In his tenth year he entered
                    the orphanage at Halle, whence he duly passed to the university, his studies
                    being interrupted, however, from October 1813 till the peace of 1815 by a period
                    of military service, during which he was enrolled as a volunteer in a regiment
                    of chasseurs. Having in 1817 taken his degree in philosophy, he in the same year
                    became assistant head master in the Minden gymnasium, and in 1818 was appointed
                    conrector of the gymnasium at Cleves. Here he published his earliest work <hi

                    treatise which has had considerable influence on all subsequent investigations
                    and discussions of the question as to the origin of the gospels, in so far as it
                    may be considered to have finally disposed of that theory of a “primitive”
                    written gospel to which most critics in the earlier part of the century had
                    inclined. In 1819 Gieseler was appointed a professor ordinarius in theology in
                    the newly-founded university of Bonn, where, besides lecturing on church
                    history, he made important contributions to the literature of that subject in

                    part of the first volume of his well-known <hi rend="italic">Church History</hi>
                    appeared in 1824. In 1833 he accepted a call to Göttingen, where the remainder
                    of his life was spent, marked by few noteworthy events beyond the steady
                    publication of volume after volume of his contributions to historical science.
                    In 1837 he was appointed a consistorialrath, and shortly afterwards was created
                    a knight of the Guelphic order. In the winter of 1853-4 symptoms of failing
                    health began to appear, and towards the end of the session he was able to
                    lecture only occasionally. His death occurred on the 8th of July 1854. The
                    fourth and fifth volumes of the <hi rend="italic">Kirchengeschichte,</hi>
                    embracing the period subsequent to 1814, were published posthumously by
                    Redepenning (1855); and they were followed in 1856 by a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dogmengeschichte,</hi> which is sometimes reckoned as the sixth volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Church History.</hi> Among church historians Gieseler
                    continues to hold a very high place. Less vivid and picturesque in style than
                    Hase, conspicuously deficient in Neander’s deep and sympathetic insight into the
                    more spiritual forces by which church life is always more or less pervaded, he
                    excels these and all other contemporaries in the fulness and accuracy of his
                    information. His <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Kirchengeschichte,</hi> in which
                    indeed the text as compared with the notes often occupies a very subordinate
                    place, is invaluable to the student who wishes at each step to be brought into
                    direct contact with all the original sources of information which it is of
                    importance that he should know. The work, which has passed through several
                    editions in Germany, has partially appeared also in two English translations.
                    That published in New York <hi rend="italic">{Text Book of Ecclesiastical
                        History,</hi> 4 vols.), brings the work down to the peace of Westphalia,
                    while that published in “Clark’s Theological Library” <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Compendium of Ecclesiastical History,</hi> Edin., 5 vols.) closes with the
                    beginning of the Reformation. For the life of Gieseler reference may be made to
                    Redepenning’s biographical sketch in the fifth volume of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Kirchengesclιichte,</hi> and to Herzog’s article in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Real-Encycloρadie</hi> (of which great work, it may be mentioned, Gieseler
                    was an energetic promoter). Both biographers testify that with the habits of a
                    devoted student he combined those of an energetic man of business. He frequently
                    held the office of pro-rector of the university, and did much useful work as a
                    member of several of its committees. He took a warm interest also in the
                    Göttingen orphanage, where he was a daily visitor, knew all the children
                    personally, and taught them to regard him as a counsellor and friend.</p>
