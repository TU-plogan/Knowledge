                    (1563-1641), professor of theology at Leyden, was born at Bruges on the 30th
                    January 1563. His parents, having embraced the principles of the Reformation,
                    emigrated to the Palatinate in 1578, in order to enjoy freedom to profess their
                    new faith, and they sent their son to be educated at Strasburg under John
                    Sturmius, He remained there three years and then went to Neustadt, whither the
                    professors of Fleidelberg had been driven by the electorpalatine because they
                    were not Lutherans. He did not stay long at Neustadt, but crossed to England
                    towards the end of the year 1582, and entered first the university of Oxford,
                    where he attended the lectures of John Raynold, and then the university of
                    Cambridge, where he attended those of William Whitaker. At Cambridge he received
                    his bachelor’s degree in June 1584, and thence proceeded to Heidelberg, where
                    the faculty had been by this time reestablished, and continued his studies there
                    for two years more. He was called to be minister of a Reformed church in
                    Frankfort in 1587, and laboured there till the congregation was dispersed by the
                    persecution of the year 1593. In 1594 he was appointed professor of theology at
                    Leyden, and before going thither received from the university of Heidelberg the
                    degree of doctor. He taught quietly at Leyden till 1603, when Arminius came to
                    be one of his colleagues in the theological faculty, and began to teach Pelagian
                    doctrines and to create a new party in the university. Gomarus immediately set
                    himself earnestly to oppose these views, in his classes at college, and wherever
                    he found opportunity. He became the leader of the opponents of Arminius, who
                    from that circumstance came to be known as Gomarists. He engaged twice iu
                    personal disputation with Arminius in the assembly of the estates of Holland in
                    1608, and was one of five Gomarists who met five Arminians or Remonstrants in
                    the same assembly in the following year. On the death of Arminius shortly after
                    this time, Vorstius, who sympathized with his views, was appointed to succeed
                    him, in spite of the keen opposition of Gomarus and his friends; and Gomarus
                    took his defeat so ill that, rather than have such a man for his colleague, he
                    resigned his post, and went to Middleburg in 1611, where he became minister of a
                    congregation and gave public lectures. From this place he was called to a chair
                    of theology at Saumur, where he remained four years, and then accepted a call as
                    professor of theology and Hebrew to Gröningen, where he stayed till his death on
                    11th January 1641. He took a leading part in the synod of Dort, assembled in
                    1618 to judge of the doctrines of Arminius. He was a man of ability, enthusiasm,
                    and learning, a considerable Oriental scholar, and also a keen controversialist.
                    He took part in the translation of the Old Testament into Dutch in 1633, and
                    after his death a book by him called the <hi rend="italic">Lyra Davidis</hi> was
                    published, which sought to explain the principles of Hebrew metre, and which
                    created some controversy at the time, having been opposed by Louis Capel. His
                    works were collected and published in one volume folio, in Amsterdam in
                    1645.</p>
