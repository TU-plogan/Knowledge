                <p><label type="entry">GOG</label> (j⅛) occurs in two passages of Scripture (Ezek.
                    xxxviii.-xxxix., and Rev. xx.) as the name of a great anti-theocratic power
                    destined to manifest itself in the world immediately before the final
                    dispensation is ushered in. In the later passage, Gog and Magog are spoken of as
                    coordinate; in the earlier, Gog is given as the name of the person or people,
                    and Magog as that of the land of its origin. Notwithstanding this discrepancy,
                    it is obvious that the passages are intimately related, and that both depend
                    upon Gen. x. 2, where, however, Magog alone is mentioned. Here he is the second
                    son of Japhet, and, on the assumption that a geographical order underlies these
                    ethnographical tables, his locality is to be sought between Gomer and Madai or
                    Media. According to Josephus, who is followed by Jerome, the Scythians were
                    primarily intended by this designation; and this opinion has been almost
                    universally accepted in modern times. The name ∑κι‰ι, it is to be observed,
                    however, is often but a vague word for any or all of the numerous and but
                    partially known tribes of the north; and any attempt to assign a more definite
                    locality to Magog can only be very hesitatingly made. According to some, the
                    Maiotes about the Palus Maeotis are meant; according to others, the Massage tae;
                    according to Kiepert, the inhabitants of the northern and eastern parts of
                    Armenia. In Ezekiel, Gog is regarded as a terrible ruler in the extreme north,
                    being prince of Rosh, Mesech, and Tubal, as well as governor in the land of
                    Magog, and having the support of Persia, Ethiopia, and Phut, as well as of Gomer
                    and the house of Togarmah. It may be considered as certain that the imagery
                    employed in this prophetic description was suggested by the Scythian invasion
                    which about the time of Josiah had devastated Asia (Herod, i. 103 ff.). As might
                    have been expected from the prominence given to that description in the Old
                    Testament, Gog figures largely in Jewish and Mahometan as well as Christian
                    eschatology. In the district of Astrakhan a legend is still to be met with, to
                    the effect that Gog and Magog were two great races, which Alexander the Great
                    subdued and banished to the inmost recesses of the Caucasus, where they are
                    meanwhile kept in by the terror of twelve trumpets blown by the winds, but
                    whence they are destined ultimately to make their escape and destroy the world.
                    The legends that attach themselves to the effigies of Gog and Magog which are at
                    present to be seen in Guild Hall, London, are only remotely connected, if at
                    all, with the statements of Scripture. According to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Recuyell des</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoires</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                        Troye,</hi> Gog and Magog were the survivors of a race of giants descended
                    from the thirty-three wicked daughters of Diocletian; after their brethren had
                    been slain by Brute and his companions, Gog and Magog were brought to London
                    (Troy-novant), and compelled to officiate as porters at the gate of the royal
                    palace. It is known that effigies similar to the present existed in London as
                    early as the time of Henry V.; but it is uncertain at what date this legend
                    first began to attach to them. According to Geoffrey of Monmouth <hi
                        rend="italic">(Chronicles,</hi> i, 16), Goëmot or Goëmagot (either corrupted
                    from or corrupted into “Gog and Magog ”) was a giant who, along with his brother
                    Corineus, tyrannized in the western horn of England until slain by foreign
                    invaders.</p>
