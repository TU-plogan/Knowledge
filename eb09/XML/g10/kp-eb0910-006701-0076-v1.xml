                    town of Germany at the head of a circle in the duchy of Brunswick, situated on
                    the Gande, a sub-tributary of the Weser, about 48 miles S.W. of Brunswick. It is
                    a small place numbering, according to the census of 1875, only 2454 inhabitants;
                    but it carries on the manufacture of linen, cigars, beet-root sugar, and beer,
                    and possesses not only an old palace built by the dukes of Brunswick in the 16th
                    century, but an abbey which ranks among the most famous in Germany.</p>
                <p>The abbey of Gandersheim was founded in 856, according to Eberhard’s Chronicle,
                    by the duke Ludolf of Saxony and his wife Oda, who removed to the new domicile
                    the nuns whom they had shortly before established at Brunshausen. Their own
                    daughter Hathurnoda was the first abbess, who was succeeded on her death by her
                    sister Gerberga. Under Gerberga’s government King Louis III. granted a
                    privilege, by which the office of abbess was to continue in the ducal family as
                    long as any member was found competent and willing to accept the same. Otto III.
                    gave the abbey a market, a right of toll, and a mint; and after the bishop of
                    Hildesheim and the archbishop of Mainz had long contested with each other about
                    its supervision, Pope Innocent III. declared it altogether independent of both.
                    The abbey was ultimately recognized as holding directly of the empire, and the
                    abbess had a vote in the diet as a member of the Rhenish bench of bishops. The
                    conventual estates were of great extent, and among the feudatories who could be
                    summoned to the court of the abbess were the elector of Hanover and the king of
                    Prussia. Protestantism was introduced in 1568, and Magdalena, the last Boman
                    Catholic abbess, died in 1589; but Protestant abbesses were appointed to the
                    foundation, and continued to enjoy their imperial privileges till 1802, when
                    Gandersheim was incorporated with Brunswick. The last abbess was a princess of
                    the ducal house, and kept her rank till her death. The memory of Gandersheim
                    will long be preserved by its literary memorials. Hroswitha, the author of the
                    famous ecclesiastical dramas, was a member of the sisterhood in the 9th century;
                    and the rhyming Chronicle of Eberhard of Gandersheim ranks as in all probability
                    the earliest historical work composed in Low German. The Chronicle, which
                    contains an account of the first period of the monastery, is edited by Wieland,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Mοnurnentα</hi><hi rend="italic">Germ,</hi><hi

                    been the object of a special study by Paul Hasse, Gottingen, 1872. See also
