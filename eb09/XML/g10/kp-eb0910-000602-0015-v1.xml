                            called by bird-dealers. The synonym “Gray,” given by Willughby and Ray,
                            is doubtless derived from the general colour of the species, and hθ3 its
                            analogue in the Icelandic <hi rend="italic">GrΛond,</hi> applied almost

                    typical but the sole species. Its geographical distribution is almost identical
                    with that of the common Wild Duck or Mallard (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Duck,</hi> vol. vii. p. 505), since it is found over the greater part of
                    the Northern Hemisphere; but, save in Iudia, where it is said to be perhaps the
                    most plentiful species of Duck during the cold weather, it is hardly anywhere so
                    numerous, and both in the eastern parts of the United States and in the British
                    Islands it is rather rare than otherwise. Its habits also, so far as they have
                    been observed, greatly resemble those of the Wild Duck; but its appearance on
                    the water is very different, its small head, flat back, elongated form, and
                    elevated stern rendering it recognizable by the fowler even at such a distance
                    as hinders him from seeing its very distinct plumage. In coloration the two
                    sexes agree much more than is the case with any of the European Freshwater Ducks
                        <hi rend="italic">{Anatinae)</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> one only, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Anas</hi><hi rend="italic">marmorata,</hi> excepted; but on
                    closer inspection the drake exhibits a delicate ash-coloured breast, and upper
                    wing-coverts of a deep chestnut, which are wholly wanting in his soberly clad
                    partner. She, however, has, in common with him, some of the secondary quills of
                    a pure white, presenting a patch of that colour which forms one of the most
                    readily-perceived distinctive characters of the species. The Gadwall is a bird
                    of some interest, since it is one of the few that have been induced, by the
                    protection afforded them in certain localities, to resume the indigenous
                    position they once filled, but had, through the draining and reclaiming of
                    marshy lands, long since abandoned. In regard to the present species, this fact
                    is due to the efforts of the late Mr Andrew Fountaine, on whose property, in</p>
                <p>West Norfolk and its immediate neighbourhood, the Gadwall has now, for nearly
                    thirty years, annually bred in constantly increasing numbers, so that it may
                    again be accounted, in the fullest sense of the word, an inhabitant of England;
                    and, as it has been always esteemed one of the best of wild fowl for the table,
                    the satisfactory result of its encouragement by this gentleman is not to be
                    despised. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
