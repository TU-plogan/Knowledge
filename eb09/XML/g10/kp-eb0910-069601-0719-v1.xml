                        rend="italic">(Gulo luscus'),</hi> a carnivorous mammal, belonging to the
                        <hi rend="italic">Mustelidoe</hi> orweasel family, but differing from the
                    typical forms of the genus <hi rend="italic">Mustela</hi> in the greater
                    heaviness and clumsiness of its body, presenting in this respect a striking
                    resemblance to the bear. Its legs are short and stout, with large feet, the toes
                    of which terminate in strong, sharp claws, considerably curved. Its mode of
                    progression is semi-plantigrade. In size and form it is not unlike the European
                    badger, measuring from 2 to -3 feet in length, exclusive of the thick bushy
                    tail, which is about 8 inches long. Its head is broad, its eyes small, with
                    defective vision, and its back arched. Its fur consists of an undergrowth of
                    short woolly hair, mixed with long straight hairs, to the abundance and length
                    of which on the sides •and tail the creature owes its shaggy appearance. The
                    colour of its fur is blackish-brown, with a broad band of chestnut colour
                    stretching from the shoulders along each side of the body, the two meeting near
                    the root of the tail; while, unlike the majority of arctic animals, the fur of
                    the glutton in winter-time grows darker in colour. Like other weasels it is
                    provided with anal glands, which secrete a yellowish fluid possessing a highly
                    foetid odour. The glutton is a boreal animal, inhabiting the northern regions of
                    both hemispheres, but most abundant in the circumpolar area of the New World,
                    where it occurs throughout the British provinces and Alaska, being specially
                    numerous in the neighbourhood of the Mackenzie River, and extending southwards
                    as far as New York and the Rocky Mountains. Many erroneous statements have been
                    made regarding the glutton by early writers on natural history, from Olaus
                    Magnus to Buffon, one of which has perpetuated itself in the animal’s common
                    name,—the fact being that the wolverene is not more gluttonous than are the
                    majority of carnivorous animals. It feeds on grouse and the smaller rodents, and
                    on foxes, which it digs from their burrows during the breeding season. Its want
                    of activity, however, renders it dependent for most of its food on the dead
                    carcases of animals. These it frequently obtains by methods which have made it
                    peculiarly obnoxious to the hunter and trapper. Should the hunter, after
                    succeeding in killing his game, leave the carcase insufficiently protected for
                    more than a single night, the glutton, whose fear of snares is sufficient to
                    prevent him from touching it during the first night, will, if possible, get at
                    and devour what he can of it on the second, hiding the remainder beneath the
                    snow. He annoys the trapper by following up his lines of marten traps, which
                    often extend to a length of 40 or 50 miles, each of which he enters from behind,
                    extracting the bait, pulling up the traps, and devouring or concealing the
                    entrapped martens. So persistent is the glutton in this practice, when once it
                    discovers a line of traps, that its extermination along the trapper’s route is a
                    necessary preliminary to the successful prosecution of his business. This is,
                    however, no easy task, as the glutton is too cunning to be caught by the methods
                    successfully employed on the other members of the weasel family. The trap
                    generally used for this purpose is one made to resemble a cache, or hidden store
                    of food, such as the Indians and hunters are in the habit of forming, the
                    discovery and rifling of which is one of the glutton’s most congenial
                    occupations,—the bait, instead of being paraded as in most traps, being in this
                    case carefully concealed, to lull the knowing beast’s suspicions. One of the
                    most prominent characteristics of the wolverene is its propensity, akin to that
                    of certain members of the crow family, to steal and hide things, not merely food
                    which it might afterwards need, or traps which it regards as personal enemies,
                    but articles which cannot possibly have any interest for it except that of
                    curiosity. An amusing instance of this is quoted by Cowes in his valuable work,
                    recently published, on the <hi rend="italic">Fur-bearing Animals of North
                        America,</hi> in which he says— “A hunter and his family, having left their
                    lodge unguarded during their absence, on their return found it completely
                    gutted—the walls were there, but nothing else. Blankets, guns, kettles, axes,
                    cans, knives, and all the other paraphernalia of a trapper’s tent had vanished,
                    and the tracks left by the beast showed who had been the thief. The family set
                    to work, and, by carefully following up all his paths, recovered, with some
                    trifling exceptions, the whole of the lost property.” The cunning it displays in
                    unravelling the oftentimes complicated snares set for it forms at once the
                    admiration and the despair of every trapper, while its great strength and
                    ferocity render it a <pb break="no"

                    than itself, and occasionally even to man. The rutting season occurs in March,
                    and the female, secure in her burrow, produces her young—four or five at a
                    birth—in June or July. In defence of these she is exceedingly bold, and the
                    Indians, according to Cowes, “have been heard to say that they would sooner
                    encounter a she-bear with her cubs than a carcajou (the Indian name of the
                    glutton) under the same circumstances.” The wolverene has a curious habit which
                    has not hitherto been observed in any other of the lower animals. On catching
                    sight of its relentless human enemy, it may be observed, before finally
                    determining on flight, sitting on its haunches, and, in order to get a clearer
                    view of the danger, shading its eyes with one of its forepaws. When pressed for
                    food it becomes fearless, and has then been known to come on board an ice-bound
                    vessel, and in presence of the crew to seize on a canister of meat. The flesh of
                    the glutton is uneatable; it is therefore only valuable for its fur, which, when
                    several skins are sewn together, forms elegant hearth and carriage rugs.</p>
