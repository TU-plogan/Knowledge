                        rend="smallcaps">Samuel Robert Louis</hi> (1790— 1863), a Protestant
                    theological writer of some repute, was born at Geneva on the 25th of August,
                    1790. His father Georges Marc Gaussen, a member of the council of two hundred,
                    was descended from an old Languedoc family which had been scattered at the time
                    of the religious persecutions in France. At the close of his university career,
                    Louis was ordained in 1816 to the ministry of the Swiss Reformed Church at
                    Satigny near Geneva, where he formed intimate relations with J. E. Cellérier,
                    who had preceded him in the pastorate, and also with the members of the
                    dissenting congregation at Bourg-de-Four (Église du témoignage), which had been
                    formed under the influence of the preaching of the Haldanes in 1817. In 1819 he
                    published in conjunction with Cellérier a French translation of the Second
                    Helvetic Confession, with a preface expounding the views he had reached upon the
                    nature, use, and necessity of confessions of faith; and in 1830, for having
                    discarded the official catechism of his church as being insufficiently <pb

                    sin, and the doctrines of grace, he was censured and suspended by his
                    ecclesiastical superiors. In the following year, for having taken part in the
                    formation of a Société Évangélique, which contemplated, among other objects, the
                    establishment of a new theological hall, he was finally deprived of his charge.
                    After some time devoted to travel in Italy and England, he returned to Geneva
                    and ministered to an independent congregation until 1836, when he became
                    professor of systematic theology in the college which he had helped to found.
                    This post he continued to occupy until 1857, when he retired from the active
                    duties of the chair. His death occurred at Les Grottes, Geneva, on the 18th of
                    June 1863. His best known work, entitled <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi

                    an elaborate defence of the doctrine of “plenary inspiration,” was originally
                    published at Paris in 1840, and rapidly gained a wide popularity in France, as
                    also, through translations, in England and America. It was followed in 1860 by a
                    supplementary treatise on the canon (Ze <hi rend="italic">Canon</hi><hi

                    widely read. Gaussen was also the author of two published series of sermons, of
                    an exposition of Daniel, and of a variety of occasional publications of a
                    missionary or polemical character. His lectures on Genesis, Exodus, Joshua,
                    Jonah, and Luke were published posthumously.</p>
