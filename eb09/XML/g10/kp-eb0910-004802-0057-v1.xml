                <p><label type="entry">GALVANI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Luigi</hi></label> (1737-1798),
                    an eminent Italian physiologist, after whom galvanism received its name, was
                    born at Bologna, September 9, 1737. It was his wish in early life to enter the
                    church, but by his parents he was educated for a medical career. At the
                    university of Bologna, in which city he practised, he was in 1762 appointed
                    public lecturer in anatomy, and soon gained repute as a skilled though not
                    eloquent teacher, and, chiefly from his researches on the organs of hearing and
                    genito-urinary tract of birds, as a comparative anatomist. His celebrated theory
                    of animal electricity he enunciated in a treatise, “De viribus electricitatis in
                    motu musculari commentarius,” published in the 8th volume of the memoirs of the
                    Institute of Sciences at Bologna in 1791, and separately at Modena in the
                    following year, and elsewhere subsequently. The statement has frequently been
                    repeated that, in 1786, Galvani had skinned some frogs to make broth for his
                    wife, who was in delicate health; that the leg of one of these, on being
                    accidentally touched by a scalpel which had lain near an electrical machine, was
                    thrown into violent convulsions; and that it was thus that his attention was
                    first directed to the relations of animal functions to electricity. From
                    documents in the possession of <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> the Institute of
                    Bologna, however, it appears that twenty years previous to the publication of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Commentary</hi> Galvani was already engaged in
                    investigations as to the action of electricity upon the muscles of frogs. The
                    observation that the suspension of certain of these animals on an iron railing
                    by copper hooks caused twitching in the muscles of their legs led him to the
                    invention of his metallic arc, the first experiment with which is described in
                    the third part of the <hi rend="italic">Commentary,</hi> wherein it is
                    registered September 20, 1786. The arc he constructed of two different metals,
                    which, placed in contact the one with a nerve and the other with a muscle of a
                    frog, caused contraction of the latter. In Galvani’s view the motions of the
                    muscle were the result of the union, by means of the metallic arc, of its
                    exterior or negative electrical charge with positive electricity which proceeded
                    along the nerve from its inner substance. Volta, on the other hand, attributed
                    them solely to the effect of electricity having its source in the junction of
                    the two dissimilar metals of the arc, and regarded the nerve and muscle simply
                    as conductors. Galvani in one of his memoirs <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit10newyrich/page/n58/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0910-0058-0049"/> recorded the observation that muscular
                    contractions may be caused in a prepared frog merely by bending back the legs
                    and bringing them into contact with the lumbar nerves, as also when a nerve is
                    touched at two different points with a morsel of muscle taken from a living
                    frog, phenomena not satisfactorily explicable on the theories of Volta: but
                    after the death of the Bologna professor very little was heard of animal
                    electricity till, in 1827, the study of the subject was resumed by Nobili. On
                    Galvani’s refusal, from religious scruples, to take the oath of allegiance to
                    the Cisalpine republic on its establishment, he was removed from his
                    professorship. Deprived thus of the means of livelihood, he retired to the house
                    of his brother Giacomo, where he soon fell into a feverish decline. The
                    republican Government, in consideration of his great scientific fame,
                    eventually, but too late, determined to reinstate him in his chair at the
                    university of Bologna. He died December 4, 1798. A quajto edition of his works
                    was published at Bologna in 184Γ-42, by the Academy of Sciences of the Institute
                    of that city, under the title <hi rend="italic">Opere edite</hi><hi
