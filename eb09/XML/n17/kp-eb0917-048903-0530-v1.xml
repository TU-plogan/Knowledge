                        Friedrich</hi></label> (1733-1811), a German author and bookseller, was born
                    on the 18th of March 1733, at Berlin, where his father was a bookseller. He was
                    educated at a real-school in Berlin, and in 1749 went to Frankfort-on-the-Oder
                    to learn his father’s business. In 1752 he returned to Berlin, and soon began to
                    take part in current literary controversy. At that time the leaders of critical
                    opinion in Germany were Gottsched and Bodmer. In 1755 Nicolai issued a book, <hi
                        rend="italic">Briefe über den jetzigen Zustand der schönen
                        Wissenschaften,</hi> in which he tried to show that each of these writers
                    was in his own way narrow and intolerant. This work secured for the author the
                    friendship of Lessing, whose power as a critic was then beginning to be
                    recognized. In 1757 Nicolai devoted himself exclusively to literature; but next
                    year, after the death of his brother, who had continued the elder Nicolai’s
                    business, he found it necessary to resume the life of a bookseller. He did not,
                    however, abandon his literary labours. In association with his friend Moses
                    Mendelssohn he had established, in 1757, the periodical called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bibliothek der schönen Wissenschaften,</hi> and this he conducted until
                    1760. From 1761 to 1766 he contributed to the <hi rend="italic">Briefe,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">die</hi><hi rend="italic">neueste Literatur betreffend</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> but it was Lessing’s work that made this series famous.
                    For many years (from 1765 to 1791) Nicolai edited the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek,</hi> a periodical which served as the organ
                    of the so-called popular philosophers, who warred against authority in religion
                    and against what they conceived to be extravagance in literature. The new
                    movement of ideas represented by Herder, Goethe, Schiller, Kant, and Fichte he
                    was incapable of understanding, and he made himself ridiculous by foolish
                    misrepresentation of their aims. Of Nicolai’s independent writings, perhaps the
                    only one of permanent value is his <hi rend="italic">Anekdoten</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">von Friedrich II.</hi> His romances are forgotten, although
                        <hi rend="italic">Leben und Meinungen des Herrn Magisters Sebaldus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Nυthanker</hi> had a certain reputation in its day. His <hi
                        rend="italic">Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die
                        Schweiz</hi> was attacked by many writers, and it proved that in middle life
                    he had become in a new way not less bigoted than the authors whose bigotry he
                    had spent much of his time in exposing. Nicolai died on the 8th of January 1811.
                    He wrote an <hi rend="italic">Autobiography,</hi> which was published in 1806.
