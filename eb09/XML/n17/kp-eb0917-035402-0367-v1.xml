                <p><label type="entry">NESTOR</label> (c. 1056-c. 1114), the patriarch of Russian
                    literature, concerning whom, however, we have but little information, except
                    that he was a monk of the Pestcherski cloister of Kieff from 1073. The only
                    other fact of his life told us is that he was commissioned with two other monks
                    to find the relics of St Theodosius, a mission which he succeeded in fulfilling.
                    His history begins with the deluge, as those of most chroniclers of the time
                    did. He appears to have been acquainted with the Byzantine historians; he makes
                    use especially of John Malala and George Armatolus. He also had in all
                    probability other Slavonic chronicles to compile from, which are now lost. The
                    labours of the Byzantine annalists, some of which were translated into
                    Palaeo-Slavonic, would stimulate the production of such works. Of course there
                    are many legends mixed up with Nestor’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle·,</hi> the
                    style is occasionally so poetical that we may easily fancy that he has
                    incorporated <hi rend="italic">bilini</hi> which are now lost. The early part is
                    rich in these quaint stories, among which may be cited the arrival of the three
                    Varangian brothers, the founding of Kieff, the murder of Askold and Dir, the
                    death of Oleg, who was killed by a serpent concealed in the skeleton of his
                    horse, and the vengeance taken by Olga, the wife of Igor, on the Drevlians, who
                    had murdered her husband. The account of the labours of Cyril and Methodius
                    among the Slavs is also given in a very interesting manner, and to Nestor we owe
                    the tale of the summary way in which Vladimir suppressed the worship of Peroun
                    and other idols at Kieff. As an eye-witness he could only describe the reigns of
                    Vsevolod and Sviatopolk (1078-1112), but he gathered many interesting details
                    from the lips of old men, two of whom are especially mentioned, Giourata
                    Rogovich, an inhabitant of Novgorod, who furnished him with information
                    concerning the north of Russia, Petchora, and other places, and Jan, a man
                    ninety years of age, who died in 1106, and was son of Vishata the waywode of
                    Yaroslavl and grandson of Ostromir the Posadnik, for whom the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Codex</hi> was written. Besides the historical portion, many of the
                    ethnological details given by Nestor of the various races of the Slavs are of
                    the highest value</p>
                <p>This interesting work lias come down ro us in several manuscripts, but
                    unfortunately no contemporary ones, the oldest being the so-called Lavrientski
                    of the 14th century (1377). _ It was named after the monk Lavrentii, who copied
                    it out for Dimitri Constantinovich, the prince of Souzdal. The work, as
                    contained in this manuscript, has had many additions made to it from previous
                    and contemporary chronicles, such as those of Volinia and Novgorod. Solovieff,
                    the Russian historian, justly remarks that Nestor cannot be strictly called the
                    earliest Russian chronicler, but he is the first writer who took anything like a
                    national point of view in his history, the others being merely local writers.
                    The language of his work, as shown in the earliest manuscripts just mentioned,
                    is Palaeo-Slavonic with many Russisms. It has formed the subject of a valuable
                    monograph by Professor Miklosich.</p>
                <p>Nestor’s <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi> has been translated into Polish,
                    Bohemian, German, and French, but no version has appeared in our own language.
                    Besides his historical work, Nestor was also'the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lives</hi> of Boris and Gleb, the martyrs, and of the St Theodosius
                    previously mentioned. In recent times the genuineness of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chronicle</hi> has been attacked by ∏ovaiski and others, but the
                    accusations have hardly been considered serious in Russia, and have been
                    completely refuted, if they needed refutation, by Pogodin. The body of the
                    ancient chronicler may still be seen among the relics preserved in the
                    Pestcherski monastery at Kieff. His work is of primary importance for the study
                    of early Russian history, and, although devoid of literary merit in the
                    strictest sense of the term, is not without its amusing and well-told episodes
                    of a somewhat Herodotean character.</p>
