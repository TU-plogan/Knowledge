                <p><label type="entry">NEWARK</label>, the principal city of the State of New
                    Jersey, United States, is situated in Essex county, on the west bank of the
                    Passaic river, 4 miles above Newark Bay, and covers an area of about 18 square
                    miles. The original site was a crescent-shaped ridge, or double chain of low
                    hills, extending from north-east to south-west, now much changed by levelling
                    and cutting. The main part of the city is on the lower ground which stretches
                    east and south towards the Newark and Hackensack Meadows (salt marshes). The
                    surface is, in general, well adapted for drainage and sewage. The climate is
                    mild, tempered by the proximity of Newark Bay and the Atlantic (12 miles
                    distant), and the place bears a good reputation for healthfιu-ness. The
                    water-supply comes from the Passaic. There are about 130 miles of streets,
                    generally wide and well-shaded, one-fifth of which are paved. The principal
                    thoroughfare, Broad Street (120 feet wide), is lined throughout a good part of
                    its length with fine old elms, and where not occupied by business premises is
                    fronted by numerous handsome residences. There are several small parks, the
                    principal of which are Military and Washington Parks, bordering on Broad Street.
                    The public buildings are for the most part unsightly and unsuitable; on the
                    other hand, the city is not overburdened by debt or by heavy taxation.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding that the central portion of Newark is but 9 miles distant from
                    the general post-office in New York city,—being considerably nearer that; point
                    than are the northern portions of New York city proper—Newark has more the
                    character of an independent city than a suburb. This it owes in part to its
                    situation within another State, but still more to its independent and
                    distinctive manufacturing interests. Even prior to 1872 it was called “the
                    Birmingham of America.” In that year a very successful exhibition, consisting of
                    the manufactures of Newark, greatly stimulated the investment of capital.</p>

                <p>The principal industries are—jewellery, tanning and currying, celluloid (a
                    substitute for ivory, coral, &amp;c.) and celluloid goods, hat-making, boot and
                    shoe making, trunk and valise making, saddlery hardware, harness-making,
                    breweries (mostly lager beer) and malt-houses, building, carriage and waggon
                    making, clothing, chemical works, cigar and tobacco factories, edge tools,
                    hammers, &amp;c., cabinetmaking, and iron and steel works. There are also large
                    cotton, woollen, and silk-thread factories, and an extensive sewing-machine
                    factory, together employing about 3000 hands.</p>
                <p>The shipping facilities of Newark are abundant, and four great trunk lines of
                    railroad—the Pennsylvania, the New York, Lake Erie, and Western, the Delaware,
                    Lackawanna, and Western, and the Central Railroad of New Jersey (Reading
                    Railroad)—give ready communication with all parts of the United States, and with
                    the steamship lines at Jersey City and in New York. Newark is intersected by the
                    Morris Canal, and has considerable coasting trade by way of the Passaic river.
                    The city has 112 churches and missions :—Presbyterian, 23; Reformed
                    Presbyterian, 1; United Presbyterian, 1; Congregational, 2; Reformed Dutch, 9;
                    Baptist, 13; Episcopal, 12; Episcopal Reformed, 1; Methodist, 22; Lutheran, 4;

                    admirable, free public school system. There are three well-appointed hospitals.
                    The city has six daily newspapers, four English and two German, besides two
                    Sunday morning newspapers and a weekly German paper.</p>
                <p>In 1810 the population of Newark was 6000; in 1836, when the town became a city,
                    it was 19,732; in 1840 it was 17,290, shortly after which began a stream of
                    immigration which has continued almost uninterruptedly since. In '1850 the
                    population had more than doubled, reaching 38,894; in 1860 it was 71,941, having
                    again almost doubled; during the next decade, including the period of the civil
                    war, it increased to 105,059, and it has since grown in like ratio, being
                    136,508 in 1880. This had risen to 145,000 (estimated) in 1883. In 1880 there
                    were 17,628 persons of German, 13,451 of Irish, 4478 of English, and 1090 of
                    Scotch birth, together with Italians, French, Swedes, Swiss, and other
                    nationalities in numbers which bring the total of foreign-born population up to
                    40,330. Those of German and Irish birth, together with their children (minors)
                    born within the United States, constitute fully three-fifths of the entire
                    population.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> On or about May 17, 1666—the exact date cannot
                    be determined—there anchored in the Passaic river, opposite what is now Newark,
                    a small vessel from Milford, Connecticut, having on board a company of thirty
                    persons, Puritans, who had come to form a new settlement in the New Jersey
                    wilderness. Before the landing was completed, the Hackensack Indians demanded
                    compensation from the new comers, which they finally received. The price then
                    paid for the land upon which Newark and the adjacent towns and villages of Essex
                    county are built being “fifty double hands of powder, one hundred bars of lead,
                    twenty axes, twenty coats, ten guns, twenty pistols, ten kettles, ten swords,
                    four blankets, four barrels of beer, ten pairs of breeches, fifty knives, twenty
                    horses, eighteen hundred and fifty fathoms of wampum, two ankers of liquor (or
                    something equivalent), and three troopers’ coats.” Subsequently another vessel
                    arrived from Connecticut containing a somewhat larger party, but both together
                    numbered, all told, less than seventy persons. Their chief desire was to
                    establish a community whose spiritual and temporal affairs would be controlled
                    and directed “according to God and a godly government.” Their pastor was Abraham
                    Pierson, originally from Newark-on-Trent, in whose honour the name of the
                    settlement was changed from Milford to Newark. The town was laid out in lots,
                    and everything was ordered and governed mainly according to Mosaic law. The
                    foremost among the settlers was Captain Robert Treat, a brave, resolute, wise,
                    and kindly man, who, after remaining long enough to see the new settlement
                    fairly established, returned to Connecticut, and became governor of the colony.
                    He had previously been deputygovernor for thirty-two years. The dream of Pierson
                    and his Puritan followers was not realized. Before many years the Mosaic bars
                    had to be removed one by one, and gradually the townspeople broadened their
                    ideas of government. But even to this day, despite the cosmopolitan character of
                    the population, the old Puritan leaven is still at work, largely leavening the
                    whole lump.</p>
                <p>The first occurrence of special interest in the history of the town after its
                    settlement was a schism in the old church. Colonel Josiah Ogden, a rich and
                    influential member, and a man of strong individuality, saved his wheat one dry
                    Sunday, in a wet season. He maintained that it was a work of necessity; the
                    church declared it tp be a violation of God’s law. The immediate result was the
                    withdrawal of Ogden and his followers, and the founding of the first Episcopal
                    or Church of England Society in Newark, —Trinity Church. The affair led also to
                    an exacerbating controversy which lasted from 1734 until long after the
                    Revolutionary war which closed in 1783. Newark was, from 1748 to 1756, the seat
                    of the college of New Jersey, thereafter permanently established at Princeton,
                    founded by the Rev. Aaron Burr, father of the nuire celebrated American of the
                    same name; the latter was born in Newark. During the war of independence, the
                    great majority of the thousand inhabitants of Newark sided with the Americans;
                    the town suffered severely from the ravages of the British and marauding parties
                    of American loyalists; on the other hand the American revolutionists drove out
                    all loyalists, and confiscated their property. After the war, manufactures began
                    to prosper, and have continued to do so ever since. At one time chair-making was
                    carried on extensively, and it is stated that among those who worked at it in
                    Newark was the famous Talleyrand.</p>
