                <p><label type="entry">NEUILLY-SUR-SEINE</label>, a town of France, at the head of a
                    canton in the arrondissement of St Denis (department of Seine), lies between the
                    line of the Paris fortifications, the Bois de Boulogne, the right bank of the
                    Seine, and the village of Levallois-Perret, which was formerly included within
                    its limits. It is only 3∣ miles from the centre of Paris by the road to St
                    Germain (a continuation in the form of a boulevard of the middle avenue of the
                    Champs Elysées), and is practically a mere suburb; but its broad drives and
                    leafy gardens make it a favourite resort for invalids and city people who wish
                    to enjoy a little country air. Unlike St Denis and Clichy, Neuilly has no large
                    manufactories: convents, boarding-schools, maisons de santé, laundries,
                    &lt;fcc., give character to the place, which also contains establishments
                    connected with Paris houses for the manufacture of preserved meats, patent
                    leather, colours, chemicals. The population is 25,235.</p>
                <p>A castle at Neuilly, built by the count of Argenson in the 18th century,
                    ultimately became the property and favourite residence of the duke of Orleans
                    (Louis Philippe), the birthplace of nearly all his children, and the scene of
                    the offer of the crown in 1830. The buildings, which comprised 30 state
                    apartments, accommodation for 500 attendants, and stabling for 200 horses, were
                    pillaged and burned by the mob in 1848. The park which extended from the
                    fortifications to the river, as well as the neighbouring park of Villiers (also
                    belonging to the princes of Orleans), was broken up into building lots, and is
                    now occupied by a large number of small middle-class houses and a few fine
                    villas. Within the line of the fortifications, but on Neuilly soil, stands the
                    chapel of St Ferdinand erected in the Byzantine style on the spot where the duke
                    of Orleans died July 13th, 1842, from the results of a carriage accident. The
                    stained glass windows were made at Sèvres after designs by Ingres; the ducal
