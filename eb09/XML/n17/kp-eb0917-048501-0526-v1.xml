                <p><label type="entry">NICHOLAS I</label>. (1796-1855), czar of Russia, third son of
                    Paul I., was born at Tsarkoe-Selo on the 25th June 1796. His elder brothers were
                    Alexander and Constantine, of whom the former was twenty years his senior. Their
                    father was murdered in 1801, and Alexander then became emperor. The education of
                    Nicholas was conducted under the care of his mother, a pious but narrow-minded
                    woman. He had not, like his eldest brother, whose education was directed by the
                    empress Catherine, the advantage of associating in early life with men of
                    culture and of modern ideas. Nor was he early introduced either to military or
                    to political life. He was brought up in retirement, and even during the invasion
                    of Russia by Napoleon in 1812 he was not permitted to serve in the army. His
                    tastes, however, were all military, and his favourite studies mathematics and
                    fortification. During the campaign of 1814 in France he was allowed to come to
                    the allied headquarters, but not to take part in any engagement. He was present
                    during the occupation of Paris in 1815, and in the following year was sent to
                    travel on the Continent and to visit England, where his striking personal
                    appearance excited the admiration of Sir Walter Scott. He married in 1817 Louise
                    Charlotte, daughter of Frederick William III., king of Prussia, and this union
                    had for half a century an important effect on the history of Prussia and Germany
                    at large. After his marriage he received a military command from his brother,
                    and from this time forward he gave his utmost attention to the mechanical part
                    of military affairs, rejoicing in the occupations of a drill-sergeant, and
                    identifying himself so completely with his soldiers that civil costume became
                    insupportable to him, even when on visits to sovereigns who, like Queen
                    Victoria, would have preferred to see him in less warlike guise. Alexander
                    having no sons, Constantine was heir to the throne. This brutal and ignorant
                    prince had, however, the sense to recognize his own unfitness for the task of
                    governing an empire, and by a secret agreement with the reigning sovereign he
                    renounced his rights in favour of Nicholas. Alexander died on December 1, 1825.
                    Constantine, who was in Poland, showed no inclination to prefer his claims; the
                    edict of the late emperor appointing Nicholas his successor was opened, and the
                    younger brother was called by the highest authorities of Russia to assume the
                    crown. He nevertheless refused, and, as it would seem, in perfect sincerity,
                    until Constantine had formally confirmed his renunciation. The delay led to
                    serious consequences. Conspiracies against the late emperor and in favour of a
                    freer government had been formed in the army and among the nobles; and when the
                    troops at St Petersburg were called upon to take the oath to Nicholas, revolt
                    broke out. The young czar showed great nerve and courage, but the mutiny was not
                    put down without bloodshed, and the impression which it left on his mind never
                    passed away. Despotic by nature, trained in the midst of the monarchical
                    reaction that followed the French wars, and accustomed to hear the earlier
                    liberal tendencies of his brother Alexander spoken of as mere vagaries that had
                    happily been abandoned, Nicholas saw in the outbreak of his soldiers in 1825 a
                    warning never to relax the grasp of authority. The maintenance of despotic power
                    was a duty to which he devoted himself with the deepest religious conviction. At
                    the accession of Nicholas, Russia had been for some years on the brink of war
                    with the Porte. Greece was in insurrection, and Russia had its own specific
                    causes of complaint in consequence of the alleged infraction of the privileges
                    of the Danubian provinces guaranteed by the treaty of Bucharest. It had long
                    been the effort of European diplomatists to dissuade Alexander from interfering
                    on behalf of Greece, and to find a peaceful solution for the difficulties in
                    which Russia was more directly concerned. The Greek cause had, however, at
                    length excited so much sympathy that the British Government took advantage of
                    the accession of Nicholas to send the duke of Wellington to St Petersburg to
                    propose some joint action on behalf of Greece. The attempt succeeded: England
                    and Russia undertook to tender their mediation, requiring the sultan to grant
                    the Greeks a modified independence, and the concert was subsequently joined by
                    France. The result of this combination, and of Ottoman obstinacy, was the
                    destruction of the Turkish fleet at Navarino by the allied squadrons, and the
                    establishment of Greek independence. This, however, did not terminate the
                    contentions between Turkey and Russia. The Porte itself challenged war, and in
                    1828 hostilities broke out. Nicholas took part in the first and unsuccessful
                    campaign of 1828, but allowed his generals to act by themselves in 1829; and the
                    march of Diebitsch over the Balkans was followed by the peace of Adrianople. A
                    Persian war had already been successfully concluded, and Russia had gained
                    thereby two provinces in the east. The peace of Adrianople gave it only an
                    improved frontier on the eastern shore of the Black Sea. In 1830 the fall of the
                    Bourbons made an end of the friendship which existed between France and Russia,
                    and restored the union between the three despotic courts of St Petersburg,
                    Vienna, and Berlin, which had been framed in 1814 and interrupted by the course
                    of Eastern affairs. Nicholas did not refuse to recognize Louis Philippe, but he
                    would never accord him the usual title of <hi rend="italic">Mon Frère,</hi> and
                    he lost no opportunity of treating him with contempt. The insurrection of Poland
                    soon followed. Alexander had received the grand-duchy of Warsaw from the
                    congress of Vienna as a separate kingdom, united with Russia only in the person
                    of its ruler; and he had fulfilled his promise of granting it a constitution,
                    and treating it as a distinct nationality. The violation of these rights by the
                    grand-duke Cqnstan-tine, who was governor of Poland, and the virtual
                    establishment of dictatorial rule, caused the insurrection against Nicholas. The
                    Polish leaders sent their demands to St Petersburg; Nicholas replied that he
                    would only answer them with cannon. The diet now pronounced his dethronement as
                    king of Poland, and the armed struggle began. It was a long and doubtful one,
                    for Poland had a regular army of its own; but the victory was at length won by
                    Nicholas, and he showed no mercy to his conquered enemy. Poland was made a
                    Russian province; its liberties were utterly extinguished; its defenders were
                    sent by thousands to Siberia. During the years that followed, the struggle
                    between the sultan and his vassal, Mehemet Ali, pasha of Egypt, brought the
                    Eastern question again to the front of European affairs. The treaty of
                    Unkiar-Skelessi seemed for a moment to have placed Turkey in absolute dependence
                    upon the czar, who guaranteed it his protection against all internal and
                    external enemies; but France and England now made their influence felt, and the
                    ultimate settlement was the work of all Europe. Nicholas visited England in
                    1844, and tried, but unsuccessfully, to frame some plan of joint action with
                    that country in view of the possible collapse of the Ottoman empire. The
                    revolutionary spirit which the czar so passionately abhorred <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit17newyrich/page/n527/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0917-0527-0486"/> was now about to convulse Europe again. He
                    watched the events of 1848, and strengthened his army. So long as revolution did
                    not approach his own frontiers he was willing to hold his hand; but when Hungary
                    rose against the Hapsburgs and established its national independence he felt
                    that Poland would soon follow its example, and sent his soldiers to crush the
                    Magyar armies which Austria had not been able to subdue. When the victory of
                    despotism was secured, he joined with the Austrian Government in demanding from
                    the Porte the surrender of the Hungarian leaders who had taken refuge in Turkey.
                    But it was not long permitted to him to play the part of international autocrat.
                    His aggressions upon the Ottoman empire, continued up to 1853, brought England
                    and France into the field against him. His armies were defeated at Alma and
                    Inkermann, his fortresses besieged; and in the bitterness of defeat death came
                    upon him, and carried him from a world where, with the deepest conviction that
                    he was doing God service, he had inflicted so much evil on mankind (February 18,
                    1855). He died as he had lived, a brave man, and his last words were those of
                    simple prayer. Shortly before his death he is said to have laid two injunctions
                    upon his successor,—to liberate the serfs, and never to grant Poland a
                    constitution. (c. A. F.)</p>
