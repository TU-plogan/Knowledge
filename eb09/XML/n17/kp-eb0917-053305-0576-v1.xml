                <p><label type="entry">NONNUS</label>, Greek epic poet, author of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Dionysiaca,</hi> was a native of Panopolis in the Egyptian
                    Thebaid. He can scarcely have been earlier than the 5th century of our era, but
                    probably wrote in the first half of it, as his versification is imitated by
                    Proclus, who was born 412 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Nothing is known of his
                    personal history, but his extensive mythological erudition almost proves him to
                    have been a grammarian. His principal work, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dionysiaca,</hi> an epic in forty-eight books on the history of Bacchus, is
                    a vast storehouse of legendary fable, embellished, especially in the long
                    episode of Bacchus’s Indian expedition, with not a little of the poet’s own
                    invention. From one point of view it may be described as the swan-song of the
                    ancient mythology; its spirit, at the same time, is anything but Hellenic. In
                    its vast and formless luxuriance, its beautiful but artificial versification,
                    its delineation of action and passion to the entire neglect of character, it
                    resembles the colossal epics of India, while its glittering but too often frigid
                    conceits bring it near to the Italian bastard epic of Marino and his school.
                    Like his countryman and near contemporary Claudian, Nonnus is a writer of
                    copious learning and still more copious fancy, eminent in invention, in
                    description, and in melody, whose faults may be charged upon his age, while his
                    merits are his own. This is more particularly the case with the author of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Dionysiaca,</hi> whose reforms in versification originated
                    with himself, while they were accepted by all succeeding poets. In his hands,
                    says Hermann, the Homeric hexameter, greatly corrupted by time and licence,
                    though losing something of its dignity, recovered its elegance and harmony, and
                    was framed to so strict a pattern that no one ignorant of prosody could
                    henceforth attempt to write an epic. His influence on the vocabulary of his
                    successors was likewise very considerable. We also possess under his name a
                    paraphrase of the Gospel of St John, which is chiefly interesting as apparently
                    indicating that, notwithstanding his mythological lore, Nonnus conformed to
                    Christianity. The style is not inferior to that of his epic, but, employed in
                    embellishing the simple narrative of the evangelist, it produces an impression
                    of extreme bombast and want of taste.</p>
                <p>The first edition of Nonnus was published by Falkenburg at Antwerp in 1569 from a
                    MS. procured at Taranto by Sambucus, an Hungarian. The standard edition is
                    Graefe’s (Leipsic, 1819-26); but the most useful is that by Count de Marcellus
                    (Paris, 1856), accompanied by valuable notes and prolegomena, and a French prose
                    translation. The analyses by Ouvaroff (St Petersburg, 1817) and Koehler (Halle,
                    1853) are useful aids to the study of so long and intricate a poem. The
