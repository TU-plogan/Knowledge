                <p><label type="entry">NANTUCKET</label>, an island, county, and town of the United
                    States, forming (since 1693) part of Massachusetts. The island, with an area of
                    about 50 square miles, lies within the 10-fathom line, but is separated from the
                    mainland by Nantucket Sound, which measures from 25 to 30 miles in breadth, and
                    has a general depth of from 5 to 8 fathoms. With the exception of a few
                    inconsiderable hills, the surface for the most part consists of open, breezy,
                    and now almost treeless downs. The soil is generally sandy, but affords in some
                    places good pasture. On the north or landward side of the island there is a
                    large lagoon-like harbour formed by a long narrow tongue of land—the Coatue
                    Beach—which, curving north-west, runs out into Great Point, the end of which is
                    marked by a white lighthouse tower in 41° 23' 24" N. lat. and 70° 2' 24" W.
                    long. Within the harbour the depth at low water is about 12 or 14 feet, but on
                    the bar it is only between 6 and 7. The western end of the island shelves out in
                    a broad submarine platform (Tuckernuck Bank), which supports the two
                    considerable islands of Tuckernuck and Muskeget, both included in the county.
                    Nantucket post-village, the principal settlement, lies at the south-west end of
                    the harbour, —a quiet place, but beginning to attract attention as a summer
                    residence. A library and museum are maintained in the Athenøeum building.</p>
                <p>Nantucket (Natocko on the map of 1630) was visited by Gosnold (1602), who found
                    it covered with oaks and other trees, and inhabited by about 1500 Indians.
                    Governor Mayhew, in 1659, granted nine-tenths of the island to ten men for £30
                    and two beaver hats, and shortly afterwards the first settler, Thomas Macy, took
                    possession. The town of Nantucket (known as Sherburne from 1673 to 1795) was
                    incorporated in 1671; the original site was at Maddequet, 5 or 6 miles west of
                    the present position, to which it was removed in the following year. About the
                    same time whaling operations were commenced, and Nantucket gradually became the
                    greatest whaling station in the world. In 1775 it had 150 vessels engaged in the
                    business; but since the beginning of the century its prosperity has rapidly
                    declined: in 1852 there were still 18,105 tons of its registered shipping
                    employed in whale-fishing; in 1863 there were only 3739; and the number has
                    gradually sunk to zero. The last full-blood Indian in Nantucket died in 1821;
                    the last halfbreed in 1854. The population of the county was 4500 in 1775, 9012
                    in 1840, 6094 in 1860, 4123 in 1870, and 3727 in 1880.</p>
