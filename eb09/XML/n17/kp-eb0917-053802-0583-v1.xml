                            Marquis of</hi></label> (1797-1863), bore an eminent, though not a
                    leading, part in some of the greatest movements of this century. As governor of
                    Jamaica he had charge of the distribution of the huge compensation to owners
                    upon the abolition of slavery in the West Indies; it fell to him as
                    lord-lieutenant of Ireland to give effect to the Catholic Emancipation Act; he
                    was English ambassador at Paris during the revolution of 1848, and minister in
                    Tuscany in the years immediately preceding the struggle for Italian unity. The
                    son of the first earl Mulgrave, and born 15th May 1797, he passed through Harrow
                    and Trinity College, Cambridge, and sat for the family borough of Scarborough as
                    soon as he attained his majority. But, speaking in favour of Catholic
                    emancipation, and dissenting in other points from the family politics, he
                    thought proper to resign his seat, and went to live in Italy for some two years.
                    Returning in 1822, he was elected for Higham Ferrers, and made a considerable
                    reputation by political pamphlets and by his speeches in the House. He was
                    returned for Malton at the general election of 1826, and enrolled himself among
                    the supporters of Canning. Previous to this, in 1825, he made his appearance as
                    a novelist with <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi>; and three years later, in 1828,
                    he produced another, <hi rend="italic">Yes and</hi> Ab. Of the brilliant band of
                    fashionable novelists who started up as by a common impulse in those years,
                    including Ward, Lister, Bui wer, Disraeli, Lord Normanby was probably the least
                    impressive; yet his <hi rend="italic">Matilda</hi> ran through four editions in
                    a year. There is a certain stiffness in the construction of his novels, as if he
                    were either deficient in the story-teller’s vivacity and fertility or, oppressed
                    by his own sense of dignity, over-fastidious in his theory of composition. The
                    novels are comparatively short, and move forward steadily to tragic catastrophes
                    that present themselves ahead from a very early stage in the journey. The moral
                    is so obtrusive that they may almost be called sermons in disguise. Especially
                    is this true of <hi rend="italic">Yes and No,</hi> in which two opposite types
                    of character, the man who says “Yes” with too great facility, and the man who
                    says “No” with too great obstinacy and suspiciousness, are very skilfully
                    contrasted. It was chiefly character that he aimed at, as became a statesman,
                    and his characters were drawn with fulness and keen insight, though not without
                    too much appearance of labour.</p>
                <p>A speech put into the mouth of one of his characters expresses very fairly Lord
                    Normanby’s political creed, a creed not uncommon among the aristocracy at the
                    time of the Reform Bill: “I can’t help thinking it but befits a gentleman to
                    move methodically forward with the main body of the age in its regular march of
                    mind, neither seeking foolish forlorn hopes in advance, nor lagging
                    disgracefully in the rear.” Acting on this principle, Lord Normanby reached the
                    zenith of his career between the age of thirty and forty; after that he began to
                    lag and to decline in political reputation. He succeeded his father as Earl
                    Mulgrave in 1831, was sent out as captaingeneral and governor of Jamaica in the
                    same year, and, in spite of certain defects of manner, gained such credit as an
                    administrator that he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1835. It is
                    significant of the reputation he then held that his appointment was received
                    with enthusiasm as the beginning of a new order in Ireland; and during his three
                    years of office, one of the most peaceful periods in the history of Ireland,
                    great improvements were made. It is disputed how much was due to him and how
                    much to his subordinate Thomas Drummond. He was created marquis of Normanby in
                    1838, and held successively the offices of colonial secretary and home secretary
                    in the last years of Lord Melbourne’s ministry. From 1846 to 1852 he was
                    ambassador at Paris, and from 1854 to 1858 minister at Florence. He died in
                    London, 28th July 1863. The publication in 1857 of ajournai kept in Paris during
                    the stormy times of 1848 <hi rend="italic">(Ä</hi><hi rend="italic">Year of
                        Revolutions')</hi> brought him into violent controversy with Louis Blanc on
                    questions of fact as well as of policy; and his controversies with Lord
                    Palmerston and Mr Gladstone, after his retirement from the public service, on
                    questions of French and Italian policy, showed him to have fallen behind “the
                    regular march of the mind” of his age.</p>
