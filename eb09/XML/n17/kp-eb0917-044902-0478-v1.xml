                    BUSHEL, situated respectively in the parishes of Wolborough and High week, and
                    separated by the small river Lemon, are generally included under the one name
                    Newton Abbot, a markettown of Devonshire, England, on the Teign, 5 miles south
                    by west of Teignmouth, and 6 north of Torquay. The beauty of the neighbouring
                    scenery and the salubrity of the climate have tended of late years to increase
                    the demand for residences, while the situation of the town at the head of the
                    Teign navigation enables it to carry on a considerable shipping trade. St
                    Mary’s, the parish church of Wolborough, about half a mile south of the town, is
                    in the Perpendicular style, as is also the parish church of Highweek, about a
                    mile to the north-west. A very extensive nunnery, called St Augustine’s Priory,
                    was erected near the town in 1861. To the east of the town is Forde House, an
                    Elizabethan structure belonging to the earl of Devon, visited by Charles I. and
                    William of Orange. The other principal buildings are the union workhouse, the
                    town-hall, and the markets. There are two fine public parks, Courtenay Park and
                    Forde Park. The town possesses iron foundries, malt-houses, flour-mills, a
                    tannery, and a brewery. The engine-works of the Great Western Railway have
                    lately been established in the town. Fine potters’ clay and pipeclay are
                    obtained in the neighbourhood, about 6000 tons being exported annually to the
                    potteries. There is a considerable trade in cattle, corn, and agricultural
                    produce. The population of Wolborough with Newton Abbot in 1881 was 7662, and of
                    Highweek 2164.</p>

                    each. The original town of Newton consists principally of one broad street, but
                    many new buildings have sprung up in the immediate neighbourhood, especially at
                    Earlestown junction, about half a mile distant. There is a town-hall, a
                    mechanics’ institute, and a grammar school. At a short distance from the town is
                    a moated timber-house, and also an ancient barrow of great extent. The Liverpool
                    farm reformatory school is in the neighbourhood. The industrial establishments
                    include the waggon factory of the London and North-Western Railway Company
                    (employing about 1000 hands), a large foundry, printing and stationery works,
