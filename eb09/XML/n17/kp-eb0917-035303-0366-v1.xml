                    (1780-1862), long foreign minister of Russia, was born at Lisbon, where his
                    father was Russian ambassador, in December 1780. Like so many other Russian
                    statesmen and soldiers, he was sprung from German ancestors settled in Livonia.
                    He entered early upon a diplomatic career, and at the age of twenty-five was
                    attached to the Russian embassy in Paris. When the alliance of Tilsit was
                    breaking down, Nesselrode was recalled to St Petersburg, and during the events
                    that followed Napoleon’s invasion of Russia he rose high in the favour of the
                    czar Alexander. From the time when Romanzoff, the advocate of a peace-policy,
                    was dismissed, Nesselrode was employed in all the great diplomatic transactions
                    of his master. He was present, though not as a plenipotentiary, at the congress
                    of Prague, and signed the treaty of Chaumont, in which the allies pledged
                    themselves to continue the struggle against Napoleon, if necessary, for twenty
                    years. In the negotiations as to the future of France, both in 1814 and 1815, he
                    seems to have encouraged the czar in his policy of moderation. At the congress
                    of Vienna his duties were shared by Capodistrias, and a certain rivalry existed
                    then and afterwards between the two statesmen. In Capodistrias the czar found
                    more sympathy both with his own earlier liberal tendencies and with his
                    religious sentimentality. In the subsequent congresses of Troppau and Laibach,
                    when Metternich, as the champion of European conservatism, set himself to
                    repress any sympathies that the czar might have for constitutional rule in
                    Naples and for Greek independence, it was with Nesselrode that he allied
                    himself; Capodistrias, a Greek and a man of more modern ideas, was now treated
                    as a dangerous person, and ultimately had to retire from office. Nesselrode
                    followed the fluctuating and reactionary course of the czar’s thoughts, and
                    remained in favour till the death of Alexander in 1825. Nicholas kept him in
                    office, and Nesselrode now promptly adapted himself to the more vigorous policy
                    that suited his new master, especially <pb break="no"

                    diplomacy of Russia throughout the contention which led to the war of 1828 and
                    to the peace of Adrianople. Years passed by, and he grew old in office, pursuing
                    with patience and discretion the ends which Russian statesmanship has always set
                    before itself. Belonging rather to the cautious than the adventurous school of
                    politicians, and attaching great value to the support of the German powers, he
                    viewed with no great pleasure the approach of the Crimean war. He continued in
                    office, however, until its close; and it is remarkable that a man who was at the
                    head of Russian diplomacy during the conflict with Napoleon I. should have lived
                    to conclude the peace of Paris under Alexander II. in 1856. He died in 1862,
                    still retaining the office of chancellor of Russia, though he had ceased to hold
                    the ministry of foreign affairs.</p>
