                <p><label type="entry">NIORT</label>, a city of France, chief town of the department
                    of Deux Sèvres, distant 255 miles south-west of Paris by the railway to Poitiers
                    and La Rochelle (here crossed by the line from Angers to Angoulême), is situated
                    at the head of navigation of the Sèvre Niortaise, partly in the valley and
                    partly on the slopes of the enclosing hills. The tower of the church of Notre
                    Dame (16th century) has a spire 246 feet high, with bell-turrets adorned with
                    statues of the evangelists, and at the base a richly-decorated dais in the
                    Renaissance style; and the north doorway shows a balustrade, whose balusters
                    form the inscription, <hi rend="italic">0 Mater Dei, memento mei.</hi> There is
                    a fine window in the apse of St André, and St Hilaire contains some beautiful
                    frescos. Of the old castle, whose site is partly occupied by the prefecture,
                    there still remains the donjon—two large square towers, flanked by several of
                    smaller dimensions. Built, it is said, by Henry II. of England or Richard Coeur
                    de Lion, the south tower contains four vaulted chambers one above the other, and
                    the platform on the top affords a fine view of the public garden (one of the
                    most picturesque in France) and the valley of the Sèvre. The old town-house (now
                    used as “justice de paix”) is known as the Aliénor or Éléonore palace, after
                    Eléonore of Guienne; near it is a Renaissance belfry. The convent of the
                    Oratorians is occupied by a public library (30,000 volumes), a picture gallery,
                    and museums of geology and antiquities—the last containing plaster copies of all
                    objects of interest in the ancient monuments of the surrounding country. Niort
                    further possesses extensive barracks, several hospitals, and a lycée named after
                    Fontanes, grandmaster of the imperial university, who was born in the town. The
                    house is still shown in which Madame de Maintenon was born while her father was
                    imprisoned in the donjon. Tanning, currying, shammy-dressing, glove-making, and
                    hair-working are the staple industries of Noirt,—gloves alone giving employment
                    to about one thousand workmen, and brushmaking, hair-working, and allied
                    industries to nearly as many. A large cotton-mill, oil-works, foundries,
                    distilleries, and a glass-work also exist in the town. Owing to the mildness of
                    its climate, Niort has admirable nurseries, and its market-gardens export onions
                    and artichokes. The population of the city in 1881 was 18,823, and that of the
                    commune 22,254.</p>
                <p>Up to the 7th century the Niort plain formed part of the Gulf of Poitou; and the
                    mouth of the Sèvre lay at the foot of the hills now occupied by the town which
                    grew up round the castle erected by Henry Plantagenet in 1155. The place was
                    captured by Louis VIII. in 1224. By the peace of Brétigny it was ceded to the
                    English; but its inhabitants revolted against the Black Prince, and most of them
                    were massacred when his troops recovered the town by assault. In 1369 Duguesclin
                    obtained possession by a stratagem. Protestantism made numerous proselytes at
                    Niort, and Coligni made himself master of the town, which successfully resisted
                    the Catholic forces after the battle of Jarnac, but surrendered without striking
                    a blow after that of Moncontour. Henry IV. rescued it from the League. It
                    suffered severely by the revocation of the edict of Nantes.</p>
