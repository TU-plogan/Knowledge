                <p><label type="entry">NEARCHUS</label>, son of Androtimus, one of the most
                    distinguished officers in the army of Alexander the Great, and admiral of his
                    fleet, with which he made an important and interesting voyage of discovery in
                    the Indian Ocean. He was a native of Crete, but settled at Amphipolis in
                    Macedonia, and must have been at an early period of life a person of some
                    consideration, as we find him attached to the court of Philip, where he became
                    the friend and companion of the young Alexander, and when the prince fell into
                    disgrace with his father Nearchus was banished, together with Ptolemy the son of
                    Lagus, Harpalus, and others, for having participated in the intrigues of
                    Olympias and her son against the old king. But after the death of Philip (336
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> he was at once recalled, and rose to great
                    favour with Alexander, which he appears to have fully merited by his abilities
                    and judgment. He did not, however, accompany him in his earlier campaigns into
                    Asia, having been left behind in the government of Lycia and the adjoining
                    provinces, where he remained for five years. But in 329 B.c. he joined the king
                    with a force of Greek mercenaries at Zariaspa in Bactria, and from this time he
                    held an important post in his army, and took an active part in his Indian
                    campaigns. Hence when Alexander had assembled his fleet on the Hydaspes, with a
                    view to descending that river and the Indus to the sea, he confided the chief
                    command of it to Nearchus. This post must, however, have been one of
                    comparatively little importance, so long as the king himself remained with the
                    fleet; but when, after descending the Indus to its mouth, and making a short
                    excursion upon the Indian Ocean, Alexander himself undertook to conduct the army
                    by land through the deserts of Gedrosia to Susa, while he confided the command
                    of the fleet to Nearchus, with orders to conduct it to the head of the Persian
                    Gulf, the position became one of great responsibility, and the success with
                    which he accomplished the task rendered his name for ever famous in
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p>He set out in the first instance from a naval station at some point in the delta
                    of the Indus; but, finding, on reaching the mouth of that river, that the
                    monsoon was still blowing with great violence, he remained for twenty-four days
                    in a neighbouring port, to which he gave the name of the Port of Alexander. This
                    is in all probability the same harbour which now forms the well-known seaport of
                    Kurrachee. Sailing thence about the beginning of November (325 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.),</hi> he proceeded for five days along the coast to
                    the westward as far as the mouth of the Arabis (now called the Poorally), and
                    thence three days further, along the coast of the Oritse, to a place called
                    Cocala, where he was able to communicate for the last time with the land army of
                    Alexander, and lay in a fresh stock of provisions. From thence he still followed
                    the coast of the Oritae for three days, as far as a place called Malana, which
                    still bears the name of Cape Malan. It was at this point that the most difficult
                    part of his voyage began, as from hence to the headland of Badis, now called
                    Cape Jask, a distance of above 400 geographical miles, his course lay along the
                    barren and inhospitable shores of the Mekran, inhabited by a very sparse
                    population, who subsisted, as they do at the present day, almost wholly upon
                    fish, for which reason they were termed by the Greeks Ichthyophagi. Hence the
                    crews of the fleet suffered severely from the want of provisions, especially
                    from that of corn or meal of any kind, of which they obtained no supply till
                    their arrival at Badis. In other respects the navigation presented no real
                    difficulties, the coast being free from reefs and other hidden dangers; and at a
                    place called Mosarna they procured a pilot, after which they were able to
                    proceed more rapidly. So slow and cautious had been their previous progress that
                    they took twenty days to accomplish the distance from Malana to Badis, which
                    Nearchus in consequence estimated at 10,000 stadia, or 1000 geographical miles,
                    more than double the true distance. The remainder of the voyage presented
                    comparatively little difficulty. After sighting from a distance the lofty
                    headland of Maceta (Cape Müssendem), which marks the entrance to the Persian
                    Gulf, the fleet put into the river Anamis in the fertile district of Harmozia
                    (Ormuz), where they were agreeably surprised by the tidings that Alexander with
                    his army was encamped at no great distance in the interior.</p>

                <p>After communicating with the king, Nearchus resumed his voyage along the northern
                    coast of the Persian Gulf to the mouth of the Euphrates, and thence ascended the
                    Pasitigris to Susa.</p>
                <p>To conduct a large fleet, consisting principally of war galleys, along so great
                    an extent of an unknown coast was undoubtedly an exploit requiring great
                    prudence and ability on the part of its commander; but the voyage of Nearchus
                    has acquired a much greater celebrity than it really deserves, both in ancient
                    and modern times, from the circumstance that it stood entirely alone in
                    antiquity, the similar expedition of Hanno along the west coast of Africa being
                    almost unknown both to the Greeks and Romans, while in modern days it has
                    attracted a greatly increased amount of attention from the accidental
                    circumstance that a complete and trustworthy record of it has been preserved.
                    Nearchus himself wrote a detailed narrative of his expedition, of which a
                    regular and full abstract was embodied by Arrian in his work on India,—one of
                    .the most interesting geographical treatises that has been transmitted to us
                    from antiquity.</p>
                <p>The success with which Nearchus had accomplished this arduous enterprise led to
                    his selection by Alexander for the more difficult task of circumnavigating the
                    great peninsula of Arabia from the mouth of the Euphrates to the Isthmus of
                    Suez. But this project was cut short by the illness and death of the king (323
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.).</hi> In the troubles that followed we hear
                    little of Nearchus, who appears to have assumed no prominent position, but we
                    learn that he attached himself to Antigonus, and probably therefore shared in
                    the downfall of that monarch (301 B.C.).</p>
                <p>The narrative of his voyage, as transmitted to us by Arrian, is contained in the
                    editions of that author’s works by Raphelius, Schmieder, and Krüger, as well as
                    in the more recent edition by Dr C. Müller (Paris, 1846), which forms part of
                    Didot’s <hi rend="italic">Biblio</hi><hi rend="italic">theca</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Graeca.</hi> But by far the most valuable edition of the
                    original text is that published by the same author, with copious geographical
                    notes, in the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Geographi</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Graeci Minores</hi> (Didot, Paris, 1855). An English
                    translation, with a very elaborate commentary, was published by Dr Vincent in
                    his <hi rend="italic">Commerce and Naviga</hi><hi rend="italic">tion of the
                        Ancients</hi><hi rend="italic">in the Indian Ocean</hi> (4to, London, 1807).
                    But much of his geographical information is now obsolete. (E. H. B. )</p>
