                    consulates on the hilly ground behind. The magnificent dock (460 feet long, 89
                    wide, and 28 deep), commenced by the prince of Hizen in 1865, and rebuilt in
                    1874-79, occupies a deep gorge between two hills at Tatagami, on the western
                    side of the firth opposite the city; a few hundred yards to the north of the
                    dock are the engine-works of Akaonura (with an area of 7 acres); and at Koski
                    there is a fine patent slip constructed for the prince of Satsuma (the prince of
                    Hizen’s rival). Nagasaki is laid out with great regularity and neatness, the
                    streets crossing each other at right angles; beginning to climb the hills, they
                    not infrequently end in stairs. Among the public buildings may be mentioned the
                    hospital established in 1861, the oldest in Japan, and the great Government
                    school, with its department for European languages and sciences, attended by
                    hundreds of Japanese of all ages and ranks. Population about 80,000.</p>
                <p>In 1825 the trade of the Dutch monopolists, who were allowed to have only two
                    vessels, amounted to upwards of £100,000 (£31,154 imports and £72,373 exports).
                    By 1871, twelve years after the opening of the port, this sum was multiplied
                    more than sevenfold (£317,727 imports, £449,855 exports), and since then there
                    has been a slight additional increase—£755,180 being the average of the four
                    years 1878-81. The principal exports are coal (£228,000 in 1881), camphor, rice
                    (now largely sent to Australia), tea, tobacco, dried fish, and vegetable wax.
                    Most of the coal, which makes excellent coke, and is freely used by men-of-war
                    and merchant steamers, is brought from the Takashima mines about 6 miles
                    distant, which give employment to 4000 workmen. The export of camphor has
                    steadily increased from 2380 piculs in 1877 to 11,640 piculs (worth £42,928) in
                    1881. Of the 333 vessels which entered the port in 1881, 280 were British.
                    Nagasaki has regular steamship communication with Shanghai, and is the terminus
                    of submarine telegraphs from that city and from Vladivostok.</p>
