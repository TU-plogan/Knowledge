                <p><label type="entry">NABATAeANS</label>, a famous people of ancient Arabia, whose
                    settlements in the time of Josephus <hi rend="italic">(Ant.,</hi> i. 12, § 4;
                    comp. Jerome, <hi rend="italic">Qu. in Gen.</hi> xxv.) gave the name of Nabatene
                    to the border-land between Syria and Arabia from the Euphrates to the Red Sea.
                    The language of Josephus suggests, and Jerome, apparently following him,
                    directly affirms, that the name is identical with that of the Ishmaelite tribe
                    of Nebaioth (<hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> &gt;T□}, Gen. xxv. 13; Isa. lx. 7),
                    which in later Old Testament times had a leading place among the northern Arabs,
                    and is associated with Kedar much as Pliny v. 11 (12) associates <hi
                        rend="italic">Nabataei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cedrei.</hi> The
                    identification is still followed by many scholars, but is rendered uncertain by
                    the fact that the name Nabataean is properly spelled with <hi rend="italic"
                        >t</hi> not <hi rend="italic">t</hi> (non: on the inscriptions, Arabic <hi
                        rend="italic">Nabat, Nabit,</hi> &lt;fcc.). Thus the history of this
                    remarkable people cannot with certainty be carried back beyond 312 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> at which date they were attacked without success
                    by Antigonus in their mountain fortress of Petra. They are described by Diodorus
                    (xix. 94 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> as being at this time a strong tribe of
                    some 10,000 warriors, preeminent among the nomadic Arabs, eschewing agriculture,
                    fixed houses, and the use of wine (which were forbidden on pain of death),
                    living on flesh and milk, and drinking water sweetened with manna, but adding to
                    pastoral pursuits a considerable and profitable trade with the seaports in myrrh
                    and spices from Arabia Felix, as well as a trade with Egypt in bitumen from the
                    Dead Sea used in the preparation of mummies. Their arid country was the best
                    safeguard of their cherished liberty; for the bottle-shaped cisterns for
                    rain-water which they excavated in the rocky or argillaceous soil were carefully
                    concealed from invaders. Petra or Sela' was the ancient capital of Edom; the
                    Nabataeans must have occupied the old Edomite country, and succeeded to its
                    commerce, after the Edomites took advantage of the Babylonian captivity to press
                    forward into southern Judaea. This migration, the date of which cannot be
                    determined, also made them masters of the shores of the Gulf of'Akaba and the
                    important harbour of Elath. Here, according to Agatharchides <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Geog. Gr. Min.,</hi> i. 178), they were for a time very troublesome, as
                    wreckers and pirates, to the reopened commerce between Egypt and the East, till
                    they were chastised by the Greek sovereigns of Alexandria.</p>
                <p>Tenacious as they were of the nomad usages of their ancestors, the Nabataeans had
                    already some tincture of foreign culture when they first appear in history. That
                    culture was naturally Aramaic; they wrote a letter to Antigonus “in Syriac
                    letters,” and Syriac continued to be the language of their coins and
                    inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom, and profited by the decay of
                    the Seleucids to extend its borders northward over the more fertile country east
                    of the Jordan. They occupied the Haurân, and about 85 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.</hi> their king Aretas (Hâritha) became lord of Damascus and Coele
                    Syria. Allies of the first Hasmonaeans in their struggles against the Greeks,
                    they became the rivals of the Judaean dynasty in the period of its splendour,
                    and a chief element in the disorders which invited Pompey’s intervention in
                    Palestine. The Roman arms were not Very successful against the sons of the
                    desert (expedition of Scaurus, 63 B.c.); King Aretas retained his whole
                    possessions, including Damascus, as a Roman vassal.<note anchored="true"

                <p>As “allies” of the Romans the Nabataeans continued to flourish throughout the
                    first Christian century. Their power extended far into Arabia, particularly
                    along the coast of the Red Sea; and Petra was a meeting-place of many nations,
                    though the importance of its commerce was diminished by the rise of the Eastern
                    trade-route from Myoshormus to Coptus on the Nile. Under the Roman peace they
                    lost their warlike habits, and were a sober, acquisitive, orderly people, wholly
                    intent on trade. They had now agriculture and houses of stone, and were not
                    unacquainted with foreign luxuries and arts (Strabo, xvi. 4). Such a people
                    might have long been a valuable bulwark between Rome and the wild hordes of the
                    desert but for the short-sighted cupidity of Trajan, who reduced Petra and broke
                    up the Nabataean nationality (105 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> The new Arab
                    invaders who soon pressed forward into their seats found the remnants of the
                    Nabataeans transformed into <hi rend="italic">fellahin,</hi> and speaking
                    Aramaic like their neighbours. Hence Nabataeans became the Arabic name for
                    Aramaeans, whether in Syria or'Irâk, a fact which was misinterpreted by
                    Quatremère into a theory that the Nabataeans were originally Aramaean immigrants
                    from Babylonia. More recent inquiry has shown this view to be quite false. The
                    Nabataeans were true Arabs—as the proper names on their inscriptions show—who
                    came under the influence of Aramaean civilization. See especially Nöldeke in <hi
