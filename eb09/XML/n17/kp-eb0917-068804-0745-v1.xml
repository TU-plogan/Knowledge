                <p><label type="entry">NYMPH</label>. The belief that the nature which surrounds
                    mankind—the woods, the springs, the hills—is full of a life resembling, yet
                    different from, human life is universal in a primitive stage of thought. At
                    Psophis in Arcadia a row of tall cypress trees was called αί <hi rend="italic"
                        >παρθένοι,</hi> the damsels. In other places the name <hi rend="italic"
                        >κόραι</hi> was used, but the general term for the spirits who dwell in
                    external nature was <hi rend="italic">vvμφaι.</hi> All three words have the same
                    meaning. There is a close relation between the souls of dead men and the life of
                    nature; the Nymphs often play the part of death and carry away human beings to
                    dwell with them. This idea appears in a slightly different form when heroes and
                    favoured mortals live in communion with them. The connexion of a human being
                    with a Nymph has something unnatural about it, and almost always brings some
                    disaster on the mortal. Yet another form’of the idea appears in the word <hi
                        rend="italic">ννρ,φόληπτος</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he whose mind the
                    Nymphs take possession of loses his human wit and becomes mad, but has wisdom
                    more than human. The worship of the Nymphs was practised throughout the
                    classical period in places where they seemed to have chosen a home for
                    themselves, in shady groves and beside springs of clear water. It retained its
                    primitive simplicity. No temple, no statue, no priest was needed; the offerings
                    of a rural people were placed on the simple altar. The cultus is therefore not
                    often mentioned in literature; but it appears to have been closely connected
                    with the household life of the people, and to have had a strong hold on them.
                    Among the ceremonies of marriage an acknowledgment of the power of the Nymphs
                    was included. The bride, herself a <hi rend="italic">vvμφη,</hi> was sprinkled
                    with water from the fresh spring of the Nymphs, or she went to bathe in the
                    spring.</p>
                <p>The Nymphs, the ever-youthful spirits of nature, protected and nourished children
                        <hi rend="italic">(κουροτρόφοι)</hi>; they were themselves often, especially
                    in Asia Minor, the mothers of the heroes of the land. In the Troad, Hermes and
                    the Sileni sport with them in the mountain caves. Their life was long, according
                    to Hesiod 9720 times that of man; it was a common belief that they were born and
