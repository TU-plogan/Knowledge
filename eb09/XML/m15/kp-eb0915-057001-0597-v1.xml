                    the province of Trapani, 20 miles south of Trapani, to the north of the river
                    Marsala, with a station on the railway between Trapani and Palermo. A
                    flourishing and well-built town, with wide paved streets, it possesses a castle,
                    a cathedral, a theatre, cavalry barracks (now occupied by Government offices),
                    an academy of science and literature, and a public library. The Corinthian
                    columns of the cathedral were originally intended for the cathedral at
                    Canterbury, and owe their present destination to the wreck of the vessel which
                    was conveying them to England. After the destruction of its harbour in the
                    latter part of the 16th century as a precaution against its occupation by <pb

                    importance of Marsala remained in abeyance till the construction of the new port
                    to the south of the town. The sea-wall for this was begun in 1818; but it was
                    not till 1835-36 that the pier was constructed. A great part of the surface of
                    44 acres constituting the port is now silted up; new works, however, on an
                    extensive scale, are being undertaken. The wine trade, which forms the staple,
                    was commenced in the end of the last century by Woodhouse &amp; Co.; and the
                    wines first got into favour by being supplied to the English fleet in 1802. They
                    are for the most part white, and are usually “fortified.” The number of seagoing
                    vessels that entered at Marsala in 1863 was 149, with a burden of 9791 tons; in
                    1880 there were 249 vessels of 16,645 tons. From 31,350 in 1861 the population
                    of the commune had increased by 1881 to 40,251; that of the town was 14,105 in
                    1871, or, with the suburbs of Porta Garibaldi, Porta Mazzara, and Porta Trapani,
                    17,666.</p>
                <p>On the small island of San Pantaleone, about 6 miles north of Marsala, lay the

                    397 B.c. the defeated party established a new colony on the neighbouring
                    promontory of Lilybaeum. It was there that in 276 B.c. the Carthaginians held
                    out successfully against Pyrrhus, who had already driven them from the rest of
                    Sicily; and it was only after a siege of ten years that in the first Punic War
                    they were obliged to surrender the fortress to the Romans. Under its new
                    possessors Lilybaeum continued to flourish and became the residence of one of
                    the two quaestors of Sicily. It was still an important city under the later
                    empire, and when occupied first by the Goths and then by the Vandale. The Arabs
                    called it Mersa <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> Aly, “port of ‘Aly,” and Edrisi
                    (12th century) describesit as a considerable town, which, having been ruined,
                    had been restored by Roger I. It was at Marsala that Garibaldi began his
                    Sicilian campaign in 1860.</p>
