                <p><label type="entry">MELANESIA</label>. This term comprises that long belt of
                    island groups which, beginning in the Indian archipelago at the east limits of
                    the region there occupied by the Malay race, and, as it were, a prolongation of
                    that great island region, runs south-east for a distance of some 3500 English
                    miles, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> from New Guinea at the equator, in 130° E.
                    long., to New Caledonia just within the Tropic, 167° E. long., and eastwards to
                    Fiji, in 180°. This chain of groups has a certain geographical as well as
                    ethnical unity. Its curve follows roughly the outline of the Australian coast,
                    and large islands occur, with a number of small ones, along the whole length,
                    with mountains of considerable height, coinciding pretty closely with a line of
                    volcanic action. Melanesia is usually held to begin with New Guinea, this great
                    island being then viewed as the headquarters of that dark Papuan race which,
                    widely and variously modified in all the other groups, occupies the whole
                    region, as the name Melanesia implies; but the race really extends farther west,
                    for the large islands Flores and Timor, with several smaller ones, are also
                    essentially Papuan.</p>
                <p>New Guinea, 1490 miles long, and containing about 303,000 square miles, the
                    largest island in the world after Australia, is clothed with almost impenetrable
                    forests, through which mountain ranges rise to a height of 13,000 feet. Parallel
                    to its longer axis, 150 miles to the north, are the Admiralty Islands, all
                    small, with one exception, in which the hills rise to 1600 feet, and which is
                    probably of volcanic origin, as the natives use spearheads and implements of
                    obsidian. A Polynesian element seems to be present, and customs peculiar to both
                    races have been observed. Mr H. N. Moseley, of the “Challenger,” found them
                    shrewd but honest traders, with much artistic skill in their carvings and
                    designs. They have numerals up to 10, with an idiom for 8 and 9, viz., 10-2 and
                    10-1, which is found also at Yap in the Carolines, and in the Marshall
                    Islands.</p>
                <p>Next follow, east, the two large islands of New Britain, about 340 by 23 English
                    miles, with active volcanoes up to 4000 feet, and New Ireland, about 240 by 22
                    miles. Next comes the Solomon group, 600 English miles in length, with seven
                    large islands from 135 to 90 miles long, all running north-west and south-east,
                    with volcanic peaks up to 8000 feet. The forms more characteristic of the New
                    Guinea fauna do not extend beyond this group. Its forest vegetation is
                    especially luxuriant. Then comes Santa Cruz, a small group partly volcanic, but
                    with numerous coral reef islands. Then the Banks and New Hebrides group, over
                    500 English miles in length, all volcanic except the Torres reef islands in the
                    north. Several spots in this group are occupied by people of purely Polynesian
                    race, immigrants apparently from the eastward. Two hundred miles southwest from
                    the New Hebrides lies the island of New Caledonia, about 240 by 25 English
                    miles. It is in parts very mountainous, rising to 5380 feet, the rocks being
                    sedimentary and plutonic, but there are no volcanoes. It lies half way between
                    Australia and Fiji, 700 miles from each. Being outside the equatorial belt, it
                    is much drier and more barren than the other groups, and its fauna and flora
                    have many Australian and Polynesian affinities. The small Loyalty chain lies 70
                    miles east of New Caledonia, and parallel to it. Fiji is detached from the other
                    Melanesian groups, and differs from them in various particulars. It consists of
                    two large and about 300 small islands, the total area being about 7400 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>Of the two great Pacific races—the brown Polynesian, and the dark Melanesian—the
                    former, considering the vast region it occupies, is singularly homogeneous both
                    in appearance and language, whereas in Melanesia even neighbouring tribes differ
                    widely from each other in both respects. Still, all the Melanesians have certain
                    common characteristics which distinguish them sharply from the other race. They
                    stand at a lower level of civilization, as is well seen at certain spots in
                    Melanesia where isolated Polynesian settlements exist, due probably to
                    involuntary migration, and where the two races, though they have some peculiar
                    customs in common, live in bitter mutual hostility. The Melanesians are mostly
                    “negroid” in appearance, nearly black, with crisp curly hair elaborately
                    dressed; the women hold a much lower position than among the Polynesians; their
                    institutions, social, political, and religious, are simpler, their manners ruder
                    and often indecent; they have few or no traditions; cannibalism, in different
                    degrees, is almost universal; but their artistic skill and taste, as with some
                    of the lower African negroes, are remarkable, and they are amenable to
                    discipline and fair treatment. Their languages, amid considerable differences,
                    which, as between the Melanesian proper and the Papuan, are very wide, have
                    features which mark them off clearly from the Polynesian, notwithstanding
                    certain fundamental relations with the latter.</p>
                <p>The various Melanesian groups will be found described in detail under separate
                    headings.</p>
