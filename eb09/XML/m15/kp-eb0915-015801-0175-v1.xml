                    (1636-1691), of Rosehaugh, knight, a prominent Scottish lawyer, was the grandson
                    of Kenneth, first Lord Mackenzie of Kintail, and the nephew of Colin and George,
                    first and second earls of Seaforth; his mother was a daughter of Dr Andrew
                    Bruce, principal of St Leonard’s College, St Andrews. He was born at Dundee in
                    1636, and, having passed through the grammar school there, was sent at an early
                    age to college at Aberdeen, and afterwards at St Andrews, graduating at sixteen.
                    He then engaged for three years in the study of the civil law at Bourges; on his
                    return to Scotland he was called to the bar in 1656, and before the Restoration
                    had risen into considerable practice. Immediately after the Restoration he was
                    appointed a “justice-depute,” and it is recorded that he and his colleagues in
                    that office were ordained by the parliament in 1661 “to repair, once in the week
                    at least, to Musselburgh and Dalkeith, and to try and judge such persons as are
                    there or thereabouts delate of witchcraft.” In the same year he acted as counsel
                    for the marquis of Argyll; soon afterwards he was knighted, and he represented
                    the county of Ross during the four sessions of the parliament which was called
                    in 1669. He succeeded Sir John Nisbet as king’s advocate in August 1677, and in
                    the discharge of this office became implicated in all the worst acts of the
                    Scottish administration of Charles II., earning for himself an unenviable
                    distinction as “the bloody Mackenzie.” His refusal to concur in the measures for
                    dispensing with the penal laws against Catholics led to his removal from office
                    in 1686, but he was reinstated in February 1688. At the Revolution, being a
                    member of convention, he was one of the minority of five in the division on the
                    forfeiture of the crown. King William was urged to declare him incapacitated for
                    holding any public office, but refused to accede to the proposal. When the death
                    of Dundee (September 1689) had finally destroyed the hopes of his party in
                    Scotland, Mackenzie betook himself to Oxford, where, admitted a student by a
                    grace passed on June 2, 1690, he was allowed to spend the rest of his days in
                    the enjoyment of the ample fortune he had acquired, and in the prosecution of
                    his literary labours. One of his last acts before leaving Edinburgh had been to
                    pronounce (March 15, 1689), as dean of the faculty of advocates, the inaugural
                    oration at the foundation of the Advocates’ Library. He died at Westminster on
                    May 8, 1691, and was buried in Greyfriars churchyard, Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>While still a young man Sir George Mackenzie appears to have aspired to eminence
                    in the domain of pure literature, his earliest publication having been <hi
                        rend="italic">Aretina, or a Serious Romance</hi> (anon., 1660); it was
                    followed, also anonymously, by <hi rend="italic">Religio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Stoici,</hi><hi rend="italic">a Short Discourse upon several Divine and
                        Moral Subjects</hi> (1663), <hi rend="italic">A Moral Essay, preferring
                        Solitude to Public Employment</hi> (1665), and one or two other
                    disquisitions of a similar nature. None of these earlier efforts are now read,
                    if they ever were; and perhaps Mackenzie’s strongest claim to be remembered at
                    all in connexion with belles lettres is that which rests upon Dryden’s grateful
                    reminiscence of some stimulating conversation held with “that noble wit of
                    Scotland, Sir George Mackenzie,” aboutl673. (See Dryden’s “Discourse on the
                    Origin and Progress of Satire,” prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Juvenal</hi>
                    in 1693.) His most important legal works are entitled <hi rend="italic">A
                        Discourse upon the Lawsand Customs of Scotland in Matters Criminal</hi>
                    (1678), <hi rend="italic">Observations upon the Laws and Customs of Nations as
                        to Precedency, with the Science of Heraldry</hi> (1680), <hi rend="italic"
                        >Institutions of the Law of Scotland</hi> (1684), and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Observations upon the Acts of Parliament</hi> (1686); of these the
                    last-named is the most important, the <hi rend="italic">Institutions</hi> being
                    completely overshadowed by the similar work of his great contemporary Stair. In
                    his <hi rend="italic">Jus</hi><hi rend="italic">Regium</hi><hi rend="italic">;
                        or the Just and Solid Foundations of Monarchy in general, and more
                        especially of the Monarchy of Scotland, maintained</hi> (1684), Mackenzie
                    appears as an uncompromising advocate of the highest doctrines of prerogative.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Vindication of the Government of Scotland during the reign
                        of</hi><hi rend="italic">Charles</hi><hi rend="italic">II.</hi> is valuable
                    as a piece of contemporary history. The collected <hi rend="italic">Works</hi>
                    were published at Edinburgh (2 vols, f&gt;&gt;l.) in 1716-22; and <hi
                        rend="italic">Memoirs of the Affairs of Scotland from the Restoration of
                        King Charles 11.,</hi> from previously unpublished MSS., in 1821. It may be
                    well to add that the subject of this notice must not be confounded with Dr
                    George Mackenzie, the author of <hi rend="italic">Lives and Characters of the
                        Most Eminent Writers of the Scots Nation</hi> (1708-22).</p>
