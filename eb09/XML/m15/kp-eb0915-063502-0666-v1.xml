                    (1782—1824)., novelist and dramatist, perplexed the serious and served as a butt
                    for the more light-minded critics of the first quarter of the 19th century. The
                    bombastic extravagance of his language, the incoherence of his plots, the wild
                    improbability of many of his incidents, the inconsistency of his characters,
                    were obvious and undeniable; but there were so many passages of extraordinary
                    eloquence in his novels, especially in his descriptions of turbulent passion,
                    that, though some pronounced him evidently mad, all admitted that it was a
                    madness allied to genius. At first he published only sermons in his own name,
                    being curate of St Peter’s, Dublin. His first novels, <hi rend="italic">The
                        Fatal Revenge</hi> (1804), <hi rend="italic">The Wild Irish Boy</hi> (1808),
                        <hi rend="italic">The Milesian Chief</hi> (1811), were issued under the
                    pseudonym of Dennis Jasper Murphy. All these were mercilessly ridiculed by the
                    press and neglected by the public, but the irregular power displayed in them
                    attracted the notice of some social and literary magnates; and through the
                    influence of Byron and Scott Maturin’s tragedy of <hi rend="italic">Bertram</hi>
                    was produced at Drury Lane in 1816, with a prologue by Hobhouse, an epilogue by
                    the Hon. George Lamb, and with Kean and Miss Kelly in the leading parts. The
                    magnificent scenic situations, and the character of Bertram (like one of Byron’s
                    sombre heroes), make this an effective stage play. It was the first and only
                    success of the author; he returned to “the baffled efforts and the blighted
                    hopes” of which Hobhouse speaks in his prologue. Two more tragedies, <hi
                        rend="italic">Manuel</hi> (1817) and <hi rend="italic">Fredolpho</hi>
                    (1819), were failures. A poem, <hi rend="italic">The Universe</hi> (1821), fell
                    flat. Three novels, <hi rend="italic">Women</hi> (1818), <hi rend="italic"
                        >Melmoth</hi> (1820), and <hi rend="italic">The Albigenses</hi> (1824),
                    produced a considerable impression. In the preface to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Women</hi> he admitted that his previous novels had been justly condemned,
                    being an impossible attempt to revive the exploded style of Mrs Radcliffe, and
                    promised that he would enter on a new vein. But he could not alter his
                    character. The new vein was as wild, fantastic, incoherent, interspersed with
                    passages of really splendid eloquence, as the old. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Albigenses</hi> was to be the first of a series of historical romances,
                    illustrating periods of European history, and it was noticed in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Westminster Review</hi> as giving, with all its faults,
                    promise of better things; but the author died in the year of its
                    publication.</p>
