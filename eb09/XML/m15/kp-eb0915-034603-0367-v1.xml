                <p><label type="entry">MÁLWÁ</label>, an historical province of Central India,
                    roughly coextensive with the western portion of the Central India agency, is
                    bounded on the N. by Hindustan Proper, on the E. by Bundelkhand, on the S. by
                    the Deccan, and on the W. by Râjputâna. It consists of an upland region, with
                    many fertile valleys, included within the main rivers of the Ganges, the Sôn,
                    the Chambal, and the Nerbudda. In prehistoric times the capital was the ancient
                    city of Ujain (Oojein), associated in Hindu legend with the great king
                    Vikramâditya, the date of whose accession (57 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi>
                    has given the “Samvat” era to all India. The Mohammedan chronicler Ferishta
                    describes Mâlwâ as the kingdom of an independent râjâ, when Mahmùd of Ghazni
                    invaded India in the beginning of the 11th century. I.· appears to have first
                    fallen into the hands of the Moslems about 1309, during the reign of the Delhi
                    emperor Alâ-ud-din. When the Tughlak dynasty was weakened by the repeated
                    attacks of the Mughals, their viceroy in Mâlwâ succeeded in establishing his
                    independence. The first Moslem king of Mâlwâ was Dilâwar Khân Ghori, of Afghân
                    origin, who ruled from 1387 to 1405, and placed his capital at Mandu. He was
                    succeeded by his son Hosharιg Ghori, to whom are attributed most of the
                    magnificent ruins still to be seen at Mandu. In 1526 the Ghori dynasty came to
                    an end, being overthrown by Bahâdur Shàh of Guzerât; and in 1570 Mâlwâ was, on
                    the conquest of Guzerât by the emperor Akbar, incorporated in the Mughal
                    dominions. On the decay of the Delhi empire in the 18th century, Mâlwâ was one
                    of the first provinces to be overrun by the Mahrattas. In 1737 the peshwâ
                    exacted <hi rend="italic">chauth,</hi> or one-fourth of the revenue, and at a
                    later date the two great military chiefs Sindhia and Holkar carved out for
                    themselves kingdoms, which their descendants still retain. But the Mahrattas set
                    up no organized government, so that Mâlwâ, besides its native population of
                    predatory Bhils, became the refuge of all the mercenary bandits of the
                    peninsula. In the beginning of the present century, the depredations of these
                    bandits or Pindâris led to what is sometimes known as the fourth Mahratta war of
                    1817, under the governor-generalship of Lord Hastings. As the result, the
                    Pindâris were extirpated; and under the rule of Sir John Malcolm the Bhils were
                    tamed, and the jungles were cleared of wild beasts. Many of the Bhils have been
                    enlisted as British soldiers; and the headquarters of the Mâlwâ Bhil corps is at
                    Sardârpur. At the present day Mâlwâ is best known as giving its name to the
                    opium which is annually exported from Bombay to the amount of about 37,000
                    chests.</p>
