                <p><label type="entry">MAXIMUS</label>, the name of four Roman emperors. In
                    chronological order the first was Μ. Clodius Pupienus Maximus, who was
                    associated with Balbinus in the imperial dignity by the senate for a short time
                    in 238, before and after the death of the hated Maximin. Tho second was Magnus
                    Clemens Maximus, a native of Spain, who shared the imperial dignity with
                    Valentinian and Theodosius from 383 to 388. He had accompanied Theodosius on
                    several expeditions, and from 368 held high military rank in Britain. The
                    disaffection of the Roman troops towards the emperor Gratian found expression in
                    383 in the proclamation of Maximus as emperor, —whether with or without his
                    complicity in the act is uncertain. Voluntarily or under compulsion Maximus
                    forthwith attacked Gratian in Gaul, and drove him from Paris to Lyons, where the
                    fugitive was murdered. Circumstances made it difficult for Theodosius at the
                    time to avenge the death of his colleague by war, and an agreement was therefore
                    come to by which Maximus was recognized as Augustus and sole emperor in Gaul,
                    Spain, and Britain, while Valentinian was to remain unmolested in Italy and
                    Illyricum, Theodosius retaining his sovereignty in the East. A prosperous reign
                    of four years having tempted Maximus, in 387, to pass the Alps, Valentinian was
                    speedily put to flight, while the invader established himself in Milan, and for
                    the time became master of Italy. Theodosius now took vigorous measures:
                    advancing a powerful army by land, he utterly defeated the western, troops at
                    Siscia (Sciszek) in Pannonia, and, passing the Julian Alps with great rapidity,
                    came upon Maximus, who had fled to Aquileia, seized him, and caused him to be
                    beheaded (August 388). The third, Maximus Tyrannus, was made emperor in Spain by
                    the Roman general Gerontius, <pb break="no"

                    Alter the defeat of Gerontius at Arles, and his subsequent death in 411, Maximus
                    renounced the imperial title and was permitted by Constantine to retire into
                    private life. About 418 he rebelled again, but, failing in his attempt, was
                    seized, carried into Italy, and put to death at Ravenna in 422. Lastly,
                    Petronius Maximus was a member of the higher Roman nobility, and had held a
                    large number of public offices, including those of praefectus Romae (420) and of
                    praefectus Italiae (439-441 and 445). He was one of the intimate associates of
                    Valentinian, who received his assistance in the palace intrigues which led to
                    the death of Aetius in 454; but a brutal outrage committed on the wife of
                    Maximus by the emperor turned his friendship into the bitterest hatred. Maximus
                    was proclaimed emperor immediately after Valentinian’s murder in March 455, but
                    reigned for less than three months, having been murdered by some Burgundian
                    mercenaries as he was flying before the Vandals, who, invited by Eudoxia, the
                    widow of Valentinian, had landed at the mouth of the Tiber (May or June
                    455).</p>
