                <p><label type="entry">MANILA HEMP</label>, the most valuable of all fibres for
                    cordage, is the produce of the leaf-stalks of <hi rend="italic">Musa</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">textilis,</hi> a native of the Philippine Islands. The plant,
                    called <hi rend="italic">abaca</hi> by the islanders, throws up a spurious stem
                    from its rhizome, consisting of a cluster of sheathing leaf-stalks which rise to
                    a height of from 20 to 30 feet, and spread out into a crown of huge undivided
                    leaves characteristic of the various species of <hi rend="italic">Musa</hi>
                    (plantain, banana, &amp;c.). In its native regions the plant is rudely
                    cultivated solely as a source of fibre; it requires little attention, and when
                    about three years old develops flowers on a central stem, at which stage it is
                    in the most favourable condition for yielding fibre. The stock is then cut down,
                    and the sheathing stalks torn asunder and reduced to small strips. These strips
                    in their fresh succulent condition are drawn between a sharp knife-edged
                    instrument and a hard wooden block to which it is fixed, and by repeated
                    scraping in this way the soft cellular matter which surrounds the fibre is
                    removed, and the fibre so cleaned has only to be hung up to dry in the open air,
                    when, without further treatment, it is ready for use. Each stock yields, on an
                    average, a little under 1 lb of fibre; and two natives cutting down plants and
                    separating fibre will prepare not more than 25 ft» per day. The fibre yielded by
                    the outer layer of leaf-stalks is hard, fully developed, and. strong, but the
                    produce of the inner stalks is increasingly thin, fine, and weak. The finer
                    fibre is used by the natives, without spinning or twisting (the ends of the
                    single fibres being knotted together), for making exceedingly fine, light, and
                    transparent yet comparatively strong textures, which they use as articles of
                    dress and ornament. The hemp exported for cordage purposes is a somewhat woody
                    fibre, of a bright brownish-white colour, and possessing great durability and
                    strainresisting power. It contains a very considerable amount of adherent
                    pectinous matter, and an unusually large proportion, as much as 12 per cent., of
                    water in a dry condition. In a damp atmosphere the fibre absorbs moisture so
                    freely that it has been found to contain not less than 40 per cent, of water, a
                    circumstance which dealers in the raw fibre should bear in mind. The plant has
                    been introduced into many tropical lands; but the cheapness of labour in its
                    native regions, and its abundance there, prevent its being a profitable
                    substance for general cultivation. The entire supply comes from Manila and Cebu
                    in the Philippine Islands, where its cultivation and preparation must give
                    employment to a very large population. The exports, which are increasing with
                    great rapidity, amounted in 1881 to about 400,000 bales of 2∣ cwts. each, almost
                    the whole of which goes to the United Kingdom, the United States, and the
                    Australian colonies. The quantity imported into <pb break="no"

                    valued at &lt;£678,514. The fibre is now so valuable that manila hemp cordage is
                    freely adulterated by manufacturers, chiefly by admixture of phormium (New
                    Zealand flax) and Russian hemp.</p>
