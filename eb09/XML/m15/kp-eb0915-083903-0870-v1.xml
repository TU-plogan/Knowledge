                    expedition against Chedorlaomer, and blessed him in the name of the supreme God,
                    possessor (or maker) of heaven and earth. And Abram gave him tithes of all his
                    booty (Gen. xiv. 18-20). The Bible history tells us nothing more about
                    Melchizedek (comp. Hebrews vii. 3); but the majestic figure of the king-priest,
                    prior to the priesthood of the law, to whom even the father of all Israel paid
                    tithes, suggested a figurative or typical application, first in Psalm ex. to the
                    vicegerent of Jehovah, seated on the throne of Zion, the king of Israel who is
                    also priest after the order of Melchizedek, and then, after the gospel had
                    confirmed the Messianic interpretation of the Psalm (Matt, xxii. 42 sy.), to the
                    kingly priesthood of Jesus, as that idea is worked out at length in the Epistle
                    to the Hebrews.</p>
                <p>The theological interest which attaches to the idea of the pre-Aaronic
                    king-priest in these typical applications is practically independent of the
                    historical questions suggested by the narrative of Gen. xiv. It is generally
                    recognized that this chapter holds quite an isolated place in the Pentateuchal
                    history; it is the only passage which presents Abraham in the character of a
                    warrior, and connects him with historical names and political movements, and
                    there are no clear marks by which it can be assigned to any one of the documents
                    of which Genesis is made up. Thus, while one school of interpreters finds in the
                    chapter the earliest fragment of the political history of western Asia, some
                    even holding with Ewald that the narrative is probably based on old Canaanite
                    records, other critics, as Nqldeke, regard the whole as unhistorical and
                    comparatively late in origin. On the latter view, which finds its main support
                    in the intrinsic difficulties of the narrative, it is scarcely possible to avoid
                    the conclusion that the chapter is one of the latest additions to the Pentateuch
                    (Wellhausen). The historical arguments <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">con</hi> may be seen at length in recent commentaries, but
                    especially in Tuch’s essay (Z. <hi rend="italic">D. Μ. G.,</hi> i. 161 <hi
                        rend="italic">sq.,</hi> reprinted in the second edition of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Genesis),</hi> which was long viewed as decisive in favour of
                    the narrative, and in Nöldeke’s <hi rend="italic">Untersuchungen,</hi> 1869, p.
                    156 <hi rend="italic">sq.,</hi> with which compare Wellhausen in <hi

                    The Assyrian monuments offer no decisive evidence, but are held to confirm the
                    historical possibility of the proper names (Schrader, <hi rend="italic">Kl.
                        und</hi><hi rend="italic">AT.,</hi> p. 46 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi>;
                    Delitzsch, <hi rend="italic">Paradies,</hi> p. 224). Here we can only speak of
                    the episode of Melchizedek, which, though connected with the main narrative by
                    the epithets given to Jehovah in verse 22, seems to break the natural connexion
                    of verses 17 and 21, and may perhaps have come originally from a separate
                    source. As the narrative now stands Salem must be sought in the vicinity of “the
                    king’s dale,” which from 1 Sam. xviii. 18 probably but not necessarily lay near
                    Jerusalem. That Salem is Jerusalem, as in Psalm lxxvi. 2, is the ancient and
                    common view, and is necessarily followed by those who view Melchizedek as a late
                    creation. Those who hold the opposite view now lean to the identification with
                    the ∑αλ∈iμ of John iii. 23, 8 miles south of Bethshean, which Jerome <hi
                        rend="italic">{Ep.</hi> lxxiii. <hi rend="italic">ad Evangelium)</hi>
                    confirms by a worthless tradition. In a genuine record of extreme antiquity the
                    union of king and priest in one person, the worship of El as the supreme deity
                    by a Canaanite,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>On the
                            other hand it is not correct to appeal to the <hi rend="italic"
                                >Poenulus</hi> of Plautus for the epithet elyôn.</p></note> and the
                    widespread practice of the consecration of a tithe of booty can present no
                    difficulty; but, if the historical character of the narrative is denied, the
                    origin of the conception must be placed as late as the rise of the temporal
                    authority of the high priests after the exile. An ancient legend identifies
                    Melchizedek with Shem (Palestinian Targum, Jerome on Isa. xli., Ephraem Syrus
                        <hi rend="italic">in loco).</hi></p>
