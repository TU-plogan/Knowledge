                    N. lat. and 63° 6' and 63° 31' W. long. The greatest length is 43 miles, the
                    mean width 19; and the surface comprises 244,090 acres, or 380 square miles. A
                    cluster of volcanic mountains in the north, a similar group in the south, and a
                    line of lower heights between them, form the backbone of the island, which

                    season become deep and too often destructive torrents. The east coast of the
                    island, exposed to the full sweep of the Atlantic, is a succession of inlets,
                    headlands, islands, and rocks; the south coast is much more regular, but bold
                    and steep; and the west alone presents, in the bay of Fort de France, a stretch
                    of mangrove swamp. Of the total area, about 83,990 acres are under cultivation,
                    83,843 occupied by forest and savanna, and 68,837 by fallow. On an average,
                    according to the returns for 1874-78 inclusive, 47,440 acres are devoted to the
                    sugar crop, 1290 to coffee, 640 to cotton, and 1660 to cocoa. The mean annual
                    temperature is 81° in the coast region,—the monthly mean for June being 83°, and
                    that of January 77°. Of the annual rainfall of 87 inches, August has the
                    heaviest share (11 '3 inches), though the rainy season extends from June to
                    October; March, the lowest, has 3 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 7.
                    Martiniqueenjoys a remarkable immunity from hurricanes; half a century may pass
                    without serious disaster from such a visitation. In 1878 there were 162,861
                    inhabitants (77,782 males, 85,079 females) in the island, which is thus nearly
                    as densely peopled as Belgium. Since 1848 the increase amounts to about 42,800.
                    Of the twenty-five communes, fourteen have more than 5000 inhabitants; the
                    largest are Saint Pierre (23,909), Fort de France (15,414), Lamentin (13,409),
                    and François (10,297). The great mass of the population consists of Creole
                    negroes and half-castes of various grades, ranging from the “Saccatra,” who has
                    hardly retained any trace of Caucasian blood, to the so-called “Sangmêlé,” with
                    his mere suspicion of negro commixture. Marriage is frequently ignored, and of
                    the births no less than 66 per cent, are illegitimate.</p>
                <p>Fort de France, the chief town, a place of about 11,000 inhabitants, stands on a
                    bay on the west coast. Since the earthquake of 1839 nearly all the houses are of
                    wood, and have only one story; the streets are laid out with great regularity.
                    An abundant supply of water was introduced in 1856. St Pierre, the commercial
                    centre of the island, with about 20,000 inhabitants, lies farther north on the
                    same coast. It consists of a lower and an upper town,—the one close and
                    unhealthy, and the other for the most part well-ventilated and pleasant.</p>
                <p>Martinique, also called Madiana or Mantinino, was discovered by Columbus 15th
                    June 1502. It was at that time inhabited by Caribs (Galibis) who had expelled or
                    incorporated an older stock. In 1635 a Norman captain, D’Enambuc, from St
                    Christopher’s, took possession of the island, and in 1637 his nephew Duparquet
                    became captain-general of the colony, now numbering seven hundred men. In 1654
                    welcome was given to three hundred Jews expelled from Brazil, and by 1658 there
                    were at least five thousand people exclusive of the Câribs, who were soon after
                    exterminated. Purchased by the French Government from Duparquet’s children for
                    120,000 livres, Martinique was assigned to the West India Company, butin 1674 it
                    became part of the royal domain. The <hi rend="italic">habitants</hi> (French
                    landholders) at first devoted themselves to the cultivation of cotton and
                    tobacco; but in 1650 sugar plantations were commenced, and in 1726 the coffee
                    plant was introduced by Desclieux, who, when water ran short during his voyage
                    to the island, shared his scanty allowance with his seedlings. Slave labour
                    having been introduced, there were 72,000 blacks in the island by 1736.
                    Martinique has several times been occupied by the English Captured by Rodney in
                    1762, it was next year restored to the French; but after the conquest by Sir
                    John Jervis and Sir Charles Grey in 1794 it was retained for eight years · and
                    seized again in 1809, it was not surrendered till 1814.</p>
