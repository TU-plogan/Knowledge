                <p><label type="entry">MEGHNÁ</label>, a river of India, forming, in the lower part
                    of its course, the great estuary of the Bengal delta, which conveys to the sea
                    the main body of the waters of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, which unite at
                    Goalânda in Faridpur district. The united waters thence roll south— a mighty
                    river of great depth and turbidness, sometimes split up into half a dozen
                    channels by sand-banks of its own formation, sometimes spreading out into a
                    widespread sheet of water which the eye cannot see across. The river enters the
                    sea by four principal mouths, enclosing the three large islands of Dakshin
                    Shâhbazpur, Hatia, and Sandwip. It is navigable by native boats of the largest
                    burden, and also by river steamers, all the year through; but the navigation is
                    difficult, and sometimes dangerous, on account of shifting sand-banks and
                    “snags,” and boisterous weather when the monsoon is blowing. The most favourable
                    season for navigation is between November and February. Alluvion and diluvion
                    are constantly taking place, especially along the seaboard, and in Noâkhâli
                    district the land is said to have advanced seawards 4- miles in twenty-three
                    years; while the islands fringing the mouth are annually being cut away and
                    redeposited in fresh shapes.</p>
                <p>The tidal phenomena of the Meghnâ surpass those of any other Indian river. The
                    regular rise of the tide is from 10 to 18 feet, and at springs the sea rushes up
                    in a single wave, known as the “bore,”—on the Meghnâ a justly dreaded danger to
                    boatmen. It is greatest at the time of the biennial equinoxes, when navigation
                    is sometimes impeded for days together. The tidal wave'is suddenly beheld
                    advancing like a wall topped with foam of the height of nearly 20 feet, and at
                    the rate of 15 miles an hour; in a few minutes all is over, and the river has
                    changed from ebb to flood tide. A still greater danger is the “storm wave,”
                    which occasionally sweeps up the Meghnâ in the shape of cyclones. The latest and
                    most destructive of these disasters were those of May 1867 and October 1876,

                    the population in the mainland portion of Noâkhâli, and in the islands of
                    Sandwip and Hatia, were drowned, and that a like proportion subsequently died of
                    cholera and other diseases caused by the results of the storm.</p>
