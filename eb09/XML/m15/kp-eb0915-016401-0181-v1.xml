                    1811-1870), subject and history painter, was born at Cork, the son of a Highland
                        soldier.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The year of
                            his birth is uncertain; he himself used to assert that the 25th of
                            January 1811 was the correct date, but research in the register of the
                            old Presbyterian church in Cork seems to prove that he was born on 2d
                            February 1806.</p></note> His education was of the plainest kind, but he
                    was eager for culture, fond of reading, and anxious to become an artist. His
                    father, however, placed him, in 1820, in Newenham’s Bank, where he remained for
                    two years, and then left to study in the Cork school of art. In 1825 it happened
                    that Sir Walter Scott was travelling in Ireland, and young Maclise, having seen
                    him in a bookseller’s shop, made a surreptitious sketch of the great man, which
                    he afterwards lithographed. It was exceedingly popular, and the artist became
                    celebrated enough to receive many commissions for portraits, which he executed,
                    in pencil, with very careful treatment of detail and accessory. Various
                    influential friends perceived the genius and promise of the lad, and were
                    anxious to furnish him with the means of studying in the metropolis; but with
                    rare independence he refused all aid, and by careful economy saved a sufficient
                    sum to enable him to leave for London. There he made a lucky hit by a sketch of
                    the younger Kean, which, like his portrait of Scott, was lithographed and
                    published. He entered the Academy schools in 1828, and carried off the highest
                    prizes open to the students, including, in 1829, the gold medal for the best
                    historical composition. In the same year he exhibited for the first time in the
                    Royal Academy. Gradually he began to confine himself more exclusively to subject
                    and historical pictures, varied occasionally by portraits of Campbell, Miss
                    Landon, Dickens, and other of his celebrated literary <pb break="no"

                    Night, or All Hallow Eve in Ireland, and Mokanna Unveiling his Features to
                    Zelica, which greatly increased his reputation, and were followed in the
                    succeeding year by the powerfully dramatic subject of the Installation of
                    Captain Rock, and in 1835 by the Chivalric Vow of the Ladies and the Peacock, a
                    work which procured his election as associate of the Academy, of which he became
                    full member in 1840. The years that followed were occupied with a long series of
                    figure pictures, deriving their subjects from history and tradition, and from
                    the works of Shakespeare, Goldsmith, and Le Sage. He also designed illustrations
                    for Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Irish Melodies,</hi> Lytton’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pilgrims of the Rhine,</hi> and several of Dickens’s Christmas books, and
                    for <hi rend="italic">The Story of the Norman Conquest</hi> and Shakespeare’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Seven Ages,</hi> published by the Art Union. Between the
                    years 1830 and 1836 he contributed to <hi rend="italic">Fraser's Magazine,</hi>
                    under the <hi rend="italic">nοm-de crayon</hi> of Alfred Croquis, a very
                    remarkable series of portraits of the literary and other celebrities of the
                    time,—character studies, etched or lithographed in outline, and touched more or
                    less with the emphasis of the caricaturist, which have been since reproduced and
                    published in a volume. In 1858 Maclise commenced one of the two great monumental
                    works of his life, the Meeting of Wellington and Blücher, on the walls of
                    Westminster Palace, where he had previously painted his Spirit of Religion and
                    his Spirit of Chivalry. It was begun in fresco, a process which proved
                    unmanageable. The artist wished to resign the task; but, encouraged by Prince
                    Albert, he studied in Berlin the new method of “water-glass’’painting, and
                    carried out the subject and its companion, the Death of Nelson, in that medium,
                    completing the latter painting in 1864. The intense application which he gave to
                    these great historic works, and the various depressing and discouraging
                    circumstances connected with the commission, had a serious effect on the
                    artist’s health. He began to shun the company in which he formerly delighted;
                    his old buoyancy of spirits was gone; and when, in 1865, the presidentship of
                    the Academy was offered to him, he declined the honour. In 186S he exhibited the
                    Sleep of Duncan, and in 1869 his King Cophetua and the Beggar Maid. Having
                    finished the Earls of Desmond and Ormond, he was attacked by acute pneumonia,
                    which carried him off, after a brief illness, on the 25th April 1870.</p>
                <p>The works of Maclise are distinguished by powerful intellectual and imaginative
                    qualities, but most of them are marred by harsh and dull colouring, by metallic
                    hardness of surface and texture, and by frequent touches of the theatrical in
                    the action and attitudes of the figures. His fame rests most securely on his two
                    greatest works at Westminster. A memoir of the artist by his friend W. J.
                    O’Driscoll was published in 1871.</p>
