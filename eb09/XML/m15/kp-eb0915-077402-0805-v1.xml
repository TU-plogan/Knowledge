                <p><label type="entry">MECHLIN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Malines</hi></label>, a city
                    of Belgium, in the province of Antwerp, on the river Dyle, about 14 miles north
                    of Brussels. The general aspect of the town, belted by a fine avenue of trees,
                    with well-built houses, extensive gardens, and broad airy streets and squares of
                    proverbial cleanliness, is pleasing to the eye; there is, however, a lack of
                    life and motion, a repose bordering on stagnation; and the area occupied by the
                    town is much too extensive for the population. Mechlin was for many centuries,
                    and is to this day, the religious metropolis of Flanders, and its monuments and
                    curiosities are in general of a sacred description. Among the most remarkable is
                    the cathedral church of St Rombold or Rombaut, mainly built in the latter half
                    of the 14th century; the square massive tower, rising 300 feet high and bearing
                    four dials, each 48 feet in diameter, is visible from all the country round. The
                    interior proportions of the edifice are grand, and it contains some fine works
                    of art—statues of the apostles, standing against the pillars of the nave,
                    Vandyck’s picture of the Crucifixion, the Adoration of the Shepherds, by Erasmus
                    Quellin, and others. The church of St John possesses a celebrated triptych of
                    Rubens, and another by the same master is to be seen at Notre Dame. The “Halle”
                    or market still retains some vestiges of the splendid palace raised on the site
                    by Charles V. in 1530, and on the chief market-place is a monument erected to
                    Margaret of Austria, daughter of the emperor Maximilian. Mechlin is an
                    archiépiscopal see, occupied by a cardinal, primate of Belgium, deriving his
                    spiritual power from Rome, and quite independent of (at times even openly
                    opposed to) the civil Government. His palace is the headquarters of the Catholic
                    party, and the seat of considerable moral and political influence extending over
                    every parish in the land; the university of Louvain, the Catholic schools, more
                    than four thousand in number, and the great seminary of Mechlin, the nursery of
                    the Belgian priesthood, are entirely under the direction of the archbishop. The
                    industrial activity of the town, formerly very great, has constantly decreased
                    in the present century, and is now almost extinct. The important corporation of
                    weavers was scattered by the political troubles of the 15th and 16th centuries;
                    and the lace trade has gradually been transferred to Brussels and other towns.
                    There still exist a few special manufactures, those of carved oak furniture,
                    straw chairs, and wool and linen tissues being among the foremost; some tanyards
                    and breweries are also to be found, and the means of communication furnished by
                    the Dyle supply a tolerably brisk market in corn, oils, flax, hemp, and hops. As
                    a railway station Mechlin possesses peculiar importance, being a junction of the
                    chief Belgian Government lines and the great central workshop for constructing
                    and repairing the rolling-stock. The population of Mechlin in 1880 was
                    42,381.</p>
                <p>Mechlin appears to have been about the 8th century a mere group of cabins
                    surrounding a noted monastery where St Rombaut, now the patron saint of the
                    town, suffered martyrdom on the 24th of June 775. After having belonged to the
                    first Frankish monarchs, it was given by Pippin the Little to his relative Adon,
                    and passed, at the commencement of the 10th century, under the dominion of the
                    bishops of Liège, in whose name it was governed by the powerful house of
                    Berthold until the year 1333. When this family became extinct, Mechlin and the
                    surrounding district were divided in two portions and sold by the bishops to the
                    duke of Brabant and the count of Flanders, the former of whom, ten years later,
                    once more united the whole territory under his own sway. By the marriage of
                    Margaret of Brabant with Philip the Bold, Mechlin was brought under the sceptre
                    of the house of Burgundy, whose fate it shared from that time. Stormed by the
                    French in 1572, by the prince of Orange in 1578, by the English in 1580, the
                    town suffered much during the wars of the 17th and 18th centuries. Napoleon I.
                    had its fortifications razed in 1804, and made it the capital of the French
                    “Département des deux Nêthes” until 1814, when it was comprised in the kingdom
                    of the Netherlands, and it finally became part of Belgium in 1830.</p>
