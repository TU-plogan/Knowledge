                        rend="smallcaps">Longueville</hi> (1820-1871), metaphysician and theologian,
                    was born at Cosgrove, Northamptonshire (where his father was rector) in 1820,
                    and educated at Merchant Taylors’ School and St John’s College, Oxford. He
                    succeeded to a fellowship in 1842, graduated in 1843, and became tutor of his
                    college. He was appointed reader in moral and metaphysical philosophy at
                    Magdalen College in 1855, becoming Waynfiete professor in 1859. In 1867 he
                    succeeded Dean Stanley as professor of ecclesiastical history, and in the
                    following year was appointed dean of St Paul’s. He died July 31, 1871.</p>
                <p>The philosophy of Mansel, like that of his older contemporary Sir W. Hamilton of
                    Edinburgh, was mainly due to three sources,— the works of Aristotle, the
                    speculations of Kant, and the philosophy of Reid. Like Hamilton, Mansel
                    maintained the purely formal character of logical science, the duality of
                    consciousness as testifying to both self and the external world, and the
                    limitation of knowledge to the finite and “conditioned.” His logical doctrines
                    were developed in his edition of Aldrich’s <hi rend="italic">Artis</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Logicae</hi><hi rend="italic">Rudimenta</hi> (1849)—his chief
                    contribution to the reviving study of Aristotle— and in his <hi rend="italic"

                    metaphysical agnosticism which seemed to result from Kant’s criticism, and which
                    had been developed in Hamilton’s <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of the
                        Unconditioned.</hi> Showing the contradictions which arise when we attempt
                    to conceive God under the categories of substance or cause, Mansel contends that
                    we can have no positive conception either of the metaphysical or moral
                    attributes of the Absolute and Infinite Being, though we are compelled to
                    believe in His existence, the religious consciousness being built up by
                    reflexion from the feeling of dependence and the conviction of moral obligation.
                    Hence he infers the invalidity of all objections to revelation from its alleged
                    inconsistency with the Divine character, maintaining the dependence of its claim
                    to acceptance upon the evidences accompanying it. While denying all knowledge of
                    the supersensuous, Mansel deviated from Kant in contending that cognition of the
                    ego as it really is is itself a fact of experience. Consciousness, he
                    held,—agreeing thus with the doctrine of “natural realism” which Hamilton
                    developed from Reid,—implies knowledge both of self and of the external world.
                    The latter ManseΓs psychology reduces to consciousness of our organism as
                    extended; with the former is given consciousness of free-will and moral
                    obligation. These views and a summary of his whole philosophy are contained in
