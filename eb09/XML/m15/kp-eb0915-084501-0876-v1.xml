                <p><label type="entry">MEMEL</label>, the most northerly town in Germany, and the
                    principal seat of the Baltic timber trade, is situated in the district of
                    Konigsberg, Prussia, at the mouth of the Dange, and on the bank of a sound
                    connecting the Kurische Haff with the Baltic Sea. On the side next the sea the
                    town is defended by a citadel and other fortifications, and the entrance to the
                    large and fine harbour is protected by a lighthouse. Largely rebuilt since a
                    destructive fire in 1854, Memel contains several churches, a gymnasium, a school
                    of navigation, an exchange, and various judicial and official establishments. It
                    also possesses large iron-foundries, shipbuilding yards, breweries,
                    distilleries, and manufactories of chemicals, soap, and amber wares. By far the
                    most important interest of the town, however, is its trade, the chief items in
                    which are timber and the grain and other agricultural products of Lithuania. The
                    timber is brought by river from the forests of Russia, and is prepared for
                    exportation by about thirty saw-mills. The annual value of timber exported is
                    about £600,000. In 1880 the port of Memel was entered by 898 ships with an
                    aggregate burden of 164,374 tons, and cleared by 932 vessels with a burden of
                    164,441 tons. The population of Memel in 1880 was 19,660.</p>
                <p>Memel was founded in 1252 by Poppo von Osterna, grand master of the Teutonic
                    order, and was at first called New Dortmund and afterwards Memmelburg. It soon
                    acquired a considerable trade, and joined the Hanseatic League. During the 13th,
                    14th, and 15th centuries it was repeatedly burned down by its hostile
                    neighbours, the Lithuanians and Poles, and in the 17th century it remained for
                    some time in the possession of Sweden. In 1757, and again in 1813, it was
                    occupied by Russian troops. After the battle of Jena, King Frederick William
                    III. retired to Memel; and there, in 1807, a treaty was concluded between
                    England and Prussia. The poet Simon Dach and the astronomer Argelander were
                    natives of Memel.</p>
