                <p><label type="entry">WORKSOP</label>, a market-town of Nottinghamshire, England,
                    is situated on the Chesterfield Canal, and on the Manchester, Sheffield, and
                    Lincoln Railway and the Midland Railway, 16 miles east-south-east of Sheffield
                    and 146∣ from London. It is a well-built and pleasant country town, with
                    considerable traces of antiquity. The church of St Mary and St Cuthbert is an
                    old priory church, once divided internally into two buildings, the eastern
                    dedicated to St Mary being for the use of the canons, and the western dedicated
                    to St Cuthbert for the parishioners. When the priory was demolished at the
                    Reformation only the western portion of the church was spared, and for many
                    years it was in a dilapidated condition until it was restored with Perpendicular
                    additions. Behind it are the ruins of the lady chapel, containing some fine
                    Early English work. The priory gatehouse, chiefly in the Decorated style, now
                    forms the entrance to the precincts of the church. It is supposed to have been
                    built early in the 14th century by the third Lord Furnival, when the market was
                    established. Of the priory itself the only remains are a wall at the northwest
                    corner of the church which includes the cloister gateway. There was a Norman
                    keep on the castle hill, but no remains of the building are now left. The
                    magnificent manor-lιouse, built by Gilbert, first earl of Shrewsbury, and
                    occasionally occupied by Mary queen of Scots during her captivity under the
                    sixth earl, was in great part destroyed by fire in 1761, while being restored at
                    great expense by the duke of Norfolk, and when the estate came into the
                    possession of the duke of Newcastle in 1840 the ruined portion of the mansion
                    remaining was removed and a smaller mansion built near it. The ecclesiastical
                    parish of St John’s was formed in 1867. There is a corn exchange, erected in
                    1854, in the Venetian style, and a mechanics’ institute, erected in 1852.
                    Formerly liquorice was extensively grown, but malting is now the principal
                    industry. A large corn market and a cattle and horse fair are held. The town
                    also possesses brass and iron foundries, agricultural implement works,
                    saw-mills, and chemical works. The population of the urban sanitary district
                    (18,220 acres) was 10,409 in 1871, and 11,625 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Worksop occurs in Domesday as Withercope. By William the Conqueror the manor was
                    bestowed on Roger de Busli. It subsequently passed to William de Lovitot, who in
                    1103 founded a priory for Augustinian canons dedicated to St Mary. From the De
                    Lovitots it passed successively to the Furni vais, the Nevilles, the Talbots,
                    earls of Shrewsbury, and the Howards, earls of Arundel and afterwards dukes of
                    Norfolk. By the duke of Norfolk it was sold in 1840 to the duke of Newcastle,
                    whoso country mansion, Clumber, is in the parish. In December 1460 an engagement
                    took place at Worksop between the forces of the duke of York and those of the
                    duke of Somerset.</p>
