                    market-town and municipal and parliamentary borough in Montgomeryshire, North
                    Wales, is situated in the upper Severn valley not far from the river, on the
                    Shropshire Union Canal, and on the Cambrian Railway, 207 miles north-west of
                    London, 8 north of Montgomery, and 18 west of Shrewsbury. The church of St
                    Mary’s, a Gothic structure, restored by Street at a cost of £4000, is a building
                    of some antiquity; Christ Church, in Powis Park, in the Norman style, was
                    erected in 1839. The town-hall, erected in 1873 at a cost of £6000, includes a
                    corn and general markethouse, assize courts, and assembly rooms. The Powysland
                    Museum, containing a collection of local fossils and antiquities and a library,
                    was in 1887 vested in the corporation as a free public library and museum. A
                    mile south-west of the town is Powis Castle, the fine old baronial residence of
                    the earl of Powis, and about the same distance to the east is Leighton Hall. The
                    site of an old moated mound is now occupied by a bowling green. The flannel
                    manufacture has now ceased, but there is a large manufactory of tweeds and
                    woollen shawls. The population of the municipal borough (area 19,549 acres) in
                    1871 was 7370 and in 1881 it was 7107. The population of the parliamentary
                    borough (area 6761 acres) in 1881 was 5211.</p>
                <p>About 1109 a castle was begun at Welshpool by Cadwygan ap Bleddyn ap Cynvyn, and
                    completed by Gwenwynwyn. In 1191 it was besieged by Hubert, archbishop of
                    Canterbury, and after being undermined surrendered, but it was retaken by
                    Gwenwynwyn in 1197. It was dismantled in 1233 by Llewelyn, prince of North
                    Wales, and for several generations it remained in the hands of the lords of
                    Powis. During the civil war Lord Powis declared for the royal cause, but he was
                    taken prisoner, and the castle was subsequently demolished. The town was
                    incorporated about 1279 by the lords of Powis. In 1406 its boundaries were
                    enlarged to the present enormous dimensions, and in 1615 it received a charter
                    from James I., which was confirmed and enlarged by Charles II. From the 27th of
                    Henry VIII. it has been included in the Montgomery district of boroughs, which
                    returns one member to parliament. The Welsh name of the town is Trailwns or
                    Trailwm.</p>
