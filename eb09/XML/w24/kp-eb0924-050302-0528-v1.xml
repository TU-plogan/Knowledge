                <p><label type="entry">WESER</label> (O. Germ. <hi rend="italic">Visuracha,
                        Wisura;</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">Visurgis),</hi> one of the chief rivers
                    of Germany, formed by the union of the Werra and the Fulda at Münden, in the
                    Prussian province of Hanover, flows to the north and north-northwest, and entere
                    the North Sea below Bremerhafen, to the east of the Jade Bay. The mouth is 170
                    miles from Münden, but the winding course of the river is 279 miles long; if the
                    measurement be made from the source of the Werra, in Thuringia, the total length
                    of the stream is 439 miles. At Münden the river surface is 380 feet above
                    sea-level; the most rapid fall in its course is between Carlshafen and Minden in
                    Westphalia, where it descends 70 feet in 20 miles. Nearly the entire course of
                    the Weser lies in Prussia, but it also touches part of Brunswick and Lippe, and
                    after flowing through Bremen expands into an estuary separating the duchy of
                    Oldenburg from the Prussian province of Hanover. Between Münden and Minden its
                    course lies through a series of picturesque valleys flanked by the irregular and
                    disjointed mountain system known as the Weser Hills; but after it emerges from
                    these mountains by the narrow pass called the “Porta Westphalica,” to the north
                    of Minden, its banks become flat and uninteresting. The breadth of the river
                    varies from 110 yards at Münden to 220 yards at Minden, 250 yards at Bremen, 1¼
                    miles at Elsfleth, and 7½ miles at its entrance into the sea. The Weser on the
                    whole is shallow; and navigation on the upper Weser, <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.,</hi> above Bremen, is sometimes interrupted for months by drought.
                    Sea-going ships may ascend to Elsfleth, though Bremerhafen is the chief port for
                    large vessels; smaller craft may reach Vegesack, and barges of 200 tons make
                    their way to Münden. The stream discharges itself into the sea amid sandbanks,
                    which leave only a single narrow fairway, 19-22 feet deep at high water and 12
                    feet at low water; on the upper Weser the navigation of the only available
                    narrow channel, which is interrupted by occasional rapids, is assisted by locks
                    and weirs. The Weser drains a basin estimated at 18,360 square miles. Its
                    principal tributaries on the right are the Aller, Wümme, Drepte, Lune, and
                    Geeste, and on the left the Diemel, Nethe, Emmer, Werre, Aue, and Hunte. The
                    Werra and Fulda are both navigable when they unite to form the Weser; the Aller,
                    Wümme, Geeste, and Hunte are also navigable. Beyond the junction of the Hunte
                    the Weser, hitherto a single stream, is divided into several channels by
                    islands.</p>
                <p>The navigation of the Weser was long hampered by the various and vexatious claims
                    and rights of the different states through whose territories it ran. Before 1866
                    the joint stream, including the Werra and the Fulda, changed its ruler no less
                    than thirty-five times on its way to the sea. In 1823, however, a treaty was
                    made establishing a fixed toll and a uniform system of management; this was
                    further improved in 1856 and 1865; and when Prussia took possession of Hanover
                    and Hesse-Nassau in 1866 the chief difficulties in the way of organizing the
                    river-trade disappeared. The principal town on the Weser is Bremen (population
                    in 1885, 118,043). Other towns past which it flows betwixt Münden and the sea
                    are Carlshafen, Höxter, Holzminden, Bodenwerder, Hameln, Rinteln, Vlotho,
                    Minden, Nienburg, Vegesack, Elsfleth, Braake, Blexen, Geestemünde, and
                    Bremerhafen. The Weser gave name to a department in the short-lived kingdom of
                    Westphalia; the chief town was Osnabrück. A canal between the Wümme and the
                    Oste, and another between the Geeste and the mouth of the Elbe, connect the
                    Weser system with that of the Elbe. A canal is also being constructed from the
                    Hunte to a tributary of the Ems.</p>
