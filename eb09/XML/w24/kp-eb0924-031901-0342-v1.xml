                    (1756-1801), classical scholar, theologian, and politician, was born at
                    Nottingham, February 22, 1756, and was the son of the Rev. George Wakefield,
                    rector of St Nicholas. After being educated at various private schools, he
                    proceeded at the age of sixteen to Jesus College, Cambridge, where he cultivated
                    his classical studies diligently, but imbibed a thorough distaste for logic and
                    mathematics. He became, however, fellow of his college in 1776, and in 1778 was
                    ordained by the bishop of Peterborough, in a frame of mind which led him
                    afterwards to declare that he regarded his subscription to the Articles as the
                    most disingenuous action of his life. He held, however, curacies for a short
                    time at Stockport and Liverpool, but in 1779, the year of his marriage, quitted
                    the church, and accepted the post of classical tutor at the Nonconformist
                    academy at Warrington. The institution was already on the decline, and
                    Wakefield’s pugnacious temper was not likely to contribute to restore it. “It
                    survived my arrival,” he says, “four years.” During this short period he
                    published translations of Matthew and the first epistle to the Thessalonians,
                    and treatises on inspiration and baptism, <pb break="no"

                    nine days. He apologizes for this precipitancy as the result of “a
                    constitutional ardour which will not suffer me to dwell long on the same
                    subject.” However inevitable, this was the source of most of his failures and
                    mistakes. After the dissolution of the academy, he resided successively at
                    Bramcote in Nottinghamshire, at Richmond, and at Nottingham, taking pupils and
                    persevering in his theological and classical studies, which were considerably
                    retarded by ill health. His most important production at this time was the <hi
                        rend="italic">Silva Critica,</hi> “illustrating the Scriptures by light
                    borrowed from the philology of Greece and Rome.” Three parts of this work were
                    printed at the Cambridge university press, but, the authorities declining to
                    proceed further with it, the author was obliged to complete it himself. In 1790
                    he was appointed professor of classics at the newly-founded Unitarian college at
                    Hackney. Here he speedily became uncomfortable; his proposals for reform in the
                    course of instruction were unacceptable to his colleagues, and his dislike to
                    the religious services, which he carried to the length of objecting to all
                    social worship, occasioned his resignation in June 1791. The publication of his
                    views on public worship deprived him of all his private pupils, and his time was
                    henceforth devoted to authorship and the education of his children. His next
                    important work was a new translation of the New Testament, retaining as much of
                    the language of the Authorized Version as he deemed consistent with accuracy.
                    This soon reached a second edition. He commenced an edition of Pope, which he
                    was prevented from completing by the competition of Warton, but the notes were
                    published separately. His edition of Lucretius, a work of high pretensions and
                    little solid performance, appeared in 1796. It gained for the editor a very
                    exaggerated reputation, but Wakefield suffered himself to be allured from the
                    paths of literature into those of political and religious controversy. After
                    assailing with equal acerbity writers so diverse in their principles as
                    Wilberforce and Thomas Paine, he in January 1798 “employed a few hours” in
                    drawing up a reply to Bishop Watson’s <hi rend="italic">Address to the People of
                        Great Britain.</hi> These few hours procured him two years’ imprisonment in
                    Dorchester jail. He was convicted in February 1799 of having published a
                    seditious libel, an offence which he had assuredly no intention of committing,
                    and his eloquent defence was naturally thrown away upon the same jurymen who had
                    already convicted the printer. The sympathy excited for him, however, led to a
                    subscription, amounting to no less than £5000, and forming a sufficient
                    provision for his family upon his death, which occurred September 9, 1801,
                    shortly after his liberation, from an attack of typhus fever. He had occupied
                    himself while in prison with the preparation of classical lectures and an
                    English-Greek lexicon, and had corresponded on classical subjects with Charles
                    James Fox. The letters were subsequently published.</p>
                <p>Wakefield was one of the most honest of men, but also one of the most
                    precipitate, narrow-minded, and presumptuous. His extreme ardour and his
                    consciousness of integrity produced an uncharitableness verging on
                    offensiveness, little in harmony with the many magnanimous and amiable features
                    of his character. Rashness, opinionativeness, and contentiousness grievously
                    marred in him the character of patriot and scholar, though they could not
                    destroy his claim to be numbered among both.</p>
                <p>The principal authority for his life is the second edition of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Memoirs,</hi> in two volumes (London, 1804). The first volume
                    is autobiographical; the second, compiled by the editors, Rutt and Wainwright,
                    includes several estimates of his character and performances from various
                    sources, the most remarkable being one by Dr Parr.</p>
