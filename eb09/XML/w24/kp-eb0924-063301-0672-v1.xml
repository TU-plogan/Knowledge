                    (1766-1828), chemist and natural philosopher, was born at East Dereham, in
                    Norfolk, on August 6, 1766, the second of seventeen children. His father, the
                    Rev. Francis Wollaston, rector of Chislehurst, grandson of William Wollaston
                    noticed above, was an enthusiastic astronomer. Wollaston studied at Caius
                    College, Cambridge, of which he remained a fellow until his death. He took the
                    degree of M.B. in 1787, and that of M.D. six years later, and commenced to
                    practise medicine in 1789 at Bury St Edmunds. Failing to make headway he removed
                    to London, where he was equally unsuccessful. He applied for a vacant
                    physicianship at St George’s Hospital, but was not appointed; and he never got
                    over the feeling of irritation, which indeed led him to abandon medicine
                    altogether. Wollaston betook himself to original research, and for a time ranged
                    pretty impartially over the sciences. He is said to have accumulated a fortune
                    by the manufacture of platinum and of various optical and mechanical inventions.
                    He devoted much attention to the affairs of the Royal Society, of which he was
                    elected a fellow in 1793 and made secretary in 1806. For many years he was a
                    vice-president, but did not care to enter on competition with Sir Humphry Davy
                    when the latter was elected president in 1820. Beyond appearing at the meetings
                    of learned societies Wollaston took little part in public affairs; he lived
                    alone, conducting his investigations in a deliberate and very exhaustive manner,
                    but in the most rigid seclusion, no person being admitted to his laboratory on
                    any pretext. Towards the close of 1828 he felt the approach of the fatal
                    malady—a tumour in the brain—and devoted his last days to a careful révisai of
                    his unpublished researches and industrial processes, dictating several papers on
                    these subjects, which were afterwards published in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Philosophical Transactions.</hi> On December 22, 1828, he died, as he had
                    lived, self-possessed, stern, and silent.</p>
                <p>Wollaston’s character presents a very remarkable analogy with that of Henry
                    Cavendish: both studied all branches of science; both were highly respected by
                    their contemporaries for intellectual power and achievements in research; both
                    were reserved and distant, making few friends, never acting from impulse, but
                    occasionally displaying unexpected generosity. Wollaston’s character can only be
                    partially divined from his public actions and relations with other scientific
                    men, and unfortunately no other data are available. A dispute as to priority in
                    discovering electromagnetic rotation is referred to under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Faraday,</hi> vol. ix. p. 29; and suggestions as to the prior invention of
                    his process of manufacturing platinum are to be found in the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Platinum</hi> (vol. xix. p. 190). The incidents associated
                    with the discovery of the metal palladium were more serious than either of
                    these. Wollaston detected this element, extracted a considerable quantity, and
                    exposed it for sale in an instrument-maker’s shop, calling attention to it by an
                    anonymous advertisement. A chemist, Chenevix, purchased some of the metal, and
                    concluded from a few hasty experiments that it was an amalgam of platinum. He
                    submitted a paper to the Royal Society, which Wollaston as secretary read,
                    after, it is said, vainly advising Chenevix to withdraw it. A controversy,
                    supported by elaborate series of experiments, took place, and was only
                    terminated when Wollaston acknowledged that he was the discoverer, and described
                    the process of extraction from the ores of platinum. Chenevix was disgusted, and
                    deserted chemistry. Yet Wollaston was a most thorough and conscientious worker:
                    it was his extreme caution in coming to conclusions until the facts were
                    irresistible that occasionally led him to the unfortunate method of tentative
                    anonymous publication; but the same quality ensured a solidity and
                    trustworthiness in his Royal Society memoirs which make them models to
                    subsequent investigators.</p>
                <p>Most of Wollaston’s papers deal more or less directly with chemistry, but they
                    diverge beyond that science on all sides into optics, physiology, botany,
                    acoustics, astronomy, and even touch on art. He discovered the metals palladium
                    and rhodium, and proved the identity of columbium with titanium. The minute
                    scale on which his analytical processes were carried out was rendered possible
                    by his extraordinary keenness of sight and neatness in manipulation.</p>
                <p>The Royal Society awarded him a royal medal for his process of manufacturing
                    platinum,—a work which, in its immediate effects, it is almost impossible to
                    over-estimate. Wollaston was the first to produce the metal in a state fit to
                    manufacture, and in quantity sufficient to make platinum crucibles generally
                    available, thus supplying analytical chemistry with its most powerful instrument
                    of advance. In optics his most important theoretical observation, to which,
                    however, he gave little attention, was the discovery in 1802 of dark lines in
                    the solar spectrum (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Light,</hi> vol. xiv. p. 593), but
                    practically the reflecting <hi rend="smallcaps">Goniometer</hi> and <hi

                        rend="italic">(qq. V. )</hi> were of greatest value, the former supplying
                    the crystallographer with his chief data, the latter indispensable in the
                    development of modern microscopical research. Amongst his other papers may be
                    mentioned those dealing with the physiology of vision, the apparent direction of
                    the eyes in a portrait, a comparison of the light of the sun with that of the
                    moon and fixed stars, a slide-rule for calculating chemical equivalents, sounds
                    inaudible to certain ears, and a theory of the formation of fairy-rings.</p>
