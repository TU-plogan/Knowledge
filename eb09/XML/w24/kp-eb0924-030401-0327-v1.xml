                <p><label type="entry">W</label> is simply double <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> so far
                    as the form goes; but its value, like its name, is double <hi rend="italic"
                        >u,</hi> and it dates back to a time when <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi> had not been fully differentiated, one into a vowel,
                    the other into a consonant (see under U). The oldest form of the letter was <hi
                        rend="italic">uu,</hi> sometimes <hi rend="italic">u</hi> only; <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> uulfheard, uilfrith, in the <hi rend="italic">Liber
                        Vitae,</hi> 9th century. Later, a peculiar symbol appears, Ҏ, called “wen”;
                    this belonged to the runic alphabet, which the Latin superseded: it undoubtedly
                    represented the <hi rend="italic">w</hi>-sound. It died out about 1300, probably
                    through the influence of French copyists. As early as the 11th century we find
                        <hi rend="italic">vv,</hi> later <hi rend="italic">w.</hi></p>
                <p>The sound denoted by W is a voiced labial, formed by rounding the lips so much
                    that the voice cannot escape without friction. In the nature of the case no hard
                    and fast line can be drawn between it and the vowel <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    (any more than between <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y)</hi>:
                    it is impossible to say exactly at what point the open position of the lips for
                        <hi rend="italic">u</hi> ceases and sufficient closure for a definite
                    consonant begins. We may perhaps mark out three noticeable sounds :—(1) the
                    clear vowel <hi rend="italic">u</hi>; (2) a consonant <hi rend="italic">u,</hi>
                    equivalent to a “glide” in the diphthongs “eu,” “ou,” &amp;c., <hi rend="italic"
                        >i.e.</hi>, a sound which is held not long enough to be a vowel as forming a
                    syllable by itself, yet without sufficient friction to make a consonant; (3) the
                    consonant <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> The difference between (2) and (3) may be
                    illustrated by the initial sounds of French “oui” and English “we”; the <hi
                        rend="italic">ou</hi> in “oui” is a consonant <hi rend="italic">u∙,</hi> it
                    does not make a syllable distinct from the following <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    and so it is not a vowel; yet it is quite distinguishable from the <hi
                        rend="italic">w</hi> in “we.” It is probable, from some slight indications,
                    principally in Sanskrit, that both (2) and (3) were sounds of the Indo-European
                    language. But it could hardly be supposed that they would be kept rigorously
                    distinct in the derived languages; they lie too near together.</p>
                <p>It has been already pointed out (see article U) that the representatives of the
                    sound <hi rend="italic">w</hi> varied much in the different languages. In Greek
                    we find Ӻ and sometimes <hi rend="italic">ν</hi> (as in εὒαδε, &amp;c.); in
                    Latin there was no symbol to distinguish it from the vowel <hi rend="italic"
                        >u.</hi> The English varieties are mentioned above.</p>
                <p>For the history of this sound in connexion with the velar <hi rend="italic"
                        >k</hi> of the original speech see article Q. This sound died out in most of
                    the derived languages, but left traces in Greek—(1) in the symbol koppa, (2) in
                    the phonetic change called “labialism,” by which the slight labial of the
                    original sound developed and eventually changed the guttural explosive into a
                    labial, <hi rend="italic">e.g., k</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> w</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ou</hi> became πoυ. Similarly in Italy the Latin <hi
                        rend="italic">qu</hi> of “qui,” “quantus,” &amp;c., preserved the original
                    symbol and sound, whereas the Oscan and Umbrian agreed with the Greek in
                    labializing.</p>
                <p>In English the <hi rend="italic">w</hi>-sound has commonly held its own. It has
                    survived in writing, even in the almost impossible combination <hi rend="italic"
                        >wr,</hi> as in “wrath,” “write,” “wreck,” “wretch,” but the sound is lost.
                    In several Old English words the combination <hi rend="italic">cw</hi> was
                    exchanged for <hi rend="italic">qu,</hi> as was natural under French influence,
                        <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> quoth (O.E. cwae <hi rend="italic">đ</hi>),
                    quell (O.E. cwellan), queen (O.E. cwên).</p>
                <p>The digraph <hi rend="italic">wh</hi> denotes the voiceless sound corresponding
                    to the voiced <hi rend="italic">w.</hi> In the great majority of cases where it
                    occurs it represents original <hi rend="italic">H,</hi> as in who, what
                    (original base <hi rend="italic">k</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> w</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">a)</hi>; these were originally written hwá, hwaet; so also
                    “while” was “hwil,” “wheeze” was “hwaes” (Lat. ques-tus). In similar
                    combinations with <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">h</hi> has been lost, as in “loud,” formerly “hlúd” (κλυτός),
                    raven (hraefn), ring (bring); and in <hi rend="italic">hw</hi> the <hi
                        rend="italic">h</hi> seems to have robbed the <hi rend="italic">w</hi> of
                    its voice (a result denoted by the writing <hi rend="italic">wh),</hi> and then
                    fallen off here also as an independent sound.</p>
