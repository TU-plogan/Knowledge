                    tints,—the cock especially having a clear grey instead of a black back. Eleven
                    other more or less nearly-allied species are recognized by Mr Sharpe (<hi
                        rend="italic">Cat. B. Brit. Museum, x.</hi> pp. 456-496), who has
                    laboriously treated the complicated synonymy of this group of birds. Eight of
                    these are natives of Asia, several of them wintering in India, and one, <hi
                        rend="italic">Μ. ocularis,</hi> even occasionally reaching the west coast of
                    North America, while the rest are confined to Africa. No colours but black,
                    grey, or white enter into the plumage of any of the foregoing; but in the
                    species peculiar to <pb break="no"

                        flaviventris,</hi> as well as in that which it much resembles, the so-called
                    Grey Wagtail of Britain, <hi rend="italic">Μ. melanope (Μ. boarula</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">sulphurea</hi> of some authors), a great part of the lower
                    surface is yellow. The species last mentioned is one of the most graceful of
                    birds, and though having a very wide range in the world at large is curiously
                    local in its distribution in Britain, being almost wholly confined in the
                    breeding-season to the neighbourhood of rocky streams in the west and north, and
                    a line drawn from the Start Point, slightly curving to round the Derbyshire
                    hills, and ending at the mouth of the Tees, will, it is believed, mark off its
                    breeding-range in England. Then there is a section which by some systematists
                    has been raised to the rank of a genus, <hi rend="italic">Budytes,</hi>
                    containing the Wagtails in which yellow takes a still more prominent part in
                    their coloration. Of these, 8 species, besides several subspecies, are
                    recognized by Mr Sharpe <hi rend="italic">(ut supra,</hi> pp. 503-532). One of
                    these is the common Yellow Wagtail of England, <hi rend="italic">Μ. raii</hi>
                    (by some mistakenly called <hi rend="italic">Μ. campestris),</hi> which, though
                    very generally distributed throughout the country, is much less numerous than
                    the Pied Wagtail, and more addicted to wet meadows; but, just as <hi
                        rend="italic">Μ. lugubris</hi> is regarded by some as a local form of the
                    more widely-ranging <hi rend="italic">Μ. alba,</hi> so does <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                        raii</hi> hold the same relation to <hi rend="italic">Μ. flaνa,</hi> the
                    Blue-headed Wagtail, which has a very extensive distribution in the Old World,
                    and even crosses the Pacific to Alaska, presenting also a great number of
                    varieties or races (most of which are treated by Mr Sharpe as real species)
                    differing from each other chiefly, if not solely, in the colour of the head, a
                    character which in this section can hardly be deemed specific, while their
                    geographical range intersects and inosculates in a most puzzling manner. Much
                    credit is due to the author just named for the enormous trouble he has taken,
                    after study of a vast series of specimens, to clear up the questions herein
                    involved; but it will probably be long before ornithologists can agree on many
                    of the disputed points, and it is certain that the last word has by no means
                    been spoken concerning them.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Motacilla</hi> (an exact rendering of the English
                    “Wagtail,” the Dutch <hi rend="italic">Kwikstaart,</hi> the Italian <hi
                        rend="italic">Codatremola</hi> and other similar words), which, as
                    originally founded by Linnaeus, contained nearly all the “soft-billed” birds of
                    early English ornithologists, was restricted by various authors in succession,
                    following the example set by Scopoli in 1769, until none but the Wagtails
                    remained in it. Most of the rest are now commonly classed as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sylviidae</hi> (<hi rend="italic">cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Warbler),</hi> while the Wagtails with the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pipits</hi>
                        (<hi rend="italic">q.v.)</hi> constitute the Family <hi rend="italic"
