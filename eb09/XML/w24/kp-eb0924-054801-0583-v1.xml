                    (1667-1752), English divine and mathematician, was born on 9th December 1667 at
                    Norton in Leicestershire, of which village his father was rector. He was
                    educated privately, partly on account of the delicacy of his health and partly
                    that he might act as amanuensis to his father, who had lost his sight. He
                    afterwards entered at Clare College, Cambridge, where he applied himself with
                    extraordinary diligence to mathematical study, and obtained a fellowship in
                    1693. He next became chaplain to Moore, the learned bishop of Norwich, from whom
                    he received the living of Lowestoft in 1698. He had already given several proofs
                    of his noble but over-scrupulous conscientiousness, and at the same time of the
                    propensity to paradox and the pragmatical and wayward temper which almost
                    destroyed the usefulness of the fine example of disinterestedness which he gave
                    to a lax and lukewarm age. His <hi rend="italic">Theory of the Earth</hi>
                    (1696), although destitute of sound scientific foundation, obtained the praise
                    of both Newton and Locke, the latter of whom justly classed the author among
                    those who, if not adding much to our knowledge, “at least bring some new things
                    to our thoughts.” In 1701 he resigned his living, where his conduct had been
                    most exemplary, to become deputy at Cambridge to Sir Isaac Newton, whom he
                    shortly afterwards succeeded as Lucasian professor of mathematics. For several
                    years Whiston continued to write and preach both on mathematical and theological
                    subjects with considerable success; but his study of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Apostolical Constitutions</hi> had convinced him that Arianism was the
                    creed of the primitive church; and with him to form an opinion and to publish it
                    were things almost simultaneous. His heterodoxy soon became notorious, and in
                    1710 he was deprived of his professorship and expelled the university. The rest
                    of his life was spent in incessant controversy,— theological, mathematical,
                    chronological, and miscellaneous. He vindicated his estimate of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Apostolical Constitutions</hi> and the Arian views he had
                    derived from them in his <hi rend="italic">Primitive Christianity,</hi>
                    published in 1711. In 1713 he produced a reformed liturgy, and in 1730 one of
                    the most valuable of his books, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Samuel
                        Clarke.</hi> While heretical on so many points, he was a firm believer in
                    supernatural Christianity, and frequently took the field in defence of prophecy
                    and miracle, including anointing the sick and touching for the king’s evil. His
                    dislike to rationalism in religion also made him one of the numerous opponents
                    of Hoadly’s <hi rend="italic">Plain Account of the Lords Supper.</hi> He proved
                    to his own satisfaction that Canticles was apocryphal and that Baruch was not.
                    He was ever pressing his views of ecclesiastical government and discipline,
                    derived from the <hi rend="italic">Apostolical Constitutions,</hi> on the rulers
                    of the church, and was lost in sincere astonishment that they could not see the
                    matter in the same light as himself. He assailed the memory of Athanasius with a
                    virulence at least equal to that with which orthodox divines had treated Arius.
                    He attacked Sir Isaac Newton’s chronological system with success; but he himself
                    lost not only time but money in an endeavour to discover the longitude. Of all
                    his singular opinions the best known is his advocacy of clerical monogamy,
                    immortalized in the <hi rend="italic">Vicar of Wakefield.</hi> Of all his
                    labours the most useful is his translation of Josephus, with valuable notes and
                    dissertations, which continues to be reprinted to this day. This appeared in
                    1736. His last “famous discovery, or rather revival of Dr Giles Fletcher’s,”
                    which he mentions in his autobiography with infinite complacency, was the
                    identification of the Tartars with the lost tribes of Israel. About the same
                    time (1747) he finally left the communion of the Church of England for the
                    Baptist, leaving the church literally as well as figuratively by quitting it as
                    the clergyman began to read the Athanasian creed. He died in London, at the
                    house of his son-in-law, on 22d August 1752, leaving an autobiography, which
                    deserves more attention than it has received, both for its characteristic
                    individuality and as a storehouse of curious anecdotes and illustrations of the
                    religious and moral tendencies of the age. It does not, however, contain any
                    account of the proceedings taken against him at Cambridge, these having been
                    published separately at the time.</p>
                <p>Whiston is a striking example of a not unfrequent phenomenon, the association of
                    an entirely paradoxical bent of mind with proficiency in the exact sciences. He
                    is still more interesting as exemplifying a less ordinary observation, the
                    possibility of arriving at rationalistic conclusions in theology without the
                    slightest tincture of the rationalistic temper. His conclusions were in many
                    respects those of the latitudinarian divines of his day; but anything more
                    unlike the processes by which they attained these, or the spirit in which they
                    supported them, would be difficult to imagine. He was not only paradoxical to
                    the verge of craziness, but intolerant to the verge of bigotry. “I had a mind,”
                    he says, “to hear Dr Gill preach. But, being informed that he ]ιad written a
                    folio book on the Canticles, I declined to go to hear him.” This moral and
                    intellectual unreason effectually destroyed the weight otherwise due to his
                    erudition and acuteness, and left nothing recommendable for imitation in his
                    conduct as a whole, except his passion for truth and his heroic
                    disinterestedness,—virtues in which few have rivalled him, though some may have
                    exhibited them less ostentatiously. When not engaged in controversy he was not
                    devoid of good sense. He often saw men and things very clearly, and some of his
                    bon-mots are admirable.</p>
