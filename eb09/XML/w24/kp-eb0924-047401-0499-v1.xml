                <p><label type="entry">WEBSTER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Noah</hi></label> (1758-1843),
                    American lexicographer, was descended on the father’s side from John Webster of
                    Warwickshire, England, one of the original settlers at Hartford, and for a time
                    governor of Connecticut, and on the mother’s side from William Bradford, second
                    governor of Plymouth and one of the founders of that colony. He was the son of a
                    farmer, and was born in West Hartford, Connecticut, 16th October 1758. In his
                    early years he was engaged in agricultural work, but attended a district school
                    in the winter, and when fourteen years of age began the study of the classics
                    under the Rev. Nathan Perkins, D.D. He entered the freshman’s class at Yale
                    College in 1774, and while in his junior year there he took part as a volunteer
                    in the expedition against General Burgoyne. After graduating in 1778 he
                    supported himself by teaching while prosecuting the study of law. Having begun
                    at this time to note down every word whose meaning he did not properly
                    understand, he was first led to conceive the scheme of a new dictionary from his
                    frequent inability to find proper definitions of words in those in current use.
                    His experience as a teacher soon convinced him also of the need of better
                    instruction books in English, and this he endeavoured to supply by his <hi
                        rend="italic">Grammatical Institute of the English Language,</hi> the first
                    part of which appeared in 1783, and a second and third part in the following
                    years. It comprehended a spellingbook, English grammar, and compilation of
                    English reading, and very soon found a place in most of the schools of the
                    United States. In 1785 he prepared a course of lectures on the English language,
                    which he delivered in the principal American cities, and published in 1789 under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">Dissertations on the English Language.</hi>
                    Meanwhile he also continued to take a deep interest in all prominent political
                    questions. In his <hi rend="italic">Sketches of American Policy</hi> (1784) he
                    made the first distinct proposal for a new constitution for the United States,
                    and when the work of the commissioners was completed in 1787 he was asked by
                    them to recommend the new constitution to the American people, which he did in
                    an <hi rend="italic">Examination of the Leading Principles of the Federal
                        Constitution.</hi> After his marriage in 1789 he established himself in the
                    practice of law at Hartford. In 1793 he was induced to found at New York a paper
                    called <hi rend="italic">Minerva,</hi> with which was connected the <hi
                        rend="italic">Herald,</hi> a semiweekly; the titles of the papers were
                    subsequently altered respectively to the <hi rend="italic">Commercial
                        Advertiser</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">New York Spectator.</hi> In 1795
                    he contributed to his paper several articles, under the signature of Curtius, in
                    vindication of Jay’s treaty with Great Britain, which were reprinted and had
                    considerable effect in allaying opposition to it. In 1798 he removed to New
                    Haven, which town he was chosen soon afterwards to represent in the general
                    assembly of Connecticut. In 1802 appeared his well-known treatise on <hi
                        rend="italic">The Eights of Neutrals.</hi> Having removed in 1812 to
                    Amherst, he took there a leading part in the establishment of the academy and
                    then of the college, of which he was chosen the first president. He also
                    represented Amherst in the court of Massachusetts. In 1822 he returned to New
                    Haven. Meanwhile his lexicographical studies, though much interrupted by his
                    professional and political duties, had never been entirely suspended. In 1806 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Compendious Dictionary of the English
                        Language,</hi> but this was only preparatory to a larger work. In 1824 he
                    sailed for Europe to complete his researches, and after spending some time in
                    Paris continued his labours in the library at Cambridge, where he finished the
                    dictionary. It was published in 1828, and a second edition with many additions
                    appeared in 1841. He also completed the revision of an appendix a few days
                    before his death, which took place 20th May 1843.</p>
                <p>In 1833 Webster published an edition of the Bible, “with amendments of the
                    language,” and again in 1839 an edition of the New Testament. In early life he
                    wrote a <hi rend="italic">History of the United States,</hi> of which a revised
                    edition appeared in 1839. He was also the author of <hi rend="italic">Historical
                        Notices of Banking Institutions and Insurance Companies</hi> (1802), and a
                        <hi rend="italic">Collection of Papers on Political and Literary
                        Subjects</hi> (1843). Since his death several revised and enlarged editions
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary</hi> have appeared. It was the result of
                    much labour and research, and on this account, as well as for the clearness and
                    carefulness of its definitions, it still holds a leading place among
                    dictionaries of the English language, especially in America. A biography of
                    Webster, by C. A. Goodrich, D.D., is prefixed to the quarto editions of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Dictionary.</hi></p>
