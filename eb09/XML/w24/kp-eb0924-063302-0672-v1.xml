                    Haff from the Baltic Sea (vol. xvii. p. 724). It is divided from the mainland on
                    the E. by the Dievenow, and from Usedom on the W. by the Swine. It is roughly
                    triangular in shape, änd has an area of 90 square miles. Heath and sand
                    alternate with swamps, lakes, and forest on its surface, which is quite flat,
                    except towards the south-west, where the low hills of Lebbin rise. The coast is
                    fenced with dunes and shifting sand-hills. Cattle-rearing and fishing are the
                    chief resources of the inhabitants, who number about 14,000. Misdroy, on the
                    north-west coast, is a favourite sea-bathing resort, and some of the other
                    villages, as Ostswine, opposite Swinemünde, Fritter, famous for its eels, and
                    Lebbin, are also visited in summer.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">' Wollin,</hi> the only town, is situated on the Dievenow,
                    and is connected with the mainland by three bridges. It carries on the
                    industries of a small seaport and fishing-town, and has (1885) a population of
                    5241. Near the site of the present town once stood the ancient and opulent
                    Baltic capital of the Slavs, called Wolin by the Wends, Julin by the Danes, and
                    Wiuetha or Vineta by the Germans. Jomsburg, Hynnisborg, and Waltzborg, names or
                    epithets occurring in several of the northern sagas, are said by Schafarik also
                    to refer to this town. In the 10th and 11th centuries Wolin was the centre of an
                    active and extensive trade. Adam of Bremen (d. 1076) extols its size and wealth;
                    he mentions that “Greeks” and other foreigners frequented it, and that “Saxons”
                    were permitted to settle there on equal terms with the Wends, so long as they
                    did not obtrude the fact of their Christianity. In 1125, however, Wolin itself
                    became the seat of a Christian bishopric, which was removed to Cammin in 1170. A
                    colony of Scandinavian vikings, often mentioned in the sagas, flourished in this
                    neighbourhood from about 970 till their stronghold of Jomsburg was destroyed in
                    1083 by Magnus of Norway and Denmark. In 1183 Wolin itself was burned by Canute
                    VI. of Denmark. Within modem times Wollin was captured by the Swedish in 1630
                    and 1759, and by the Brandenburgers in 1659 and 1675. A tradition long reigned,
                    though now proved to be baseless, that the Wendish Vineta had been overwhelmed
                    by the sea, and some submarine granite blocks near Damerow, in Usedom, were
                    popularly recognized as its rains. These are still pointed out as such to
                    strangers.</p>
