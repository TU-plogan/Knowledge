                <p><label type="entry">WEST, <hi rend="smallcaps">Benjamin</hi></label> (1738-1820),
                    history and portrait painter, was born in 1738, at Springfield, in Pennsylvania,
                    coming of an old Quaker family who had emigrated from Buckinghamshire. When a
                    boy of seven he began to show his inclinations to art. According to the
                    well-known story, he was sitting by the cradle of his sister’s child, watching
                    its sleep, when the infant happened to smile in its dreams, and, struck with its
                    beauty, young Benjamin got some paper, and drew its portrait. The career thus
                    begun was prosecuted amid many difficulties; but his perseverance overcame every
                    obstacle, and at the age of eighteen he settled in Philadelphia as a
                    portraitpainter. After a short time he removed to New York, where he practised
                    his profession with considerable success. In 1760, through the assistance of
                    some friends, he was enabled to complete his artistic education by a visit to
                    Italy, where he remained nearly three years. Here he acquired reputation, and
                    was elected a member of the principal academies of Italy. On the expiry of his
                    Italian visit he settled in London as an historical painter. His success was not
                    long doubtful. George III. took him under his special patronage; and commissions
                    flowed in upon him from all quarters. In 1768 he was one of the four artists who
                    submitted to the king the plan for a royal academy, of which he was one of the
                    earliest members; and in 1772 he was appointed His Majesty’s historical painter.
                    He devoted his attention mainly to the painting of large pictures on historical
                    and religious subjects, conceived, as he believed, in the style of the old
                    masters, and executed with great care and much taste. So high did he stand in
                    public favour that on the death of Sir Joshua Reynolds, in 1792, he was elected
                    his successor as president of the Royal Academy, an office which he held for
                    twenty-eight years. In 1802 he took advantage of the opportunity afforded by the
                    peace of Amiens to visit Paris, and inspect the magnificent collection of the
                    masterpieces of art, pillaged from the gallery of almost every capital in
                    Europe, which then adorned the Louvre. On his return to London he devoted
                    himself anew to the labours of his profession, which were, however, somewhat
                    broken in upon by quarrels with some of the members of the Royal Academy. In
                    1804 he resigned his office, but an all but unanimous request that he should
                    return to the chair induced him to recall his resignation. Time did not at all
                    weaken the energy with which he laboured at his easel. When sixty-five he
                    painted one of his largest works, Christ Healing the Sick. This was originally
                    designed to be presented to the Quakers in Philadelphia, to assist in erecting a
                    hospital. On its completion it was exhibited in London to immense crowds, and
                    was purchased by the British Institution for 3000 guineas, West sending a
                    replica to Philadelphia. His subsequent works were nearly all on the same grand
                    scale with the picture which had been so successful, but for obvious reasons
                    they did not meet with very ready sale. He died in 1820, in his eighty-second
                    year, and was buried in St Paul’s.</p>
                <p>Since his death West’s reputation has seriously declined. His works, which fond
                    criticism ranked during his life with the great productions of the old masters,
                    are now considered as in general formal, tame, wanting that freedom of nature
                    and that life which genius alone can breathe into the canvas. His Death of Wolfe
                    is interesting as introducing modern costume instead of the classical draperies
                    which had been previously universal in similar subjects by English artists; and
                    his Battle of La Hogue is entitled to an honourable place among British
                    historical paintings. An account of West’s life was published by Galt <hi
