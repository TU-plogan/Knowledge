                    IV. The town-hall was built in 1686 by Sir</p>
                <p>Christopher Wren, but was much altered in 1852. The Thames is crossed here by a
                    bridge resting on three granite piers (1823). The parish church of St John the
                    Baptist was rebuilt in 1822; the other two churches are also modern. The town
                    was formerly celebrated for the number of its inns, of which “The Garter” and
                    “The White Hart” were the chief. The former was the favourite inn of
                    Shakespeare’s Sir John Falstaff, and is frequently mentioned in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windsor.</hi> In 1650 the town contained 70
                    inns, many of which were very picturesque half-timbered buildings; but none of
                    these now exist. In <pb break="no"

                    was 11,769 and in 1881 12,273; that of the parliamentary borough (area 3253
                    acres) in the same years was 17,281 and 19,082 respectively. Of this last total

                <p>Windsor Castle, from its commanding position, its stately group of ancient
                    buildings, and its long list of historical associations, is one of the most
                    magnificent and interesting of royal palaces. It has for many centuries been the
                    chief residence of the English sovereigns.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    some importance existed at Windsor; the chief part of this still remains, and
                    forms the great circular mound, about 125 feet in diameter, on which the Round
                    Tower now stands. This great earthwork was once surrounded by the fosse, agger,
                    and vallum which were usually constructed to defend both Roman and Saxon
                    strongholds. The primitive wooden enclosure was replaced by a stone circuit-wall
                    in the time of William the Conqueror; and the first complete Round Tower was
                    built by Henry III. about 1272, but was wholly reconstructed on a more massive
                    scale by Edward III., who in 1344 designed the new tower to form a meeting-place
                    for his newly-established order of the Knights of the Garter. Edward selected
                    this spot because, according to a popular legend (quoted by Froissart), it was
                    on the summit of the circular mound that King Arthur used to sit surrounded by
                    his knights of the Round Table. The main bulk of the present Round Tower is of
                    this date; but its walls were heightened, and the tall flag-turret was added by
                    the court architect, Sir Jeffrey Wyatville, in the reign of George IV. In
                    addition to the Round Tower, Henry III. constructed long lines of circuit-walls,
                    crowned at intervals with many smaller towers, one of which, named after him,
                    still exists in good preservation. He also built a great hall, kitchen, and
                    other apartments, together with a chapel, which was afterwards pulled down to
                    make room for the present chapel of St George. The beautiful little chapel
                    cloister which Henry III. built still exists, and on its walls are traces of
                    contemporary paintings in distemper. Another chapel was built by Henry III. and
                    dedicated to his favourite saint, Edward the Confessor. This graceful building,
                    with an eastern apse, is now called the Albert Memorial Chapel; a good deal of
                    Henry III.’s work still exists in the lower part of its walls, but the upper
                    part was rebuilt in 1501-3 by Henry VII. Some years later the unfinished chapel
                    was given by Henry VIII. to Cardinal Wolsey, and for long after it was known as
                    “Wolsey’s tomb-house.” Wolsey engaged a Florentine sculptor named Benedetto<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Probably a son or nephew
                            of the Florentine sculptor Benedetto da Maiano, who died in 1497;
                            another member of the same family was employed by Wolsey at Hampton
                            Court.</p></note> to make him a very magnificent and costly tomb of
                    marble and gilt bronze, with a recumbent effigy at the top, probably very
                    similar in design to Torrigiano’s tomb of Henry VII. at Westminster. The rich
                    bronze work of Wolsey’s tomb was torn off and melted by order of the
                    Commonwealth in 1642, and the mere metal was sold for the then large sum of
                    £600. In 1805 the black marble sarcophagus, stripped of its bronze ornaments,
                    was moved from Windsor and used as a monument over Nelson’s grave in the crypt
                    of St Paul’s. Though Wolsey’s tomb-house was roofed in and used for mass by
                    James II., the stone vaulting was not completed till recent times, when the
                    whole place was fitted up by Sir Gilbert Scott as a memorial to the Prince
                    Consort. Its internal walls were then lined with rich marbles, and decorated
                    with reliefs by Baron Triqueti, in a style somewhat tawdry and discordant with
                    the old building.</p>
                <p>The magnificent chapel of St George ranks next to Westminster Abbey as a royal
                    mausoleum, though no king was buried there before Edward IV., who left
                    directions in his will that a very splendid tomb was to be erected with an
                    effigy of himself in silver. Nothing now remains of this, except part of the
                    wrought iron grille which surrounded the tomb—one of the most elaborate and
                    skilfully wrought pieces of iron-work in the world. This grille has recently
                    been moved from the north aisle to the north side of the sanctuary. The next
                    sovereign buried here was Henry VIII., who directed that his body should be laid
                    beside that of Jane Seymour, in a magnificent bronze and marble tomb. The tomb
                    was never completed, and what existed of its metal-work was probably melted down
                    by the Commonwealth. No trace of it now remains. The chapel itself is one of the
                    finest examples of Perpendicular architecture in England, and is on the whole
                    finer in design than the other two royal chapels, those of King’s College at
                    Cambridge and that of Henry VII. at Wéstminster, which were a little later in
                    date. The existing building was begun by Edward IV., who in 1473 pulled down
                    almost the whole of the earlier chapel, which had been completed and filled with
                    stained glass by Edward III. in 1363. The nave of St George’s was vaulted about
                    the year 1490, but the choir groining was not finished till 1507; the hanging
                    pendants from the fan vaulting of the choir mark a later development of style,
                    which contrasts strongly with the simpler lines of the earlier nave vault. In
                    1516 the lantern and the rood-screen were completed, but the stalls and other
                    fittings were not finished till after 1519.</p>
                <p>The present private apartments of the sovereign at Windsor were mostly rebuilt or
                    remodelled by Sir Jeffrey Wyatville, but some of the rooms, and especially the
                    library, contain fine mantelpieces and ceilings of the 16th and 17th centuries.
                    Among the many treasures preserved in t ’ he royal library is a fine collection
                    of drawings by the chief Italian painters, together with three volumes of MSS.
                    in the autograph of Leonardo da Vinci, illustrated with many drawings by his
                        hand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>These have
                            recently been printed with an English translation by Dr Richter, London,

                    contains a magnificent series of portraits by Holbein, eighty-seven in number,
                    highly finished in sepia and chalk, representing the chief personages of Henry
                    VIII.’s court—all of them works of the highest beauty and marvels of iconic
                    vigour. The foundation attached to the royal chapel, which possesses the
                    privileges of a “royal peculiar,” consists of a dean, who is exempt from any
                    episcopal jurisdiction, and a’college of canons.</p>
                <p>The royal forest of Windsor is one of the finest in the country, though it has
                    been much reduced in size even since 1790, when it contained about 60,000 acres;
                    many of its oaks are of great size and antiquity. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi>
