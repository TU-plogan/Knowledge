                <p><label type="entry">WOLFE, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label> (1727-1759),
                    the hero of Quebec, was the son of Lieutenant-General Edward Wolfe, and was born
                    in the vicarage of Westerham, Kent, on January 2, 1727. At an early age he
                    evinced a keen interest in the adventures and achievements of war, and at
                    thirteen accompanied his father to Cartagena. Obtaining a commission as ensign
                    in the 12th regiment of foot in 1741, he embarked for Flanders on the 10th May
                    of the following year, and during the campaign of 1743, in which he acted as
                    adjutant, he was present at the battle of Dettingen. Having exhibited, in
                    addition to high courage, a rare talent for command, he received while yet a
                    youth a commission, on 3d June 1744, as captain in the 4th or king’s regiment of
                    foot, and shortly afterwards was made brigade-major. In this capacity he took
                    part in the suppression of the rebellion of 1745, being present both at Falkirk
                    and at Culloden. In January 1747 he sailed for the Continent, and for his valour
                    at the battle of Lawfeldt on the 2d July he received the public thanks of the
                    commander-in-chief, the duke of Cumberland. On 5th January 1749 he was gazetted
                    major of the 20th regiment, and in the following year he became
                    lieutenant-colonel. In this position he began to manifest those great qualities
                    as a commander which were the secret of his success, and, while introducing into
                    the regiment that perfect discipline necessary to the highest proficiency,
                    secured the personal affection of almost every soldier. In the luckless
                    Rochefort expedition he was quartermaster-general, and by his dashing gallantry
                    attracted the special notice of Pitt. When therefore it was decided in 1758 to
                    send an expedition to Cape Breton under Amherst, Wolfe was appointed by Pitt
                    brigadier-general. Under the eye of Amherst and Admiral Boscawen he conducted
                    the landing at Louisburg through a heavy surf and in face of the well-directed
                    fire of the enemy. He himself was the first to land, and forming his division
                    into compact order attacked and carried with the bayonet the nearest French
                    battery, after which he formed the camp. Chiefly through his ardent energy the
                    siege operations were brought to a successful issue after an investment of six
                    months. Wolfe then eagerly urged an attack on Quebec, expressing his
                    determination to leave the service if nothing further was to be done. Pitt not
                    only acted on his advice, but selected him as the leader of the difficult and
                    almost chimerical enterprise. Quebec, besides being strongly fortified, was
                    occupied by forces which greatly outnumbered those placed at Wolfe’s disposal.
                    Moreover, Montcalm the French commander had an open country behind him for
                    supplies, and was only called upon to protract the defence behind his ramparts
                    till the resources of the besiegers were exhausted. It was incumbent on Wolfe to
                    force Montcalm to give battle, and this could only be effected by manoeuvres of
                    the most daring kind. After bombarding the city from the heights of Point Levi,
                    Wolfe made an attempt, 29th June 1759, to attack Montcalm’s camp in front, but
                    his instructions were not carried out with sufficient accuracy, and foreseeing
                    that irretrievable disaster was imminent he found it necessary after the attack
                    had begun to recall his troops and retire. As the enemy were now on their guard
                    against a second attack of a similar kind, Wolfe saw that the problem must be
                    solved by some other method, and after some time spent in careful consideration
                    he hit upon a still more daring plan. In the evening of the 12th September with
                    5000 men he silently descended the St Lawrence in boats, and, scaling the
                    heights of Abraham in the darkness, drew up his forces on the plains so as to
                    cut off Montcalm’s supplies. The audacity of the movement was too much for
                    Montcalm’s patience. On his attention being called to it he exclaimed “Oui, je
                    les vois où. ils ne doivent pas être; je vais les écraser.” But the genius of
                    Wolfe was equal to the occasion. With calm self-possession he forbade a single
                    shot to be fired till the enemy were within thirty yards. The crushing volleys
                    with which they were then met, followed by an impetuous attack with the bayonet,
                    was decisive of the action. While leading a charge at the head of the Louisburg
                    grenadiers, Wolfe had one of his wrists shattered by a shot, but wrapping a
                    handkerchief round it he kept on. Another shot struck him, and he still
                    advanced, when a third lodged in his breast. While he was lying in a swoon some
                    one near him exclaimed, “They run; see how they run !” “Who run 1” demanded
                    Wolfe, like one roused from sleep. “The enemy,” was the answer; “they give way
                    everywhere.” Wolfe then signified that a regiment should be sent down to Charles
                    river to cut off their retreat, and on learning that his <pb break="no"

                    and murmured as his last words, “Now God be praised, I will die in peace.”
                    Montcalm, the French commander, was mortally wounded in the same action, and
                    died soon afterwards. By the surrender of Quebec Canada was lost to the
                    French.</p>
