                <p><label type="entry">WIMBORNE MINSTER</label>, a market town of Dorset, England,
                    is situated on a gentle slope above the river Allen, near its confluence with
                    the Stour, and on the Great Western Railway, 6 miles north of Poole ajιd 114
                    westsouth-west of London. The feature of the town is the ancient minster. As it
                    now stands, it is a fine cruciform structure of various styles from Early Norman
                    to Perpendicular, and consists of a central lantern tower, nave and choir with
                    aisles, transepts without aisles, western or bell tower, north and south
                    porches, crypt, and vestry or sacristy, with the library over it. Its maximum
                    length is 182 feet, and its maximum breadth 102. The interior was restored in
                    1856-57. It contains a large number of interesting monuments, including a brass
                    with the date 873 (supposed to mark the resting-place of Ethelred, third son of
                    Ethelwulf), an orrery of the 14 th century, and an octagonal Norman font of
                    Purbeck marble. A new church, dedicated to St John the Evangelist, was built and
                    partly endowed in 1876. The free grammar-school, established in 1497, was
                    refounded by Elizabeth, a portion of the revenues of the monastery being devoted
                    to this purpose. New school buildings in the Elizabethan style were erected in
                    1851. There are two hospitals, St Margaret’s and Courtenay’s. Near Wimborne is
                    Canford Hall, the seat of Lord Wimborne, a mansion in the Tudor style, built by
