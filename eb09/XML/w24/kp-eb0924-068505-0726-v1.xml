                    (1666—1726), is now remembered chiefly for his part in the famous “Battle of the
                    Books,” but to his own generation his <hi rend="italic">Reflections upon Ancient
                        and Modern Learning</hi> was only one of many proofs of his extraordinary
                    amount and variety of scholarship. Born in 1666, the son of an English
                    clergyman, rector of Wrentham, in Suffolk, he was one of the.wonders of his age
                    in precocity. He could translate from several languages at the age of five. He
                    was under ten when he was sent to Cambridge, and he took the degree of B.A. at
                    the age of twelve years and five months, having already created such a sensation
                    by his linguistic attainments that Latin poems were addressed to him as a
                    prodigy. In the Battle of the Books he took a judicious middle course between
                    the extreme champions, Fontenelle <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit24newyrich/page/n727/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0924-0727-0686"/> and Temple, making a succinct, elaborate, and
                    careful comparison between ancients and moderns in oratory, poetry, mathematics,
                    philosophy, astronomy, anatomy, botany, and other arts and sciences. His <hi
                        rend="italic">Refections,</hi> the first edition of which appeared in 1694,
                    show that his prodigious memory was not confined to languages, and that he
                    possessed also strong judgment and argumentative power. The treatise may still
                    be read with interest, as a survey of the state of various sciences at the close
                    of the 17 th century. Wotton, who was made D.D. in 1707, wrote also on subjects
                    so diverse as fossils and Welsh laws, besides producing various historical
                    works. He was engaged on his translation of the Welsh laws at the time of his
                    death, which took place in 1726.</p>
