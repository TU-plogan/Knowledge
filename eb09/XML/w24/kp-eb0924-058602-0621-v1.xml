                <p><label type="entry">WILLIAMS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Roger (c. 1600-c</hi></label>.
                    1684), one of the founders of the colony of Rhode Island, North America, was
                    born either of Welsh or Cornish parents, but this as well as the date of his
                    birth has been the subject of dispute. In early life he went to London, where
                    his skill as a reporter commended him to the notice of Sir Edward Coke, who sent
                    him to Sutton’s Hospital (Charterhouse school). From Charterhouse he went to one
                    of the universities, but whether to Oxford or Cambridge there is no direct
                    evidence to show. The register of Jesus College, Oxford, has the following entry
                    under date 30th April 1624: “Rodericus Williams, filius Gulielmi Williams, de
                    Conwelgaio Pleb., an. Nat. 18.” If this entry refers to the founder of Rhode
                    Island he was of Welsh parentage and born about 1606. As Coke was a Cambridge
                    student, the probability is, however, that Williams was sent there; and a Roger
                    Williams matriculated at Pembroke College of that university on 1st July 1625,
                    and took his B.A. degree in January 1627. This Roger Williams was the second son
                    of William Williams, and was baptized at Gwinsea, Cornwall, on 24th July 1600, a
                    date which corresponds with a statement regarding his age made by Williams
                    himself. After leaving the university he entered on the study of law; but, soon
                    forsaking it for theology, he was admitted into holy orders and is said to have
                    had a parochial charge. On account of his Puritan beliefs he left England for
                    Massachusetts Bay, where he arrived in the beginning of 1631. He accepted an
                    invitation to become pastor of a church at Salem, on 12th April 1631, the same
                    day that the magistrates were assembled at Boston to express disapproval of the
                    scheme. To escape persecution he went to Plymouth, beyond the jurisdiction of
                    Massachusetts Bay, and became assistant pastor there; but in the autumn of 1633
                    he returned to Salem as assistant pastor, succeeding in the following year as
                    sole pastor. Chiefly on account of his pronounced opinions regarding the
                    restricted sphere of the civil magistrate in religious matters, he came into
                    conflict with the court of Massachusetts, and, being banished from the colony,
                    left with a <pb break="no"

                    Narragansett Bay. At first they received a grant of land from an Indian chief,
                    which is now included in Seekonk, Massachusetts, and began to build houses, but
                    in June following he and five others embarked in a canoe for Rhode Island, and
                    founded a settlement to which Williams, in remembrance “of God’s providence to
                    him in his distress,” gave the name of Providence. In 1639 he was publicly
                    immersed and became pastor of the first Baptist church of Providence. As
                    Massachusetts now began to claim jurisdiction over Narragansett Bay, Williams
                    proceeded in June 1643 to England, and through the mediation of his friend Sir
                    Henry Vane, whose acquaintance he had made at Massachusetts, obtained an
                    independent charter, 14th March 1644. In 1649 he was chosen deputy president. He
                    again visited England in 1651 to obtain a more explicit charter, and remained
                    there till 1654, enjoying the friendship of Milton, Cromwell, and other
                    prominent Puritans. On his return to the colony in 1654 he was chosen president
                    or governor, and remained in office till 1658. He lived to the age of
                    eighty-four, but the exact date of his death is uncertain.</p>
