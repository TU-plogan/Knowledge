                <p><label type="entry">HELMONT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean Baptiste van</hi></label>
                    (1577-1644), was born at Brussels in 1577. He was educated at Louvain, and began
                    the study of natural science under the Jesuits in that city. Their hard and dry
                    philosophy, however, had few attractions for a nature so ardent and imaginative
                    as his. Turning for relief to other systems, he found no rest except in the
                    mysticism of A Kempis and Tauler. From them he learned that wisdom is the gift
                    of the Supreme Being, that it must be obtained by prayer, .and that we must
                    renounce our own will if we wish to participate in the influence of the divine
                    grace. From this time he began a life of exemplary meekness and humility, made
                    over his property to his sister, and retired from the high society in which he
                    had hitherto walked. He devoted himself to the study of medicine, read carefully
                    all that had been written on the science, and felt dissatisfied with its method
                    and results. He then turned to Paracelsus and the alchemists, and conferred a
                    real boon on humanity by rescuing chemical science from the erratic absurdities
                    of the post-Paracelsian alchemists, and applying to it more philosophical
                    principles. He graduated as M.D. in 1599, and, after travelling through France
                    and Italy, Switzerland and England, married a rich lady of Brabant, by whom he
                    had several children. He died in Holland in 1644, in the sixty-seventh year of
                    his age. Science is under real obligations to Van Helmont, though the greater
                    part of his speculations present a curious mixture of mystical philosophy and
                    acute chemical research. To him is due the invention, or at least the first
                    application, of the term “gas” in the sense in which it is now used. He also
                    discovered that gas was disengaged in abundance by the application of heat to
                    various bodies, and during the solution of various carbonates and metals in
                    acids.</p>
                <p>Van Helmont’s works were published at Amsterdam in 1648 by his son Mercurius; a
                    more accurate and complete edition is that of Elzevir, 1652. The fullest account
                    of his speculations is given in Rixner and Sieber, <hi rend="italic">Beiträge
                        zur Geschichte der Physiologie</hi> (1819-26), Hft. vii. See also Spiess,

                    Van Helmont’s mystical theosophy and alchemy appeared in even greater confusion
                    in the works of his youngest son, Franz Mercurius, who was born in 1618 and
                    died, after a somewhat adventurous and troubled life, at Berlin in 1699. His
                    chief works are <hi rend="italic">Cabbalah</hi><hi rend="italic">Denudata,</hi>
                    1677; <hi rend="italic">Paradoxal Discoτιrses,</hi> 1685; and <hi rend="italic"
