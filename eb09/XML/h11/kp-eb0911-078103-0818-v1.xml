                    (1488-1540), a distinguished German humanist of the 16th century, was bern
                    January 6, 1488, at Bockendorf near Frankenberg in Hesse. His family name is not
                    known: the baptismal name Eoban he owed to a local saint; Hessus merely
                    indicates the land of his origin; while the prenomen Helius was assumed by
                    himself partly with reference to the sun-god, patron of poets, and partly also,
                    it is said, with reference to the fact that he had been born on a Sunday. His
                    early education was received in the monastery of Haina, where his father held a
                    menial position, and afterwards at Frankenberg; in 1503 he entered the
                    university of Erfurt, where in 1505 Crotus Rubianus and Ulrich von Hutten became
                    his fellow-students and his firm friends. Though devoting himself
                    enthusiastically to the composition of Latin verse, in which he soon became an
                    acknowledged master, he was far from neglecting the other studies of the place,
                    and shortly after his graduation he held for a short time the post of rector of
                    the St Severus school. Compelled by disturbances to leave Erfurt in 1510, he for
                    five years led a somewhat wandering life, in the course of which he passed some
                    time in Leipsic as a student of law; in</p>
                <p>1515 he returned to his former post at Erfurt, and in</p>
                <p>1516 became professor of belles-lettres. He was now prominently associated with
                    Reuchlin, Peutinger, Mutianus, as well as with Crotus Rubianus and Hutten; and
                    from the first he fully identified himself with the cause of Luther and ,the
                    Reformation. In 1526 he went as teacher of rhetoric and poetry to Nuremberg, but
                    in 1534 returned to Erfurt, whence in 1536 he was called to the chair of poetry
                    and history in Marburg. There he died October 5, 1540.</p>
                <p>Hessus was generally regarded by his contemporaries both in Germany and elsewhere
                    as the foremost Latin poet of the age; “if Erasmus was the modern Cicero, Eoban
                    was Virgil and Ovid.” His most popular works were a translation into Latin
                    distichs of the Psalms, which passed through more than forty editions, and Latin
                    hexameter translations of Theocritus and of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad.</hi> He
                    also published <hi rend="italic">Silvae,</hi> a collection of idylls, epigrams,
                    and occasional pieces, and a series of Christian <hi rend="italic"

                    were edited by his friend Joachim Camerarius, who also published his Life
                    (1553). See the monographs of Herz <hi rend="italic">{H.E. Hesse, ein Lehrer
