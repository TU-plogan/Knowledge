                    (1813-18G3), a German poet and dramatist, was born of peasant parents at
                    Wesselburen, in Schleswig-Holstein, 18th March 1813. In his fourteenth year he
                    obtained a humble clerkship in his native parish, but already his ambition was
                    soaring towards higher things. At an early period he began to practise poetical
                    composition, and several of his poems published in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Modezeitung</hi> at Hamburg awakened such interest that several gentlemen
                    procured him in his twenty-second year the meins of preparing himself in Hamburg
                    for the university. He afterwards studied philosophy and history at Heidelberg
                    and Munich. In 1811 he returned to Hamburg, where he published his first
                    tragedy, <hi rend="italic">Judith.</hi> In a journey which lie made to
                    Copenhagen in 1842 he formed the acquaintance of Thorwaldsen and Oehlenschläger,
                    and acquired the more substantial advantage of a travelling annuity from the
                    king of Denmark. He accordingly visited Paris, after which he went to Italy,
                    where he remained several years, staying principally at Rome, Pisa, and Palermo.
                    Having in the spring of 1846 stopped at Vienna on his way home to Germany, he
                    made the acquaintance of the actress Christine Engehaus, whom he married in May
                    of the same year. His marriage led him to take up his permanent residence in
                    Vienna, and probably deepened his interest in dramatic composition, which from
                    that time chiefly occupied his attention. He died in 1863. His principal dramas
                    are <hi rend="italic">Genoveva,</hi> 1843; <hi rend="italic">Maria
                        Magdalena,</hi> 1844; <hi rend="italic">Julia,</hi> 1851; <hi rend="italic"
