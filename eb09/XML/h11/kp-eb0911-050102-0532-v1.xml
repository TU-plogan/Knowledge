                    (1806-1876), a Scottish painter and president of the Royal Scottish Academy, was
                    the son of a watchmaker, and was born at St Ninians, near Stirling, in February
                    1806. Soon after his birth his parents removed to Stirling, where George was
                    apprenticed to a bookseller. His love for art having, however, become very
                    decided, he in his eighteenth year entered the Trustees’ Academy at Edinburgh.
                    Here he so distinguished himself that in 1826 he was invited by the Scottish
                    artists, who had resolved to found a Scottish academy, to join it as an
                    associate. Indeed it was chiefly to the zeal and judgment of Harvey and of two
                    others that it owed its early success. Harvey’s first picture, A Village School,
                    was exhibited in 1826 at the Edinburgh Institution; and from the time of the
                    opening of the Academy in the following year he continued annually to enrich its
                    exhibitions by a succession of pictures which, although they never obtained much
                    fame beyond the limits of Scotland, appealed with such effect to Scottish
                    sentiment as to win for him in his native land an unrivalled popularity. His
                    best known pictures are those depicting historical episodes in religious history
                    from a puritan or evangelical point of view, such as Covenanters Preaching,
                    Covenanters’ Communion, John Bunyan and his Blind Daughter, Sabbath Evening, and
                    the Quitting of the Manse. He was, however, equally successful in subjects not
                    directly religious; and The Bowlers, A Highland Funeral, The Curlers, A Schule
                    Skailin ’, and Children Blowing Bubbles in the Churchyard of Grey friars,
                    Edinburgh, manifest the same close observation of character, artistic
                    conception, and conscientious elaboration of details. In The Night Mail and Dawn
                    Revealing the New World to Columbus the aspects of nature are made use of in
                    different ways, but with equal happiness, to lend impressiveness and solemnity
                    to human concerns. It was chiefly in his later years that he devoted his
                    attention to landscape, the branch of art in which on the whole he was most
                    successful, and there perhaps in suggesting the deep calm and the sweet and
                    varied charm which broods among the liills when nature is at rest. He also
                    devoted some attention to portraiture, among his works in this branch of art
                    being a portrait of Professor Wilson, now at the Philosophical Institution,
                    Edinburgh. In 1829 he was elected a fellow of the Royal Scottish Academy, and in
                    1864 he succeeded Sir J. W. Gordon as president. He received the honour of
                    knighthood in 1867. His death took place at Edinburgh, January 22, 1876.</p>
