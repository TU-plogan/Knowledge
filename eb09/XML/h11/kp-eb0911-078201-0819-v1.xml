                <p><label type="entry">HESTIA</label>, a Greek goddess, who is probably the latest
                    in origin of the greater deities. She seems to belong to a particular stage in
                    the advance of civilization, and to embody the religious sanction that confirmed
                    the social system then reached. When we compare her worship with that of Agni,
                    the nearest parallel in the Vedic period, we see that the Greeks made this
                    advance after they had separated from the Aryan conquerors of India. Agni is
                    invoked in the <hi rend="italic">Rig Veda</hi> as the brother, friend, and
                    helper of men, as dwelling with them and mediating between them and the gods.
                    But beyond this Hestia is the hearth-fire as the centre of an association, wider
                    or narrower, which meets in common at the hearth. She is not mentioned in Homer;
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> sometimes one swears by Zeus, the table
                    and the hearth, <hi rend="italic">i.β.,</hi> by Zeus as the god of the family
                    both in its external relation of hospitality and its internal unity round its
                    own hearth. Hence we have the Zeus <hi rend="italic">ΐστιώναξ,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">εστιoυχo&lt;s, lφlστa&gt;s.</hi> The former of these two ideas
                    is too delicate and fine ever to become more than a mere aspect of Zeus, but the
                    second gradually formed itself into a distinct worship, in which the already
                    existing worship of the fire was merged. The fact that Hestia is not mentioned
                    in Homer shows that her worship was not so universally acknowledged at the time
                    which these poems reveal to us. Perhaps we may see in the connexion of the Latin
                    Jupiter and Vesta at Lavinium a relic of the original connexion of the two; and
                    the fact that the worship of this same goddess under the same name (they are
                    only two forms of the feminine of the passive participle of the root <hi
                        rend="italic">vas,</hi> burn) is found in Latium and Greece affords strong
                    evidence of a specially close connexion between the two races. We find therefore
                    in Hestia relics of the old pre-Greek worship; she is the altar-fire, presiding
                    over all sacrifices, and sharing in the honours of all the gods. The opening
                    sacrifice was offered to Hestia; to her at the sacrificial meal the first and
                    the last libations were poured. The fire of Hestia was always kept burning, or
                    if by any mischance it were extinguished, only sacred fire made by friction, or
                    got direct from the sun, might be used to rekindle it (see Kuhn, <hi
                        rend="italic">Herabkunft').</hi> But beyond this she is the goddess of the
                    family union, the personification of the idea of home (see Weicker, <hi
                        rend="italic">Gr. Goth,</hi> ii. 694), the protectress along with Zeus of
                    the suppliants who fled for refuge to the hearth. To her therefore is ascribed
                    the art of housebuilding. Hestia and Hermes are often united as the
                    representatives of home and private life on the one hand, and of all business
                    and outdoor life on the other. The city union, moreover, is just the family
                    union on a large scale; it has its centre in the prytaneum, where the common
                    hearth-fire round which the magistrates meet is always burning, and where the
                    sacred rites that sanctify the concord of city life are performed. From this
                    fire, as the representative of the life of the city, was taken the fire
                    wherewith that on the hearth of a new colony was kindled. As patroness of the
                    deliberations held in the prytaneum, Hestia is surnamed <hi rend="italic"
                        >βονλαiα,</hi> Even larger unions than the city had their central fire: in
                    Tegea was the Hestia of the Arcadians; and it is probable that the Achaeans had
                    theirs at Aeginium. In the later mystic philosophy Hestia became the hearth of
                    the universe, the eternal fire at the centre of the world.</p>
                <p>As Hestia had her home in the prytaneum, special temples to her rarely occur.
                    There was one in Hermione, where the only symbol of the goddess was a fire
                    always burning on the hearth. We also hear of her house at Olympia. Her statue
                    stood in the prytaneum at Athens beside that of Peace. Though many statues of
                    the Roman Vesta are preserved, more or less based on the Greek conception of
                    Hestia, yet no really Greek representation of the goddess has come down to
                    us.</p>
