                    (1795-1874), astronomer, was born on December 8, 1795, at Tondern, in the duchy
                    of Schleswig. When a youth he served an apprenticeship to a clock and watchmaker
                    at Flensburg, with whom he remained several years. During this time he exhibited
                    an <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n473/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0473-0452"/> intense interest fur mathematics and the
                    physical sciences, which was the means of his introduction in 1820 to
                    Schumacher, professor of astronomy at Copenhagen, who, appreciating Hansen’s
                    abilities, engaged him to assist in the measurement of an arc of meridian in
                    Holstein. This led to his appointment as assistant to Schumacher at the
                    observatory of Altona, on its foundation in 1823. Hansen’s reputation as an
                    excellent mathematician had by this time become generally known, and in 1825 he
                    was selected to succeed Professor Encke as director.of the observatory of
                    Seeberg, near Gotha. There he remained for the rest of his life, devoting his
                    talents to the development of the highest branches of mathematical astronomy,
                    with an originality of conception which was acknowledged by the English Royal
                    Astronomical Society on two occasions, by the award of their gold medal for his
                    researches in physical astronomy and his lunar tables. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tables de la Lune</hi> appeared in 1857, published at the expense of the
                    British Government; they have been adopted for use in the calculations of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Nautical Almanac.</hi> In addition to his important volume
                    containing the full details of the formulae explanatory of his lunar theory,
                    Hansen was the author of a large number of miscellaneous astronomical papers,
                    principally relating to the orbits of comets and planets or to perturbational
                    astronomy. In one of these he was the first to point out that Encke’s value of
                    the horizontal equatorial solar parallax required to be increased to reconcile
                    the lunar theory with modern observations,—an opinion which was subsequently
                    confirmed by Le Verrier from his planetary researches, and by the observations
