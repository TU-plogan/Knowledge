                    (1755-1794),a French revolutionist, surnarned from the newspaper he edited “Le
                    Père Duchesne,” was born of obscure parents at Alençon in 1755. He came at an
                    early age to Paris, where he lost more than one situation through malversation,
                    and was in abject poverty when the occurrence of the French Revolution opened up
                    to him a career in which he obtained considerable temporary success and
                    permanent notoriety. Having shown great readiness and proficiency in a style of
                    writing and of oratory which appealed to the worst feelings of the revolutionary
                    mob, he soon acquired great influence in the clubs, and was chosen to oppose the
                    constitutional paper <hi rend="italic">Ls</hi><hi rend="italic">Père</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Duchesne</hi> by editing a revolutionary paper of the same
                    name. The scurrilous and extravagant language of the new print exactly coincided
                    with the sentiments of the class to whom it was addressed, and it contributed
                    not a little to several of the worst and most violent manifestations of the
                    revolutionary spirit. It had a very beneficial influence on the fortunes of its
                    editor, who after the 10th August 1792 was one of the chief members of the
                    revolutionary commune, and on the 2d September was appointed substitute to the
                        <hi rend="italic">procureur</hi><hi rend="italic">syndic.</hi> On the 21th
                    May 1793 an order was sent out for his arrest by the more moderate party of the
                    commune on the ground that he was plotting their assassination, but on account
                    of a formidable outbreak of the mob he was set at liberty, and when he appeared
                    again at the commune he was presented with a civic crown. Having been appointed
                    a member of the commission to examine Marie Antoinette, he with unsurpassed
                    moral baseness foully accused her of a crime too scandalous to be mentioned,
                    Along with several of his colleagues he invented the worship of the goddess
                    “Reason,” and subsequently he organized a party of ultra-revolutionists known as
                    the Hébertists or <hi rend="italic">enrages.</hi> The faction w ere, however,
                    arrested by the committee of public safety, and on the 24th March 1794 were led
                    forth to execution. Hébert behaved with great Cowardice at his trial, and died
