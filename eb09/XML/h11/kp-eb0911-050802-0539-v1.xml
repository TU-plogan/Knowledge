                <p>The office of guardian of the kaabelι or temple of Mecca, and chief of the tribe
                    of Koreish, which was vested in 'Abd Menâf, would have descended to 'Abd Shems,
                    his eldest son, had it not been given to Hâshim, the second, in reward for some
                    military successes, and this circumstance caused a bitter* enmity between the
                    two families. When Mahomet died, 'All claimed the right to the office of caliph
                        <hi rend="italic">{khalffeh,</hi> “vicegerent” or “successor”), but found
                    formidable rivals in Abu Bekr, the father of 'Ayesha the prophet’s favourite
                    wife, 'Omar, another of his fathers-in law, and 'Othn√ιn, the only member of the
                    rival house of Ommaiyeh who had joined the Muslim ranks. 'Ayesha, whom 'All had
                    mortally offended by listening to a charge of incontinence which had been made
                    against her, made common cause with the Ommaiyides, and strenuously opposed
                    'All’s accession. A compromise was effected by the election of Abu Bekr; on his
                    death 'Omar was made caliph, and when he in turn died, '0thman was elected, as
                    *Ali refused to subscribe to the conditions imposed upon him that he should
                    govern in accordance with the “traditions” as well as the Korân. These
                    “traditions” are the whole body of ceremonial laws and customs by which the
                    imperfect code cf the Korân was supplemented; they are derived from ancient Arab
                    and even Jewish usage, although to give them a proper sanction and force they
                    have been attributed to Mahomet himself, who is supposed to have enunciated them
                    at different times as separate <hi rend="italic">ahadith</hi> (singular, <hi
                        rend="italic">lιadithf,</hi> and the tracing of them through the various
                    authorities to the prophet himself is still a most important branch of Muslim
                    theology.</p>
                <p>The “traditions” are spoken of collectively as the <hi rend="italic">Sunneh,</hi>
                    whence the name Sunni, given to that sect of Mahometans who follow them, and it
                    was to this that 'All refused to subscribe. 'Othman ou his accession displayed
                    an unblushing partisanship for his own, the Ommaiyide, family, and appointed
                    Mo'âwiyeh, a bitter enemy of the Hâshimi family, governor of Syria. 'Othman was
                    assassinated in 655 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> and 'All was then
                    unconditionally elected caliph. He immediately recalled Mo'âwiyeh, who refused
                    to obey, and, supported by the influence of the implacable'Ayesha, claimed the
                    caliphate for himself. A severe struggle between the two parties ensiled, and
                    'Ali was at first successful, but was at length compelled by intrigue to submit
                    his claims to arbitration, instead of following up his military advantages. A
                    number of his followers, about 12,000, taking umbrage at this, deserted him,
                    thus originating the sect of Khârejiyeh or “Separatists,” who reject the lawful
                    government established by public consent. A conspiracy of three, of these
                    deserters resulted in the murder of 'All, who was slain at the door of a mosque
                    in Ktifa, and buried at a spot about 5 miles from that town. A magnificent
                    mausoleum was afterwards erected over his tomb, which became later on the site
                    of the town Meshed 'Ali, “All’s shrine,” one of the great places of resort for
                    Shiah pilgrims. On All’s death his eldest son Hasan was elected caliph, but
                    resigned the office in favour of Mo'âwiyeh on condition that he should resume it
                    at the latter’s death. Mo'âwiyeh, however, wdιo wished his own son Yezid to
                    succeed him, caused Hasan to be foully murdered by his own wife eight years
                    later. Yezid succeeded his father, on the latter’s death, without opposition or
                    election, and the Ommaiyide dynasty became thus firmly established on the
                    throne. The partisans of 'All’s family were, however, far from content, and
                    Husein, 'All’s surviving son, was secretly invited to Kùfa to place himself at
                    the head of the party, and revolt against Yezid. Prompt measures were taken by
                    the caliph, who had obtained timely warning of the movement. 'Obeidallah, a
                    vigorous officer, was appointed governor of Kιifa, seized upon Huseiu’s envoy,
                    Muslim, and one Hâni in whose house he had been concealed, and when the populace
                    assembled and clamoured for their release he caused them to be beheaded and
                    their <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n540/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0540-0509"/> heads ta be cast down among the crowd. Husein
                    was intercepted on the borders of Babylonia by Harro, with a company of horse,
                    who told him he had orders to bring him alone to Kùfa, but allowed him to
                    proceed by what route he chose without losing sight of him. A horseman met them
                    on the road with secret orders from Obeidallah to lead Husein into an open and
                    undefended place, and halt until <hi rend="superscript"> c</hi> Amer, the
                    commander of the Syrian army, arrived with his forces. This happened the next
                    day, and Husein and his small escort were surrounded by 4000 horse, and
                    slaughtered, after a stubborn resistance, on the plain of Kerbelà by the banks
                    of the Euphrates, under peculiarly tragic circumstances, his little
                    son'Abdallah, and his nephew, a beautiful child, both being murdered in his
                    arms. This took place on the 10th of Muharram 61 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.h.</hi>
                    (680 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.),</hi> and is commemorated during that month by
                    the Shiahs in India and Persia, a long miracle play being performed, the scenes
                    of which are carried on from day to day, and culminate in carrying out the <hi
                        rend="italic">tabut</hi> or coffins of the martyrs to an open place,
                    generally the cemetery, or in sea-side places to the sea-shore.</p>
                <p>The cause of ’ Ali and his family was warmly expoused by the Persians, who had
                    been forced to embrace Islam, but who regarded the Sunneh or Semitic law with
                    especial repugnance. The party were known as Shiahs, “Sectarians;” and as the
                    quarrel between them and the Sunnis thus perpetuates the old enmity between Jew
                    and Gentile, between the Semitic and Aryan races, it has produced an irreparable
                    breach in Islam.</p>
                <p>The passion play of <hi rend="italic">Hαsαn and Husein</hi> has been published in
                    English by Sir Lewis Pelly (London, 1879,2 vols. 8vo) from the dictation of
                    native teachers and performers of the drama. (E. H. P.)</p>
