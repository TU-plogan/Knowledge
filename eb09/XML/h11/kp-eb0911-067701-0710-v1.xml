                    the author of the <hi rend="italic">History of Great Britain written on a new
                        plan,</hi> was the son of a farmer, and was born in the parish of St Ninians
                    near Stirling, 18th February 1718. He received his early education at the school
                    of his native parish, and at the grammar school of Stirling, and after
                    completing a course of study at Edinburgh University became master of the
                    grammar school of Annan. In 1746 he was licensed to preach by the Annan
                    presbytery, shortly after which he was chosen minister of a Presbyterian
                    congregation at Carlisle, where he remained until 1760, when he was removed to a
                    similar charge at Berwick-on-Tweed. It was during his stay at Berwick that the
                    idea of his <hi rend="italic">History</hi> first occurred to him, but the dearth
                    of books and the difficulty of consulting original authorities compelled him to
                    postpone the execution of his design till his removal to Edinburgh, as minister
                    of New Grey friars, in 1768. The first volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                        >History</hi> appeared in 1771, and the others followed at irregular
                    intervals until 1785, when the fifth was published, bringing down the narrative
                    to the Tudor dynasty. The work was virulently assailed by Gilbert Stuart, but
                    the attack was overdone, and although it for a time hindered the sale, the
                    injury effected was only temporary. For the volumes published in his lifetime
                    Henry realized as much as £3300, and through the influence of Lord Mansfield he
                    was in 1781 rewarded with a pension of £100 a year from George III. In 1784 he
                    received the degree of D.D. from the university of Edinburgh. He died in 1790
                    before his tenth volume was quite ready for the press. Four years after his
                    death it was published under the care of Malcolm Laing, who supplied the entire
                    chapters v. and vii., and added an index. A life of the author by Sir Henry Well
                    wood Moncreiff was prefixed to the volume. The novel feature in Henry’s <hi
                        rend="italic">History</hi> was that he combined with the narrative of the
                    great political events of each era an account of the domestic state and social
                    progress of the people within the same period. His researches were conducted
                    with great care, and his work embodies much novel and curious information; but
                    the comprehensiveness of his plan, and the limited character of the historical
                    sources then available, greatly militated against the accuracy of his narrative.
                    Notwithstanding also that the work is well arranged, and written with clearness
                    and simplicity, its defects as an authority are not compensated for by any
                    peculiar excellences of. style, by originality or vigour of reflexion, or by any
                    special skill in the delineation of character.</p>
