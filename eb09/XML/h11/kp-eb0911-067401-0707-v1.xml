                    —variously called of Cluny, because he was at one time a monk of that rule, of
                    Lausanne, because he is believed to have first appeared as a preacher of
                    repentance there, and of Toulouse, because his later years were passed in that
                    city and neighbourhood, —founder of the anti-sacerdotal sect of <hi
                        rend="italic">IIenricians,</hi> was of Swiss or Italian extraction (his
                    birthplace is unknown), and was born towards the end of the 11th century. About
                    the year 1115 he abandoned the cloister, where he had entered the diaconate,
                    and, burning with righteous indignation against the dead mechanical
                    ceremonialism of the dominant church and the hideous moral corruption of its
                    clergy, began to go about as an itinerant preacher. The neighbourhood of
                    Lausanne was probably the scene of his earliest appearances, but he soon betook
                    himself to France, where the soil had been prepared for him by Peter of Bruis
                    (leader of the Petrobrusians), and where he at once began to attract adherents.
                    About the beginning of Lent in 1116 he asked and received permission of the
                    bishop Hildebert of Le Mans (Cenomani) to visit that city; the fact that he was
                    not only tolerated but received with some degree of honour at this time shows
                    that he had not as yet fallen under serious suspicion of heretical pravity. Soon
                    the extraordinary fascination of his character began to make itself felt; and
                    the rude but convincing eloquence with which he exposed the immorality of the
                    clergy rapidly alienated the people of the town from their spiritual guides;
                    remonstrances and inhibitions by the local ecclesiastical authorities were
                    equally vain; and when Hildebert, who had been absent in Rome, returned to his
                    diocese, he found his episcopal blessing treated with contempt, and was bluntly
                    told by his flock that they had found “a father, a priest, an intercessor, more
                    exalted in authority, more honourable in life, more eminent in knowledge.” From
                    the confused accounts of Henry’s life and labours which have reached uβ it does
                    not appear that even then he had come forward as the teacher of any new or
                    strange doctrine; his efforts as a reformer of public and domestic morals are
                    chiefly insisted on, especially the measures he took for the reclamation of
                    fallen women, for the encouragement of early and honourable marriage among the
                    laity, and for the promotion of a higher standard of purity among the nominally
                    celibate clergy. It was not as a heretic but merely as a somewhat inconvenient
                    agitator that he was ordered by Hildebert at last to leave Le Mans. We next read
                    of Henry as conspicuously active in Provence, especially after the burning in
                    1124 of Peter of Bruis, with whose peculiar views he is alleged, upon evidence
                    which has not reached us, to have entirely sympathized. In 1134 he was arrested
                    by the bishop of Arles and taken to the council of Pisa; there he was declared
                    to be a heretic, and condemned to imprisonment. This captivity, however, does
                    not appear to have lasted long. The scene of the third and concluding chapter of
                    the recorded life of Henry is laid at Toulouse, where after ten years of
                    uninterrupted activity with the result complained of by Saint Bernard <hi
                        rend="italic">(Ep.</hi> 241)—“the churches are without flocks, the flocks
                    without priests, the priests are nowhere treated with due reverence, the
                    churches are reduced to the level of synagogues, the sacraments are despised,
                    the festivals disregarded ”—it was found necessary by Pope Eugenius III. to take
                    active measures for the defence of the church. With this view the cardinal
                    bishop Alberic of Ostia was sent as a legate to the disaffected districts, and
                    with him was associated Bernard of Clairvaux. Their efforts were ultimately
                    successful; Henry died an obscure death in prison about the year 1148, and his
                    sect soon afterwards ceased to have any separate existence.</p>

                    tenets of Henry and the Henricians (if distinctive tenets there were) cannot be
                    gathered with any clearness. The probability is that Henry and his disciples had
                    not any definite system of doctrine to oppose to that of the church, but were
                    anti-sacerdotal i sts pure and simple, “insurgents, who shook the established
                    government, but did not attempt to replace it by any new form or system of
                    opinions and discipline.” See Milman, <hi rend="italic">History of Latin
