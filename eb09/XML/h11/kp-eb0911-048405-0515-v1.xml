                    Saracens in Sicily and Italy. It is even said that in a crusade against the
                    infidels he penetrated as far as Jerusalem, but most probably if he entered that
                    city it was in the peaceful character of a pilgrim. Returning after his exploits
                    to Constantinople, he was refused the hand of a niece of the empress Zoe,
                    because, according to the legend, the empress herself was enamoured of him; and
                    offended at the refusal he one night made his escape with two galleys, carrying
                    with him all his treasures, and also it is said the princess whose hand had been
                    denied him, whom, however, he put on shore after he had passed the Bosphorus,
                    with a message to the empress that, if lie had so willed, her power would have
                    been vain against his strategy aud skill. He now set sail for Russia, where he
                    was warmly welcomed by King Yaroslaf; and as he was now a man of great fame and
                    wealth Yaroslaf gave him in marriage his daughter Ellisof or Elizabeth, whose
                    hand he had formerly asked in vain. Soon after his marriage he resolved to
                    return home and if possible to win the crown of Norway from his nephew Magnus
                    the Good. With that purpose he about the year 1045 came to an agreement with his
                    relative Swend of Denmark, who had been driven by Magnus into exile in Sweden;
                    but Magnus, having obtained news of the intended joint expedition against him,
                    entered into communication with Harold, and agreed to share with him the
                    government of Norway, each ruling over a separate division. They now turned
                    their united forces against Swend, drove him from Denmark, and completely
                    prostrated his power; but just when he had resolved finally in despair to give
                    up the contest, Magnus about the year 1047 took suddenly ill and died,
                    bequeathing on his death-bed the whole of Norway to Harold and Denmark to Swend.
                    Such a bequest did not however coincide with the desires of Harold, and between
                    him and Swend a constant warfare raged for several years, until in 1064 they
                    agreed to a peace by which each retained his dominions according to the old
                    established boundaries. The chief motive of Harold in consenting to this
                    arrangement was probably that he might be free to embark on a purpose of wider
                    ambition, namely, to revive in his own person the old Scandinavian sovereignty
                    of England which had ended with the death of Hardicanute. The story goes that he
                    was instigated to the enterprise by a visit from Tostig, the exiled earl of
                    Northumbria; but whether that be so or not, he in 1066 set sail for England with
                    an immense fleet, which carried his wife Ellisof, his son Olaf, his treasures,
                    and more than half of all his fighting men. After touching at Orkney, where he
                    left his wife, he proceeded southwards to the Tyne, and was there joined by
                    Tostig and by a contingent of troops from Malcolm of Scotland. From the Tyne
                    they sailed southwards along the coast of Yorkshire, stopping at intervals to
                    ravage the country for provisions, and after proceeding up the Humber cast
                    anchor on the left bank of the Ouse near the village of Riccall. Leaving a
                    detachment under his son Olaf to guard the fleet, Harold along with Tostig.
                    marched with a great force towards York, and, defeating the Northumbrians with
                    heavy loss at Fulford on September 20th, received the surrender of the city on
                    September 24th. Meanwhile Harold of England, having heard of the Norse invasion,
                    was marching northwards from London day and night with an immense army; and
                    passing through York on the day after its surrender, he appeared suddenly on the
                    afternoon before the Norsemen encamped at Stamfordbridge. Taken by surprise, the
                    Norsemen fought nevertheless with stubborn courage and fierce energy, but though
                    the battle was for some time doubtful it ended at nightfall in their total
                    overthrow, with a slaughter so enormous that the great majority of them lay dead
                    upon the field. Tostig was slain and also Harold Hardrada himself, who, towering
                    head and shoulders above all his warriors, was inflicting death on all who dared
                    to meet him, till struck by an arrow in the windpipe he received the wound which
                    laid him low. According to some writers his body ultimately found burial in
                    Norway.</p>
