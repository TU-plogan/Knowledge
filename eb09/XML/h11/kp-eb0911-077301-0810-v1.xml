                <p><label type="entry">HERTZ, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henrik</hi></label> (1798-1870),
                    Danish poet, was born of Jewish parents in Copenhagen, August 25, 1798. At that
                    date it was unusual for Jews to enjoy a professional education, but young Hertz
                    showed such marked literary bias that in 1817 he was sent to the university. His
                    father having died in his infancy, and the family property having been destroyed
                    in the bombardment of 1807, the boy was brought up by his relative, M. L.
                    Nathanson, for many years editor of the principal Danish newspaper. Young Hertz
                    was destined for the law, and passed his juridical examination in 1825. But his
                    taste was all for polite literature, and in 1827 he came forward as a dramatic
                    author by the publication of two plays, <hi rend="italic">Herr Burchardt and his
                        Family</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Love and Policy</hi>; the latter enjoyed
                    considerable success on the stage. In 1828 followed the comedy of <hi
                        rend="italic">Flyttedagen,</hi> which occupied itself with the humours of
                    moving house on quarter-day. In 1830 he brought out what was a complete novelty
                    in Danish literature, a drama in rhymed verse, <hi rend="italic">Amor's Strokes
                        of Genius.</hi> In the same year Hertz published anonymously <hi
                        rend="italic">Gjenganger-brevene,</hi> or Letters from a Ghost, which he
                    pretended were written by Bιggesen, who had died in 1826, and which were full of
                    satirical humour and fine critical insight. The success of this book was
                    overwhelming; Copenhagen talked of nothing else for a whole season; but Hertz
                    preserved his anonymity, and the secret was not known until many years later. In
                    1832 he published a didactic poem, <hi rend="italic">Nature and Art,</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Four Poetical Epistles. A Day on the Island of</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Als</hi> was his next comedy, followed in 1835 by <hi
                        rend="italic">The Only Fault.</hi> Hertz passed through Germany and
                    Switzerland into Italy in 1833; he spent the winter there, and returned the
                    following autumn through France to Denmark. In 1836 his comedy of <hi
                        rend="italic">The Savings Bank</hi> enjoyed a great success. But it was not
                    till 1837 that he developed his most important talent by writing the romantic
                    drama of <hi rend="italic">Sven I Dyrinfs House,</hi> a beautiful and original
                    piece, which still holds the stage. His historical tragedy <hi rend="italic"
                        >Valdemar Atterdag</hi> was not so well received in 1839; but in 1845 he
                    achieved an immense success with his lyrical drama <hi rend="italic"
                        >King</hi><hi rend="italic">Renë's</hi><hi rend="italic">Daughter,</hi>
                    which has been translated into almost every European language, and successfully
                    acted all over the civilized world. To this succeeded the tragedy of <hi
                        rend="italic">Ninon</hi> in 1818, the romantic comedy of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Toηietta</hi> in 1849, <hi rend="italic">A Sacrifice</hi> in 1853, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Youngest</hi> in 1854. His lyrical poems appeared in
                    successive collections, dated 1832,1840, and 1814. From 1858 to 1859 he edited a
                    very interesting literary journal entitled <hi rend="italic">Weekly Leaves.</hi>
                    He died in 1870. Hertz is one of the first of Danish lyrical poets. His poems
                    are full of colour and passion, his versification has more witchcraft in it than
                    any other poet’s of his age, and his style is grace itself. He has all the
                    sensuous fire of Keats without his proclivity to the antique. As a romantic
                    dramatist he is scarcely less original. He has bequeathed to the Danish theatre,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Svend Dyrinfs House</hi> and <hi rend="italic">King Rene's
                        Daughter,</hi> two pieces which have survived the vicissitudes of forty
                    years, and which are as popular as ever. He is a troubadour by instinct; he has
                    little or nothing of Scandinavian local colouring, and succeeds best when he is
                    describing the scenery or the emotions of the glowing south.</p>
