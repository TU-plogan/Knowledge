                    (1821-1872), a German poet and novelist, was born of Jewish parents at Duschnik
                    in Bohemia, October 15, 1821. He studied at Prague and Vienna, and after a tour
                    in Italy, Switzerland, and South Germany became a teacher in Vienna. He left
                    Austria, however, in 1844, in order to publish without danger a volume of
                    patriotic poems entitled <hi rend="italic">Kelch und Schwert,</hi> which
                    appeared at Leipsic in 1845, and in which .he gave expression to somewhat
                    radical sentiments as regards both church and state, in language full of the
                    fire of youthful passion and tinged with considerable poetic fancy. After
                    residing for some years in Belgium and France, he came to Leipsic, where in 1847
                    he published <hi rend="italic">Neuere Gedichte.</hi> On his venturing towards
                    the close of this year to return to Austria he suffered a short imprisonment,
                    from which he was freed by the revolution of the following March. In the same
                    year he was chosen to represent the district of Leitmeritz in the Frankfort
                    parliament, where he took his seat on the extreme left. In October he
                    accompanied Blum and Fröbel to Vienna, but he made his escape before the
                    execution of Blum, and took part in the deliberations of the “Rump Parliament”
                    at Stuttgart. In 1849 he published the <hi rend="italic">Reimchronik</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">des Pfafen Maurizius,</hi> a satirical political poem in the
                    style of the old chronicles. After the dissolution of the “Rump Parliament,” he
                    went to Switzerland, then to England and Ireland, and in 1850 to Paris, where,
                    besides other literary engagements, he held that of correspondent to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Kölnische Zeitung.</hi> On the outbreak of the Russian war he
                    became correspondent of the same paper in the Crimea, where he remained eighteen
                    months. After several years’ residence at Paris he settled in 1860 at Ghent,
                    where he delivered courses of lectures on German literature and history in some
                    of the principal academies. In 1863 he removed to Stuttgart to edit the <hi
                        rend="italic">Freya,</hi> and in 1868 he undertook the editorship at Vienna
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Neue Freie Presse.</hi> He died at Oberdöbling near
                    Vienna, May 13, 1872. Hartmann published several volumes of poems in addition to
                    those already mentioned, and besides his spirited accounts of his travels and
                    adventures he is the author of various novels of more than average merit. A
                    series of tales <hi rend="italic">(Novellen,</hi> 3 vols.) appeared in 1863, and
                    a second series <hi rend="italic">(Nach Natur,</hi> 3 vols.) in 1866. His
                    collected works were published at Stuttgart in 10 vols., 1873-74, and a
                    selection of his poems at the same place in 1874.</p>
