                    the <hi rend="italic">Hyoscyamus niger,</hi> a Solanaceous plant indigenous to
                    Britain, found wild in waste places, on rubbish about villages and old castles,
                    and cultivated for medical use at Mitcham and other places in Surrey, and in
                    Bedfordshire, Cambridgeshire, and Hereford. It occurs also in central and
                    southern Europe and in western Asia, and has long been naturalized in the United
                    States. There are two forms of the plant, an annual and a biennial, which spring
                    indifferently from the same crop of seed,—the one growing on during summer to a
                    height of from 1 to 2 feet, and flowering and perfecting seed; the other
                    producing the first season only a tuft of radical leaves, which disappear in
                    winter, leaving underground a thick fleshy root, from the crown of which arises
                    in spring a branched flowering stem, usually much taller and more vigorous than
                    the flowering stems of the annual plants. The biennial form is that which is
                    considered officinal. The radical leaves of this biennial plant spread out flat
                    on all sides from the crown of the root; they are ovate-oblong, acute, stalked,
                    and more or less incisely-toothed, of a greyish-green colour, and covered with
                    viscid hairs; these leaves perish at the approach of winter. The flowering stem
                    pushes up from the root-crown in spring, ultimately reaching from 3 to 4 feet in
                    height, and as it grows becoming branched, and furnished with alternate sessile
                    leaves, which are stem-clasping, oblong, unequally-lobed, clothed with glandular
                    clammy hairs, and of a dull grey-green, the whole plant having a powerful
                    nauseous <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n684/mode/1up"

                    lower ones growing in the fork of the branches, the upper ones sessile in
                    one-sided leafy spikes which are rolled back at the top before flowering, the
                    leaves becoming smaller upwards and taking the place of bracts. The flowers have
                    an urceolate calyx which persists around the fruit and is strongly veined, with
                    five stiff, broad, almost prickly lobes; these, when the soft matter is removed
                    by maceration, form very elegant specimens when associated with leaves prepared
                    in a similar way. The corollas are obliquely funnel-shaped, of a dirty yellow or
                    buff, marked with a close reticulation of purple veins. The capsule opens
                    transversely by a convex lid, and contains numerous seeds. Both the leaves and
                    the seeds are employed in pharmacy. The Mahometan doctors of India are
                    accustomed to prescribe the seeds. Henbane yields a poisonous alkaloid, <hi
                        rend="italic">hyoscyamine,</hi> which is stated to have properties almost
                    identical with those of atropine, from which it differs in being more soluble in
                    water. It is usually obtained in an amorphous, scarcely ever in a crystalline
                    state. Its properties have been investigated in Germany by Husemann, Schroff,
                    Höhn, &amp;c. Höhn finds its chemical composition expressed by C <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 18</hi> H <hi rend="subscript"> 28</hi> N <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 2</hi> O <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>. (Compare Hellmann,

                        >Wirkung des Hyoscyamins,</hi> &lt;tc., Jena, 1874.) In small and repeated
                    doses henbane has been found to have a tranquillizing effect upon persons
                    affected by severe nervous irritability. In poisonous doses it causes loss of
                    speech, distortion, and paralysis. In the form of extract or tincture it is a
                    valuable remedy in the hands of a medical man, either as an anodyne, a hypnotic,
                    or a sedative. The extract of henbane is rich in nitrate of potassium and other
                    inorganic salts. The smoking of the seeds and capsules of henbane is noted in
                    books as a somewhat dangerous remedy adopted by country people for toothache.
                    Accidental poisoning from henbane occasionally occurs, owing sometimes to the
                    apparent edibility and wholesomeness of the root.</p>
