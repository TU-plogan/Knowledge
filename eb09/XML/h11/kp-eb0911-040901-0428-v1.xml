                <p><label type="entry">HAMELN</label>, the chief town of a circle in the province of
                    Hanover, Prussia, is situated at the confluence of the Weser and Hamel, and at
                    the junction of four railways, 25 milee S.W. of Hanover. It is surrounded by old
                    walls, and possesses a number of old-fashioned houses with quaint richly-adorned
                    gables. The only public buildings of interest are the minster church, restored
                    in 1872, and the townhouse. Hameln is the seat of several courts and public
                    offices, and possesses a gymnasium, a higher city school, a higher female
                    school, a trade school, a poorhouse, two hospitals, and a district prison. The
                    principal industries are the manufacture of woollen and cotton goods and
                    machines, distilling, agriculture, and salmon fishing. By the steamboats on the
                    Weser there is communication with Karlshafen and Minden. In order to avoid the
                    dangerous part of the river near the town a channel was cut in 1734, the
                    repairing and deepening of which, begun in 1868, was completed in 1873. The
                    Weser at Hameln is crossed by an iron suspension bridge 830 feet in length,
                    supported by a pier erected on an island in the middle of the river. The
                    population of Hameln in 1875 was 9519.</p>
                <p>The older name of Hameln was Hameloa or Hamelowe, and the town owes its origin to
                    an abbey of St Boniface. It existed as a town as early as the 11th century, and
                    in 1259 it was sold by the abbot of Fulda to the bishop of Minden, but this
                    transaction gave offence to the townspeople, and after a battle in which many of
                    them lost their lives, they placed themselves under the protection of the house
                    of Brunswick. During the Thirty Years’ War Hameln was conquered by the Swedes
                    (1633). In 1757 it capitulated to the French, who, however, vacated it in the
                    following year. Its fortifications were strengthened in 1766 by the erection of
                    Fort George, but they were wholly dismantled in 1807. Hameln is famed as the
                    scene of the myth of the piper of Hameln. According to the legend, the town in
                    the year 1284 was so infested by rats as almost to compel the inhabitants to
                    leave it, when one day there appeared upon the scene a piper clad in a fantastic
                    suit, who offered for a certain sum of money to charmall the vermin into the
                    Weser by his piping. His conditions were agreed to, but after he had fulfilled
                    his promise the inhabitants, on the ground that he was a sorcerer, declined to
                    fulfil their part of the bargain, whereupon on the 26th of June he reappeared in
                    the streets of the town, and putting his pipe to his lips began a soft and
                    curious strain, which drew all the children to come trooping after him while he
                    led them out of the town to the Koppelberg hill, in whose side a door suddenly
                    opened, by which he entered and the children after him, all but one who was lame
                    and could not follow fast enough to reach the door before it shut again and
                    remained fast. Some trace the origin of the legend to the “Child Crusade,” or to
                    an abduction of children. For a considerable time the town dated its public
                    documents from the event. The story is the subject of a poem by Robert Browning,
                    and also of one by Julius Wolff (3d edition, Berlin, 1876).</p>
