                <p><label type="entry">HILAR</label> ΓON, <hi rend="smallcaps">St,</hi> abbot, the
                    first to introduce the monastic system into Palastine, was born of heathen
                    parents at Tabatha, about 5 miles to the south of Gaza, about the yeιr 288, was
                    sent when very young to Alexandria to be educated, and there became a convert to
                    the Christian religion. Attracted by the fame of St Anthony, he went to visit
                    that saint in his solitude, and forthwith became a disciple. Returning to
                    Palestine with some companions while still but a lad of fifteen, he gave away
                    all the property he had inherited by the recent death of his parents, and then
                    withdrew into loneliness in the desert between the sea and the marshes on the
                    Egyptian border. In this solitude he observed the most rigid asceticism, and (to
                    quote the quaint remark of Butler) “thought himself at liberty to practise
                    certain mortifications which the respect we owe to our neighbour makes
                    unseasonable in the world.” Twenty years of patient continuance in the way of
                    life he had chosen for himself were rewarded, we are told, with miraculous gifts
                    and with rapidly growing fame; disciples and imitators multiplied to the number
                    of two or three thousand, and all owned the spiritual oversight of Hilarion.
                    Informed by revelation when sixty-five years old of the death of Anthony, he
                    undertook an extended tour into Egypt, where he visited all the scenes of that
                    saint’s labours; afterwards he removed in the company of a favourite disciple,
                    Hesychius, into Sicily, where, however, his popularity rendered impossible the
                    quiet and retirement which were congenial to his habits; a further migration to
                    Epidaurus thus became necessary; and ultimately he found a resting-place in
                    Cyprus, the diocese of his old friend Epiphanius, where in a lonely cell amongst
                    some almost inaccessible rocks he died in 371. According to Sozomen his festival
                    was observed in Palestine with great solemnity as early as the 5th century; he
                    is now commemorated by the Roman Church on October 21st. His earliest
                    biographers were Epiphanius and Jerome.</p>
