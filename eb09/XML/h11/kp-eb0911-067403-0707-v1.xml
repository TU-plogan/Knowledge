                    1090, was the son of an ecclesiastic named Nicholas, who probably held the
                    office of archdeacon of Huntingdon, to which Henry himself afterwards attained
                    about 1120. The celibacy of <pb break="no"

                    1102, this paternity was considered no disgrace, and our author in several
                    passages of his writings refers to his father with much filial respect. Received
                    as a mere child into the household of Robert of Bloet, bishop of Lincoln, Henry
                    not only continued to enjoy the advantages of its culture and affluence till the
                    bishop’s death in 1123, but he also secured the patronage and friendship of
                    Alexander of Blois, who next succeeded to the see. There is reason to believe
                    that he accompanied Alexander to Rome, probably in 1125 and 1144, and it was to
                    him that he dedicated his <hi rend="italic">Historice</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Anylorum,</hi> which was issued four times during the author’s life, and in
                    the last form came down to the accession of Henry II. (1154). The date of the
                    author’s death has not been preserved, but it is probable that the close of his
                    life is approximately marked by the close of his history.</p>
                <p>Heury of Huntingdon’s <hi rend="italic">Historioe</hi> was first printed by
                    Savile, <hi rend="italic">Rcrum Aηglicarum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Scriptores</hi><hi rend="italic">post Bcdam</hi> (London, 1586), and it was
                    republished at Frankfort in 1603. Books i., ii., iv., v., and vi. were edited by
                    Mr Petrie for the Record Commission Collection, vol. i., 1848; and the whole
                    work has been prepared for the Rolls Series by T. Arnold, 1880. An English
                    translation by Thomas Forester forms a volume of Bohn’s Standard Library (1853).
                    We have besides from Henry’s pen an Epistle to Henry I. on the succession of the
                    Jewish, Assyrian, Persian, Macedonian, and Roman kings and emperors (written in
                    1130); an Epistle to Warin (one of his friends) containing an epitome of the
                    British History of Geoffrey of Monmouth, which he had discovered at Bee in
                    Normandy; and, better known than either, an Epistle to his friend Walter <hi
                        rend="italic">On Contempt of the World or on Bishops and other Illustrious
                        Men of the Age</hi> (written in 1135, and edited by Wharton in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Anglia Sacra,</hi> 1691). Nor must Henry’s poetical pieces be
                    forgotten, as they speak well for his culture and taste. Two MS. copies of his
                    complete works preserved at Lambeth deserve to be specially mentioned; and the
                    British Museum possesses several important rescripts of the History. See Wright,
                        <hi rend="italic">Biogr. Brit. Litt., Anglo-Norman Period,</hi> 1846;
                    Forester’s Preface; James Gairdner, <hi rend="italic">Early Chroniclers of
                        Europe: England</hi> (1879); and Arnold’s elaborate introductions.</p>
