                    (1802-1869), for more than forty years one of the most conspicuous and able
                    champions of the strictest Lutheran orthodoxy, was born at Fröndenberg, a
                    Westphalian village near Hamm and not far from the Ruhr, on October 20, 1802;
                    received his entire school education under the roof of his father, who was a
                    minister of the Reformed Church, and head of the Fröndenberg Fräuleinstift; and
                    entered the university of Bonn in 1819, shortly before the completion of his
                    seventeenth year. There he attended the lectures of Frey tag and Gieseler on Old
                    Testament exegesis and church history, but his energies were principally devoted
                    to philosophy and philology, and his earliest publication was an edition of the

                    the prize at his graduation in the philosophical faculty, and the public
                    commendation of Sylvestre de Sacy. This was followed in 1824 by a German
                    translation of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">AIetaphysica.</hi> On quitting Bonn
                    it had been Hengstenberg’s wish to complete his theological studies under
                    Neander and Tholuck in Berlin; but finding himself without the means of doing
                    so, he accepted for a year a situation at Basel as tutor in Oriental languages
                    to J. J. Stähelin. Then it was that, suffering much from ill-health and deeply
                    mourning the loss of his mother, he began to direct his attention, with an
                    ardour formerly unknown to him, to the spiritual truths of the Bible. His
                    studies and experiences at this crisis resulted in a conviction, never
                    afterwards shaken, not only of the divine character ot evangelical religion, but
                    also of the unapproachable adequacy of its expression in the Augsburg
                    Confession. Taking as his motto Psalm cxviii. 17, he resolved thenceforward to
                    devote himself to the uncompromising defence of that creed. In the autumn of
                    1824 he joined the philosophical faculty of Berlin as a privat-docent, and in
                    the following year he became a licentiate in theology, his theses even then
                    being remarkable for their evangelical fervour and for their emphatic protest
                    against every form of “rationalism,” especially in questions of Old Testament
                    criticism. In 1826 he became professor extraordinarius in theology; and in July
                    1827 appeared under Hengstenberg’s editorship the first number of the <hi

                    “reactionary’’journal which in his hands was destined to acquire an almost
                    unique reputation as an organ of religious, theological, and ecclesiastical
                    controversy. It did not, however, attain to great notoriety until in 1830 an
                    anonymous article (by E. L. von Gerlach) appeared, which openly charged
                    Professors Gesenius and Wegscheider with infidelity and profanity, and on the
                    ground of these accusations advocated<pb break="no"

                    giving rise to the prolonged “Haifische Streit” as it was called, which was at
                    least effectual in giving the public a due impression of the energy and zeal of
                    the new “evangelical” school. In 1828 the first volume of Hengstenberg’s <hi

                    the autumn of that year he was promoted to the dignity of professor ordinarius
                    in theology; and in 1829 he married. The remainder of his life, apart from the
                    excitement which its various literary activities imparted to it, was uneventful.
                    He died on the 28th of May 1869.</p>
                <p>The following is a list of the principal works of Hengstenberg:— <hi

                    Library,” by Th. Meyer and J. Martin, 1854-58), a work of much ingenuity and
                    considerable learning, but which will be differently va'ued according to the
                    hermeneutical principles of the individual critic; <hi rend="italic">Beiträge

                    each question is strongly upheld, and much capital is made of the absence of
