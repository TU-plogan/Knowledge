                <p><label type="entry">HEBE</label>, in Greek mythology, is a personification of the
                    blooming freshness and youth of nature. Originally she appears almost identical
                    with the pure Greek Aphrodite (as distinguished from the Oriental goddess). Hebe
                    is the daughter of Zeus and Hera, as Aphrodite of Zeus and Dione; but Dione and
                    Hera are only two names for the Bame goddess. Like Aphrodite, Hebe is called the
                    most beautiful of the gods (Pind., <hi rend="italic">N.,</hi> 10, 17). In Sicyon
                    and Phlius Hebe is called Dia, a regular epithet of Aphrodite. In Phlius, where
                    Hebe was worshipped on the citadel in a temple where no image of her was allowed
                    and to which right of asylum was attached, a festival called <hi rend="italic"
                        >κLσσοτοpοL</hi> was celebrated to her every year; and ivy was sacred also
                    to Aphrodite. It is in accordance with the close resemblance between Aphrodite
                    and Core that Hebe also has many points of analogy with the latter, to whom she
                    is compared by Gerhard and Weicker <hi rend="italic">(Gr. Giiti.,</hi> i. 369).
                    According to the custom for the unmarried daughters of a family, Hebe acts in
                    the Homeric poems as a sort of attendant to the gods and especially to her own
                    mother Hera. She offers the cup to the gods, just as on earth the women, and
                    especially the youngest daughter, did to guests and to warriors departing or
                    returning. She bathes Ares (ZZ., V. 905), as Polycaste does Telemachus. She
                    harnesses the horses for Hera (7Γ., v. 722). She appears very often in connexion
                    with the worship of Hera. A statue of her by Naucydes stood beside the Hera of
                    Polyclitus in the Heraeum at Argos. Praxiteles placed statues of her and Athene
                    beside that of Hera in the temple at Mantinea, and Kekulé <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Hebe)</hi> maintains that the artistic conception of Hebe which prevailed
                    in the finest period of Greek art was a slight modification of that of Hera, and
                    he believes that a bust, now in private possession, is the single remaining
                    example of its kind. Weicker’s opinion that the so-called Farnese Flora is
                    really a Hebe has not been generally accepted. In later art she is often
                    represented, like Ganymedes, caressing the eagle; and it is possible that the
                    epithet Ganymeda, by which she was called in Phlius, is not really ancient, but
                    arises from the supposed analogy of her office with that of Ganymedes. The
                    meaning of the w ord Hebe tended to transform the goddess into a mere
                    personification of the eternal youth that belongs to the gods, and this
                    conception is frequently met with. Then she becomes identical with the Roman
                    Juventas, who is simply an abstraction of an attribute of Jupiter Juventus, the
                    god of increase and blessing and youth. By a most transparent allegory it was
                    said that Juventas and Terminus alone of all the gods refused to give way when
                    the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus was being built. Perhaps the most interesting
                    point about Hebe is her connexion with Heracles. When he was received among the
                    gods and reconciled to Hera, Hebe was given him in marriage. This legend appears
                    only in a doubtful line of Homer <hi rend="italic">(Od.,</hi> xi. 603); but
                    Hesiod <hi rend="italic">(Th.,</hi> 950) and Pindar <hi rend="italic">(N.,</hi>
                    10, 17) also know it. They were worshipped together in the Cynosarges at Athens,
                    and represented side by side on the Amyclaean throne. The apotheosis of Heracles
                    and his marriage with Hebe became a favourite subject with poets and painters.
                    Many instances occur on vases, though several of those enumerated by Kekulé are
                    otherwise explained by other writers on art.</p>
