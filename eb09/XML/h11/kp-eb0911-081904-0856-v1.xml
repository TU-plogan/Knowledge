                <p><label type="entry">HILLEL</label>, a famous Jewish rabbi, sometimes called for
                    distinction’s sake 1P,∣Π, “the elder” or “the old,” flourished about the time of
                    Herod the Great. According to the Talmudists he was born of a poor Davidic
                    family, at Babylon, apparently about the year 75 B.c. In his zeal for the study
                    of the law he went, when already of mature age, to Jerusalem, where Shemaiah and
                    Abtalion were at that time the leading teachers. While supporting himself and
                    his family there by working as a day labourer, he was not always able to earn
                    the fee which the porter of the Beth-Midrash or house of instruction is said to
                    have required; but such was his ardour for learning that on one occasion on a
                    cold December morning, having failed to obtain admission, he climbed up to the
                    window of the class-room, where some time afterwards he was found quite buried
                    and half frozen to death under a heavy fall of snow. He was now made free of the
                    schools, and so great were the attainments with which his diligence was
                    ultimately rewarded that, according to the tradition, he understood all
                    languages, including those of the hills and the valleys, the trees and the
                    flowers, the beasts and the demons. In his later years he succeeded the “sons of
                    Bethyras” in the presidency of the sanhedrin, and in this high position he
                    became the author of several important rules of interpretation (the so-called
                    seven “middoth”; see <hi rend="smallcaps">Hermeneutics),</hi> and also of some
                    authoritative legal decisions. A contemporary, and perhaps a pupil of his, was
                    Shammai, who became the head of a rival and at times bitterly hostile school.
                    Dying about the year 10 A.D., Hillel was succeeded in his official position by
                    his son Simeon, and afterwards by his grandson Gamaliel I.</p>
                <p>There is evidently a good deal of what is incredible in the above Talmudic
                    account; for example, it is now recognized on all hands that the Talmudic
                    statement as to Hillel’s presidency over the sanhedrin is absolutely
                    irreconcilable with what we learn from the New Testament writers and from
                    Josephus, and must be regarded as wholly unhistorical. But after every
                    reasonable deduction has been duly made, we still have ample traces of a strong
                    personality, characterized by unusual sweetness and light, bent on supporting

                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0857-0820"/> the claims of a right-minded and ethical
                    religion against those of mere sacerdotal traditionalism. His “middoth,” so far
                    as they go (but they do not go far), are based on sound principles of logic and
                    hermeneutic; the so-called “prosbol,” by which he evaded the restrictions laid
                    upon commerce through the law relating to the sabbatic year, showed that he
                    possessed at least some power of adapting old institutions to the changing
                    circumstances and wants of a progressive society; and if most of the questions
                    which are alleged to have divided his school from that of Shammai cannot but
                    strike the modern reader as having been infinitely small, the “golden rule” and
                    some other sayings attributed to him show that he was not incapable of large and
                    true views on the deepest problems of human life.</p>
                <p>A remote descendant of the same name, who flourished about 350 A. D., is said to
                    have sought to quiet his co-religionists, restive under foreign domination, with
                    the novel doctrine that all the “Messianic” prophecies of the Old Testament had
                    related to Hezekiah, and had been fulfilled in him.</p>
                <p>Our only source of information with regard to Hillel “the old” is the Talmud,
                    unless indeed the Pollion referred to once and again by Josephus be also Hillei
                    under a Greek name. For the grounds on which this probable identification rests,
                    and for a masterly sketch of Hillel and his place in the history of Israel, the
                    great work of Ewald may be consulted <hi rend="italic">(Gesch. d. V.
                        Israel,</hi> vol. v.). See also Delitzsch, <hi rend="italic">Jesus u.

                    this subject, especially with reference to the question regarding the
                    “originality” of the two teachers. Renan, Keim, and Farrar (vol. ii. appendix)
