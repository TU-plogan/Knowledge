                            Aldebert)</hi></label> of Le Mans and afterwards of Tours, a prominent
                    churchleader, and one of the best Latin writers of his. century, was born about
                    1055 at Lavardin near Vendôme, became a pupil of the famous Berengarius of
                    Tours, and made so great progress in all the learning of the time that he was
                    made head master of the school, archdeacon, and finally, in 1097, bishop of Le
                    Mans. In the beginning of his episcopate much trouble was caused him by the
                    jealousy of his dean, Godfrey, who had accused him of immorality; but finally he
                    succeeded in fully vindicating his innocence. He next had to encounter the
                    persecutions of William Rufus, who had captured the city; and these proved so
                    harassing that he ultimately felt it necessary to withdraw to Rome, with the
                    intention of resigning his charge; but Pope Paschalis II. declined to give him
                    his release. On his return to Le Mans, Hildebert found the diocese in a state of
                    great commotion, which had been caused by the preaching of Henry the Deacon; but
                    he speedily succeeded in restoring order after he had banished the agitator.
                    About 1125 he was translated, much against his will, to the see of Tours; and
                    soon afterwards he held the important synod of Nantes, convened for the purpose
                    of correcting the abuses and terminating the disorder which had so long
                    prevailed in Brittany. A dispute with Louis the Fat about the rights of
                    ecclesiastical patronage brought him into much disfavour with that monarch; but
                    their mutual relations had much improved before the death of Hildebert, which
                    took place on December 18, 1134. From some writers he has received the name of
                    Saint, but his name occurs in no martyrology.</p>
                <p>The works of Hildebert, which include letters, sermons, and poems, as well as
                    formal contributions to philosophy and dogmatic theology, have been edited by
                    Beaugendre (Paris, 1708), and in part both by Baluze and Muratori. (See also
                    Galland’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Patrum,</hi> vol. xiv.) The poems, which
                    are on very various subjects, are disfigured by many faults of metre and defects
                    of style, but nevertheless enjoyed great popularity in their time, and were
                    frequently used as classics in the schools of France and Italy, as also were the
                    letters, of which the literary merit is greater (129 in 3 b⅛oks). The sermons
                    are often eloquent and instructive, but generally overloaded with imagery and
                    disfigured by an excessive use of the allegorical method of interpretation. The
                    tendency to Mariolatry is strongly developed in them; and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >De Coena</hi><hi rend="italic">Domini</hi> has an historical interest, as
                    exhibiting the first instance of the use of the word transubstantiation. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Tractatus</hi><hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >querimonia</hi><hi rend="italic">s.</hi><hi rend="italic">conflictu
                        carnis</hi><hi rend="italic">et animoe</hi> is an imitation of Boetius; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Moralis Philosophia</hi> has its sources in earlier Latin
                    authors, and especially in Cicero and Seneca. The <hi rend="italic">Tractatus
                        theologicus</hi> appears to have determined the form of later systems, and
                    thus to be of importance in the history of dogmatic theology. His method is
                    first to lay down the thesis, which is then supported by scripture proofs and by
                    passages from the fathers, especially from Augustine; he finally proceeds by
                    detailed argument to dispose of difficulties and objections with considerable
                    acuteness, and without that excessive subtlety which characterized later
                    scholastic writers.</p>
