                    French advocate and parliamentary orator, was born at Paris, January 4, 1790, in
                    the midst of the agitating events of the first year of the great Revolution.
                    Berryer’s father was an eminent advocate and parliamentary counsellor. The son
                    was educated at the Collège de Juilly, on leaving which he adopted, in deference
                    to his father’s wishes, the profession of the law; but his own leaning at that
                    time was to the church. After completing the usual course of professional
                    studies, he was admitted advocate in 1811, and in the same year he married. In
                    the great conflict of the period between Napoleon I. and the Bourbons, Berryer,
                    like his father, was an ardent Legitimist; and in the spring of 1815, at the
                    opening of the campaign of the Hundred Days, he followed Louis XVIII. to Ghent
                    as a volunteer. After the second Restoration he distinguished himself as a
                    courageous advocate of moderation in the treatment of the military adherents of
                    the emperor. He was engaged, in conjunction with his father and Dupin, in the
                    unsuccessful defence of Marshal Ney before the Chamber of Peers; and he
                    undertook alone the defence of General Cambronne and General Debelle, procuring
                    the acquittal of the former and the pardon of the latter. Proceedings were soon

                    speeches, but he escaped with nothing more severe than a censure by the Council
                    of Advocates. By this time he had a very large business as advocate, and was
                    engaged on behalf of journalists in many press prosecutions. He stood forward
                    with a noble resolution to maintain the freedom of the press, and severely
                    censured the rigorous measures of the police department. In 1830, not long
                    before the fall of Charles X., Berryer was elected a member of the Chamber of
                    Deputies. He appeared there as the champion of the king, and encouraged him in
                    his tyrannical course. After the Revolution of J uly, when the Legitimists
                    withdrew in a body, Berryer alone retained his seat as deputy; and though
                    avowedly the friend of the deposed king, he took an independent course, not
                    making himself an unscrupulous partizan, but guided in his advocacy or his
                    opposition by reason and prudence. He was one of the influential men who
                    resisted, but unsuccessfully, the abolition of the hereditary peerage. He
                    advocated trial by jury in press prosecutions, the extension of municipal
                    franchises, and other liberal measures. In May 1832 he hastened from Paris to
                    see the duchess of Berri on her landing in the south of France for the purpose
                    of organizing an insurrection in favour of her son, the duke of Bordeaux, since
                    known as the count of Chambord. Berryer attempted to turn her from her purpose;
                    and failing in this he set out for Switzerland. He was, however, arrested,
                    imprisoned, and brought to trial as one of the insurgents. He was immediately
                    acquitted. In the following year he pleaded for the liberation of the countess;
                    made a memorable speech in defence of Chateaubriand, who was prosecuted for his
                    violent attacks on the Government of Louis Philippe; and undertook the defence
                    of several Legitimist journalists. In 1834 he defended two deputies in a
                    Government prosecution for libel, and the same year opposed the passing of a new
                    rigorous law against political and other associations. Among the more noteworthy
                    events of his subsequent career were his defence of Louis Napoleon after the
                    ridiculous affair of Boulogne, in 1840, and a visit to England in December 1843,
                    for the purpose of formally acknowledging the pretender, the duke of Bordeaux,
                    then living in London, as Henry V., and lawful king of France. This proceeding
                    brought on him the censure of Μ. Guizot, then first minister of Louis Philippe.
                    Berryer was an active member of the National Assembly convoked after the
                    Revolution of February 1848, again visited the pretender, then at Wiesbaden, and
                    still fought in the old cause. This long parliamentary career was closed by a
                    courageous protest against the <hi rend="italic">coup d'état</hi> of December
                    2,1851. After a lapse of twelve years, however, he appeared once more in his
                    forsaken field as a deputy to the Corps Législatif. Meanwhile he had been a
                    diligent promoter of the much talked of fusion of the two branches of the
                    Bourbon family, and had distinguished himself at the bar by great speeches on
                    the trial of Montalembert in 1858, and in the civil proceedings set on foot by
                    Μ. Patterson against Jerome Bonaparte in 1860. Berryer was elected member of the
                    French Academy in 1854. A visit paid by this famous orator to Lord Brougham in
                    1865 was made the occasion of a banquet given in his honour by the benchers of
                    the Temple and of Lincoln’s Inn. In November 1868 he was removed by his own
                    desire from Paris to his country seat at Augervιlle, and there he died on the
                    29th of the same month.</p>
