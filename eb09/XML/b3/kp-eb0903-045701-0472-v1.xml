                            de</hi></label>, was born, of a noble family, at the chateau Bayard,
                    Dauphiné, in 1476. He served as a page to the duke of Savoy until Charles VIII.,
                    attracted by his graceful bearing, placed him among the royal followers under
                    the count de Ligny. As a youth he was distinguished for comeliness, affability
                    of manner, and skill in the tilt-yard. In 1494 he accompanied Charles VIII. into
                    Italy, and was knighted after the battle of Fornova, where he had captured a
                    standard. Shortly afterwards, entering Milan alone in pursuit of the enemy, he
                    was taken prisoner, but w as set free without a ransom by Ludovic Sforza. His
                    powers and daring were conspicuous in the Italian wars of this period. On one
                    occasion it is said that, single-handed, he made good the defence of a bridge
                    over the Garigliano against about 200 Spaniards, an exploit that brought him
                    such renown that Pope Julius II. sought to entice him into the Papal service,
                    but unsuccessfully. The captaincy of a company in the royal service was’given
                    him in 1508, and the following year he led a storming party at the siege of
                    Brescia. Here his intrepidity in first mounting the rampart cost him a severe
                    wound, which obliged his soldiers to carry him into a neighbouring house, the
                    residence of a nobleman, whose wife and daughters he protected from threatened
                    insult. On his recovery he declined a gift of 2500 ducats, with which they
                    sought to reward him. At this time his general was the celebrated Gaston de
                    Foix, who acted greatly in accordance with his advice, and, indeed, fell at the
                    battle of Ravenna through neglecting it. In 1513, when Henry VIII. of England
                    routed the French at the battle of the Spurs, Bayard, in trying to rally his
                    countrymen, found his escape cut off. Suddenly riding up to an English officer
                    who was resting unarmed, he summoned him to yield, and the knight complying,
                    Bayard in return gave himself up to his prisoner. He was taken into the English
                    camp, but on relating this gallant incident was immediately set free by the king
                    without ransom. On the accession of Francis I. in 1515 he was made
                    lieutenant-general of Dauphiné; and after the victory of Marignano, to which his
                    valour largely contributed, he had the honour of conferring knighthood on his
                    youthful sovereign. When war again broke out between Francis I. and Charles V.,
                    Bayard, with 1000 men, held Mézières, a town which had been declared untenable,
                    against an army of 35,000, and after six weeks compelled Nassau to raise the
                    siege. This stubborn resistance saved Central France from invasion, as the king
                    had not then sufficient forces to withstand the imperialists. All France rang
                    with the achievement. Parliament thanked Bayard as the saviour of his country;
                    the king made him a knight of the order of St Michael, and commander in his own
                    name of 100 gens d’armes, an honour till then reserved for princes of the blood.
                    After allaying a revolt at Genoa, and striving with the greatest assiduity to
                    check a pestilence in Dauphiné, Bayard was sent, in 1523, into Italy with
                    Admiral Bonivet, who, being defeated at Rebec, implored him to assume the
                    command and save the army. He repulsed the foremost pursuers, but in guarding
                    the rear at the passage of the Sesia was mortally wounded. He had himself placed
                    against a tree that he might die facing the <pb break="no"

                    expressed pity for him, he replied, “My lord, I thank you, but pity is not for
                    me, who die a true man, serving my king; pity is for you who bear arms against
                    your prince, your country, and your oath.” He expired after repeating the <hi

                    interred near Grenoble. Chivalry, deprived of fantastic extravagance, is
                    perfectly mirrored in the character of Bayard. He combined the merits of a
                    skilful tactician with the romantic heroism, piety, and magnanimity of the ideal
                    knight-errant. Even adversaries experienced the fascination of his virtues, and
                    joined in the sentiment that he was, as his contemporaries called him, “Le
                    chevalier sans peur et sans reproche.” <hi rend="italic">(Cf.</hi> Walford’s <hi
