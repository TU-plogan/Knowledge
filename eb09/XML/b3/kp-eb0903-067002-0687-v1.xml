                <p><label type="entry">BIKÄNIR</label>, a native state of Râjputânâ, under the
                    political superintendence of the British Government, lies between 27° 30' and
                    29° 55' N. lat., and 72° 30' and 75° 40' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by the
                    Panjâb, on the E. by the British districts of Hariânâ and Shekâwati, on the S.
                    by the native state of Jodhpur or Mârwâr, and on the W. by the native states of
                    Jasalmér and Bhâwalpur. Length of the state from E. to W. 200 miles; breadth,
                    160 miles; area, 17,676 square miles. The natural aspect of the country is one
                    desolate tract, without a single permanently running stream. Its surface is
                    overspread with undulating sand-hills, of from 20 to 100 feet above the average
                    level, and so loose that men and quadrupeds stepping off the beaten track sink
                    as if in snow. Two streams, the Kâturi and Gâgar attempt to flow through this
                    dismal region, but are lost in its sands. Water is very scarce, and is raised
                    from wells of from 250 to 340 feet in depth. A few shallow salt lakes are filled
                    by rain water, but they dry up on the setting in of hot weather, leaving a thick
                    crust of salt on their beds, which is used for commercial and domestic purposes.
                    The population of the state has been estimated at 539,000, consisting chiefly of
                    Jâts, Râjputs (to which race the chief belongs), and other Hindu tribes,
                    inhabiting 1814 villages, which, according to Elphinstone, are composed of “a
                    few round huts of straw, with low walls and conical roofs, like little stacks of
                    corn.” <hi rend="italic">Bajrà</hi> and <hi rend="italic">moth</hi> (two species
                    of millet) and water melons are almost the only agricultural products. The
                    inhabitants are very poor. They live chiefly by pasturage,—rearing camels, and
                    horses of a fine breed, which fetch good prices. From the wool which their sheep
                    yield they manufacture every article of native dress and good blankets. The
                    other industries are leather work, sugar-refining, goldsmith’s work, iron,
                    brass, copper, stone masonry, tanning, weaving, dyeing, and carpentry. In

                    The state is in debt, and is said to be badly managed, the present Mahârâjâ
                    being entirely guided by favourites. The military force of the state amounts to
                    5000 regulars, horse and foot. Bikânir was invaded by the adventurer George
                    Thomas in 1799, who levied from the Râjâ a black mail of £20,000. The Râjâ
                    entered into a treaty of dependence with the British Government in 1818.

                    town of Bikânir is surrounded by a stone wall, 6 feet thick, 15 to 30 feet high,

                    population, 60,000. The citadel is half a mile north-east of the city, and is
