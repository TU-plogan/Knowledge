                <p><label type="entry">BAYLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre</hi></label>, author of
                    the famous <hi rend="italic">Historical and Critical Dictionary,</hi> was born
                    on the 18th November 1647, at Carlat-lc-Comte, near Foix, in the south of
                    France. He was educated at first by his father, a Calvinist minister, and was
                    afterwards sent to an academy at Puy-Laurens, where he studied with such
                    assiduity as seriously to injure his health. After a short residence at home he
                    entered a Jesuit college at Toulouse. While there he devoted much of his time to
                    controversial works on theology, and ended by abjuring Calvinism and embracing
                    the Roman Catholic faith. In this, however, he continued only seventeen months,
                    abruptly resuming his former religion. To avoid the punishment inflicted on such
                    as relapsed from the Catholic Church, he withdrew to Geneva, where he resumed
                    his studies, and for the first time became acquainted with the philosophical
                    writings of Descartes. For some years he acted as tutor in various families; but
                    in 1675, when a vacancy occurred in the chair of philosophy at the Protestant
                    university of Sedan, he was prevailed upon to compete for the post, and was
                    successful. In 1681 the university at Sedan was suppressed, but almost
                    immediately afterwards Bayle was appointed professor of philosophy and history
                    at Rotterdam. Here in 1682 he published his famous letter on comets, and his
                    critique of Maimbourg ’ s work on the history of Calvinism. The great reputation
                    achieved by this critique stirred up the envy of Bayle’s colleague, Jurieu, who
                    had written a book on the same subject, and who afterwards did all in his power
                    to injure his former friend. In 1684 Bayle began the publication of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Nouvelles de la République des Lettres,</hi> a kind of journal
                    of literary criticism, which was continued with great success for several years.
                    In 1690 appeared a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Avis aux Réfugiés,</hi> which
                    Jurieu attributed to Bayle, whom he attacked with the bitterest animosity. After
                    a long quarrel Bayle was deprived of his chair in 1693. He was not much
                    depressed by this misfortune, being at the time closely engaged in the
                    preparation of his great Dictionary, which appeared in 1697. A second edition
                    was called for in 1702. The few remaining years of Bayle’s life were devoted to
                    miscellaneous writings, arising in many instances out of criticisms made upon
                    his Dictionary. He died on the 28th December 1706, after some months’ suffering
                    from chest disease, which he would not permit to interfere with his literary
                    labours. Bayle’s erudition, despite the low estimate placed upon it by Leclerc,
                    seems to have been very considerable. He was an ardent student, and his reading
                    was varied and extensive. As a critic he was second to none in his own time, and
                    even yet one can admire the lightness and delicacy of his touch, and the skill
                    with which he handles his subject. The <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle-de</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">la République des Lettres</hi> was the first thorough-going
                    attempt to popularize literature, and it was eminently successful. The
                    Dictionary, however, is Bayle’s masterpiece, and in it appear to perfection his
                    various qualities, —extensive and curious information, fluency of style, and
                    that light sceptical spirit which has became closely associated with his name.
                    Bayle’s scepticism is of a peculiar kind. It is not a distrust of the power of
                    human knowledge grounded on a scientific investigation of the nature of thought
                    in itself. It is rather the scepticism of the literary man of the world, who in
                    his reading has encountered so many opposing and well-supported arguments on all
                    subjects, that he feels inclined to hold that no certainty can ever be attained.
                    On this account, perhaps, his sceptical criticism, though it did much to
                    liberate thought from the bonds of authority, has had little influence on pure
                    philosophy. Examples of Bayle’s critical mode of investigation may be seen in
                    his articles on the Greek sceptical philosophers, particularly those on
                    Pyrrhonism, Zeno, Carneades, and Chrysippus.</p>
