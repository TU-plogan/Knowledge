                            Cavendish</hi></label>, better known as Lord George Bentinck, the second
                    son of the fourth duke of Portland, by Henrietta, sister to the Viscountess
                    Canning, was born February 27, 1802. He was educated at Eton, and at Christ
                    Church, Oxford; after which he entered the army, and served for several years in
                    the Guards. On retiring from the army, he acted for some time as private
                    secretary to his uncle Mr Canning, then prime minister; in which capacity he
                    gave proofs of high ability for the conduct of public business. In 1828 he
                    succeeded his uncle Lord William Bentinck as member for Lynn-Regis, and
                    continued to represent that constituency during the remaining twenty years of
                    his life. Till within three years of his death Lord George Bentinck was little
                    known out of the sporting world. His early attempts at public speaking afforded
                    no indication of the abilities which the subsequent course of political events
                    served to develop so conspicuously. His failures in the House of Commons seem to
                    have discouraged him from the attempt to acquire reputation as a politician. The
                    natural energy of his character, however, found scope in another arena. As one
                    of the leaders on “the turf,” he was there distinguished by that integrity,
                    judgment, and indomitable determination, which, when brought to bear upon
                    matters of weightier importance, placed him, with a rapidity almost unexampled,
                    in the foremost rank of British senators. On his first entrance into parliament
                    he belonged to what may be called the moderate Whig party, and voted in favour
                    of Catholic emancipation, as also for the Reform Bill, though he opposed some of
                    its principal details. Soon after, however, he joined the ranks of the
                    Opposition, with whom he sided up to the important era of 1846. When, in that
                    year, Sir Robert Peel openly declared in favour of free-trade, the advocates of
                    the corn-laws, then without a leader, after several ineffectual attempts at
                    organization, discovered that Lord George Bentinck was the only man around whom
                    the several sections of the Opposition could· be brought to rally. His sudden
                    elevation to so prominent a position took the public mind by surprise; but he
                    soon gave convincing evidence of powers so formidable, that the position of the
                    Protectionist party at once assumed an imposing aspect. Towards Sir Robert Peel,
                    in particular, his hostility was marked and uncompromising. Believing, as he
                    himself expressed it, that that statesman and his political colleagues had
                    “hounded to the death his illustrious relative” Mr Canning, he combined with his
                    opposition as a political leader a degree of personal animosity that gave
                    additional force to the poignancy of his invectives. On entering on his new
                    position, he at once abandoned his favourite pursuits, disposed of his
                    magnificent stud, forsook all connection with the turf, and devoted his whole
                    time and energies to the laborious and trying duties of a parliamentary leader.
                    Apart from the question of the cornlaws, his politics were strictly independent.
                    In opposition· to the rest of his party, he supported the bill for removing the
                    Jewish disabilities, and was favourable to the scheme for the payment of the
                    Roman Catholic clergy in Ireland by the landowners. As he had held no high
                    office under Government, his qualifications as a statesman never found scope
                    beyond the negative achievements of a leader of Opposition; but it may be safely
                    affirmed that nothing but his untimely death could have debarred him from
                    acquiring a distinguished position among the statesmen of Britain. This event,
                    caused by the rupture of a vessel in the heart, took place suddenly on the 21st
                    September 1848, while his lordship was proceeding on foot to.visit a friend in
                    the country.—(See <hi rend="italic">Lord George Bentinck; a Poli· tical
