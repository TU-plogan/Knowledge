                        “</hi> White-Prince ”), the greatest general of the Byzantine empire, was
                    bom about 505 <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> at Germania, on the borders of
                    Illyria. As a youth he served in the body-guard of Justinian, who appointed him
                    commander of the Eastern army. He won a signal victory over the Persians in 530,
                    and successfully conducted a campaign against them, until forced, by the
                    rashness of his soldiers, to join battle and suffer defeat in the following
                    year. Recalled to Constantinople, he married Antonina, a profligate, daring
                    woman. During-the sedition of the “green” and “blue” parties of the circus he
                    did Justinian good service, effectually crushing the rebels who had proclaimed
                    Hypatius emperor. In 533 the command of the expedition against the Vandal
                    kingdom in Africa, a perilous office, which the rest of the imperial generals
                    shunned, was conferred on Belisarius. With 15,000 mercenaries, whom he had to
                    train into Roman discipline, he took Carthage, defeated Gelimer the Vandal king,
                    and carried him captive, in 534, to grace the first triumph witnessed in
                    Constantinople. In reward for these services Belisarius was invested with the
                    consular dignity, and medals were struck in his honour. At this time the
                    Ostrogothic kingdom, founded in Italy by Theodoric the Great, was shaken by
                    internal dissensions, of which Justinian resolved to avail himself. Accordingly,
                    Belisarius invaded Sicily; and, after storming Naples and defending Rome for a
                    year against almost the entire strength of the Goths in Italy, he concluded the
                    war by the capture of <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0903-0551-0536"/> Ravenna, and with it of the Gothic king
                    Vitiges. So conspicuous were Belisarius’s heroism and military skill that the
                    Ostrogoths offered to acknowledge him Emperor of the West. But his loyalty did
                    not waver; he rejected the proposal and returned to Constantinople in 540. Next
                    year he was sent to check the Persian king Nushirvan; but, thwarted by the
                    turbulence of his troops, he achieved no decisive result. On his return to
                    Constantinople the intrigues of Antonina, whom he had confined on account of her
                    illicit amours, caused him to be stripped of his dignities and condemned to
                    death, and he was only pardoned by humbling himself before his imperious
                    consort. The Goths having meanwhile reconquered Italy, Belisarius was despatched
                    with utterly inadequate forces to oppose them. Nevertheless, during five
                    campaigns his strategic'skill enabled him to hold his enemies at bay, until he
                    was removed from the command, and the conclusion of the war entrusted to his
                    rival Narses. Belisarius remained at Constantinople in tranquil retirement until
                    559, when an incursion of Bulgarian savages spread a panic through the
                    metropolis, and men’s eyes were once more turned towards the neglected veteran,
                    who placed himself at the head of a mixed multitude of peasants and soldiers,
                    and repelled the barbarians with his wonted courage and adroitness. But this,
                    like his former victories, stimulated Justinian’s envy. The saviour of his
                    country was coldly received and left unrewarded by his suspicious sovereign.
                    Shortly afterwards Belisarius was accused of complicity in a conspiracy against
                    the emperor; his fortune was confiscated, and himself flung into prison. His
                    last years are shrouded in uncertainty, as they are not dealt with in the
                    circumstantial history of Procopius; but he seems to have been liberated and
                    reinstalled in the enjoyment of his hard-won honours before his death in 565.
                    The fiction of Belisarius wandering as a blind beggar through the streets of
                    Constantinople, which has been adopted by Marmontel in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bélisaire,</hi> and by various painters and poets, seems to have been
                    invented by Tzetzes, a writer of the 12th century. Gibbon justly calls
                    Belisarius the Africanus of New Rome. But for his successes, which were achieved
                    with most insignificant means, the effete Byzantine empire would have been
                    dismembered among Vandals, Persians, and Goths. He was merciful as a conqueror,
                    stern as a disciplinarian, enterprising and wary as a general; while his
                    courage, loyalty, and forbearance seem to have been almost unsullied. Like
                    Corbulo, the faithful general of Nero, he was suspected and persecuted by an
                    ungrateful master; and, like him, he restored the old discipline to the troops
                    and the ancient lustre to the Roman arms in a corrupt and nerveless age. <hi
