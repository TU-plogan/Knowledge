                <p><label type="entry">BERTHOLLET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Claude Louis</hi></label>,
                    one of the most distinguished chemists of the French school, was born at
                    TaUoire, near Annecy, in Savoy, in 1748. He studied first at Chambery, and
                    subsequently at Turin, where he took his degree as a physician. In 1772 he
                    settled at Paris, and soon became the medical attendant of Philip, duke of
                    Orleans. By the publication of a volume of chemical essays, he gained such
                    reputation that he was admitted in 1781 into the Académie des Sciences. He was
                    appointed Government superintendent of the establishment for the improvement of
                    dyeing; and in 1791 he published his essay <hi rend="italic">Sur la
                        Teinture,</hi> a work that first systematized and chemically explained the
                    principles of the art. It was translated into English by Dr William Hamilton,
                    1794. Berthollet early adopted the chemical views of Lavoisier, and took part
                    with him in the formation of a new system of chemical nomenclature. He confirmed
                    and extended the discoveries of Priestley on ammonia, discovered fulminating
                    silver, and greatly extended our knowledge of the dephlogisticated marine acid
                    of Scheele, for which the name of oxymuriatic acid was then proposed, and which
                    is now termed chlorine. It was he who in 1785 first proposed to apply it to
                    bleaching. He discovered the remarkable salt now called chlorate of potash; and
                    we owe to him also an excellent essay on the chemical constitution of soaps.
                    Berthollet’s contributions to chemistry are scattered through the pages of the

                    the scarcity of saltpetre for the manufacture of gunpowder was much felt; and
                    Berthollet was placed at the head of a commission for improving the processes
                    for obtaining and purifying this important product within the territory of
                    France. Soon afterwards we find him one of a commission for improving the
                    processes in the smelting of iron, and converting it into steel. In 1792 he was
                    appointed a director of the mint, and in 1794 he became a member of the
                    committee on agriculture and the arts; while he filled the office of teacher of
                    chemistry in the Polytechnic and Normal Schools of Paris, and took an active
                    part in the remodelling of the National Institute in 1795. In the following year
                    Berthollet and Monge were appointed heads of a commission to select in Italy the
                    choicest specimens of ancient and modern art, for the national galleries of
                    Paris. In .1798 Berthollet accompanied General Bonaparte to Egypt. On the
                    overthrow of the Directory he was made a senator and a grand officer of the
                    Legion of Honour. Under the empire he was created a count, and he sat as a peer
                    on the restoration of the Bourbons. His last work was his curious essay on <hi
                        rend="italic">Chemical Statics</hi> (1803), in which he controverted the
                    views of Bergman. Berthollet was a man of great modesty and unostentatious
                    manners. For some years he lived retired at Arcueil, especially after the
                    misconduct and suicide of his only son. He died at Paris of a painful malady
                    bravely borne, November 6, 1822.</p>
