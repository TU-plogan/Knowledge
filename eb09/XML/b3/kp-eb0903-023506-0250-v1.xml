                    musical instrument of unknown antiquity, which seems to have been at one time or
                    other in common use among all the nations of Europe, and still retains its place
                    in many Highland districts, such as Calabria, the Tyrol, and the Highlands of
                    Scotland. The wind is generally supplied by a blowpipe, though in some cases
                    bellows are used. These and other slight variations, however, involve no
                    essential difference in character or construction, and a description of the
                    great bagpipe of the Highlands of Scotland will serve to indicate the leading
                    features of the instrument in all its forms. It consists of a large windbag made
                    of greased leather covered with woollen cloth; a mouth-tube, valved, by which
                    the bag is inflated with the player’s breath; three reed drones; and a reed
                    chanter with finger-holes, on which the tunes are played. Of the three drones,
                    one is long and two are short. The longest is tuned to A, an octave below the
                    lowest A of the chanter, and the two shorter drones are tuned each an octave
                    above the A of the longest drone; or, in other words, in unison with the lowest
                    A of the chanter. The scale of the chanter has a compass of nine notes, all
                    natural, extending from G on the second line of the treble stave up to A in alt.
                    In the music performed upon this instrument, the players introduce among the
                    simple notes of the tune a kind of appoggiatura, consisting of a great number of
                    rapid notes of peculiar embellishment, which they term <hi rend="italic"
                        >warblers.</hi> No exact idea of these <hi rend="italic">warblers</hi> can
                    be formed except by hearing a first-rate player upon the Highland bagpipe. The
                    history of the bagpipe can be clearly traced from the earliest periods by means
                    of pictorial representations and references occurring in literature. The
                    instrument probably consisted at first of the pipes without the bag, and in this
                    form it is mentioned in Scripture (1 Sam. x. 5; Isa. v. 12; Jer. xlviii. 36),
                    and was used by the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans. The strain upon the
                    player of these pipes was so great that he had to bandage up his lips and cheeks
                    with a <hi rend="italic">φopβda</hi> or <hi rend="italic">πfpιστ0μιov,</hi> the
                    Roman <hi rend="italic">capistrum,</hi> a leathern muzzle or headstall. It seems
                    very probable that the bagpipe derived its origin from these double and triple
                    reed-pipes, by the after addition to them of a wind-bag made of the skin of a
                    goat or kid, together with a valved <hi rend="italic">porte-vent,</hi> in order
                    to relieve the strain on the lungs and cheeks of the player. There are several
                    evidences that the bagpipe was well known in the time of Nero. It is represented
                    on a coin of that reign, copied in Montfaucon’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Antiquities,</hi> and Suetonius <hi rend="italic">(Ner.,</hi> 54) speaks of
                    a promise made by Nero shortly before his death, that he would appear before the
                    people as a bagpiper <hi rend="italic">(utricularius).</hi> In mediaeval Latin
                    the instrument is designated the <hi rend="italic">Tibia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >utricularia.</hi> Chaucer represents the miller as skilled in playing the
                    bagpipe; and Shakspeare’s familiar allusion to “the drone of a Lincolnshire
                    bagpipe” is sufficient of itself to disprove the common notion that the
                    instrument has always been peculiar to Scotland.</p>
