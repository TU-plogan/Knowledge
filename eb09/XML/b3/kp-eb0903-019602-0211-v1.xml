                    distinguished American physicist, who has gained a wide reputation as
                    superintendent of the great American Coast Survey, was a great-grandson of
                    Benjamin Franklin, and was born at Philadelphia, 19th July 1806. In 1821 he
                    entered the military academy at West Point, and graduated there with the highest
                    honours in 1825. For some time he acted as assistant professor in the academy,
                    holding at the same time a commission as lieutenant of engineers, in which
                    capacity he was engaged for a year or two in the erection of coast
                    fortifications. He occupied the post of professor of mathematics in the
                    university of Pennsylvania from 1827 to 1836, and was then made president of the
                    newly-instituted Girard College. In this capacity he undertook a journey through
                    some of the principal countries of Europe, in order to examine their systems of
                    education, and on his return published a very valuable report. In 1843, on the
                    death of Professor Hassler, he was appointed by Government to the office of
                    superintendent of the coast survey. He succeeded in impressing Congress with a
                    sense of the great value of this work, and by means of the liberal aid it
                    granted, he carried out a singularly comprehensive plan -with great ability and
                    most satisfactory results. By a skilful division of labour, and by the erection
                    of numerous observing stations, the mapping out of the whole coast proceeded
                    simultaneously under the eye of the general director. Nor were the observations
                    confined to mere description of the coast-line; the several stations were well
                    supplied with instruments, and a vast mass of magnetic and meteorological
                    observations was collected, such as must infallibly prove of infinite service in
                    the future progress of physical science. The annual reports issued by the
                    superintendent were admirable specimens of such summaries, and secured for him a
                    high reputation among European savants. Professor Bache contributed numerous
                    papers to scientific journals and transactions, and laboured earnestly to raise
                    the position of physical science in America. For some months before his death,
                    which took place at Newport, 17th February 1867, he was afflicted with softening
                    of the brain, caused, perhaps, by intense and long-continued mental
                    exertion.</p>
