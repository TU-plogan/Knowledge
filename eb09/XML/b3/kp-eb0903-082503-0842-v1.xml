                            of</hi></label>, novelist and miscellaneous writer, was born near
                    Clonmel, Tipperary, Ireland, September 1, 1790. Her childhood was made unhappy
                    by the bad temper, improvidence, and loose living of her father, and by the
                    reduced circumstances of the family. Her early womanhood was made unhappier
                    still by her compulsory marriage at fifteen to one Captain Farmer, whose
                    drunkenness involved him in debt, and whose debts brought him to the King’s
                    Bench prison, where he was killed by a fall in one of his drunken fits, in
                    October 1817. His wife had some time before left his house, and in February 1818
                    she was married a second time to the earl of Blessington. Celebrated for her
                    wit, her literary accomplishments, her generosity, and her social attractions,
                    she was no less distinguished by her passion for pleasure and her craving for
                    show and a high style of living. In the gratification of these tastes debts were
                    accumulated, and the estates of the earl soon became burdened with
                    “incumbrances.” In the autumn of 1822 they set out on a Continental tour, and
                    remained abroad till the death of the earl, which took place at Paris in May
                    1829. Some years earlier they had become acquainted with Count Alfred d’Orsay, a
                    man of fashion and seeker of pleasure, who was then serving in the army, but
                    quitted it for the sake of joining them. In 1827 he had connected himself with
                    the family by his marriage with the only daughter of the earl by a former wife.
                    After Lord Blessington’s death Count d’Orsay, who had separated from his wife,
                    came to England with the countess, and they lived together in London till her
                    death. The home of the beautiful and brilliant countess (first Seamore Place,
                    and afterwards Gore House, Kensington) became a centre of attraction for
                    whatever was distinguished in literature, learning, art, science, and fashion.
                    Ambitious of the distinction of authorship, Lady Blessington had published in
                    1822 her first work entitled <hi rend="italic">Sketches,</hi> in two volumes.
                    Ten years later she made herself favourably known by a <hi rend="italic">Journal
                        of Conversations with Lord Byron,</hi> which appeared first in successive
                    numbers of the <hi rend="italic">New Monthly Magazine,</hi> and soon afterwards
                    as a separate work. This was followed by a long series of works, most of them
                    novels of high life, several of which obtained considerable popularity. Her <hi
                        rend="italic">Idler in Italy</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Idler in</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">France</hi> were rendered temporarily attractive by personal
                    gossip and anecdote, descriptions of nature, and sentiment. Lady Blessington was
                    for some years editor of Heath’s <hi rend="italic">Book of Beauty</hi> and the
                        <hi rend="italic">Keepsake,</hi> the popular annuals of the day, and also
                    contributed largely to magazines and newspapers. Early in 1849, in consequence
                    of failing resources, the splendours of Gore House were extinguished; its
                    furniture and decorations were sold to pay debts, and its presiding genius
                    withdrew to Paris, whither her friend Count d’Orsay had previously gone. She
                    died there, June 4, 1849. Her <hi rend="italic">Literary Life and
                        Correspondence,</hi> 3 vols., edited by R. R. Madden, appeared in 1855.</p>
