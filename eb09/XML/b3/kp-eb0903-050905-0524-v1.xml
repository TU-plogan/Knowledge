                    authoress of some celebrity, was born of a good family in Canterbury in the
                    reign of Charles I., probably in 1642. Her father, whose name was Johnson,
                    having received the appointment of lieutenant-general of Surinam, proceeded to
                    the West Indies, taking with him his whole family. Mr Johnson died on the
                    voyage; but his family reached Surinam, and resided there for some years. Here
                    Aphra learned the history, and acquired a personal knowledge, of the American
                    prince Oroonoco and his beloved Imoinda, whose adventures she has related in her
                    novel <hi rend="italic">Oroonoco.</hi> On her return to London she is said to
                    have married Mr Behn, a merchant of Dutch extraction residing in that city, of
                    whom nothing but the name has ever been known, if anything more even existed.
                    The wit and abilities of Mrs Behn brought her into high estimation at court, and
                    Charles II. employed her to transact some affairs of importance abroad during
                    the Dutch war. For this purpose she went to Antwerp, where she skilfully
                    contrived to penetrate so far into the secrets of state as to accomplish the
                    objects of her mission; and in the latter end of 1666, by means of the influence
                    she had gained over one Van der Albert, she wormed out of him the design formed
                    by De Ruyter, in conjunction with the family of the De Witts, of sailing up the
                    Thames and burning the English ships in their harbours. This she communicated to
                    the English court, but although the event proved her intelligence to have been
                    well founded, it was at the time disregarded,—which circumstance, together with
                    the disinclination shown to reward her for her services, determined her to drop
                    all further thoughts of political affairs. She returned to England, and had a
                    narrowescape on the voyage home, the vessel in which she sailed having
                    foundered. From this period she appears to have supported herself by her
                    writings. Her works are nume rous, and all of them are of a lively and amatory
                    character. Her dramas are sometimes well constructed, but they are among the
                    worst specimens of the later Stuart literature. Of her short tales, or
                    novelettes, the only one possessing any merit is the story of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Oroonoco,</hi> which was made the basis of Southerne’s most popular
                    tragedy. Mrs Behn died on the 16th of April 1689, and was interred in the
                    cloisters of Westminster Abbey. Her works have passed through many editions, the
                    latest being that published by Pearson, 1872.</p>
