                <p><label type="entry">POSEIDON</label>, the ancient Greek god of the sea and of
                    water generally, was fabled to be the son of Cronus and Rhea, and brother of
                    Zeus and Pluto. When the three brothers deposed their father Cronus the kingdom
                    of the sea fell by lot to Poseidon. With his wife, Amphitrite, he dwelt in the
                    depths of the sea; at Aegae he had a golden house beneath the waves. In his hand
                    he bore a trident (a three-pronged fish-spear), wherewith he lashed the sea into
                    fury. But, while he caused storms and shipwrecks, he could also send favouring
                    winds. He was the god of navigation, adored by all who sailed the sea. His
                    temples stood especially on headlands and isthmuses. As god of the sea he
                    disputed with other deities for the possession of the land—with Athene for
                    Athens and Troezen, with Helios for Corinth, with Hera for Argos, with Zeus for
                    Aegina, àc. Earthquakes were thought to be produced by Poseidon shaking the
                    earth,—hence his epithet of “Earth-shaker,” and hence he was worshipped even in
                    inland places, like Apamea in Phrygia, which had suffered from earthquakes.
                    Hence also may have arisen the custom in some places of sacrificing moles to
                    him. The great seawave which often accompanies an earthquake was also his work ·
                    the destruction of Helice in Achaia by such a λvave (373 B.c.) was attributed to
                    his wrath. Once when an earthquake shook the ground where a Spartan army was
                    encamped, the whole army sang a hymn to Poseidon. The island of Delos was
                    thought to have been raised by him from the bottom of the sea, and in 237 B.c.,
                    when a new island appeared between Thera and Therasia, the Rhodians founded a
                    temple of Poseidon on it. Thessaly was said to have been a lake until this god
                    opened a way for the waters through the Vale of Tempe. Poseidon was also the god
                    of springs, which he produced by striking the rock with his trident, as he did
                    on the acropolis of Athens when he was disputing with Athene for the sovereignty
                    of Athens. This dispute was represented on the western pediment of the
                    Parthenon. As he gave, so he could withhold springs of water; thus the waterless
                    neighbourhood of Argos was supposed to suffer from his anger. Black bulls were
                    sacrificed to him; in Ionia and Thessaly bull-fights took place in his honour;
                    at a festival of his at Ephesus the cupbearers were called “bulls,” and the god
                    himself was surnamed “Bull Poseidon.” The herse was <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0580-0559"/> especially associated with his λvorship; he
                    was said to have produced the first horse by striking the ground in Thessaly
                    with his trident. At a fountain in Argolis horses bitted and bridled were
                    sacrificed to him by being drowned in the water, and similarly Sextus Pompeius
                    sought to propitiate him by throwing horses into the sea. He bore the surname of
                    “Horse Neptune,” and was regarded as the tamer as well as the creator of the
                    steed. His worship was thought by Herodotus to have been derived from the
                    Libyans. It had special seats in Thessaly, Boeotia, and the Peloponnesus. He had
                    a famous cave-like temple at Taenarum in Laconia. On the island of Tenos he was
                    worshipped as the physician, and crowds gathered from the neighbouring islands
                    to offer sacrifice. At Mycale in Asia Minor the Panionium, or place of general
                    assembly of the Ionian Greeks, was sacred to him. In the Trojan War Poseidon
                    sided with the Greeks because he had been cheated of his reward by Laomedon, the
                    former king of Troy, for whom he had built the city walls. The offspring of his
                    numerous amours λvere mostly wild and cruel like the sea; such were the
                    Laestrygones, Polyphemus, Cycnus, Antaeus, Busiris, Procrustes, Sciron, and
                    Orion. Alcinous, king of the seafaring Phaeacians in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Odyssey,</hi> traced his lineage to Poseidon. By far the most famous of the
                    festivals of Poseidon was that celebrated every second year on the Isthmus of
                    Corinth and hence called the “Isthmian festival” (see vol. x. p. 65). Pine trees
                    were sacred to Poseidon; a row of them stood close to his temple on the isthmus.
                    Amongst the Ionians the stormy month which precedes the winter solstice was
                    called by the name of Poseidon. He was described as dark-haired, broad-breasted,
                    and blueeyed. In works of art he appeared holding a trident and with a dolphin
                    on his hand or under his feet; sometimes he was represented riding a bull, a
                    horse, or a sea-horse, or in a chariot, often surrounded by the Tritons,
                    Nereids, and other fabulous creatures of the sea. There were colossal statues of
                    him at Helice in Achaia, on the Isthmus of Corinth (set up by the Greeks after
                    the Persian Avars), and at Tenos. The derivation of his name is uncertain; some
                    refer it to the same root as τroτos, ττοτα/χός, &amp;c.; others compare ττότνια.
                    In modern Greece St Nicholas has taken the place of Poseidon as patron of
                    sailors. But the Zachyn thians have a special sea-god, half man, half fish, who
                    dwells under the sea, rides on dolphins or in a car drawn by dolphins, and
                    wields a trident. He seems to combine the attributes of Poseidon and Nereus. For
