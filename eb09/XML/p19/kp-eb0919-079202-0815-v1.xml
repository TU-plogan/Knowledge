                    (1787-1874), poet and miscellaneous writer, was born on the 21st November 1787.
                    At an early age he was sent to a small boarding school near London, and thence
                    in his thirteenth year to Harrow, where he had for contemporaries Lord Byron and
                    Sir Robert Peel. On leaving school he was placed in the office of a solicitor at
                    Caine, Wiltshire, remaining there until about 1807, when he returned to pursue
                    his legal studies in London. By the death of his father in 1816 he became
                    possessed of a small property, and soon after entered into partnership with a
                    solicitor; but in 1820 the partnership was dissolved, and during the temporary
                    difficulties thus occasioned he supported himself in part by literary work under
                    the pseudonym of Barry Cornwall. After his marriage in 1824 to Miss Skepper, a
                    daughter of Mrs Basil Montague, he returned to his professional work as
                    conveyancer, and was called to the bar in 1831. In the following year he was
                    appointed metropolitan commissioner of lunacy—an appointment annually renewed
                    until his election to the permanent commission constituted by the Act of 1842.
                    He resigned office in 1861. Luring the last years of his Ike a failure of speech
                    led him to withdraw increasingly from society, and his death took place on
                    October 4, 1874. The period of his poetic productiveness had closed many years
                    previously, the larger proportion of his verse having been composed between
                    1815, when he began to contribute to the <hi rend="italic">Literary
                        Gazette,</hi> and 1823, or at latest 1832.</p>

                    works.</p>
                <p>A posthumous autobiographical fragment with notes of his literary friends, of
                    whom he had a wide range from Bowles to Browning, was published in 1877. His
                    genius cannot be said to have been entirely mimetic, but his works are full of
                    subdued echoes. His songs have caught some notes from the Elizabethan and
                    Cavalier lyrics, and blended them with others from the leading poets of his own
                    time; and his dramatic fragments show a similar infusion of the early Victorian
                    spirit into pre-Restoration forms and cadences. The results are somewhat
                    heterogeneous, and without the impress of a pervading and dominant personality
                    to give them unity, but they abound in pleasant touches, with here and there the
                    flash of a higher, though casual, inspiration.</p>
                <p>His daughter, <hi rend="smallcaps">Adelaide Anne Procter(1825-1864),</hi> also
                    attained some distinction as a poet, her principal works being her <hi
                        rend="italic">Legends and Lyrics,</hi> of which a first series, published in
                    1858, ran through nine editions in seven years, and a second series issued in
                    1860 met with a similar success. Her unambitious verses dealing with simple
                    emotional themes in a simple manner have a charm which is scarcely explicable on
                    the ground of high literary merit, but which is due rather to the fact that they
                    are the cultured expression of an earnest and beneficent life. Latterly she
                    became a convert to Roman Catholicism, and her philanthropic zeal appears to
                    have hastened her death, which took place February 3, 1864.</p>
