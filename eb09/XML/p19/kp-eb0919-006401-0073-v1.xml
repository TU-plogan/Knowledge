                    the chief town of a province, lies on the Lombard plain, 217 feet above
                    sea-level, not far from the right bank of the Po, just below the confluence of
                    the Trebbia. By rail it is 43 miles south-east of Milan and 3∙5∣ north-west of
                    Parma. Formerly a place of considerable strength, it is still surrounded by
                    walls with bastions and fosse in a circuit of 4 miles. The cathedral •was
                    erected between 1122 and 1233, in the Lombardo-Gothic style, under the direction
                    of Santo da Sambuceto, on the site of a church of the 9th century which had been
                    destroyed by earthquake. The west front has three doors with curious pillared
                    porches. The campanile is a massive square brick tower 223 feet high; the iron
                    cage attached to one of its windows was put up in 1495 by Ludovico il Moro for
                    the confinement of persons guilty of treason or sacrilege. The crypt is a large
                    church supported by one hundred columns. Sant’ Antonino, which was the cathedral
                    church till 877, and occupies the spot where it was reputed that St Barnabas
                    preached to the people, -was built by St Victor, the first bishop of Piacenza,
                    in 324, restored in 903, rebuilt in 1104, and altered in 1857. It was within its
                    walls that the deputies of the Lombard League swore to the conditions of peace
                    ratified in 1183 at Constance. The brick vestibule (Il Paradiso) on the north
                    side is one of the older parts of the building. San Francesco, a spacious
                    edifice begun by the Franciscans in 1278, occupies the site of Ubertino Landi’s
                    palazzo, and is famous as the place where Agostino Landi harangued the people
                    after the murder of Pierluigi, and where in 1848 the deputies of Piacenza
                    proclaimed the annexation of their city to the Sardinian kingdom. San Sisto,
                    which dates from 1499, and takes the place of the church founded in 874 by
                    Angilberga (consort of the emperor Louis II.) for the Benedictines, lost its
                    chief attraction when Raphael’s Sistine Madonna (now in Dresden) was sold by.the
                    monks in 1754 to Frederick Augustus III. San Sepolcro and Sta Maria della
                    Campagna are both after Bramante’s designs; the latter is rich in works of
                    Pordenone. Sant’ Anna, dating from 1334, was the church of the barefooted
                    Carmelites. Of the secular buildings in the city the most interesting is the
                    Palazzo Communale, begun in 1281. In the main front the lower story, constructed
                    of red and white marble, presents a series of five open pointed arcades; the
                    upper story, in brick, has six very rich round-arched windows, each of five
                    lights; and above the cornice rise forked battlements. The square in front is
                    known as the Piazza dei Cavalli, from the two bronze equestrian statues of
                    Ranuccio (1620) and his father Alexander, prince of Parma, governor of the
                    Netherlands (1625). Both were designed by Francesco Mocchi. The Farnese palace
                    was begun after Vignola’s designs by Margaret of Austria in 1558; but it was
                    never completed, and since 1800 it has been used as barracks. Other buildings or
                    institutions of note are the old and the new bishop’s palace, the fine theatre
                    designed by Lotario Tomba in 1803, the great hospital dating from 1471, the
                    library presented to the commune in 1846 by the marquis Ferdinande Landi, and
                    the Passerini library founded in 1685. About a mile to the east of the city is
                    the Collegio Alberoni, instituted in 1751 for the education of priests and
                    missionaries. At a distance of about 2 miles in the opposite direction the
                    Trebbia is crossed by a bridge of twenty-three arches, erected in 1825 at a cost
                    of £47,000; the Austrians blew up two of the arches in 1859. Piacenza is an
                    important point in the Italian railway system—the Lombardy, Piedmont, and
                    Ligurian lines meeting there with those of Central Italy. Silk, cotton, and
                    woollen goods, pottery, and hats are among the local manufactures. The
                    population of the commune (which in this case is almost exactly identical with
                    the city) was 34,985 in 1871 and 34,987 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Piacenza, originally, it is supposed, a Ligurian and afterwards a Gallic town,
                    was made a Roman colony in 219 B.c. While its walls were yet unfinished it had
                    to repulse an attack by the Gauls, whose hopes were excited by the news of
                    Hannibal’s approach, and in the latter part of 218 it afforded protection to the
                    remains of the Roman army under Scipio which had been defeated by the
                    Carthaginian general in the great battle on the Trebbia. In 207 it withstood a
                    protracted siege by Hasdrubal, Hannibal’s brother, and thus contributed largely
                    to the ultimate success of the Romans. Seven years later the Gauls surprised and
                    burned the city; and the colony was so diminished in strength that in 190 it had
                    to be recruited with three thousand families. In 187 it was connected with
                    Rimini and the south by the construction of the Aemilian Way. During the later
                    republic and the empire Placentia is named in connexion with a defeat of the
                    forces of Marius in the neighbourhood (82 B.c.), a mutiny of Julius Caesar’s
                    garrison (49 B.c.), another mutiny under Augustus (41 B.c. ), the defence of the
                    city by Spurinna, Otho’s general, against Caecina, Vitellius’s general (69 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.),</hi> and the defeat of Aurelian by the Marcomanni
                    outside the walls (271 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.).</hi> In 546 Totila reduced
                    Piacenza by famine. Between 997 and 1035 the city was governed by its bishops,
                    who had received the title of count from Otho III. In the latter part of the
                    12th century it was one of the leading members of the Lombard League. For the
                    most part it remained Guelph, though at times, as when it called in Galeazzo
                    Visconti, it was glad to appeal to a powerful Ghibelline for aid against its
                    domestic tyrants. In 1447 the city was captured and sacked by Francesco Sforza.
                    Having placed itself directly under papal protection in 1512, it was in 1545
                    united with <hi rend="smallcaps">Parma</hi><hi rend="italic">{q.v.)</hi> to form
                    an hereditary duchy for Pierluigi Farnese, son of Paul III. In 1746 a battle
                    between the Franco-Spanish forces and the Austrians was fought under the city
                    walls. In 1848 Piacenza was the first of the towns of Lombardy to join Piedmont;
                    but it was re-occupied by the Austrians and had to wait for its emancipation
                    till 1859. Lucius Calpurnius Piso (father-in-law of Julius Caesar), Pope Gregory
                    X., and Alexander Farnese, duke of Parma, were natives of the city. Among the
                    local historians are Boselli, Rossi, Bonara, and Gemmi.</p>
