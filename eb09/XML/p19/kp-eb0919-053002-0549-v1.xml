                            of</hi></label> (d. 1709), was descended from an ancient and noble
                    family of Guelderland, and became page of honour to William, prince of Orange,
                    from which he was advanced to be gentleman of the bedchamber. In this capacity
                    he accompanied the prince to England in 1670, and along with him was created
                    doctor of civil law by the university of Oxford. Afterwards he became a colonel
                    in a Dutch regiment of guards. When the prince of Orange was attacked with
                    smallpox he, in accordance with a suggestion of the physicians, volunteered to
                    lie in bed with him, that the heat of his body might check and expel the
                    disease. This remarkable act of self-sacrifice secured him throughout life the
                    special friendship of the prince, and by his prudence and ability, no less than
                    by his devotedness, he fully justified the confidence that was placed in him. In
                    1677 he was sent by the prince to England to solicit the hand of the princess
                    Mary, eldest daughter of James, then duke of York. At the Revolution he was the
                    chief medium of communication between the prince and the English nobility, and
                    in the delicate negotiations his practical shrewdness greatly facilitated the
                    arrival at a proper understanding. After superintending the arrangements in
                    connexion with the prince’s expedition, he accompanied him to England, and was
                    made groom of the stole, privy purse, first gentleman of the royal bedchamber,
                    and first commissioner on the list of privy councillors. On 9th April 1689 he
                    was created Baron Cirencester, Viscount Woodstock, and earl of Portland. With
                    the rank of lieutenant-general he distinguished himself in command of the Dutch
                    cavalry at the battle of the Boyne in 1690, and he was also present at the
                    battle of Landen in 1693, and at the siege of Namur in 1695. Along with marshal
                    de Bouflers he prepared the terms of the peace of Ryswick in 1697, and shortly
                    afterwards was appointed ambassador-extraordinary to Paris. Notwithstanding his
                    diplomatic skill, his grave and cold manner rendered him unpopular with the
                    English nobility, and his brusque honesty caused him to be sometimes wanting in
                    outward respect to the king. Gradually his influence at the court was supplanted
                    by that of the earl of Albemarle, who was more skilled in the arts of
                    popularity; and in 1700, notwithstanding the efforts of the king to soothe his
                    wounded vanity, he resigned his offices and retired to his seat at Bulstrode,
                    Bucks, where he occupied his leisure in gardening and in works of charity. For
                    receiving grants of land in Ireland, and for his share in the partition treaty,
                    he was impeached by parliament, but the prosecution did not succeed. He died 23d
                    November 1709, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>
