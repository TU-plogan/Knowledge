                        Reuss</hi> (1814-1870), Spanish soldier and statesman, was the son of
                    Lieutenant-Colonel Pablo Prim, and was bom at Reuss in Catalonia on 12th
                    December 1814. He entered the free corps known as the volunteers of Isabella II.
                    in 1834 and greatly distinguished himself throughout the Carlist War, in the
                    course of which he rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel and had two orders of
                    knighthood conferred upon him. After the pacification of 1839 he entered
                    political life, and as a progressist opposed to the dictatorship of Espartero he
                    was sent into exile. However, in 1843 he was elected deputy for Tarragona and
                    issued a pronunciamento against Espartero at Reuss; and after defeating
                    Espartero at Bruch he entered Madrid in triumph with Serrano. The regent Maria
                    Christina recognized his services, promoted him to the rank of majorgeneral, and
                    made him count of Reuss. Prim now looked forward to peace under a settled
                    constitutional monarchy, but Narvaez, the prime minister, failed to understand
                    what constitutional freedom meant, and Prim, on showing signs of opposition, was
                    sentenced to six years’ imprisonment in the Philippine Islands. The sentence was
                    not carried out, and Prim remained an exile in England and France until the
                    amnesty of 1847. He then returned to Spain, but kept aloof from politics, and
                    was first employed as captaingeneral of Porto Rico and afterwards as military
                    representative of Spain with the sultan during the Crimean War. In 1854 he
                    returned to Spain on being elected to the cortes, and gave his support to
                    O'Donnell, who promoted him to be lieutenant-general in 1856. In the war with
                    Morocco, at the head of his division, he did such good service at Los
                    Castillejos or Marabout, Cabo Negro, Guad al Gelu, and Campamento in 1860 that
                    he was made marquis de los Castillejos and a grandee of Spain. He next commanded
                    the Spanish expeditionary army in Mexico, when he acted in exact accordance with
                    the treaty of London and refused to consent to the ambitious schemes of Napoleon
                    III. On his return to Spain he joined the opposition, heading pronunciamentos in
                    Catalonia against Narvaez and O’Donnell. All his attempts failed until the death
                    of Narvaez in April 1868, after which Queen Isabella fell more and more under
                    the influence of the J esuits, and became increasingly tyrannical, until at last
                    even Serrano was exiled, and more than 10,000 persons, includ- <pb break="no"

                    Prim returned, and Admiral Topete, commanding the fleet, raised the standard of
                    revolt at Cadiz. For the public events of the subsequent ten months the reader
                    is referred to the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Spain.</hi> In July 1869 Serrano
                    was elected regent, and Prim became president of the council and was made a
                    marshal. On 16th November 1870 Amadeo, duke of Aosta, was elected king of Spain,
                    but Prim was not destined to receive the new monarch, for on leaving the chamber
                    of the cortes on 28th December he was shot by unknown assassins and died two
                    days later. The cortes at once declared that he had deserved well of his native
                    land, and took his children as wards of the country; three days afterwards King
                    Amadeo I. swore in the presence of the corpse to observe the new Spanish
                    constitution.</p>
