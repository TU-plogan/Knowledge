                <p><label type="entry">POSEN</label>, a province in the east of Prussia, with an
                    area (11,180 square miles) nearly equal to that of Belgium, is bounded on the N.
                    by the province of Prussia, on the E. by Russian Poland, on the S. by Silesia,
                    and on the W. by Brandenburg. It belongs physically to the great north German
                    plain, and consists of a low plateau intersected by the beds of the Netze, the
                    Warthe, and the Obra. The three rivers just named drain into the Oder, but part
                    of the province falls within the basin of the Vistula, which forms the frontier
                    for a short distance on the north-east. The surface of the whole district is
                    dotted with small lakes and ponds, and there are many broad fens and marshes.
                    The soil on the whole is light and sandy, but much of the land reclaimed in the
                    boggy districts is very fertile. Upwards of 61 per cent, of the area is under
                    cultivation, while 13 per cent, is occupied by pasture and meadows and 20 per
                    cent, by forests. The principal crops are wheat, rye, oats, barley, potatoes,
                    and hops (compare <hi rend="smallcaps">Prussia);</hi> the vine is cultivated to
                    some extent in the south-west corner, and tobacco is also grown. The marshy
                    tracts often afford excellent pasture and support large numbers of cattle,
                    sheep, and goats. The mineral resources of the province are practically
                    restricted to brown coal and salt, about 26,000 tons of the formerand 75,000
                    tons of the latter being raised in 1882. The industry is confined to a few
                    points, and is of comparatively little importance. Besides beer and brandy, the
                    chief products are machinery, cloth, tobacco, and bricks. Trade, carried on
                    briskly in timber and agricultural produce, is facilitated by the network of
                    navigable rivers and canals. Both industry and trade are somewhat cramped by the
                    duties imposed at the Russian frontier. The population of the province in 1880
                    was 1,703,397, including 1,112,962 Roman Catholics, 532,498 Protestants, and
                    56,609 Jews. The Roman Catholics are mainly Poles, of whom there are about
                    950,000 in Posen, while the great bulk of the 750,000 Germans are Protestants.
                    About 65 per cent, of the population is returned as “rural” in spite of the
                    large number of so-called “towns,” only seven of which, however, have more than
                    10,000 inhabitants. The largest are Posen and Bromberg. The province of Posen
                    enjoys the unenviable distinction of being the worst educated corner of the
                    German dominions, a fact illustrated by the high ratio of illiterate recruits (9
                        <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 75 per cent, in 1882-83). It is represented
                    in the German reichstag by fifteen and in the Prussian parliament by twenty-nine
                    deputies.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> The history of the district of Posen,
                    comprehending great part of the cradle of the old kingdom of Poland, including
                    its most ancient capital (Gnesen), falls properly within the scope of the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Poland</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(?.».).</hi> Its
                    political connexion with Prussia began in 1772, when the districts to the north
                    of the Netze fell to the share of that power in the first partition of Poland.
                    The rest followed in 1793, and was united with the Netze district to form the
                    province of South Prussia. After the peace of Tilsit Posen was incorporated with
                    the grand-duchy of Warsaw, but in 1815 it reverted to Prussia under the style of
                    the “grand-duchy of Posen.” In 1848 the Polish inhabitants of the province
                    revolted and had to be put down by force; and a thoroughly harmonious union of
                    the two elements of the population is still unattained.</p>
                <p>The tide of German immigration into Posen began at an early period and flowed
                    very strongly in the 13th and following centuries. The industrious German
                    settlers were heartily welcomed by the Polish nobles and were the founders of
                    most of the towns, in which they lived after their own customs and were governed
                    by their own laws. They established the few manufactures of which the district
                    can boast, introduced the cultivation of hops, reclaimed the waste soil, and did
                    much to improve agriculture generally. In the 16th century Protestantism was
                    widely diffused by their means. À strong reaction, however, set in in the
                    following century, and persecution of the Protestants went hand in hand with the
                    ravages of war in hastening the political, intellectual, and agricultural
                    decline of the territory. By the 18th century the burghers had sunk to the level
                    of “städtische Bauern,” or peasants with municipal privileges, and poverty and
                    misery were widely spread. The Prussian rule, in spite of many defects, proved
                    so beneficial that even Napoleon was compelled to praise it.</p>
                <p>Posen contains a numerous Polish noblesse, many of the members of which are very
                    poor. A double transformation is going on in the ownership of the ground, the
                    large estates passing into the hands of the peasants and Polish proprietors
                    giving place to German. A few years ago between 60 and 70 per cent, of the soil
                    was occupied by “latifundia,” while at present it is pretty equally divided
                    between those and peasant holdings. In the four years 1878-81, inclusive, the
                    land in the possession of Germans increased at the expense of Polish landowners
                    by upwards of 100,000 acres. The peasantfarmers are generally deeply in debt,
                    partly owing to the educational and communal burdens, but mainly owing to the
                    pernicious custom of “Leibgedinge,” according to which an able-bodied man in the
                    prime of life will give up his holding in return for an annuity from his
                    successor. In some instances two annuitants of this kind are found living on the
                    same small patch of ground iu addition to the actual cultivator.</p>
