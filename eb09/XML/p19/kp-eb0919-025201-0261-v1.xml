                            drunkard. That this word would in the ordinary way become the English
                            Pochard or Poker may be regarded as certain; but then it is not known to
                            be used in French as a bird's name.</p></note> names properly belonging
                    to the male of a species of Duck (the female of which is known as the Dunbird),
                    the <hi rend="italic">Anas</hi><hi rend="italic">ferina</hi> of Linnaeus, and
                        <hi rend="italic">Fuligula</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Aethyia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ferina</hi> of later ornithologists—but names very often
                    applied by writers in a general way to most of the group or Subfamily <hi
                        rend="italic">Fuligulinae,</hi> commonly called Diving or Sea-Ducks <hi
                        rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Duck,</hi> vii. p. 505). The
                    Pochard in full plumage is a very handsome bird, with a coppery-red head, on the
                    sides of which sparkle the ruby irides of his eyes, relieved by the greyish-blue
                    of the basal half of his broad bill, and the deep black of his gorget, while his
                    back and flanks appear of a light grey, being really of a dull white closely
                    barred by fine undulating black lines. The tail-coverts both above and below are
                    black, the quill feathers brownish-black, and the lower surface of a dull white.
                    The Dunbird has the head and neck reddish-brown, with ill-defined whitish
                    patches on the cheeks and chin, the back and upper tail-coverts dull brown, and
                    the rest of the plumage, except the lower tail-coverts, which are brownish-grey,
                    much as in the Pochard. This species is very abundant in many parts of Europe,
                    northern Asia, and North America, generally frequenting in winter the larger
                    open waters, and extending its migrations to Barbary and Egypt, but in summer
                    retiring northward and inland to breed, and is one that certainly seems to have
                    profited by the legislative protection lately afforded to it in Britain, for,
                    whereas during many years it had but a single habitual breeding-place left in
                    England, it is now known to have several, to some of which it resorts in no
                    inconsiderable numbers. American examples seem to be slightly larger and
                    somewhat darker in colour, and hence by some writers have been regarded as
                    specifically distinct under the name of <hi rend="italic">Fuligula
                        americana;</hi> but America has a perfectly distinct though allied species
                    in the celebrated Canvas-back Duck, <hi rend="italic">F. vallisneriana,</hi> a
                    much larger bird, with a longer, higher, and narrower bill, which has no blue at
                    the base, and, though the plumage of both, especially in the females, is very
                    similar, the male Canvas-back has a darker head, and the black lines on the back
                    and flanks are much broken up and further asunder, so that the effect is to give
                    these parts a much lighter colour, and from this has arisen the bird’s common
                    though fanciful name. Its scientific epithet is derived from the freshwater
                    plant, a species of <hi rend="italic">Vallisneria,</hi> usually known as “wild
                    celery,” from feeding on which its flesh is believed to acquire the delicate
                    flavour that is held in so great a repute. The Pochard and Dunbird, however, in
                    Europe are in much request for the table (as the German name of the species, <hi
                        rend="italic">Tafelente,</hi> testifies), though their quality in this
                    respect depends almost wholly on the food they have been eating, for birds
                    killed on the sea-coast are so rank as to be almost worthless, while those that
                    have been frequenting fresh water are generally well-tasted.<note

                <p>Among other species nearly allied to the Pochard that frequent the northern

                    its red bill and legs, well known in India. In the southern hemisphere the genus
                    is represented by three species, <hi rend="italic">F. capensis, F.

                <p>Generally classed with the <hi rend="italic">Fuligidinae</hi> is the small group
                    known as the Eiders,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Icelandic, <hi rend="italic">Aedur.</hi></p></note> which differ
                    from them in several respects: the bulb at the base of the trachea in the male,
                    so largely developed in the members of the genus <hi rend="italic"

                    smaller and wholly of bone; the males take a much longer time, two or even three
                    years, to attain their full plumage, and some of the feathers on the head, when
                    that plumage is completed, are always stiff, glistening, and of a peculiar
                    pale-green colour. This little group of hardly more than half a dozen species
                    may be fairly considered to form a separate genus under the name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Somateria.</hi> Many authors indeed have—unjustifiably, as it
                    seems to the present writer—broken it up into three or four genera. The

                    the largest of this group, and, beautiful as it is, is excelled in beauty by the
