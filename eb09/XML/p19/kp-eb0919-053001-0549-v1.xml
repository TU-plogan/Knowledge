                <p><label type="entry">PORTLAND, <hi rend="smallcaps">Isle of</hi></label>, a small
                    island or peninsula of England, in the English Channel, 4j miles south of
                    Weymouth, Dorsetshire, connected with the mainland by a long narrow ridge of
                    shingle called the Chesil Bank. There is communication with Weymouth both by
                    rail and steamer. The island is 4 j miles long by 1∣ broad, the area being 2890
                    acres. The coast-line is wild and precipitous, and Portland is inaccessible from
                    the sea on all sides except the south. The highest elevation is 490 feet.
                    Numerous caverns have been excavated by the action of the waves, and off
                    Portland Bill, the southern extremity of the island, is a bank called the
                    Shambles, between which and the land there flows a dangerous current called the
                    Race of Portland. The substratum of the island is Kimmeridge clay, above which
                    rest beds of sands and strata of Oolitic limestone, widely famed as a building
                    stone. The extensive quarries have supplied the materials for St Paul’s
                    Cathedral and many other important public buildings in London and elsewhere,
                    about 70,000 tons of stone being now exported annually. In the “dirt-bed”
                    resting upon the Oolitic strata numerous specimens of petrified wood are found,
                    some of them of great size. The soil, though shallow, is fertile, and mutton fed
                    on the grass has a peculiarly rich flavour. Agriculture, fishing, and especially
                    quarrying give employment to the inhabitants, who are tall and handsome, and
                    retain some singular customs, among which may be mentioned that of conveying
                    land by “church gift” (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Real Estate).</hi> By the
                    construction of a breakwater <hi rend="italic">2</hi> 1 miles in length, the
                    building of which occupied twenty-three years, from 1849 to 1872, a harbour of
                    refuge 2100 acres in extent has been formed, affording a safe and convenient
                    anchorage for a very large fleet of vessels. It is defended by two forts of
                    great strength, mounted with heavy ordnance. A convict prison, erected on
                    Portland in 1848, has cells for 1500 prisoners.</p>
                <p>Portland Castle, built by Henry VIII. in 1520, is generally occupied by the
                    commander of the engineers or of the regiment stationed on the island. On the
                    east side of the island are the remains of a more ancient fortress, ascribed to
                    William Rufus. The Isle of Portland is not mentioned in the time of the Romans.
                    In 837 it was the scene of an action against the Danes, and in 1052 it was
                    plundered by Earl Godwine. In 1643 the Parliamentary party made themselves
                    masters of the island and castle, but shortly afterwards these were regained by
                    the Royalists through a clever stratagem, and not recovered again by the forces
                    of the Parliament till 1646. The island is under the government of a local board
                    of health. The population in 1871 was 9907, and in 1881 it was 10,061, including
                    550 on board vessels, 861 in Verne Citadel barracks, and 1620 in the convict
                    prison.</p>
