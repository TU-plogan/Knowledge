                    “Water-Thrushes” and “Ant-Thrushes,” though there was no evidence of their
                    having aquatic habits or predilections, or of their preying especially upon
                    ants; but the fact that they formed a separate Family was gradually admitted.
                    Their position was at last determined by Garrod, who, having obtained examples
                    for dissection, in a communication to the Zoological Society of London, printed
                    in its <hi rend="italic">Proceedings</hi> for 1876, proved (pp. 512, 513) that
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pittidae</hi> belonged to that section of Passerine Birds
                    which he named <hi rend="italic">Mesomyodi</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(Ornithology,</hi> vol. xviii. p. 41), since their syrinx, like that of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Tyrannidae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(King-bird,</hi> vol.
                    xiv. p. 80), has its muscles attached to the middle of its half-rings, instead
                    of to their extremities as in the higher Passerines or <hi rend="italic"
                        >Acromyodi.</hi> This in itself was an unexpected determination, for such a
                    structure had been thought to be confined to Birds of the New World, to which
                    none of the Pittas belong. But it is borne out by, and may even serve to
                    explain, the sporadic distribution of the latter, which seems to point them out
                    as survivors of a somewhat ancient and lower type of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Passeres.</hi> Indeed except on some theory of this kind the distribution
                    of the Pittas is almost unaccountable. They form a very homogeneous</p>
                <p>Family, not to say genus, which it is not easy to split up justifiably, for all
                    its members bear an unmistakable and close resemblance to each other—though the
                    species inhabit countries so far apart as Angola and China, India and Australia;
                    and, to judge from the little that has been recorded, they are all of
                    terrestrial habit, while their power of flight, owing to their short wings, is
                    feeble. Nearly fifty species have now been described, most of them found in the
                    Malay Archipelago, between the eastern and western divisions of which they are
                    pretty equally divided; and, in Mr Wallace’s opinion,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Owing to recent discoveries in Papuasia
                            it is possible that this opinion may require some
                        modification.</p></note> they attain their maximum of beauty and variety in
                    Borneo and Sumatra, from the latter of which islands comes the species, <hi
                        rend="italic">Pitta</hi><hi rend="italic">elegans,</hi> represented in the
                    accompanying woodcut. Few Birds can vie with the Pittas in brightly-contrasted
                    coloration. Deep velvety black, pure white, and intensely vivid scarlet,
                    turquoise-blue and beryl-green—mostly occupying a considerable extent of
                    surface—are found in a great many of the species,—to say nothing of other
                    composite or intermediate hues; and, though in some a modification of these
                    tints is observable, there is scarcely a trace of any blending of shade, each
                    patch of colour standing out distinctly.</p>
                <p>This is perhaps the more remarkable as the feathers have hardly any lustre to
                    heighten the effect produced, and in some species the brightest colours are
                    exhibited by the plumage of the lower parts of the body. Pittas vary in size
                    from that of a Jay to that of a Lark, and generally have a strong bill, a
                    thickset form, which is mounted on rather high legs with scutellated “tarsi,”
                    and a very short tail. In many of the forms there is little or no external
                    difference between the sexes. All the species then known were figured in Mr
                    Elliot’s <hi rend="italic">Monograph of the</hi><hi rend="italic">Pittidae,</hi>
                    completed in 1863; but so many have since been described that this work but
                    imperfectly represents the existing knowledge of the Family, and even Schlegel’s
                    revised catalogue of the specimens contained in the Leyden Museum <hi
                        rend="italic">(Mus. des Pays-Bas,</hi> livr. 11), published in 1874, is now
                    out of date, so that a new synopsis is very desirable. Many of the
                    lately-discovered species have been figured in Gould’s <hi rend="italic">Birds
                        of Asia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Birds of New Guinea.</hi></p>
                <p>Placed by some authorities among the <hi rend="italic">Pittidae</hi> is the genus
                        <hi rend="italic">Philepitta,</hi> consisting of two species peculiar to
                    Madagascar, while other systematists would consider it to form a distinct
                    Family. This last is the conclusion arrived at by W. A. Forbes <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1880, pp. 387- 391) from its syringeal
                    characters, which, though shewing it to be allied to the Pittas, are yet
                    sufficiently different to justify its separation as the type of a Family <hi
                        rend="italic">Philepittidae.</hi> The two species which compose it have
                    little outward resemblance to the Pittas, not having the same style of
                    coloration and being apparently of more arboreal habits. The sexes differ
                    greatly in plumage, and the males have the skin round the eyes bare of feathers
                    and carunculated.</p>
                <p>It may be advisable to remark that nomenclatorial purists, objecting to the names
                        <hi rend="italic">Pitta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Philepitta</hi> as
                    “barbarous,” call the former <hi rend="italic">Coloburis</hi> and the latter <hi
                        rend="italic">Paictes. Brachyurus</hi> also has frequently been used for <hi
                        rend="italic">Pitta;</hi> but, having been previously applied in another
                    sense, it is inadmissible. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
