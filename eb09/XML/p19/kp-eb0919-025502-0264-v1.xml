                    (1809-1849), is the most interesting figure in American literature, and his life
                    furnishes the most extraordinary instance on record of systematic
                    misrepresentation on the part of a biographer. The greater part of his short
                    working life was passed in intense and unremitting literary toil, and no poems
                    or romances were ever produced at greater expense of brain and spirit than his.
                    Yet, till lately, when Mr J. H. Ingram, the careful editor of Poe’s works,
                    undertook to collect the plain facts of the poet’s life, the current statement
                    and belief were that his strange tales and poems were flung off from a
                    distempered imagination in the intervals of degraded debauchery. This myth was
                    studiously floated by his first biographer, Griswold, and found readier
                    acceptance with the public owing to the weird and horrible character of much of
                    his imaginative work. Griswold’s story of a life wayward and irregular from
                    hapless beginning to disgraceful close was just what people were prepared to
                    believe about a genius so eccentric and with such a turn for dark mysteries,
                    horrible crimes, inhuman doings and sufferings. That the author of such works
                    should have been expelled from the university and from the army, and from
                    situation after situation when he tried to make a living by literature, all
                    owing to the gross irregularity of his habits, and should finally have died in a
                    hospital in a fit of intoxication, seemed credible enough when affirmed by a
                    selfconstituted biographer. Many of Griswold’s allegations were denied at the
                    time, but the denials were local and isolated, and the truth had no chance
                    against the systematic libel, repeated as it was in many editions, till Mr
                    Ingram prepared a regular and authoritative memoir.<note anchored="true"

                <p>There was a sufficient mixture of truth with falsehood to make Griswold’s story
                    plausible. It was not quite correct to describe Poe as the son of strolling
                    players, but his father, a man of good family, had married an actress and taken
                    to the stage as a profession. Their son was born in Baltimore, February 19,
                    1809; and father and mother died in 1811 when he was a child. The orphan was
                    adopted by his godfather, Mr Allan, a wealthy merchant, and from his eighth till
                    his thirteenth year (1816— 1821) was placed at school in England. Thence he was
                    transferred to an academy at Richmond, Virginia, and thence at the age of
                    seventeen to the university of Virginia at Charlottesville. Mr Allan was
                    childless, and apparently treated his adopted son as his own child. Why Poe left
                    the university after one session is not clearly explained, but it has bcm
                    ascertained that he was not expelled, but on the contrary was honourably
                    distinguished as a student, although it is admitted that he had contracted debts
                    and had “an ungovernable passion for card-playing.” These debts may have been
                    sufficient cause for a quarrel with Mr Allan. Poe disappeared for two years,
                    setting out for Europe to join the Greeks in their fight for independence.
                    Reappearing at Richmond in 1829, he stayed at home for a year, and then was
                    entered as a military cadet at West Point. But all his ambitions by this time
                    were towards literature; he neglected his duties, disobeyed orders, and was
                    dismissed from the service of the United States. What he did for two years after
                    is not ascertained, but in 1833 he reappeared as the successful competitor for a
                    prize offered by a Baltimore newspaper for a prose story. From that time he
                    subsisted by literature. Mr Allan had married again, and died soon afterwards,
                    leaving an heir by his second wife, and “not a mill,” as Griswold puts it, to
                    Poe.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly in his account of Poe’s literary career that Griswold has been
                    guilty of slandering the subject of his biography, representing him as rendered
                    incapable of permanent employment by his intemperate habits. There would seem to
                    be not the slightest foundation for this coarse slander. During the fifteen
                    years of his literary life Poe was connected with various newspapers and
                    magazines in Richmond, New York, and Philadelphia, and there is unanimous
                    testimony that, so far from being an irregular contributor, he was a model of
                    punctuality and thoroughness, and took a pride in these homely virtues. His
                    connexion was not in any one case “severed by his irregularities.” He wrote
                    first for the <hi rend="italic">Southern Literary Messenger</hi> in Richmond,
                    and edited it for some time; then, in 1837, he removed to New York, and wrote
                    criticisms and did editorial work for the <hi rend="italic">New York Quarterly
                        Review;</hi><pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n265/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0265-0256"/> then, after a year, with a prospect of more
                    lucrative employment, he removed to Philadelphia, and for four years was the
                    mainstay of <hi rend="italic">Graham's Magazine.</hi> His literary work was
                    poorly paid for, though some of his most powerful tales— <hi rend="italic">Hans
                        Pfaal, Arthur Gordon Pym, Ligeia, The House of Usher, The Murders in the Rue
                        Morgue, Marie</hi><hi rend="italic">Roget,</hi><hi rend="italic">The Descent
                        into the Maelstrom—</hi> were among Poe’s contributions to these
                    periodicals. Not unnaturally he conceived the idea of starting a magazine of his
                    own as the most hopeful way of living by his work, but he had no capital, and
                    was obliged to abandon the project, and return to New York and miscellaneous
                    journalism. To add to his troubles his wife, a cousin of his own, whom he had
                    married in 1836, and to whom he was passionately attached, was in very delicate
                    health, and during a lingering illness of eight years gave him constant anxiety.
                    We have only to look at the character of Poe’s work, and the condition of such
                    literature commercially, to see why it was that the most popular writer of his
                    generation in America had to struggle so hard for a bare subsistence. His short
                    stories were an easy prey for the newspaper pirate, and when thousands were
                    reading them the author received nothing but the few dollars paid him by the
                    publication in which they first appeared. The <hi rend="italic">Raven</hi> was
                    published first in 1845, and in a few months was being read and recited and
                    parodied wherever the English language was spoken; but the half-starved poet,
                    who had to live by his genius, received only two pounds for the production. And,
                    fertile and active as his imagination was, these short works of his, which
                    served for the passing sensation of the newspaper reader, were far from being
                    extempore effusions. His <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Composition</hi> is
                    sometimes, indeed génerally, regarded as half-serious half a jest in the
                    author’s peculiar way of mystification. But to any one who examines Poe’s work
                    closely by the light of this essay it is obvious that the disclosure of his
                    method is only too seriously true. It would have been well for his own powers of
                    endurance if he had composed on a less exacting and exhausting system. The most
                    fantastic of Poe’s creations are not the product of the imagination abandoned to
                    the impulses of a dominant mood; the effects are deliberately calculated, as he
                    says they were, step by step and point by point to a prearranged culmination. A
                    man writing on such a system, with the wolf at the door and affections daily on
                    the rack, could hardly have endured the strain if he had had a constitution of
                    iron. It was no wonder that Poe’s health became distempered, or that, during the
                    last years of his wife’s illness and the two remaining years through which he
                    survived her, he had recourse to the dangerous help of stimulants. Not only did
                    he subject his imagination to exhausting conditions, but he wasted his force in
                    doing with superfluous thoroughness what a ready journalist would have dismissed
                    with a few easy sentences of commonplace. When we read his criticisms, which are
                    full of insight and suggestion, we see that in reviewing a book or a poem he was
                    never satisfied till he had thought out what could be done with the subject. His
                    famous feat in anticipating the plot of <hi rend="italic">Barnaby Rudge</hi>
                    from the opening chapters was only a sample of the thoroughness with which he
                    threw himself into whatever he undertook. Poe failed to make a living by
                    literature, not because he was an irregular profligate in the vulgar sense, but
                    because he did ten times as much work as he was paid to do—a species of
                    profligacy, perhaps, but not quite the same in kind as that with which he was
                    charged by his malignant biographer.</p>
                <p>The current story about his breaking off his engagement with Mrs Whitman by
                    presenting himself at her house in a state of violent drunkenness has been
                    proved to be a fabrication, and many other stories about him have been exploded
                    by Mr Ingram. His wife died in 1847, and he followed her in 1849, dying under
                    painful circumstances at Baltimore. For a critical estimate of Poe’s writings
                    the reader may be referred to Professor Nichol’s <hi rend="italic">American
                        Literature.</hi> There are few English writers of this century whose fame is
                    likely to be more enduring. The feelings to which he appeals are simple but
                    universal, and he appeals to them with a force that has never been surpassed.
