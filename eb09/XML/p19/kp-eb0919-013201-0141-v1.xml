                        Island,</hi> an island of the eastern Pacific, in 25° 4' N. lat. and 130°
                    8'W. long., may be considered as a member or appendage of the Paumotu, Tuamotu,
                    Low, or Dangerous Archipelago, but is nearly 100 miles south of Oeno. It is not
                    more than 3 miles long from east to west and about 2 miles broad. Unlike the
                    other islands of this region it has no coral reef, but rises abruptly from the
                    depths with steep and rugged cliffs of dark basaltic lava. There is no anchorage
                    except on a bank at the west end; and even the best of its three landing
                    places—Bounty Bay on the north coast—is dangerous from the violence of the surf
                    and the existence of a strong undertow. The longer axis of the island is formed
                    by a range of steep hills, attaining in Outlook Ridge a maximum height of 1008
                    feet. On a plateau about 400 feet above the sea lies the village of Adamstown,
                    with its fields and gardens. The climate is variable and rainy, and snow
                    sometimes falls on the mountains; but, as there are no springs or streamlets,
                    drinking water is apt to grow scarce in a dry season. Vegetation is luxuriant.
                    Neither the bread fruit nor the cocoa nut, introduced by the settlers, are fully
                    successful; but the sweet potato, which forms their staple food, banana, yam,
                    taro, pineapple, &amp;c., produce abundantly. Com cannot be grown because of
                    rats. The Pitcairn Islanders (not more than ninety in 1878), descended mainly
                    from the mutineers of the “Bounty” and their Tahitian wives, are a healthy,
                    virtuous, cheerful, and hospitable people, proud of their English blood, and
                    grateful for the services rendered them from time to time by the English
                    Government and private liberality.</p>
                <p>Stone axes, remains of sculptured stone pillars similar to those of Rapanui
                    (Easter Island), and skeletons with a pearl-mussel beneath their head, have been
                    found in the island, and show that, though it was uninhabited when discovered by
                    Carteret in 1767, it had previously been occupied. Pitcairn was the name of the
                    midshipman who first descried it from the mast-head. On 28th April 1789 a mutiny
                    broke out on board the “Bounty,” then employed by the English Government in
                    conveying young breadfruit trees from Tahiti to the West Indies. The commander,
                    Lieutenant <hi rend="smallcaps">Bligh</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi> was set
                    adrift in the launch with a number of his officers and crew, but managed to make
                    his way to Kupang in Timor (Dutch Indies). The mutineers, twenty-five in number,
                    at first all returned to Tahiti. Of those who chose to be landed on that island,
                    six were condemned to death by court-martial in England, and three of these were
                    ultimately executed (1792). Two years earlier (1790) the other party (consisting
                    of Fletcher Christian, the leader of the mutiny, eight other Englishmen, six
                    Polynesian men, and twelve Polynesian women) had taken possession of Pitcairn
                    and burned the “Bounty.” The beautiful island, which might have been a paradise,
                    was soon turned into a little hell. Treachery, drunkenness, madness, and murder
                    fill the first years of its annals. By 1800 all the men were dead except
                    Alexander Smith (afterwards known as John Adams), whose endeavours to train up
                    the youthful generation thus left in his sole charge were crowned with success.
                    An American vessel, the “Topaze,” under Mayhew Folger, discovered the strange
                    colony in 1808, and again, by accident, it was visited by the “Briton,” Captain
                    Sir F. Staines, and the “Tagus,” Captain Pipon, in 1817. On the death of John
                    Adams, 29th March 1829, George Hunn Nobbs, who, after an adventurous life had
                    settled at Pitcairn in 1828, was appointed pastor and chief magistrate of the
                    settlement. Through fear of drought the islanders, now numbering 87 persons,
                    removed in 1830 to Tahiti, but neither the climate nor the morals of the place
                    were such as they approved, and in 1831 they returned to their lonely island.
                    Hardly had they settled into their old ways when Joshua Hill, a strange
                    adventurer, rather crazy than criminal, appeared among them; claiming to be
                    under Government authority, he tyrannized over them till his removal by an
                    English man-of-war in 1838. In 1856 the whole population of Pitcairn—60 married
                    persons and 134 young men, women, and children—were landed on <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Norfolk Island</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.);</hi> and the
                    little island was again left to the occupancy of goats and cattle. In 1858,
                    however, two men, William and Moses Young, chose to return with their families
                    to their old homes, and their example was afterwards followed by a few
                    others.</p>
