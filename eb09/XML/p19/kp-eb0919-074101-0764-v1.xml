                    When in 1785 it was ceded to the English by the rajah of Kedah in return for an
                    annual pension of 10,000 dollars, it was almost uninhabited; at the census of
                    1881 its population amounted to 90,951 (comprising 612 Europeans, 21,772 Malays,
                    45,135 Chinese, 15,730 natives of India), and it has since been increased mainly
                    by further Chinese and Indian immigration. The people from the east coast of
                    India are locally known as Klings, a Malay corruption of Telinga or Telugu; and
                    the half-breed race between Indian and Malay is distinguished as Jawi-Pekan.
                    About two-fifths of Penang are lowland and the rest consists of hills, which
                    towards the north reach their culminating point, 2922 feet above the sea, in the
                    peak now utilized as a sanatorium. A considerable portion of the surface is
                    still uncleared, and from the summit of the peak the whole island presents very
                    much the appearance of a forest, the villages always lying in the midst of
                    groves of the cocoa-nut palm. On the whole, however, vegetation is not so rich
                    as on the neighbouring mainland. Apart from the cocoa-nuts and areca-nuts, the
                    principal products are sugar, coffee, and pepper; but increasing attention is
                    again being given to nutmegs and cloves, which can be grown on the hillsides. Of
                    the landholders 2280 were Chinese and 1482 Malays in 1882. In the lowlands the
                    temperature ranges from 80° to 90°, but on the peak from 60° to 75°. The
                    rainfall in 1882 was 126 ’ 50 inches—somewhat above the average. Georgetown or
                    Penang, the only town on the island, lies on the east coast on a low plain
                    stretching out into the sea; its harbour, always well filled with both European
                    vessels and native craft, is the strait between island and mainland. Water-works
                    were undertaken in 1865. Among the public buildings are the town-hall (1872-80),
                    the post-office (1881), the free school with upwards of 600 pupils, the
                    Christian Brothers’ school, several Tamil schools, the general hospital (1882),
                    and the pauper hospital. An important leper hospital is maintained on
                    Pulo-Jarajah, a small but lofty island in the strait opposite the town. Though
                    Singapore has withdrawn much of the trade that formerly found its way to Penang,
                    there has been a great increase both in exports and imports, the aggregate value
                    for 1859-60 being £3,530,000 and for 1882 £8,855,919.</p>
                <p>The attention of the East India Company was first called to Pulo-Penang by
                    Captain Light in 1771, and it was under his personal command that the settlement
                    was founded in July 1786. At his death in 1794 he left “a compact little
                    township with fort and public buildings.” In 1798 Sir George Leith (for the
                    purpose mainly of rooting out piracy) purchased from the rajah of Kedah for 2000
                    dollars the tract of land opposite Prince of Wales Island, which has since
                    become known as Province Wellesley (area in 1885, 234 square miles). In 1806 the
                    island was made a presidency of equal rank with Madras or Bombay; and after
                    Singapore and Malacca were incorporated with it in 1826 it remained the seat of
                    the general government till 1832. The commercial part of the town was destroyed
                    by fire in 1808.</p>
