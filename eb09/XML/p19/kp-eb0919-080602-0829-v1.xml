                    of the province of Burmah, but in 1870 Thayet was formed into an independent
                    jurisdiction. There are two mountain ranges in Prome, which form respectively
                    the eastern and western boundaries. The Arakan Yoma extends along the whole of

                    the south and southwest portions of Prome, and extend along the whole length of
                    the railway that runs between the towns of Poungdé and Prome; they are mostly
                    under cultivation, and those in the south are watered by a series of streams
                    forming the Myit-ma-kha or upper portion of the Hlaing. There are in addition
                    large tracts of land covered by tree-jungle which are available for cultivation.
                    The principal river is the Irawadi, which intersects the district from north to
                    south; next in importance are the Tha-ni and its tributaries and the Na-weng
                    system of rivers. In the hills near the capital the soil is of Tertiary
                    formation, and in the plains it is of alluvial deposit. The climate is much
                    drier than other districts in British Burmah. The total rainfall in 1882 was 49
                    ’ 64 inches.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population was 322,342 (161,433 males and 160,909 females). Buddhists
                    and Jains numbered 313,261, Mohammedans 1795, Hindus 978, Christians 336,
                    Aborigines 5818, and Parsees 5. More than two-thirds of the population are
                    agriculturists. The chief towns are Prome (see below), and Shwedoung and
                    Poungdé, with 12,373 and 6727 inhabitants respectively. The chief products are
                    rice, teak, cutch, silk, sugar cane, cotton, tobacco, and sesame oil; but the
                    staple product is rice, which is cultivated mainly in the Poungdé and Shwe-doung
                    townships. The total area under cultivation in 1882 was 234,222 acres. One of
                    the most important manufactures is silk; others are ornamental boxes, coarse
                    brown sugar, and cutch. The gross revenue of the district in 1882 amounted to
                    about £92,000, of which over a third was derived from the land.</p>
                <p>The early history of the once flourishing kingdom of Prome, like that of the
                    other states which now form portions of the province of British Burmah, is
                    veiled in obscurity. Fact and fable are so interwoven that it is impossible to
                    disentangle the true from the false. After the conquest of Pegu in 1758 by
                    Aloung-bhùra, the founder of the third and present dynasty of Ava kings, Prome
                    remained a province of the Burman kingdom till the close of the second Burmese
                    war in 1853, when the province of Pegu was annexed to British territory.</p>
