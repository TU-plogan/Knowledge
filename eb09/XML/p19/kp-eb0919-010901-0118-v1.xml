                    Palos de Moguer, in Andalusia, three members of which —Alonzo, Francesco, and
                    Vicente, brothers—were associated with Columbus in his great discovery.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Martin Alonzo Pinzon,</hi> born about the middle of the 15th
                    century, gave material assistance to Columbus in carrying out his project. In
                    the expedition of 1492 Alonzo commanded the “Pinta,” on board of which his
                    brother Francesco was pilot; another brother, Vicente Yanez, had command of the
                    “Nina.” It was at Alonzo’s pursuasion that on October 7th the course of the
                    expedition was changed to the south-west; the island of Guanahani or San
                    Salvador, four days after, was sighted. On November 21, off the coast of Cuba,
                    Alonzo separated himself from the expedition, and crowded sail to the westward,
                    hoping to be the first to arrive at the land of gold of which they had heard the
                    natives speak. After an absence of six weeks he rejoined Columbus, who accepted
                    the excuses he gave for his absence. On the return journey Alonzo again
                    separated from his leader, probably by design, and when Columbus arrived at
                    Palos on March 15, 1493, he learned that Alonzo had already landed at Bayona in
                    Galicia. If his object was to forestall Columbus and obtain the credit of being
                    the discoverer of the Neλv World, his intentions were foiled; he λvas refused
                    the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit19newyrich/page/n119/mode/1up"

                    and very shortly after died, it is supposed of chagrin. Even although it could
                    be proved that Alonzo’s intentions were dishonourable, we should remember that
                    it was largely through his liberality that Columbus was enabled to carry out his
                    immortal voyage.</p>

                    gave Columbus material help, and remained loyal to his leader throughout. In
                    after years he made important discoveries on his own account. In 1499 he sailed
                    with four caravels across the Atlantic to the south-west, and on January 20,
                    1500, he struck the South-American continent at Cape S. Agostinho, its most
                    easterly projection, three months before the Portuguese navigator Cabral reached
                    Brazil, the discovery of which is generally attributed to him. Proceeding
                    southwards a short distance, he then turned north, followed the coast to the
                    north-west, and went as far at least as what is now Costa Rica. After touching
                    at Hayti, and losing two of his vessels among the Bahamas, Vicente returned to
                    Palos in the end of September 1500. Although concessions were made to him, and
                    he was created governor of the newly discovered lands by Ferdinand and Isabella,
                    he does not seem to have ever taken possession. In 1508 we find Vicente sailing
                    with Juan Diaz de Salis along the east coast of South America, in their attempt
                    to find an opening towards the west that would conduct them to the Spice
                    Islands. He did not get beyond the 40th degree of S. lat., about the mouth of
                    the Rio Negro, having passed the mouth of the La Plata without recognizing it.
                    After 1523 all traces of Vicente are lost.</p>
