                    (1788-1867), mathematician, was born at Metz, July 1, 1788. From 1808 to 1810 he
                    attended the Polytechnic School, and afterwards, till 1812, the Practical School
                    at Metz. He then became lieutenant of engineers, and took part in the Russian
                    campaign, during which he was taken prisoner and was confined at Saratoff on the
                    Volga. It was during his imprisonment here that, “privé de toute espèce de
                    livres et de secours, surtout distrait par les malheurs de ma patrie et les
                    miens propres,” as he himself puts it, he began his researches on projective
                    geometry which led to his great treatise on that subject. This work, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Traité des Propriétés Projectives</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                        Figures,</hi> which was published in 1822 (2d ed., 1865), is occupied with
                    the investigation of the projective properties of figures, that is, such
                    properties as are not altered by projection. In his investigation he employs the
                    ideas of continuity, of homologous figures, and of reciprocal polars; and by
                    means of these, without any analysis, he was able to establish all the known
                    properties of lines and surfaces of the second degree, and to discover others
                    unknown before. This work entitles Poncelet to rank as one of the greatest of
                    those who took part in the development of the modern geometry of which Monge was
                    the founder. From 1815 to 1825 he was occupied with military engineering at
                    Metz; and from 1825 to 1835 he was professor of mechanics at the Practical
                    School there. In 1826, in his <hi rend="italic">Mémoire sur les Rôties
                        Hydrauliques à Aubes Courbes,</hi> he brought forward improvements in the
                    construction of water-wheels, which more than doubled their efficiency. In 1834
                    he became a member of the Academy; from 1838 to 1848 he was professor to the
                    faculty of sciences at Paris, and from 1848 to 1850 commandant of the
                    Polytechnic School, where he effected a reform in the course of study. At the
