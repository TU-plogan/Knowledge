                            Bentinck, third Duke of</hi></label> (1738-1809), prime minister of
                    England, was the grandson of Henry, second earl and first duke of Portland, who
                    was son of William, first earl. He was born 14th April 1738, and was educated at
                    Oxford university, where he graduated Μ. A. in 1757. In 1761 he was elected to
                    represent the borough of Weobly (Hereford) in parliament, but in May of the
                    following year he was called to the Upper House on the death of his father.
                    Under the marquis of Rockingham he was, from July 1765 to July 1766, lord
                    chamberlain, and on the return of the marquis of Rockingham to power in 1782 he
                    was made lord-lieutenant of Ireland. After the short ministry of Shelburne,
                    succeeding the death of Rockingham, the duke of Portland was selected by Fox and
                    North as a “convenient cipher” to become the head of the coalition ministry, to
                    the formation of which the king was with great reluctance compelled to give his
                    assent. The duke held the premiership from 5th April 1783 until the defeat of
                    the Bill for “the just and efficient government of British India” caused his
                    dismissal from office on 17th December. In 1792 he succeeded the earl of
                    Guildford as chancellor of the university of Oxford. Under Pitt he was, from
                    1794 to 1801, secretary of state for the home department, after which he was,
                    from 1801 to 1805, president of the council. In 1807 he was appointed a second
                    time first lord of the treasury. Ill-health caused him to resign in September
                    1809, and he died 30th October following. He owed his political influence
                    chiefly to his rank, his mild disposition, and his personal integrity, for his
                    talents were in no sense brilliant, and he was deficient in practical energy as
