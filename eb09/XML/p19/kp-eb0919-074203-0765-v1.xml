                <p><label type="entry">PRINCETON</label>, a borough and township of the United
                    States, in Mercer county, New Jersey, on the Delaware and Rariton Canal, 3 miles
                    north by rail from Princeton Junction, which is 48 miles south-west of New York
                    and 42 north-east of Philadelphia on the Pennsylvania Railway. Standing on high
                    ground, it commands a fine prospect towards the east and south. The town is the
                    seat of Princeton or New Jersey College, founded in 1746 by members of the
                    presbytery of New York, chartered in the same year, and opened at Elizabethtown
                    (now Elizabeth) in 1747, removed to Newark in the same year and rechartered in
                    1748, and finally transferred in 1756 to Princeton, where Nassau Hall, so called
                    in honour of λVilliam III. of England, had been erected. Nassau Hall has been
                    twice burned down, in 1802 and 1855, but was restored in 1856 in the old style.
                    This building, Reunion Hall (1870), West College (1836), East College (1833),
                    and the halls of the American Whig and Cliosophic literary societies enclose a
                    quadrangle; and eastward, in the line of Nassau Hall or the north front, stand
                    the library buildings (1873), consisting of an octagonal centre with two wings,
                    the Dickinson Hall (1870), and the John C. Green School of Science (1873). Along
                    the western border of the grounds are University Hall (1876), the Halstead
                    observatory (1867), the gymnasium (1869), Witherspoon Hall (1876), and Edwards
                    Hall (1879), while on the east are the Marquand Chapel (1881), Murray Hall
                    (1877), and the residence of the president. Almost all these buildings are the
                    gifts of generous benefactors, the most munificent of whom was Mr John C. Green,
                    by whom and by the trustees of his estate not less than $1,500,000 has been
                    given in buildings and endowments. In 1884 the college, which is steadily
                    growing, had 39 professors and 519 students, and the library contained 77,000
                    volumes. The endowments amount to $1,392,000. The governor of the State of New
                    Jersey is <hi rend="italic">ex officio</hi> president of the board of trustees,
                    who are twenty-five in number besides the president of the college. The trustees
                    appoint the members of the faculty and have entire control over the funds and
                    property of the college. They fill all vacancies in their own body. Besides the
                    Halstead observatory, there is another well-equipped observatory at the School
                    of Science, and the laboratories and museum are well furnished for scientific
                    study. In ttfe cemetery, which lies to the north of the college, are the tombs
                    of Jonathan Edwards, Aaron Burr, &amp;c. Princeton is also the seat of the
                    oldest theological seminary of the Presbyterian Church in the United States
                    (founded in 1812), with 7 professors, 1 instructor, about 150 students, and an
                    endowment of about a million dollars. The population of the township in 1870 was
                    3986 and of the borough 2798, and in 1880 respectively 4348 and 3209. (See also
