                    preparatory studies for the university. In 1815 he entered the university of
                    North Carolina, where in 1818 he graduated with the highest honours. Called to
                    the bar in 1820, he speedily made for himself a high reputation, and in 1823 he
                    entered the State legislature. In August 1825 he was chosen to represent his
                    district in Congress, to which he was re-elected every succeeding two years
                    until 1839. As a strong supporter of Democratic opinions he identified himself
                    with every important discussion, and, though he was not a brilliant speaker, his
                    solid abilities, extraordinary energy, and indomitable will soon gave him a
                    place in the front rank of politicians. In 1835 he was chosen speaker of the
                    House of Representatives, to which he was re-elected in 1837, and in 1839 he was
                    elected governor of Tennessee. In 1844 he was the Democrat candidate for the
                    presidentship, and was chosen over Clay by a majority of sixty-five electoral
                    votes. The election in great measure turned on the annexation of Texas, which
                    was effected before his inauguration. One of the earliest questions with which
                    his administration had to deal was the boundary of Oregon, which, although he
                    had previously declared the title of the United States to Oregon to be “clear
                    and undisputed,” was finally fixed at the parallel of 49° instead of 54° 40.'
                    Following the annexation of Texas came the Mexican war, resulting in the treaty
                    of Guadalupe Hidalgo, 2d February 1848, by which New Mexico and California were
                    ceded to the United States. Other important measures of his administration were
                    the admission of Iowa and Wisconsin to the Union, the adoption of a low tariff
                    in 1846, the organization of the department of the interior, and the adoption of
                    the method of collecting Government revenues by specie without the aid of the
                    banks. Polk retired from office 4th March 1849, and died in Nashville, 15th June
                    of the same year.</p>
