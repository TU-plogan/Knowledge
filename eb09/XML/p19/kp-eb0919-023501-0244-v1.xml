                <p><label type="entry">PLUTO</label>, the god of the dead in Greek mythology. His
                    oldest name was Hades (‘Atifys, Άιδτ/ς, ’Αδτ/ç), “the Unseen”; the name Pluto
                    (∏λoυτωv) was given him as the bestower of the riches (τrλovτoς) of the mine,
                    and in ordinary language it ousted the dread name of Hades, which was, however,
                    retained in poetry. He was the son of Cronus and Rhea, and brother of Zeus and
                    Poseidon. Having deposed Cronus, the brothers cast lots for the kingdoms of the
                    heaven, the sea, and the infernal regions, and Pluto obtained the infernal
                    regions, which from their ruler were afterwards known as Hades. The “house of
                    Hades” was a dark and dreadful abode deep down in the earth. How literally the
                    god was supposed to dwell underground is shown by the method of invoking him,
                    which was by rapping on the ground to attract his attention. According to
                    another view the realm of Hades was in a land beyond the ocean in the far west,
                    which to the Greek was always the region of darkness and death, as the east of
                    light and life. This is the view of Hades presented in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Odyssey.</hi> Ulysses sails all day with a north wind, and at sunset
                    reaches a land at the limits of ocean. Here, wrapped in mist and cloud, dwell
                    the Cimmerians, who never see the sun. He lands, and moving along the shore he
                    calls the ghosts of the departed to meet him. In the description of the
                    Cimmerians we have perhaps a traveller’s tale of the long dark winters of the
                    north. Besides this gloomy region, we find in another passage of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> (iv. 561 <hi rend="italic">sq.)</hi> a picture of
                    Elysium, a happy land at the ends of the earth, where rain and snow fall not,
                    but the cool west wind blows and men live at ease. After Homer this happy land,
                    the abode of the good after death, was known as the Islands of the Blest, and
                    these in later times were identified with Madeira and the Canary Islands.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The conception of the
                            land of the dead, whether in the far west or beneath the earth, might be
                            paralleled from the beliefs of many savage tribes. The Samoan Islanders
                            unite the two conceptions: the entrance to their spirit-land is at the
                            westernmost point of the westernmost island, where the ghosts descend by
                            two holes into the under-world. Long ago the inhabitants of the French
                            coast of the English Channel believed that the souls of the dead were
                            ferried across to Britain, and there are still traces of this belief in
                            the folk-lore of Brittany (Tylor, <hi rend="italic">Primitive
                                Culture,</hi> ii. p. 64; Grimm, <hi rend="italic">Deutsche</hi><hi
                                rend="italic">Mythologie,</hi> ii, p. 694). In classical mythology
                            the underground Hades prevailed over the western. It was an Etruscan
                            custom at the foundation of a city to dig a deep hole in the earth, and
                            close it with a stone; on three days in the year this stone was removed,
                            and the ghosts were then supposed to ascend from the lower world. In
                            Asia Minor caves filled with mephitic vapours or containing hot springs
                            were known as Plutonia or Charonia. The most famous entrances to the
                            under-world were at Taenarum in Laconia, and at the Lake Avemus in
                            Italy.</p></note> But in the oldest Greek mythology the “house of Hades”
                    was a place neither of reward nor punishment; it was simply the home of the
                    dead, good and bad alike, who led a dim and shadowy reflexion of life on earth.
                    The differentiation of this “home of Hades” into a heaven and a hell was the
                    result of progressive thought and morality. Pluto was himself simply the ruler
                    of the dead; in no sense was he a tempter and seducer of mankind like the devil
                    of Christian theology. Indeed the very conception of a devil, as a principle of
                    evil in continual conflict with God or the principle of good, is totally foreign
                    to Greek mythology, as it was also to Indian and Teutonic mythology. Pluto was
                    certainly depicted as <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0919-0245-0236"/> stem and pitiless, but he was so only in
                    discharge of his duty as custodian of the dead. But even Pluto once melted at
                    the music of Orpheus when he came to fetch from the dead his wife Eurydice. The
                    cap of Hades, like the <hi rend="italic">Nebelkappe</hi> of German mythology,
                    rendered its wearer invisible; as a sort of thick cloud it was the reverse of
                    the nimbus or halo of the heavenly gods. While the victims sacrificed to the
                    latter were white, those offered to Pluto were black. His wife was Proserpine
                    (Persephone), daughter of Demeter (Ceres), whom he carried off as she was
                    gathering flowers at Enna in Sicily. Like the Greeks, the ancient Italians
                    believed that the souls of the dead dwelt underground; in Latin the names for
                    the god of the dead are Orcus and Father Dis, but the Greek name Pluto also
                    frequently occurs. But, while Orcus was rather the actual slayer, the angel of
                    death, Father Dis was the ruler of the dead, and thus corresponded to Pluto.
                    Their names also correspond, Dis being a contraction for Dives, “wealthy.” The
                    Etruscan god of death was represented as a savage old man with wings and a
                    hammer; at the gladiatorial games of Rome a man masked after this fashion used
                    to remove the corpses from the arena. In Romanesque folklore Orcus has passed
                    into a forest-elf, a black, hairy, man-eating monster, upon whose house children
                    lost in the woods are apt to stumble, and who sometimes shows himself kindly and
                    helpful. He is the Italian <hi rend="italic">or co,</hi> the Spanish <hi
