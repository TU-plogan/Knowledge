                        >Angeles,</hi> a city of Mexico, formerly capital of the province of
                    Tlaxcala, now of the state of Puebla, lies 76 miles south-east of Mexico, in 19°
                    N. lat. and 98° 2' W. long., at a height of 7220 feet above the sea. It is
                    admirably situated on a spacious and fertile plateau, which, while almost
                    destitute of trees, is, especially in the neighbourhood of the city, clothed
                    with gardens and fields. To the south-west rises the summit of Popocatepetl, and
                    Orizaba and Iztaccihuatl are also within the horizon. By Humboldt Puebla was
                    ranked as the most important city of Spanish America after Mexico, Guanajuato,
                    and Havana, and in the matter of population it still stands third among the
                    state capitals. Its spacious streets run exactly east-west and north-south, and
                    its houses, often of three stories, are solidly built of stone and in Spanish
                    style. The cathedral, dedicated to the Immaculate Conception, was commenced in
                    1552 after the designs of Juan Gomez de Mora, but it was not completed until
                    1649, after Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza had devoted eight years of
                    strenuous effort to the enterprise. It is rather more than 320 feet long and 165
                    wide, and consists of a nave 80 feet high, with side aisles and a dome, the
                    upper portion of which is constructed of pumice-stone for the sake of lightness.
                    The main front, like the columns of the interior, is in the Doric style, but its
                    two side towers are Ionic. In one is a great bell cast in 1637 and weighing
                    upwards of 8 tons. Apart from the cathedral Puebla was famous for the number,
                    and more especially for the lavish decoration of its churches, monasteries, and
                    colleges. Several of these (such as the church and convent of Santo Domingo and
                    the church of S. Felipe Neri) are still of note, and the city also contains a
                    museum, a theatre, &amp;c. Puebla has long been one of the great trading and
                    manufacturing centres of the country, and it has recently become an important
                    point in the rapidly-developing railway system, having in 1884 lines to Apizaco
                    on the railway from Vera Cruz to Mexico (28 miles), to Villa de Libres (58
                    miles), to San Martin (24 miles), to Matamoros Izucar (31 miles), and to San
                    Juan de los Llanos. Cotton and woollen goods, leather, earthenware, soap, and
                    glass are the leading manufactures. The population, which was about 80,000 in
                    1746 and 52,717 in 1793, and which greatly decreased during the revolutionary
                    period, is now (1885) stated at 75,000.</p>
                <p>Puebla was founded in 1533-34 by Sebastian Ramirez de Fuenleal, archbishop of
                    Santo Domingo, and the Franciscan friar Toribio Motolinia. In 1550 it became the
                    seat of the bishopric which had originally been founded in 1526 at Tlaxcala. The
                    epithet “de los Angeles,” which is now practically dropped, was in the 17th and
                    18th centuries the chief part of the name, which often appears simply as
                    Angeles. It is associated with a popular belief that during the building of the
                    cathedral two angels every night added as much to the height of the walls as the
                    workmen had managed to add in the preceding day. In 1845 Santa Anna made an
                    unsuccessful attempt to capture the city. On 18th March 1863 it was invested by
                    the French under Forey, and on 17th May taken by storm.</p>
