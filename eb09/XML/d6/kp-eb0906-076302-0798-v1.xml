                <p><label type="entry">DAHLIA</label>, a genus of herbaceous plants of the natural
                    order <hi rend="italic">Composites,</hi> so called after Dr Dahl, a pupil of Lin
                    naeus. The dahlia is indigenous to Mexico, where it flourishes in sandy tracts
                    at a height of 5000 feet above sea-level. Two cultivated species are
                    distinguished by some botanists, <hi rend="italic">D.frustranea</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">D. superflua,</hi> the outer involucre in the former being
                    spreading, in the latter reflexed. The flowers have a chaffy receptacle, a
                    double involucre, and no pappus. The roots or tubers are spindle-shaped, and
                    grow in bundles; they were at one time used as food in France; but their acrid
                    flavour occasioned their rejection as an esculent. They may be stored in winter
                    in the same manner as potatoes. The flowers, at the time of the first
                    introduction of the plant, were single, with a yellow disc and dull scarlet
                    rays; under cultivation, since 1802 in France and 1804 in England, flowers of
                    numerous brilliant hues, with the elements of the disc converted into
                    rayflorets, have been produced. The flower has been modified also from a flat to
                    a globular shape, and the arrangement of the florets has been rendered quite
                    distinct in the ranunculus and anemone-like kinds. The ordinary natural height
                    of the dahlia is about 7 or 8 feet, but one of the dwarf races grows to only 18
                    inches. With changes in the flower, changes in the shape of the seed have been
                    brought about by cultivation; varieties of the plant have been produced which
                    require more moisture than others; and the period of flowering has been made
                    considerably earlier. In 1808 dahlias were described as flowering from September
                    to November, but some of the dwarf varieties at present grown are in full
                    blossom in the middle of June. The nature of the season has a marked effect upon
                    certain kinds of dahlia, so that those which are good in one year may become
                    decidedly bad in the next. In 1842 it was noted by one observer that
                    every-dahlia with a tendency to become of a scarlet hue had its petals deeply
                    notched, in some cases to the depth of half an inch. A fine colour is an
                    important requisite for a good flower; there should also be no sinking of the
                    centre or eye, and the backs of the petals should not be visible. Dahlias may be
                    grown in almost any kind of soil, but flourish best in a rich loam; on a light
                    sandy mould they arrive early at maturity, and become dwarfed. The plants should
                    be protected from north and east winds, and when watered the whole of their
                    foliage should be wetted. They are propagated by cuttings and seed as well as by
                    tubers. Experience has shown that the best plants obtained from cuttings are
                    those planted in soil different from that on which the parent plants grow. The
                    seeds are sown in pots early in March, under the protection of a hotbed frame or
                    in a hothouse.</p>
