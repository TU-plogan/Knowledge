                <p><label type="entry">DAVID</label> (Welsh, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dewi), St,</hi>
                    the patron saint of Wales, flourished in the 6th century. Various dates have
                    been assigned for his birth and death, the earliest being that of Geoffrey of
                    Monmouth, who fixes his death in 542, and the latest that of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Annales Cambrice,</hi> which fixes it in 601. Many writers
                    follow Ussher in stating that he died in 544, aged eighty-two; but the latest
                    authorities, Jones and Freeman <hi rend="italic">(History of St David's')</hi>
                    and Haddan and Stubbs (C'ouncifs <hi rend="italic">and Ecclesiastical
                        Documents),</hi> accept the date of the <hi rend="italic">Annales
                        Cambrice.</hi> The narrative of St David’s life is overlaid with legendary
                    matter to an unusual extent, and it is impossible to determine accurately what
                    is historical and what is fictitious. Such stories as that he possessed the
                    power of working miracles, even before his birth, that he was eighteenth in
                    descent from the Virgin Mary, and that he was attended by an angel in his
                    infancy, may obviously be referred at once to the latter category; but there are
                    many other details which, even though not obviously improbable, must be regarded
                    as extremely doubtful. According to the account given by Rice Rees <hi
                        rend="italic">(Welsh Saints)</hi> as historical, St David was the son of
                    Sandde or Xantus, prince of Ceretica (Cardiganshire), and was born at Hen-Menen
                    or Menevia (now St David’s). After spending a number of years at the college of
                    a celebrated teacher Paulinus, he founded a college or monastery in the Vale of
                    Rhos, near his native place, which was distinguished for the severity of its
                    rule. His fame as a theologian led to his being summoned to the synod of Brefi
                    to confute the Pelagian heretics. So well did he acquit himself of this task
                    that the synod elected him archbishop of Caerleon and primate of
                    Wales,—Dubriciu3, the occupant of the see, having resigned to make room for him.
                    Soon after his election St David found it necessary to convene another synod,
                    which is styled in the annals the Synod of Victory, so complete was the triumph
                    obtained over the Pelagians. Somewhat later the primate obtained leave to
                    transfer his seat from Caerleon to Menevia (St David’s). He died at an advanced
                    age, and was buried in the church of St David’s. His shrine is to be seen in the
                    existing cathedral. Recent criticism, while admitting that St David founded a
                    see at Menevia, and that he probably took an active part in the undoubtedly
                    historical synod of Brefi, has discredited his archiepiscopal jurisdiction. This
                    is almost certainly the invention of those in a later age who wished to maintain
                    the independence of the Welsh church, and supremacy in that church of the see of
                    St David’s. It was the view that naturally commended itself to the author of the
                    earliest life of St David, Rythmark, or Ricemarchus, bishop of St David’s in the
                    11th century, who wrote at a time when the independence of the Welsh church was
                    seriously threatened. His narrative is followed in the main by Giraldus
                    Cambrensis and later authorities. St David was canonized by Pope Calixtus II.,
                    in the 12th century. His festival is celebrated on the 1st March.</p>
