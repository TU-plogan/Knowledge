                <p><label type="entry">DAGGER</label>, a weapon which, in relation to its
                    comparatively short blade, may be considered a diminutive of the sword.
                    Specially designed to inflict wounds by the act of stabbing, the dagger is sharp
                    at the point, but it is equally adapted for cutting purposes with its keen edge.
                    Al savage races have highly valued the dagger in some modifications of its
                    simplest type; while at certain periods it has been included among the military
                    weapons of civilized nations, and, in our own time, is well known as the dirk.
                    Early in the 14th century a dagger straight in the blade, and called a <hi
                        rend="italic">misericorde—</hi> either because the sight of it caused the
                    vanquished to cry out for mercy, or from its use in mercifully ending the
                    sufferings of the hopelessly wounded—became a companion weapon to the sword
                    among the knights of Europe; and, accordingly, from about 1330 till the end of
                    the succeeding century, in many knightly effigies it is often represented as
                    attached on the right side by a cord or a chain to the sword-belt. The
                    misericorde varied in size, the length of the blade sometimes causing it to
                    appear almost like a second sword, while at other times the blade and the hilt
                    were nearly of equal length. This weapon and its sheath were often elaborately
                    adorned. It was customary to secure it from accidental loss by a guard-chain
                    fastened to a mamelliere of the breast-armour, of which chain the other end was
                    secured to the hilt of the weapon by a ring either fixed on the apex of the
                    pommel or travelling along the grip. Occasionally the misericorde was fixed to
                    the body-armour by a staple; or, more rarely, it was connected with a gypciere
                    or pouch. A similar weapon, with a longer blade than the ordinary misericorde,
                    was habitually worn by civilians, including judges, during the Middle Ages; such
                    weapons bore the name of <hi rend="italic">anlace</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >basilarde.</hi> By nobles and knights the misericorde was worn when they
                    had exchanged their armour for the costume of peace. It is recorded, besides,
                    that when they appeared at a tournament, and on some other occasions, ladies at
                    that time wore daggers depending, with their gyp-cieres, from their girdles.
                    Thus, writing of the year 1348, Knighton speaks of certain ladies who were
                    present at jousts as “habentes cultellos, quos <hi rend="italic">daggerios</hi>
                    vulgariter dicunt, in powchiis desuper impositis.” A sword having a blade much
                    shorter than the principal knightly weapon of the same class, and distinguished
                    as an <hi rend="italic">estoc,</hi> which, like the civilian anlace or
                    basilarde, may be considered to be a variety of the dagger, occasionally formed
                    a part of the equipment of the mediaeval man-at-anns; and it is the scabbard of
                    such a weapon that hangs as a characteristic memorial above the tomb and the
                    effigy of the Black Prince in Canterbury Cathedral. Much ingenuity and skill
                    have been lavished on the adornment of daggers, and in rendering the blades more
                    capable of inflicting severe wounds. Daggers also were sometimes made to poison
                    as well as wound. Some Italian daggers, of stiletto type, have the blade made to
                    expand laterally, by the action of delicate and powerful springs. Others, like
                    the <hi rend="italic">cris of</hi> the Malays, have wavy blades.</p>
