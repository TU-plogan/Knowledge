                        rend="smallcaps">von,</hi> famous for her acquaintance and correspondence
                    with Goethe, was a member of the Brentano family, and born at Frankfort, April
                    4, 1785. Her acquaintance with Goethe continued from 1807 until 1811, when it
                    was brought to a close by her offensive behaviour to his wife. Shortly after his
                    death she published an extensive correspondence alleged to have passed between
                    the parties. Its genuineness was immediately contested by Goethe’s old friend
                    Riemer, and the discussion leaves no doubt that it is everywhere interpolated,
                    and to a great extent wholly fictitious. Bettina never could produce the
                    originals of the letters; and it has been demonstrated that the sonnets which
                    she claimed as addressed to herself, and as partly versifications of her own
                    ideas, were in fact addressed to Minna Herzlieb before Goethe had even seen
                    Bettina. This discovery effectually relieves the poet’s memory from some very
                    unpleasant imputations. The literary merits of the work are in some respects
                    very considerable. Nothing can surpass Bettina’s liveliness, freshness,
                    originality, and graphic power when dealing with actual persons and things: she
                    is, unfortunately, addicted to abstract speculation, and then becomes
                    unintelligible. Though probably equally supposititious, her correspondence with
                    the friend of her youth, the interesting and unfortunate Caroline von
                    Giinderode, is superior to her more celebrated work from its greater truth to
                    nature <hi rend="italic">; and</hi> her almost unknown volume of professed
                    letters to and from her brother, Clemens Brentano, is the best of all. These
                    later productions failed to attract a public sated with her peculiar mannerism,
                    and Bettina had sunk into comparative obscurity before her death in 1859.
                    Bettina was a true member of a∙ family whose folly was in her time proverbially
                    said to begin where the folly of others ceases. Her vanity, caprice, mendacity,
                    and utter want of principle can only be excused on the supposition of her
                    virtual irresponsibility for her actions. She possessed a brilliant fancy, and
                    her remarks occasionally display great penetration; her conversational powers
                    are described as marvellous. One of her freaks was to translate her
