                <p><label type="entry">APPENZELL</label> (for derivation see below), one of the
                    twenty-two cantons of the Swiss Confederation, is an alpine region, with an area
                    of about 152 square miles, entirely surrounded by the canton of St Gall. The
                    mountains in the south attain a considerable elevation, the highest, Mount
                    Sentis, being 8215 feet in height, and reaching the region of perpetual snow;
                    but towards the north the surface is composed of’mere hills and hollows, some of
                    the hills being rather remarkable for their conical shape. The canton is watered
                    by a tributary of the Thur, the Sitter, which takes its rise from a glacier on
                    Mount Sentis, its affluent the Urnäsch, and a number of mountain streams. It was
                    at one time almost covered with forests of fir and pine; but in consequence of
                    the extension of the population, these have been greatly diminished. Peat and
                    wood for fuel are abundant. The climate is cold and variable, but not unhealthy.
                    Subject like the rest of Switzerland to the Franks in the 8th century, Appenzell
                    gradually passed into the hands of the abbots of St Gall; in 1401 it rebelled
                    against what had become an ecclesiastical tyranny; and in 1513 it was admitted
                    into the Swiss Confederation. The violent struggles which followed the
                    Reformation led to its division, in 1597, into two parts—the Inner Rhodes (a
                    word of military origin, like the German <hi rend="italic">Rotte),</hi> in the

                    Catholics, and the Outer Rhodes, in the north, to the Protestants. This
                    distinction has continued to the present day; the census of 1870 giving the
                    number of Protestants in the Catholic district as only 188, and of Catholics in
                    the Protestant, 2358. Until 1848, indeed, no Protestants, or even Catholic
                    aliens, were allowed to settle in Inner Rhodes. The chief town of that division
                    is Appenzell, and of the other, Trogen. Each district has its own democratical
                    constitution, consisting of a <hi rend="italic">Landesgemeinde,</hi> or General
                    .Assembly, where every freeman above 18 years is bound to appear, and a Great
                    Council, chosen by the people, the members of which must submit their acts to
                    the general approval for their ratification. Outer Rhodes sends two members to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Nationalrath,</hi> or House of Representatives of the
                    Confederation, and Inner Rhodes one, besides the two members which the canton
                    sends to the <hi rend="italic">Standerath,</hi> or Senate. Appenzell has taken
                    the civil code of Zurich for its model, and has instituted a court of appeal.
                    The value of real and other property in Outer Rhodes is estimated at £59,028,
                    and in Inner Rhodes at £9600; the revenue of Outer Rhodes at £12,699, and its
                    expenditure, £12,800 (1868); and the revenue of Inner Rhodes at £6031, and its
                    expenditure at £6011. In 1837 the population of the canton was 50,876; in 1860,
                    60,624, of whom 48,604 belonged to the Protestant division; and in 1870, 60,635,
                    of whom 48,726 belonged to Outer Rhodes. This division, therefore, is far more
                    populous and wealthy than the other part of the canton. Its inhabitants are
                    industrious, and carry on large manufactures of cotton and linen goods and
                    embroidery, while the inhabitants of Inner Rhodes are chiefly engaged in the
                    rearing of cattle and the making of cheese. Since railway communication has made
                    the district more accessible, a great number of strangers come to take advantage
                    of the whey-cure establishments at Gais, Weissbad, Gonten, Umäsch, &lt;sc. A
                    peculiar dialect— differing from the ordinary Swiss German—is spoken throughout
                    the canton. Red is the prevailing colour in the national dress; and athletic
                    sports and rifle-shooting are the favourite amusements.</p>
