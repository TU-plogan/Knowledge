                    Theodorus, a distinguished Greek rhetorician or sophist, was the son of
                    Eudae-mon, a priest of Zeus, and was born at Adriani, in Mysia. The date of his
                    birth is given by some as 129 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> by others, with
                    more probability, as 117. He studied with great assiduity, and early manifested
                    an uncommon aptitude for all that pertained to the art of rhetoric. He travelled
                    extensively through Greece, Italy, Egypt, and Asia, and acquired such renown for
                    eloquence that monuments were erected to him in several of the towns through
                    which he passed. A record of his journeys has been preserved by himself, and his
                    vanity appears to have been increased to an inordinate extent by his success.
                    Shortly after his return to Italy, he was seized with a peculiar illness, which
                    lasted for 13 years, and the nature of which has been the subject of some
                    speculation. It is described very fully in his six <hi rend="italic">Sacred
                        Discourses,</hi> along with a mass of details regarding visions, dreams, and
                    wonderful cures. His account of these cures has excited considerable attention,
                    from the similarity between them and the effects produced by Mesmerism or
                    Hypnotism, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> nervous sleep. Aristides meanwhile had
                    settled at Smyrna, whither he had gone for the sake of his health. In 178, when
                    the city was partially destroyed by an earthquake, he wrote an eloquent account
                    of the misfortune to the Emperor Aurelius, with whom he was a great favourite,
                    and prevailed on him to give assistance to the citizens. The Smyrnaeans, out of

                    their city, and erected a brazen statue to him. He declined the other honours
                    which they would have heaped upon him, and would only accept the office of
                    priest of Aesculapius, which he held till his death, about 189 <hi

                <p>The extant works of Aristides consist of two small and unimportant treatises on
                    rhetoric, and of fifty-five orations or declamations. In several of these he
                    selects the same subjects as had been treated by Demosthenes and Isocrates, and
                    puts himself in direct competition with them. His contemporaries ventured to
                    compare him with Demosthenes, but modern criticism does not confirm this
                    judgment The style of Aristides is good, sometimes terse and elegant, but
                    occasionally laboured, and there is a total want of the vigorous energy of
                    thought and practical skill that give so much power to the orations of
                    Demosthenes. No doubt this is in great measure due to the fact that the subjects
                    selected by Aristides were to him fictitious, and that, consequently, his whole
                    attention must have been concentrated on the diction and manner of treatment; in
                    the cause itself he could have had no living interest. A complete edition of his
