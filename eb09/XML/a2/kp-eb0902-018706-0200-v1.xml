                        rend="smallcaps">(Pergaeus),</hi> next to Archimedes the most illustrious of
                    the ancient Greek geometricians, was bom probably about 250 B.c., and died
                    during the reign of Ptolemy Philopator (222-205 B.c.), flourishing thus about
                    forty years later than Archimedes. He studied at Alexandria under the successors
                    of Euclid, and is one of the brightest ornaments of that famous mathematical
                    school.</p>
                <p>But few of the mathematical works of Apollonius have escaped the ravages of time.
                    Of the greater part we have merely the names and general description given by
                    Pappus in his preface to book vii. of the <hi rend="italic">Mathematical
                        Collections.</hi> His treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Conic Sections</hi>
                    gained him the title of The Great Geometer, and is that by which his fame has
                    been transmitted to modem times. It is not, indeed, to be for a moment supposed
                    that Apollonius discovered all, or even the greater part, of the demonstrations
                    which he gives, any more than that Euclid devised the propositions that go by
                    his name. Pappus mentions several treatises on conics known to have existed
                    previously—in particular the five books of Aristaeus “The Ancient” (350 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> on Solid Loci; and there can be little doubt
                    that Apollonius availed himself of these, as well as of the discoveries of
                    Conon, Euclid, Eudoxus, Menechmus, Nicoteles, Thrasidaeus, and others, who had
                    explored the way before him. At this distance of time we cannot distinguish the
                    original from the borrowed propositions; but, though it is certain that he both
                    added to and improved upon the existing theory of conics, the mere embodying in
                    a complete and logical treatise of a number of miscellaneous theorems was in
                    itself a work of great mathematical genius. Eutocius informs us that Apollonius
                    was the first to show that all the three sections may be cut from the same cone,
                    by varying the position of the intersecting plane; for previous authors had
                    supposed the plane of section always perpendicular to the slant side of the
                    cone,—an hypothesis which requires that the three sections be cut from cones of
                    different species, namely, the parabola from a right-angled cone, the ellipse
                    from one with an obtuse, and the hyperbola from one with an acute vertical
                    angle. But Archimedes, as Ubaldus shows in his commentary on the <hi
                        rend="italic">Aequipon-</hi><hi rend="italic">derantes,</hi> had been
                    acquainted with this fact. Pappus ascribes to Apollonius the names by which the
                    three sections are now distinguished; the term <hi rend="italic">Parabola,</hi>
                    however, occurs in the writings of Archimedes. Of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Conicorum Libri</hi><hi rend="italic">Octo</hi> of Apollonius,
                    unfortunately only four have reached us directly through the original Greek.
                    Three more have been preserved in an Arabic version, but the eighth has never
                    been found. Though many attempts had been made to discover the last four books,
                    they continued to be regarded as lost till 1658, when Borelli, the celebrated
                    author of the treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">motu
                        Animalium,</hi> discovered in the Medici library at Florence an Arabic
                    manuscript, entitled <hi rend="italic">Apollonii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Pergcei</hi><hi rend="italic">Conicorum Libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Octo.</hi> With the assistance of Abraham Ecchellensis he translated and
                    published in 1661 the fifth, sixth, and seventh books; but the eighth,
                    notwithstanding the title, was wanting. Some years previously Golius, Oriental
                    professor at Leyden, had returned from the East with an Arabic version of the
                    whole seven books, and had projected the publication of a translation; but it
                    never appeared. A note appended to the MS. of Golius stated that the eighth book
                    had never been translated into Arabic. It was long a favourite problem with
                    geometers to attempt to restore the lost books of Apollonius, that is, to infer
                    from the general nature of their contents, as described by Pappus, the
                    propositions they had contained. Maurolycus, a Sicilian geometer of the 16th
                    century, Viviani, the last favourite pupil of Galileo, Fermat, Halley, Simson,
                    and a number of others, all attempted this with more or less success. Halley,
                    guided by the descriptions of Pappus, and the assertion that his preliminary
                    lemmas to the seventh book really belonged tc the eighth, as well as by the
                    statement of Apollonius himself that the eighth was a continuation of the
                    seventh book, restored this book for the edition issued by the Oxford Press in
                    1710, the only edition of the Greek text that has as yet appeared. The last four
                    books of the conics of Apollonius formed the chief part of the higher geometry
                    of the ancients; and they present some elegant geometrical solutions of
                    problems, which offer considerable difficulty even to the modern analytical
                    method. For example, the fifth book treats of the greatest and least lines that
                    can be <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n201/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0201-0188"/> drawn from given points to the peripheries of
                    conics, and contains the chief properties of normals and radii of curvature.</p>
                <p>The other treatises of Apollonius mentioned by Pappus are—lsi, The Section of
                    Ratio, or Proportional Sections; 2&lt;∕, the Section of Space; 3&lt;7, the
                    Determinate Section · <hi rend="italic">4dh,</hi> the Tangencies; <hi
                        rend="italic">5th,</hi> the Inclinations <hi rend="italic">; 6th,</hi> the
                    Plane Loci. Each of these was divided into two books, and, with the <hi
                        rend="italic">Data</hi> of Euclid and the <hi rend="italic">Porisms,</hi>
                    they formed the eight treatises which, according to Pappus, constituted the body
                    of the ancient analysis.</p>
                <p>Isi, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Dationis Sectione</hi> had for
                    its subject the resolution of the following problem: Given two straight lines
                    and a point in each to draw through a third given point a straight line cutting
                    the two fixed lines, so that the parts intercepted between the given points in
                    them and the points of intersection of this third line, may have a given
                    ratio.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">2d, De</hi><hi rend="italic">Spatii Sectione</hi> discussed the
                    similar problem, which requires that the space contained by the three lines
                    shall be equal to a given rectangle.</p>
                <p>Dr Halley published in 1706 a restoration of these two treatises, founded on the
                    indications of their contents given by Pappus. An Arabic version of the first
                    had previously been found in the Bodleian library at Oxford by Dr Edward
                    Bernard, who began a translation of it, but broke off on account of the extreme
                    inaccuracy of the MS.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3d, De</hi><hi rend="italic">Sectione Determinata</hi> resolved
                    the problem: In a given straight line to find a point, the rectangles or squares
                    of whose distances from given points in the given straight line shall have a
                    given ratio. Several restorations of the solution have been attempted, one by
                    Snellius, another by Alex. Anderson of Aberdeen, in the supplement to his <hi
                        rend="italic">Apollonius</hi><hi rend="italic">Redivivus</hi> (Paris, 1612),
                    but by far the most complete and elegant by Dr Simson of Glasgow.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ath, De</hi><hi rend="italic">Tactionibus</hi> embraced the
                    following general problem: Given three things (points, straight lines, or
                    circles) in position, to describe a circle passing through the given points, and
                    touching the given straight lines or circles. The most difficult case, and the
                    most interesting from its historical associations, is when the three given
                    things are circles. This problem, though now regarded as elementary, was
                    proposed by Vieta in the 16th century to Adrianus Romanus, who gave a very
                    clumsy solution. Vieta thereupon proposed a simpler construction, and restored
                    the whole treatise of Apollonius in a small work, which he entitled <hi
                        rend="italic">Apollonius Gallus</hi> (Paris, 1660.) Both Descartes and
                    Newton have discussed this problem, though they failed to give it that
                    simplicity of character which it has since been shown to possess. A very full
                    and interesting historical account of the problem is given in the preface to a
                    small work of Camerer, entitled <hi rend="italic">Apollonii</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Pergoei que</hi><hi rend="italic">supersunt, ac maxime Lemmata
                        Pappi in hos Libros, cum Observationibus,</hi> &amp;c. (Gothae, 1795,
                    8vo).</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">5 th,</hi><hi rend="italic">De Inclinationibus</hi> had for its
                    object to insert a given straight line, tending towards a given point, between
                    two given (straight or circular) lines. Restorations have been given by Marinus
                    Ghetaldus, by Hugo de Omerique <hi rend="italic">(Geometrical Analysis,</hi>
                    Cadiz, 1698), and elegantly by Dr Horsley (1770).</p>

                        >Plants</hi> is merely a collection of properties of the straight line and
                    circle, and corresponds to the construction of equations of the first and second
                    degrees. It has been successfully restored by Dr Simson.</p>
                <p>The great estimation in which Apollonius was held by the ancients, and the great
                    value attached to his productions, are manifest from the number and celebrity of
                    the commentators who undertook to explain them. Among these we find the names of
                    Pappus, the learned and unfortunate Hypatia, Serenus, Eutocius, Borelli, Halley,
                    Barrow, and others. Various discoveries in other departments of mathematical
                    science were also ascribed to him by the ancients. Pappus says that he made
                    improvements on the modes of representing and multiplying large arithmetical
                    numbers. The invention of the method of projections has been attributed to him;
                    and he has the honour of being the first to found astronomical observations on
                    the principles of geometry.</p>
