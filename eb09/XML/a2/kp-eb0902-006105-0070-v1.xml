                <p><label type="entry">ANNATES</label>. As early as the 6th century it began to be
                    customary for those who were ordained to ecclesiastical offices to pay a fee or
                    tax to the ordaining authorities; and this tax at length amounted to a half or
                    the whole of a year’s income. When, in course of time, the Roman See had
                    appropriated the right of consecration, the money was paid into the Papal
                    treasury, not, according to the defenders of the system, as a remuneration for
                    the benefice conferred, but as a natural contribution to the maintenance of the
                    Pope and his ecclesiastical government. These <hi rend="italic">annates,</hi> or
                    first-fruits, were of different kinds, though the chief features were the same
                    in all. <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> When a bishop, archbishop, or abbot
                    received his investiture, he paid to the Pope a year’s revenue of his new
                    benefice <hi rend="italic">(servitia communia)</hi><hi rend="italic">;
                        Secondly,</hi> If his benefice was one of those “reserved” by the Pope, he
                    handed over to the Papal treasury the annates paid to him by those whom he at
                    any time collated to livings in his diocese <hi rend="italic">(annalia, medii
                        fructus,</hi><hi rend="italic">jus deportuum); Thirdly,</hi> According to a
                    bull of Paul II. in 1469, if benefices were united to certain communities, the
                    annates were only to be paid every fifteen years, and not at every presentation
                        <hi rend="italic">(quindenia)</hi>; and, <hi rend="italic">Fourthly,</hi> A
                    small addition was made to the <hi rend="italic">servitia communia</hi> as a
                    kind of notarial fee <hi rend="italic">(servitia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >minuta).</hi> It must not be supposed that this system ever was worked with
                    absolute uniformity and completeness throughout the various parts of the Papal
                    domain. There were continual disagreements and disputes: the central authorities
                    endeavouring to maintain and extend this most important of their financial
                    schemes, and the subordinate ecclesiastics doing their best to get rid of the
                    impost altogether, or to transmute it into some less objectionable form. The
                    subject frequently became one of national interest, on account of the alarming
                    amount of specie which was thus drained away, and hence numerous enactments
                    exist in regard to it by the various national governments. In England the
                    annates, which had previously been paid for the most part to the archbishop of
                    Canterbury, were claimed by John XXII. (1316— 1334) for three years, and
                    permanently usurped by his successors till the time of Henry VIII., when, in
                    1531, their collection was prohibited. At that time the sum amounted to about
                    £3000 a year. On the completion of the Reformation, the annates were, along with
                    the supremacy, <pb break="no"

                    they were appropriated by Queen Anne to the assistance of the poorer clergy, and
                    thus form what has since been known· as <hi rend="italic">“Queen Λnne</hi><hi
                        rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi><hi rend="italic">s bounty.”</hi> The
                    amount to be paid was originally regulated by a-valuation by the bishop of
                    Norwich in 1254, later by one instituted in 1292, which in turn was superseded
                    by the <hi rend="italic">L·iber Regis</hi> of 1535. In France, in spite of royal
                    edicts,—like those of Charles VI., Charles VIL, Louis XL, and Henry IL,—and even
                    denunciations of the Sorbonne, the custom held its ground till the famous decree
                    of the 4th of August during the Revolution of 1789. In Germany it was decided by
                    the concordat of Constance, in 1418, that bishoprics and abbacies should pay the
                        <hi rend="italic">servitia</hi> according to the valuation of the Roman
                    chancery in two half-yearly instalments. Those benefices only were to pay the
                        <hi rend="italic">annalia</hi> which were rated above 24 gold florins; and
                    as none were so rated, the annalia fell into disuse. The Basle Council
                    (1431-1443) wished to abolish the <hi rend="italic">servitia,</hi> but the
                    concordat of Vienna (1448) confirmed the Constance decision. The Congress of Ems
                    (1786) also declared against them; but they continued to be paid till 1803,
                    when, to indemnify the powers that had sustained territorial loss through the
                    recent wars, a very great amount of ecclesiastical property was secularised. In
                    some parts of Germany, the payment of annates is still made under particular
                    concordats. In Scotland <hi rend="italic">annat</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                        >ann</hi> is half a year’s stipend allowed by the Act 1672, c. 13, to the
                    executors of a minister of the Church of Scotland above what was due to him at
                    the time of his death. This is neither assignable by the clergyman during his
                    life, nor can it be seized by his creditors.</p>
