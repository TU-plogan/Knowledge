                <p><label type="entry">AQUITANIA</label>. This was, in the time of Julius Caesar,
                    the name given to that part of Gallia which lay between the Garumna and the
                    Pyrenees, and was inhabited by a race distinct from the Celtae. According to
                    Bial and Bello-guet, Aquitani is probably a form of Auscetani, a Hispanic
                    lengthening of Ausces (Ausks, Wasks, Basques), and Aquitania would thus be
                    radically identical with Gascony (Wasconia), a word of much later introduction
                    into geographical nomenclature. Though the greater proportion of the Aquitanian
                    tribes made submission to Caesar, it was not till 28 B.c. that the region was
                    fairly brought under the Boman yoke by Μ. Valerius Messala. In keeping with the
                    imperial policy of denationalisation, the term Aquitania was extended, in the
                    division of Gallia under Augustus, to the whole stretch of country south and
                    east of the continuous course of the Loire and the Allier, and thus ceased to be
                    of ethnographical import. In the 3d century after Christ this extended Aquitania
                    was divided into three parts. <hi rend="italic">Aquitania</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Prima</hi> consisted of the eastern portion of the district between the
                    Loire and the Garonne; <hi rend="italic">Aquitania Secunda,</hi> of the western
                    part of the same district; and <hi rend="italic">Aquitania Tertia</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">N^ovempopulania,</hi> of the region between the Pyrenees and
                    the Garonne, or the original Aquitania. Like the rest of Gau], Aquitania
                    absorbed a large measure of Roman civilisation which continued to distinguish
                    the district down to a late period. In the 5th century the Visigoths established
                    themselves in Aquitania Secunda, and in some cantons of Narbonensis Prima and
                    Novempopulania. As their power also included Spain, it was usual to speak of
                    their Gallic possessions as Spain likewise. The Merovingian kings extended their
                    authority nominally to the Pyrenees; but as Guizot has remarked <hi
                        rend="italic">{Essais,</hi> No. ii.) “the conquest of Aquitania by Clovis
                    left it almost as alien to the people and king of the Franks as it had formerly
                    been ’ For a time indeed, about 630, the Aquitanians rallied round Haribert
                    (Charibert), the brother of Dagobert, in hope of national independence, even
                    under a Frankish ruler; but the usual story that their ducal family was
                    descended from him rests on a forgery (z&gt;. Henri Martin, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hist, de France,</hi> vol ii. p. 137). About the end of the 7th century, an
                    adventurer named Eudes or Eudon had made himself master of the region. Attacked
                    by the Saracens, he inflicted on them a crushing defeat but, on their
                    reappearance, was obliged to call in the aid of Charles Martel, who, as the
                    price of his assistance, claimed the homage of his ally. He was succeeded by his
                    son Hunald, who, after carrying on a war against the aggressions of Pepin the
                    Short, retired to a convent, and left the conflict and the kingdom to Guaifer
                    (Waifer). For nine years he strenuously maintained the hopeless strife, till his
                    assassination in 768. With him perished for a time the national independence,
                    but not the national individuality, of the Aquitanians. The kingdom of Aquitania
                    was bestowed by Charlemagne on the infant Louis in 781; and from him it was
                    transmitted to his son Pepin, on whose death the Aquitanians loyally chose Pepin
                    the younger, but were opposed by Louis, who gave the crown to Charles the Bald.
                    Hence ensued a long period of confusion and conflict, which resulted in the
                    comparative success of Charles, who granted the Aquitanians a nominal separation
                    from Neus-tria, and gave them his son Charles, eight years old, to be their
                    nominal king (855)—nominal, not only because he was a child, but because his
                    kingdom was in a state of anarchy through domestic faction and foreign invasion.
                    On his death (866), Louis the Stammerer succeeded to the titular sovereignty.
                    About 886 Guilhem (William) the Pious, count of Auvergne, the founder of the
                    abbey of Cluny, obtained the title of Duke of Aquitania, and transmitted it
                    (918) to Guilhem II. He was followed in succession by Raimond Pons, count of
                    Toulouse (d. 950), Guilhem Tête d'Etoupes, count of Poitiers (d. 963), Guilhem
                    Fier-à-Bras, whose sister was married by Hugh Capet (970), and Guilhem the Great
                    (977-1030), who had hard work to maintain his ground, but at last changed his
                    title into an effective lordship. His duchy almost reached the limits of the I.
                    and II. Aquitania of the Romans, but did not extend south of the Garonne, that
                    district having been ever since the 6th century in the possession of the
                    Gascons. Guilhem refused the empire offered him by the Italians, and died at
                    Maillezais. Meanwhile civilisation and refinement were gradually increasing. The
                    names of Guilhem VI. (d. 1038), Guilhem VII., who joined Gascony and Bordeaux to
                    his duchy, and married his daughter to Henry the Black, and Guilhem VIII. bring
                    us down to Guilhem IX., who succeeded in 1086, and made himself famous as
                    crusader and troubadour. Guilhem X. (d. 1137) married his daughter to Louis VII.
                    of France, and Aquitania went as her dowry. On her divorce from Louis and
                    marriage with Henry II. of England (1152), her possession passed to her new
                    husband, and from that time continued to follow the fortunes of the English
                    territories in France. The name Guienne, the modern corruption of Aquitania,
                    seems to have come into use about the 10th century. An interesting literary
                    relic of the struggle between the Franks and the Gallo-Roman inhabitants of
                    Aquitania exists under the title of <hi rend="italic">Walther d'Aquitaine</hi>
                    (see Fauriel·s <hi rend="italic">Poésie Provençale'),</hi> but the historical
                    value of this work has been questioned.</p>
