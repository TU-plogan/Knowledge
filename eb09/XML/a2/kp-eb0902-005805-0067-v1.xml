                    succeeded his brother Duke Louis III. He was born at Angers in 1408, and brought
                    up by his uncle, Louie of Bar, who, in 1419, contracted a marriage between him
                    and Isabella, heiress of Lorraine, and, in 1430, left him in possession of his
                    duchy. On the death ôf Charle3 of Lorraine in 1431, Bené was acknowledged as his
                    successor, but he had soon to defend himself against the claims of the count of
                    Vandemont, who was supported by Philip of Burgundy. The battle of Bouligneville
                    decided in favour of the count, and Bené was taken prisoner to Dijon by Philip.
                    In 1432, however, he was conditionally released, and in the following year was
                    confirmed in the duchy of Lorraine by the Emperor Sigismund. In 1435, while
                    again, according to the conditions of his release, in the custody of Philip, he
                    became, by the death of his brother, duko of Anjou and count of Maine, and a
                    little later, received the offer of the inheritance of the queen of Naples. His
                    endeavours to enforce his claims on the Neapolitan kingdom were ultimately
                    futile, and he quitted Italy in 1442. Three years afterwards he married his
                    daughter Margaret tα Henry VI. of England, and thus increased the influence, <pb

                    the death of his wife in 1453, he bestowed the duchy of Lorraine on John of
                    Calabria, his only surviving son. He himseif retired to Provence, where
                    henceforth, with but occasional interruption, he led a simple quiet life,
                    amusing himself with the writing of verses and the painting of miniatures, the
                    cultivation of flowers, and the keeping of wild animals. Thus occupied, he
                    exhibited a philosophical submission to the changes brought about by the artful
                    schemes of his less pacific neighbours, until he was at last reduced to an
                    ignoble dependency on the good-will and pleasure of Louis of France, without the
                    liberty of even bequeathing his possessions to any one but the king. He died at
