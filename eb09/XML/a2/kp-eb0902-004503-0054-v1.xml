                <p><label type="entry">ANGOLA</label>, a name that is employed to designate at least
                    three different, although partly coincident, portions of the west coast of
                    Africa. It is often applied to the whole coast-line, from Cape Lopez de
                    Gonsalvo, in lat. 0° 44' S., to St Felipe de Benguela, in 12° 24' S.; the
                    Portuguese consider that the entire country lying between the Zaire or Congo and
                    lat. 18° S., and stretching for a considerable but somewhat indefinite distance
                    into the interior, over which they assert that their authority extends, ought to
                    be called Angola; lastly, the name 13 by most British geographers and travellers
                    applied to that part of the preceding territory which lies between 8° 20' and 9°
                    30' S., and which nearly corresponds to the Portuguese sub-government of Angola.
                    The natives, whose practice seems to harmonise with the third of these
                    applications of the word, also call the country Dongo. With the exception of a
                    flat, sandy, barren plain, that extends from the coast for a considerable
                    distance inland, Angola, using the word in its most restricted sense, is
                    mountainous and well-watered. Its chief rivers are the Coanza, which bounds it
                    on the north, the Danda, which bounds it on the south, and the Benga. Most of
                    the country is very fertile, producing palms, citrons, oranges, lemons, bananas,
                    tamarinds, mangroves, and sugar canes in great abundance. Nor is the fauna less
                    extensive; all the animals common in intertropical Africa are found in Angola,
                    as well as some peculiar to the district; while the sheep, the cow, and the
                    horse have been imported from Europe. Of its mineral productions, lead, sulphur,
                    petroleum, and iron are plentiful; and gold, silver, and copper are said to
                    exist in the interior. Gum, wax, and ivory, are now the most important articles
                    of trade; but formerly the principal traffic was in slaves. The heat is usually
                    moderate, and the climate comparatively mild and salubrious. The religion of the
                    natives of Angola is Fetichism; they believe implicitly in their priests, who
                    pretend to bestow rain, favourable winds, and other blessings upon those who
                    have propitiated them by liberal gifts. In criminal cases much use is made of
                    what our ancestors called “the judgments of God.” The accused is made to swallow
                    poison, to take in his hand burning coals, or to undergo tests of a similar
                    nature, and, unless he escapes unhurt from these trials, is pronounced guilty;
                    of course the priests contrive that those whom they wish to absolve should
                    suffer no harm. The native huts are formed merely of straw or dried leafy
                    plants, intertwisted upon a framework of stakes; containing no aperture for the
                    admission of light, they form not so much dwelling-houses, as dens for sleeping
                    in, while the tenants spend the day and receive company in an open space in
                    front that is covered with a slight roof. The population of Angola is estimated
                    at about 250,000, of whom about 2000 are Europeans. Angola was discovered by the
                    Portuguese under Diego Cam in 1484; and since that time, with the exception of a
                    short period, from 1G4O to 1G48, during which the Dutch attempted to expel them,
                    they have maintained their possession of the country undisturbed by other
                    European powers. It cannot be said, however, that they have done much during
                    this long rule either to develop the resources of the country or to improve the
                    condition of its people; and, while they permitted an active slave trade to be
                    carried on, their influence must have been much more injurious than beneficial.
                    St Paul de Loando, at which the governor resides, is the chief town. They
                    possess a few forts in the interior, but over the greater part of the country
                    their authority is hardly felt.</p>
