                <p><label type="entry">ARMENIAN VERSION</label>. The Armenian version of the Bible
                    was undertaken in the year 410 by Miesrob, with the aid of his pupils Joannes
                    Ecelensis and Josephus Pal· neusis. It appears that the patriarch Isaac first
                    attempted, inconsequence of the Persians having destroyed all the copies of the
                    Greek version, to make a translation from the Peshito; that Miesrob became his
                    coadjutor in this work; and that they actually completed their translation from
                    the Syriac. But when the above-named pupils, who had been sent to the
                    ecclesiastical council at Ephesus returned, they brought with them an accurate
                    copy of the Greek Bible. Upon this Miesrob laid aside his translation from the
                    Peshito, and prepared to commence anew from a more authentic text. Imperfect
                    knowledge of the Greek language, however, induced him to send his pupils to
                        Alexandria<pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit02newyrich/page/n612/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0902-0612-0551"/> to acquire accurate Greek scholarship; and,
                    on their return, the translation was accomplished. Moses of Khorene, the
                    historian of Armenia, who was also employed, as a disciple of Miesrob, on this
                    version, fixes its <hi rend="italic">completion</hi> in the year 410; but he is
                    contradicted by the date of the Council of Ephesus, which necessarily makes it
                    subsequent to the year 431. In the Old Testament this version adheres closely to
                    the LXX., but, in the book of Daniel, it has followed the version of Theodotion.
                    Its most striking characteristic is, that it does not follow any known recension
                    of the LXX. Although it more frequently agrees with the Alexandrine text, in
                    readings which are peculiar to the latter, than it does with the Aldine or
                    Complutensian text, yet, on the other hand, it also has followed readings which
                    are only found in the last two. Bertholdt accounts for this mixed text by
                    assuming that the copy of the Greek Bible sent from Ephesus contained the Lucian
                    recension, that the pupils brought back copies according to the Hesychian
                    recension from Alexandria, and that the translators made the latter their
                    standard, but corrected their version by aid of the former. The version of the
                    New Testament is equally close to the Greek original, and also represents a text
                    made up of Alexandrine and Occidental readings. This version was afterwards
                    revised and adapted to the Peshito, in the 6th century, on the occasion of an
                    ecclesiastical union between the Syrians and Armenians. Again, in the 13th
                    century, an Armenian king, Hethom or Haitho, adapted the Armenian version to the
                    Vulgate, by way of smoothing the way for a union of the Roman and Armenian
                    churches. Lastly, the bishop, Uscan, who printed the first edition of this
                    version at Amsterdam in 1666, is also accused of having interpolated the text,
                    by adding all that he found the Vulgate contained <hi rend="italic">more</hi>
                    than the Armenian version. The existence of the verse 1 John V. 7, in this
                    version, is ascribed to this supplementary labour of Uscan. It is clear from
                    what has been said, that the critical uses of this version are limited to
                    determining the readings of the LXX. and of the Greek text of the New Testament
                    which it represents, and that it has suffered many alterations which diminish
                    its usefulness in these respects.</p>
