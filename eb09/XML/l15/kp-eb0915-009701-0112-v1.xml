                <p><label type="entry">LYCURGUS</label>, one of the ten great Attic orators, was
                    born about 396-93 <hi rend="smallcaps">b,c.</hi> His father was named Lycophron,
                    and he belonged to the old Attic family of the Eteobutadae. He is said to have
                    been a pupil both of Plato and of Isocrates. His early career is quite unknown,
                    but after the real character of the great struggle with Philip of Macedon was
                    becoming manifest he was recognized along with Demosthenes and Hyperides as one
                    of the chiefs of the national party. He left the care of external relations to
                    his colleagues, and devoted himself to the internal organization and the
                    financial administration of the state. He managed the finances of Athens for
                    twelve successive years, being chosen ταμ,iας ττ)ς κοινήν προσόδου, probably, in
                    341 B.c., for a term of four years, and in the two succeeding terms, when the
                    actual office was forbidden him by law, directing it through a nominal official
                    chosen from his party. Part of one of the deeds in which he rendered account of
                    his term of office is still preserved in an inscription <hi rend="italic">(Corp.
                        Inscr. Gr.,</hi> i. No. 247 <hi rend="italic">; Corp. Inscr. Λtt.,</hi> ii.
                    pt. 2, No. 289). During this time 18,900 talents passed through his hands, and
                    he raised the public income to 1200 talents yearly. His integrity and his
                    skilful management were highly appreciated by the people, who refused to deliver
                    him up when Alexander the Great demanded his surrender; many private persons
                    deposited money under his charge. He was also appointed to various other offices
                    connected with the preservation and improvement of the city. He was very strict
                    in his superintendence of the public morals, ajιd passed a sumptuary law to
                    restrain extravagance. On the other hand he showed a noble and liberal spirit in
                    all that concerned public expenditure; he did much to beautify and improve the
                    city by fine buildings; and he passed a famous law ordering that statues of the
                    three great tragedians should be erected, and that a careful edition of their
                    tragedies should be made and preserved among the state archives.</p>
                <p>Lycurgus was a man of action and not of words: his orations, of which fifteen
                    were published, are criticized by the ancients for their awkward arrangement of
                    matter, harshness of style, and the tendency to digressions about mythology and
                    past history, while the noble spirit and the lofty morality that breathe through
                    them are highly praised. Only one of the orations, that against Leocrates, has
                    been preserved, and fully bears out the criticism of the ancients. He was
                    evidently one of the last examples of the finest Athenian type—full of religious
                    feeling, as became one of the Eteobutadae·, the family in which the priestlιood
                    of Athene Polias was hereditary, proud of the history and the religion of his
                    country, and resolved to act worthily of it and to make others do the same,
                    severe and stern in his treatment of offenders and frequently prosecuting them
                    in the public courts, but generous and liberal in all that concerned the glory
                    of Athens.</p>
