                    service of Philip of Macedon, was born about 361 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>
                    During Alexander’s campaigns he was one of his immediate bodyguard; he
                    distinguished himself in India, and was appointed a trierarch when Alexander
                    constructed his fleet on the Hydaspes. After the death of Alexander, Lysimachus
                    was appointed to the government of Thrace and the district about the Chersonese.
                    For a long time the Odrysians under their king Seuthes caused him so much
                    trouble that he could take very little part in the struggles of the rival
                    satraps; but in 316 he joined the alliance which Cassander, Ptolemy, and
                    Seleucus made against Antigonus. In 309 he founded Lysimachia in a commanding
                    situation on the neck connecting the Chersonese with the mainland. He followed
                    the example of Antigonus in taking the title of king. When in 302 the second
                    alliance between Cassander, Ptolemy, and Seleucus was made, Lysimachus,
                    reinforced by troops from Cassander, entered Asia Minor, where he met with
                    little resistance. On the approach of Antigonus he retired into winter quarters
                    near Heraclea, marrying its widowed queen Amastris, a Persian princess. Seleucus
                    joined him in 301, and the decisive battle was fought in the plain of Ipsus;
                    Antigonus was slain, and his dominions divided among the victors, Lysimachus
                    receiving the greater part of Asia Minor. Feeling that Seleucus was becoming
                    dangerously great, he now allied himself with Ptolemy, marrying his <pb

                    Heraclea. During the absence of Antigonus’s son Demetrius in Greece, Lysimachus
                    seized his towns in Asia Minor and rebuilt Ephesus, calling it Arsinoe. He tried
                    to carry his power beyond the Danube, but was defeated and taken prisoner by the
                    Getae, who, however, set him free on amicable terms. After Demetrius had entered
                    Macedon to help Alexander against his brother Antipater, and by murdering the
                    former had gained possession of the whole country, he invaded Thrace, but had to
                    retire in consequence of a rising in Boeotia, and an attack from Pyrrhus of
                    Epirus. In 287 Lysimachus and Pyrrhus invaded Macedon. Demetrius marched against
                    Pyrrhus, thinking the Macedonians would not fight against Lysimachus, one of
                    Alexander’s companions in arms; but his army went over to Pyrrhus, and he was
                    obliged to fly. Lysimachus claimed a share of the kingdom and received it.
                    Demetrius, crossing into Asia Minor, seized Caria and Lydia, but Agathocles, the
                    son of Lysimachus by an Odrysian princess, was sent against him, and forced him
                    to retreat into the territory of Seleucus, who obliged him to surrender.
                    Lysimachus attacked Pyrrhus and Demetrius’s son Antigonus, now his ally, and
                    forced Pyrrhus to give up part of Thessaly and the whole of Macedon. Amastris
                    had been murdered by her two sons, and Lysimachus resolved to avenge her; he got
                    them into his hands on pretence of friendship and put them to death. On his
                    return Arsinoe asked the gift of Heraclea, and he granted her request, though he
                    had promised to free the city. In 284 Arsinoe, desirous of gaining the
                    succession for her sons in preference to Agathocles, intrigued against him with
                    the help of her brother Ptolemy Ceraunus; they accused him of conspiring with
                    Seleucus to seize the throne, and he was put to death. To remove the disquietude
                    of the Egyptian court, Agathocles being the husband of Ptolemy’s daughter
                    Lysandra, Lysimachus married his daughter Arsinoe to the young Ptolemy
                    Philadelphus. The widow of Agathocles fled to Seleucus, and war between the
                    latter and Lysimachus soon followed. In 281 the decisive battle took place at
                    the plain of Corus, the exact situation of which is doubtful; Lysimachus was
                    killed; after some days his body was found on the field watched by a faithful
                    dog.</p>
                <p>Lysimachus was a man of distinguished bravery and great personal strength; on one
                    occasion he had killed a lion single-handed, though at the cost of fearful
                    wounds. He did not rise to political importance till after the battle of Ipsus.
                    Tenacious and insatiate, lie framed schemes of aggrandisement till his death,
                    and in pursuit of the schemes his craft suggested, he was ready to sacrifice
                    even his own family.</p>
