                    superintend buildings of all kinds, but more especially public ones, as temples,
                    aqueducts, bridges, &amp;c. To the aediles likewise belonged the care of the
                    highways, public places, weights and measures, &amp;c. They also superintended
                    the markets, fixed the prices of provisions, took cognisance of breaches of
                    decency and public order, and took charge of police matters generally. The
                    custody of the <hi rend="italic">plebiscita,</hi> or decrees of the people, and
                        <hi rend="italic">senatus consulta,</hi> or decrees of the senate, was
                    likewise committed to them. They had the inspection of theatres and plays, and
                    were obliged to exhibit magnificent games to the people, usually at their own
                    expense, whereby many of them were ruined. They had the power, on certain
                    occasions, of issuing edicts, and by degrees they procured to themselves a
                    considerable jurisdiction. At first there were only two aediles, viz., the
                    aediles of the people, <hi rend="italic">aediles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >plebeii,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">minores.</hi> They were first created in
                    the same year as the tribunes, B.c. 494; for the tribunes, finding themselves
                    oppressed with the multiplicity of affairs, demanded of the senate to have
                    officers to whom they might entrust matters of less importance; and accordingly
                    two aediles were created; and henceforward the aediles were elected every year
                    at the same assembly as the tribunes. But these plebeian aediles having refused,
                    on a signal occasion, to continue the great games for four days instead of
                    three, on account of the expense, the patricians made an offer to do it,
                    provided they were admitted to the honours of the aedileship. Accordingly two
                    new aediles were created, from the order of the patricians, in the year of Rome
                    388. They were called <hi rend="italic">aediles</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >curules,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">majores,</hi> as having a right to sit
                    on a curule chair when they gave audience; whereas the plebeian aediles only sat
                    on benches. The curule aediles alone had the right to issue edicts. Otherwise
                    they shared all the ordinary functions of the plebeian aediles; they had to
                    procure the celebration of the grand Roman games, and to exhibit comedies, shows
                    of gladiators, &amp;c., to the people; and they were also appointed judges in
                    all cases relating to the selling or exchanging of estates. To assist these
                    first four aediles, Caesar <hi rend="smallcaps">(b.c.</hi> 45) created a new
                    kind, called <hi rend="italic">aediles</hi><hi rend="italic">cereales,</hi> so
                    named from their being deputed chiefly to take care of the supply of corn, which
                    was called <hi rend="italic">donum</hi><hi rend="italic">Cereris.</hi> These
                    aediles cereales were also taken out of the order of patricians. In the
                    municipal cities and colonies there were aediles having much the same authority
                    as at Rome. We also read of an <hi rend="italic">aedilis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >alimentarius,</hi> expressed in abbreviature by <hi rend="italic">cedil.
                        alim.,</hi> whose business seems to have been to provide diet for those who
                    were maintained at the public charge, though others assign him a different
                    office. In an ancient inscription we also meet with aedile of the camp, <hi
                        rend="italic">aedilis</hi><hi rend="italic">castrorum.</hi></p>
