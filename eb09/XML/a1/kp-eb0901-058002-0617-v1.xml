                    Academy, was born at Edinburgh in 1782. At an early age he was entered as a
                    pupil in the School of Design established in Edinburgh by the Board of Trustees
                    for Arts and Manufactures, where he had as companions, Wilkie, Burnet the
                    engraver, and others who afterwards distinguished themselves as artists. Here

                    scanty resources, to seek his fortune abroad. He accordingly set out the same
                    year for Russia, but was carried by stress of weather to Memel, where he
                    remained for some time, supporting himself by his pencil. At last, however, he
                    reached St Petersburg, where the kindness of Sir Alexander Crichton, the court
                    physician, and other friends procured him abundant employment. The emoluments of
                    his profession enabled him by and by to make excursions into southern Russia,
                    Turkey, the Crimea, and Circassia, where he filled his portfolio with vivid
                    sketches, of which he made admirable use in his subsequent pictures. In 1814 he
                    returned to Edinburgh, and in the two following years exhibited at the Royal
                    Academy <hi rend="italic">The Circassian Captives</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bashkirs conducting Convicts to Siberia.</hi> The former composition, which
                    united graceful forms and powerful expression with novel and picturesque
                    costumes, established his reputation as a master in the highest walk of art; but
                    the picture remained so long unsold in the studio of the artist, that,
                    thoroughly disheartened, he threatened to retire to Circassia when, through the
                    kindness of Sir Walter Scott, a subscription of 1000 guineas was obtained for
                    the picture, which fell by lot into the possession of the Earl of Wemyss. About
                    the same time the Grand Duke Nicholas, afterwards emperor of Russia, visited
                    Edinburgh, and purchased his <hi rend="italic">Siberian Exiles</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Haslan Gheray crossing the River Kuban,</hi> giving a very
                    favourable turn to the fortunes of the painter, whose pictures were now sought
                    for by collectors. From this time to 1834 we find him pursuing his art in the
                    sphere in which he achieved his greatest success and firmly established his
                    fame, the illustration of Scottish history. His most important works of this
                    class were <hi rend="italic">Archbishop Sharpe on Magus Moor; John Knox
                        admonishing Mary Queen of Scots</hi> (1823), engraved by Burnet; <hi
                        rend="italic">Mary Queen of Scots signing her Abdication</hi> (1824); and
                        <hi rend="italic">Regent Murray shot by Hamilton of Bothwell-haugh.</hi> The
                    last procured his election as an associate of the Royal Academy (1825). Later
                    Scottish subjects were <hi rend="italic">Lord Byron</hi> (1831), portraits of
                    Scott, and <hi rend="italic">The Orphan</hi> (1834), which represented Anne
                    Scott seated near the chair of her deceased father. In 1830 he was compelled, on
                    account of an attack of ophthalmia, to seek a milder climate, and visited Rome,
                    Naples, and Constantinople. He returned with a rich store of materials, of which
                    he made excellent use in his <hi rend="italic">Constantinople Slave Market</hi>
                    and other productions. In 1834 he visited Spain and Morocco, and in 1841 went
                    again to St Petersburg, when he undertook, at the request of the Czar, his <hi
                        rend="italic">Peter the Great teaching his Subjects the Art of
                        Shipbuilding,</hi> exhibited in London in 1845, and now in the Winter Palace
                    of St Petersburg. His <hi rend="italic">Polish Exiles</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Moorish Love-letter,</hi> &amp;c., had secured his election as a Royal
                    Academician in 1835; he was appointed president of the Royal Scottish Academy
                    (1838), and limner to Her Majesty for Scotland, after Wilkie’s death (1841); and
                    in 1842 received the honour of knighthood. His later years were occupied with
                    battle-pieces, the last he finished being the second of his two companion
                    pictures of the <hi rend="italic">Battle of Waterloo.</hi> He died on the 22d
                    February 1850, leaving a large picture unfinished— <hi rend="italic">Bruce at
                        Bannockburn—</hi> which exhibits no traces of impaired power.</p>
