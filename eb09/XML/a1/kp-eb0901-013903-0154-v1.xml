                <p><label type="entry">ADAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, architect,
                    the second son of William Adam of Maryburgh, in Fife, was born in 1728. He
                    studied at the University of Edinburgh, and probably received his first
                    instruction in architecture from his father, who, whether a professional
                    architect or not, gave proofs of his skill and taste in the designs of Hopetoun
                    House and the Edinburgh Royal Infirmary. In 1754 young Adam visited the
                    Continent, and spent three years in Italy for the purpose of examining the ruins
                    of Roman architecture. The magnificence of the public baths erected at Rome in
                    the time of Diocletian having impressed him with the idea that there had been a
                    marked revival of architectural art during that emperor’s reign, he resolved to
                    visit the ruins of the private palace Diocletian had erected at Spalatro in
                    Dalmatia. In company with Clerisseau, a French architect, he sailed from Venice
                    in July 1754, and in a few weeks, with the help of two experienced draughtsmen,
                    had completed plans and views of the fragments, from which he was afterwards
                    able to execute a design of the entire building. The results were published in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Ruins of the Palace of Diocletian,</hi> &amp;c. (1764).
                    After his return to England he rose to the highest eminence in his profession,
                    and was appointed architect to the king in 1762. Six years later he entered
                    Parliament as representative of the county of Kinross, but he still continued to
                    devote himself to the duties of his profession, resigning only his court
                    appointment. In 1773-78 he and his brother James, also an architect of
                    considerable note, published from time to time large folio engravings with
                    letterpress description of their designs, the most important being,—Lord
                    Mansfield’s house at Caenwood; Luton House, Bedfordshire; the Register House,
                    Edinburgh, &amp;c. Among their later works may be mentioned the buildings

                    Place, London; and the Infirmary of Glasgow. The leading characteristics of all
                    these designs are lightness and elegance; and, though grave faults may be found

                    of the streets of London, owes very much to Robert Adam. He continued actively
                    engaged in his profession until his death in 1792. James, his brother and
                    associate in labour, died in 1794.</p>
