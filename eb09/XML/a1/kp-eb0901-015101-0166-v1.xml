                <p><label type="entry">ADELAIDE</label>, the capital of the British colony of South
                    Australia and of the county of the same name, situated on the Torrens, seven
                    miles from Port Adelaide, with which it is connected by railway. The river,
                    which is spanned at this point by several bridges, divides the city into two
                    parts —North Adelaide, the smaller of the two, but containing the chief private
                    houses, occupying a gentle slope on the right bank; and South Adelaide, the
                    commercial centre of the town, lying on a very level plain on the left. The
                    streets of Adelaide are broad, and regularly laid out. Among its public
                    buildings are the Government offices and the governor’s house, the post office,
                    the jail, five banks, the railway station, and a theatre. It is the seat of a
                    Protestant Episcopal and also of a Roman Catholic bishop, and contains places of
                    worship belonging to these bodies, as well as to the Presbyterians, the
                    Methodists, the Unitarians, the Baptists, and other denominations. Adelaide
                    possesses a botanical garden, and is surrounded by extensive public grounds,
                    known as the “Park Lands,” containing over 1900 acres. It is lighted with gas,
                    and is supplied with water from a reservoir some miles up the Torrens. The
                    corporation consists of a mayor and eight councillors, two from each of the four
                    wards; and there are also two auditors, a town clerk, and other officials. The
                    chief manufactures are woollen, starch, soap, beer, flour, leather, earthenware,
                    and iron goods. There is a good retail trade in European produce; and in the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Port Adelaide</hi> is situated in a low marshy position, on
                    a small inlet of the Gulf of St Vincent. Its harbour is safe and commodious; but
                    a bar at the mouth, where the depth of water varies with the tide from 8 to 16
                    feet, prevents large vessels from entering. It is a free port, and has good
                    wharfs and warehouse accommodation. In 1867, 364 vessels of 119,654 tons arrived
                    at, and 376 of 125,559 tons departed from, Port Adelaide. The chief imports were
                    drapery, iron goods and machinery, beer, wine, spirits, and paper; and the
                    exports, grain, copper and lead ores, wool, tallow, and other native products.
