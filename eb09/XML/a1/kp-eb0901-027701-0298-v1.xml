                <p><label type="entry">AGATE</label> (from <hi rend="italic">Achates,</hi> a river
                    in Sicily, on the banks of which it is said to have been found), a name applied
                    by mineralogists to a stone of the quartz family, generally occurring in rounded
                    nodules or in veins in trap rocks. The number of agate balls in the rock often
                    give it the character of amygdaloid; and when such a rock is decomposed by the
                    elements, the agates drop out, and are found in the beds of streams that descend
                    from it; or they may be obtained in quarrying. Great quantities are obtained
                    from Oberstein and Idar, in Germany, where there are large manufactories for
                    colouring and polishing the stones; and many are brought from India and Brazil.
                    Agate occurs in considerable quantity in Scotland, whence the stone is
                    familiarly known to lapidaries as <hi rend="italic">Scotch pebble;</hi> and very
                    large masses of calcedony, a variety of it, are brought from Iceland, the Faroe
                    Islands, and Brazil. Agate chiefly consists of calcedony, with mixtures of
                    common quartz and occasional patches of jasper and opal. The colour markings are
                    often in concentric rings of varying forms and intensity, or in straight
                    parallel layers or bands. The colours are chiefly gray, white, yellow, or
                    brownish-red. The composition of agate is not uniform; but it usually contains
                    from 70 to 96 per cent. of silica, with varying proportions of alumina, coloured
                    by oxide of iron or manganese. The principal varieties are—</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Calcedony.</hi> In this the colours are in parallel bands.
                    The porosity of this stone, and the presence of iron in it, have given rise to a
                    beautiful artificial process for heightening its natural colours, which has been
                    long practised at Oberstein, and probably long known in India. The stones best
                    suited for this purpose are such as when recently fractured imbibe moisture most
                    readily. The stones are first dried without heat, then immersed in a mixture of
                    honey and water, and afterwards placed in a heated oven, where they remain for
                    two or three weeks, constantly covered with the liquid. They are then washed,
                    dried, and put into an earthenware vessel containing sufficient sulphuric acid
                    to cover them; this vessel is closed and placed in the oven for a space varying
                    from one to twelve hours, according to the hardness of the stone. The agates are
                    now removed, washed, and thoroughly dried; and after being kept in oil for
                    twenty-four hours, are cleaned, cut, and polished. In the best specimens the
                    gray streaks are increased in intensity; some exhibit brown streaks approaching
                    to black, while white impenetrable parts assume a brighter hue by the contrast.
                    This is the process employed to convert the veined calcedony or agate into <hi
                        rend="italic">onyx,</hi> especially for the production of <hi rend="italic"
                        >cameos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">intaglios,</hi> in imitation of the
                    antique sculptured gems, of which admirable specimens are found in the cabinets
                    of the curious, and especially in the Florentine Museum. In those minute but
                    exquisite works the ancient Greeks especially excelled; and remarkable specimens
                    of the art have been found in the tombs of Egypt, Assyria, and Etruria. In such
                    works the figures, whether in relief or intaglio, appear of a different colour
                    from the ground.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Carnelian,</hi> or red calcedony, when found, is almost
                    always brownish or muddy. The following process is employed at Oberstein to
                    convert both this sort and the yellowish-brown varieties into a rich red, so as
                    to rival the Indian carnelian, which probably also has its colour heightened
                    artificially :—After being thoroughly dried, the <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0299-0278"/> stones are dipped in sulphuric acid, and
                    immediately exposed in a covered earthenware crucible to a red heat: the whole
                    is allowed to cool slowly, and when cold the stones are removed and washed.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Mocha stones,</hi> originally brought from the East, are
                    clear grayish calcedonies, with clouds and dashes of rich brown of various
                    shades. They probably owe their colour chiefly to art.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Moss agates</hi> are such as contain arborisations or <hi
                        rend="italic">dendrites</hi> of oxide of iron, some of which seem to be
                    petrifactions of real vegetable forms.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Bloodstone</hi> is a dark-green agate containing bright red
                    spots like blood-drops.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">Plasma,</hi> a grass-green stone, found engraved in ruins at
                    Rome, on the Schwartzwald, and on Mount Olympus, appears to be calcedony
                    coloured by chlorite.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">Chrysoprase,</hi> found in Silesia, is an agate coloured
                    apple-green by oxide of nickel.</p>
                <p>The agate can be cut or sawed easily, and is used for making cups, rings, seals,
                    handles for knives and forks, sword-hilts, rosary beads, and a great variety of
                    trinkets. Many stones of this kind are marked with representations of men,
                    animals, or inanimate natural objects; but there can be no question that a very
                    large proportion of these are to be regarded as productions of art.</p>
