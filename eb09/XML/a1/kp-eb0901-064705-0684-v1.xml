                    and politics; and he was engaged with distinction at the battle of Pavia while
                    still a youth. Selected for a military command by Charles V., he took part in
                    the siege of Tunis (1535), and successfully defended Perpignan against the
                    Dauphin of France. He was present at the battle of Mühlberg (1547), and the
                    victory gained there over John of Saxony was due mainly to his exertions. He
                    took part in the subsequent siege of Wittenberg, and presided at the
                    court-martial which tried the Elector and condemned him to death. In 1552 Alva
                    was intrusted with the command of the army intended to invade France, and was
                    engaged for several months in an unsuccessful siege of Metz. In consequence of
                    the success of the French arms in Piedmont, he was made commander-in-chief of
                    all the emperor’s forces in Italy, and at the same time invested with unlimited
                    power. Success did not, however, attend his first attempts, and after several
                    unfortunate attacks he was obliged to retire into winter quarters. After the
                    abdication of Charles he was continued in the command by Philip II., who,
                    however, restrained him from extreme measures. Alva had subdued the whole
                    Campagna, and was at the gates of Rome, when he was compelled by Philip’s orders
                    to negotiate a peace. One of its terms was, that the Duke of Alva should in
                    person ask forgiveness of the haughty pontiff whom he had conquered. Proud as
                    the duke was by nature, and accustomed to treat with persons of the highest
                    dignity, yet such was the superstitious veneration then entertained for the
                    papal character that he confessed his voice failed him at the interview, and his
                    presence of mind forsook him. Not long after this (1559) he was sent at the head
                    of a splendid embassy to Paris, to espouse, in the name of his master,
                    Elizabeth, daughter of Henry, king of France. In 1567, Philip, who was a bigoted
                    Catholic, sent Alva into the Netherlands at the head of an army of 10,000 men,
                    with unlimited powers for the extirpation of heretics. When he arrived he soon
                    showed how much he merited the confidence which his master reposed in him, and
                    instantly erected a tribunal which soon became known to its victims as the
                    “Court of Blood,” to try all persons who had been engaged in the late commotions
                    which the civil and religious tyranny of Philip had excited. He imprisoned the
                    counts D’Egmont and Horn, the two popular leaders of the Protestants, brought
                    them to an unjust trial, and condemned them to death. In a short time he totally
                    annihilated every privilege of the people, and, with unrelenting cruelty, put
                    multitudes of them to death. The executioner was employed in removing all those
                    friends of freedom whom the sword had spared. In most of the considerable towns
                    Alva built citadels. In the city of Antwerp he erected a statue of himself,
                    which was a monument no less of his vanity than of his tyranny: he was figured
                    trampling on the necks of two smaller statues, representing the two estates of
                    the Low Countries. By his unusual and arbitrary demand of new supplies from the
                    states he greatly aggravated this insult. The exiles from the Low Countries,
                    roused to action by his oppression, fitted out a fleet of privateers, and after
                    strengthening themselves by successful depredations, ventured upon the bold
                    exploit of seizing the town of Breil. Thus Alva, by his cruelty, became the
                    unwitting instrument of the future independence of the seven Dutch provinces.
                    The fleet of the exiles having met the Spanish fleet, totally defeated it, and
                    reduced North Holland and Mons. Many cities hastened to throw off the yoke;
                    while the States-General, assembling at Dordrecht, openly declared against
                    Alva’s government, and marshalled under the banners of the Prince of Orange.
                    Alva’s preparations to oppose the gathering storm were made with his usual
                    vigour, and he succeeded in recovering Mons, Mechlin, and Zutphen, under the
                    conduct of his son Frederick. With the exception of Zealand and Holland, he
                    regained all the provinces; and at last his son stormed Waerdan, and massacring
                    its inhabitants, proceeded to invest the city of Haarlem, which, after standing
                    an obstinate siege, was taken and pillaged. Their next attack was upon Alkmaar;
                    but the spirit of desperate resistance was raised to such a height in the
                    breasts of the Hollanders that the Spanish veterans were repulsed with great
                    loss, and Frederick constrained reluctantly to retire. Alva’s feeble state of
                    health and continued disasters induced him to solicit his recall from the
                    government of the Low Countries; a measure which, in all probability, was not
                    displeasing to Philip, who was now resolved to make trial of a milder
                    administration. In December 1573 the much oppressed country was relieved from
                    the presence of the Duke of Alva, who, returning home accompanied by his son,
                    made the infamous boast that during the course of six years, besides the
                    multitudes destroyed in battle and massacred after victory, he had consigned
                    18,000 persons to the executioner. (For further details of his administration in
                    the Netherlands, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Holland.)</hi></p>
                <p>On his return he was treated for some time with great distinction by Philip. A
                    tardy and imperfect justice, however, overtook him, when he was banished from
                    court and confined in the castle of Uzeda for complicity in certain disgraceful
                    conduct of his son. Here he had remained two years, when the success of Don
                    Antonio in assuming the crown of Portugal determined Philip to turn his eyes
                    towards Alva as the person in whose fidelity and abilities he could most
                    confide. A secretary was instantly despatched to Alva to ascertain whether his
                    health was sufficiently vigorous to enable him to undertake the command of an
                    army. The aged chief returned an answer full of loyal zeal, and was immediately
                    appointed to the supreme command in Portugal. It is a striking fact, however,
                    that the liberation and elevation of Alva were not followed by forgiveness. In
                    1581 Alva entered Portugal, defeated Antonio, drove him from the kingdom, and
                    soon reduced the whole under the subjection of Philip. Entering Lisbon, he
                    seized an immense treasure, and suffered his soldiers, with their accustomed
                    violence and rapacity, to sack the suburbs and vicinity. It is reported that
                    Alva, being requested to give an account of the money expended on that occasion,
                    sternly replied, “If the king asks me for an account, I will make him a
                    statement of kingdoms preserved or conquered, of signal victories, of successful
                    sieges, and of sixty years’ service.” Philip deemed it proper to make no further
                    inquiries. Alva, however, did not enjoy the honours and rewards of his last
                    expedition, for he died in January 1583, at the age of 74.</p>
