                    Protestant dissenting divine of Ireland, was born at Coleraine, county
                    Londonderry, Ulster, where his father was minister (Nonconformist), on the 19th
                    October 1680. In his thirteenth year he entered a student at the University of
                    Glasgow. On concluding his course at Glasgow he went to Edinburgh University,
                    where his many brilliant gifts and quick and ready wit— thought-born, not verbal
                    merely—struck the most eminent of his contemporaries and even his professors.
                    Returning home, he received licence to preach from his Presbytery before ho was
                    twenty-one. In 1701 he was urgently invited to accept the ministerial charge of
                    an important congregation in Antrim; and after an interval of two years, he was
                    ordained there on 8th August 1703. His admiring biographer tells of an amount
                    and kind of work done there, such as only a man of fecund brain, of large heart,
                    of healthful frame, and of resolute will, could have achieved. In 1717 he was
                    invited to the congregation of Usher’s Quay, Dublin, as colleague with Rev. Mr
                    Arbuckle, and contemporaneously, to what was called the Old Congregation of
                    Belfast. The Synod assigned him to Dublin. He refused to accede, and remained at
                    Antrim. This refusal was regarded then as ecclesiastical high-treason; and a
                    controversy of the most intense and disproportionate character followed. The
                    controversy and quarrel bears the name of the two camps in the conflict, the
                    “Subscribers” and the “Non-subscribers.” Out-and-out evangelical as John
                    Abernethy was, there can be no question that he and his associates sowed the
                    seeds of that after-struggle in which, under the leadership of Dr Henry Cooke,
                    the Arian and Socinian elements of the Irish Presbyterian Church were thrown
                    out. Much of what he contended for, and which the “Subscribers” opposed
                    bitterly, has been silently granted in the lapse of time. In 1726 the
                    “Non-subscribers,” spite of an almost wofully pathetic pleading against
                    separation by Abernethy, were cut off, with due ban and solemnity, from the
                    Irish Presbyterian Church. In 1730, spite of being a “Non-subscriber,” he was
                    called by his early friends of Wood Street, Dublin, whither he removed. In 1731
                    came on the greatest controversy in which Abernethy engaged, viz., in relation
                    to the Test Act nominally, but practically on the entire question of tests and
                    disabilities. His stand was “against all laws that, upon account of mere
                    differences of religious opinions and forms of worship, excluded men of
                    integrity and ability from serving their country." He was nearly a century in
                    advance of his century. He had to reason with those who denied that a Roman
                    Catholic or Dissenter could be a “man of integrity and ability.” His <hi

                    generations later. And so John Abernethy through life was ever foremost where
                    unpopular truth and right were to be maintained; nor did he, for sake of an
                    ignoble expediency, spare to smite the highest-seated wrongdoers any more than
                    the hoariest errors (as he believed). He died in 1740, having been twice
                    married. (Kippis' <hi rend="italic">Biog. Brit.,</hi> s. v.; Dr Duchal's <hi
