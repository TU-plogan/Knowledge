                    Italian lady preeminently distinguished for her scientific attainments, was born
                    at Milan on the 16th of May 1718, her father being professor of mathematics in
                    the university of Bologna. When only nine years old, she had such command of
                    Latin as to be able to publish an elaborate address in that language,
                    maintaining that the pursuit of liberal studies was not improper for her sex. By
                    her thirteenth year she had acquired Greek, Hebrew, French, Spanish, German, and
                    other languages. She was in consequence generally known as “the Walking
                    Polyglot.” Two years later her father began to assemble in his house at stated
                    intervals a circle of the most learned men in Bologna, before <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n305/mode/1up"

                    theses on the most abstruse philosophical questions. President De Brosses has
                    given an interesting account of one of those meetings, at which he was present,
                    in his <hi rend="italic">Lettres</hi><hi rend="italic">sur l'Italie</hi> (tom.
                    i. p. 243); and a permanent record of Agnesi’s share in them has been preserved
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Propositiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Philosophicoe,</hi>
                    which her father caused to be published in 1738. These displays, being probably
                    not altogether congenial to Maria, who was of a retiring disposition, ceased in
                    her twentieth year, and it is even said that she had at that age a strong desire
                    to enter a convent. Though the wish was not gratified, she lived from that time
                    in a retirement almost conventual, avoiding all society, and devoting herself
                    entirely to the study of mathematics. The most valuable result of her labours
                    was the <hi rend="italic">Instituzioni Analitiche ad Uso della Gioventu
                        Italiana,</hi> which was published at Milan in 1748. The first volume treats
                    of the analysis of finite quantities, and the second of the analysis of
                    infinitesimals. A French translation of the second -volume, by D’Antelmy, with
                    additions by Bossut, appeared at Paris in 1775; and an English translation of
                    the whole work by Colson, the Lucasian professor of mathematics at •Cambridge,
                    was published after his death at the expense of Baron Masères. The great merit
                    of the work was 'Universally recognised at the time of its publication; and
                    though in the long interval that elapsed before the English translation appeared
                    the methods of analysis had been greatly improved, it was recognised by a writer
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> (1803) as still the best
                    introduction to the works of Euler and other mathematicians of the continent.
                    Madame Agnesi also wrote a commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Conic
                        Sections</hi> of the Marquis de l’Hôpital, which, though highly praised by
                    those who saw it in manuscript, was never published. In 1750, on the illness of
                    her father, she was appointed by Pope Benedict XIV. to occupy the -chair of
                    mathematics and natural philosophy at Bologna. After the death of her father, in
                    1752, she carried out a long-cherished purpose by giving herself to the study of
                    theology, and especially of the fathers. Another purpose, which seems also to
                    have been long cherished, was now also fulfilled. After holding for some years
                    the office of directress of the Hospice Trivulzio for Blue Nuns at Milan, she
                    herself joined the sisterhood, and in this austere order •ended her days
                    (1799).</p>
