                    Protestant reformer of the 16th century, was bom, Dec. 3, 1483, at
                    Gross-Zschopa, near Wurzen, on the Mulde. He was educated at Leipsic, and then
                    at Wittenberg, where ho was one of the first who matriculated (1502) in the
                    recently-founded university. He soon obtained various academical honours, and
                    became <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit01newyrich/page/n822/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0901-0822-0779"/> professor of theology in 1511. He joined
                    Luther at the very beginning of his great struggle (1517); continued all along
                    one of his most admiring and determined supporters; was with him at the Leipsic
                    conference (1519), and the Diet of Worms (1521); and was in the secret of his
                    Wartburg seclusion. He assisted the first efforts of the Reformation at
                    Magdeburg (1524), at Goslar (1531), and at Einbeck (1534); took an active part
                    in the debates at Schmalkald (1537), where he defended the use of the sacrament
                    by the unbelieving; and (1539) spoke out strongly against the bigamy of the
                    Elector of Hesse. After the death of the Count Palatine, bishop of
                    Naumburg-Zeiz, he was installed there (Jan. 20, 1542), though in opposition to
                    the chapter, by the elector of Saxony and Luther. His position was a painful
                    one, and he longed to get back to Magdeburg, but was persuaded by Luther to
                    stay. After Luther’s death (1546) and the battle of Mühlberg (1547) he had to
                    yield to his rival Pfiug, and retire to the protection of the young duke of
                    Weimar. Here he took part in founding Jena university (1548); opposed the
                    “Augsburg Interim” (1548); superintended the publication of the Jena edition of
                    Luther’s works ;- and debated on the freedom of the will, original sin, and,
                    more noticeably, on the Christian value of good works, in regard to which he
                    held that they were not only useless, but prejudicial. He urged the separation
                    of the High Lutheran party from Melanchthon (1557), got the Saxon dukes to
                    oppose the Frankfurt Recess (1558), and continued to fight for the purity of
                    Lutheran doctrine. He died at Eisenach, May 14,1565, and was buried in the high
                    church there, where his effigy shows a well-knit frame and sharpcut features. He
                    was a man of strong will, of great aptitude for controversy, and considerable
                    learning, and thus exercised a decided influence on the Reformation. Many
                    letters and other short productions of his pen are extant in MS., especially
                    five thick volumes of <hi rend="italic">Amsdorfiana,</hi> in the Weimar library.
                    A small sect, which adopted his opinion on good works, was called after him; but
                    it is now of mere historical interest.</p>
