                    founder of the reigning dynasty in Burmah, was born in 1711 at Monchaboo, a
                    small village 50 miles north-west of Ava. Of humble origin, he had risen to be
                    chief of his native village when the invasion of Birmah by the king of Pegu in
                    1752 gave him the opportunity of attaining to the highest distinction. The whole
                    country had tamely submitted to the invader, and the leading chiefs had taken
                    the oaths of allegiance. Alompra, however, with a more independent spirit, not
                    only contrived to regain possession of his village, but was able to defeat a
                    body of Peguan troops that had been sent to punish him. Upon this the Birmese,
                    to the number of a thousand, rallied to his standard, and marched with him upon
                    Ava, which was recovered from the invaders before the close of 1753. For several
                    years he prosecuted the war with uniform success. In 1754 the Peguans, to avenge
                    themselves for a severe defeat at Keoum-nuoum, slew the king of Birmah, who was
                    their prisoner. The son of the latter claimed the throne, and was supported by
                    the tribe of Quois; but Alompra resisted, being determined to maintain his own
                    supremacy. In 1755 Alompra founded the city of Rangoon. In 1757 he had
                    established his position as one of the most powerful monarchs of the East by the
                    invasion and conquest of Pegu. Ere a year elapsed the Peguans revolted; but
                    Alompra, with his usual promptitude, at once quelled the insurrection. The
                    Europeans were suspected of having instigated the rising, and the massacre of
                    the English at Negrais in October 1759 is supposed to have been approved by
                    Alompra after the event, though there is no evidence that he ordered it. Against
                    the Siamese, who were also suspected of having abetted the Peguan rebels, he
                    proceeded more openly and severely. Entering their territory, he was just about
                    to invest the capital when he was seized with an illness which proved fatal on
                    the 15th May 1760. Alompra is certainly one of the most remarkable figures in
                    modern Oriental history. To undoubted military genius he added considerable
                    political sagacity, and he deserves particular credit for his efforts to improve
