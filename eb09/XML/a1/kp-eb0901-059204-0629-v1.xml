                    the first viceroy of Portuguese India, was born at Lisbon about the middle of
                    the 15th century. He was the seventh son of the second Count of Abrantes, and
                    thus belonged to one of the most distinguished families in Portugal. In his
                    youth he took part under Ferdinand of Aragon in the wars against the Moors
                    (1485-92). In March 1505, having received from Emmanuel I. the appointment of
                    viceroy of the newly-conquered territory in India, he set sail from Lisbon in
                    command of a large and powerful fleet, and arrived in July at Quiloa, which
                    yielded to him almost without a straggle. A much more vigorous resistance was
                    offered by the Moors of Mombaza, but the town was taken and destroyed, and its
                    large treasures went to strengthen the resources of Almeida. At other places on
                    his way, such as the island of Angediva, near Goa, and Cananore, he built forts,
                    and adopted measures to secure the Portuguese supremacy. On his arrival in India
                    he took up his residence at Cochin, where a Portuguese fort had been built by
                    Albuquerque in 1503. The most important events of Almeida’s brief but vigorous
                    administration were the conclusion of a commercial treaty with Malacca, and the
                    discoveries made by his son Lorenzo, who acted as his lieutenant. The latter was
                    probably the first Portuguese who visited Ceylon, where he established a
                    settlement, and is also celebrated as the discoverer of Madagascar and the
                    Maldive islands. In 1508 he was killed at Dabul in a naval engagement with the
                    Moors. His father was preparing signally to avenge his death when Albuquerque
                    arrived in Cochin, and presented a commission empowering him to supersede
                    Almeida in the government. It was probably Almeida’s unwillingness to be
                    thwarted in his scheme of vengeance that chiefly induced him to refuse to
                    recognise Albuquerque’s commission, and to cast him into prison. (See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Albuquerque.)</hi> The punishment he inflicted on the Moors
                    was speedy and terrible. Sailing along the coast, he pillaged and burned various

                    fleet off Diu early in 1509, he completely destroyed it. Returning immediately
