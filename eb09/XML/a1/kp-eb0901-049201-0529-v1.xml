                        >Saint</hi></label>, Grand Duke of Wladimir, second son of the Grand Duke
                    Jaroslaw II., was born at Wladimir in 1219, and died 14th November 1263. He
                    became prince of Novgorod on the resignation of his father in 1239, his elder
                    brother having died. While Batu Khan was sweeping with his Tatars over the
                    south, the Swedes, Danes, and Livonian knights took advantage of this to oppress
                    the north of Russia; Alexander accordingly directed his arms against them, and
                    gained a brilliant victory with his small army on the 15th July 1240. His
                    surname of <hi rend="italic">Nevski</hi> was derived from this event, which took
                    place near the Neva, and in the vicinity of the modern St Petersburg. In a
                    second campaign in 1241 he was no less successful, and drove his enemies out of
                    Pleskow in Kiew. In a third campaign he defeated them near lake Peipus (1242),
                    and forced the Livonian knights to sue for peace and retire from the district of
                    Pskow, which they had conquered a short time before. On his father’s death in
                    1247, a younger brother (Andrew) opposed Alexander, and seized the duchy of
                    Wladimir; but in 1251 the latter was established in his rights by the khan of
                    Kaptchak, the district which the Mongolian Batu had taken under his immediate
                    authority. He firmly opposed the proposal of Pope Innocent IV. to unite the
                    Greek with the Roman church. He died at Gorodetz, 14th November 1263, on his
                    return from a visit to Kassimcow. Towards the close of his life he is said to
                    have taken holy orders, but the tradition rests on no sure basis. At his death
                    the people universally spoke of him as their father and protector, and
                    afterwards recorded his deeds in their songs, and honoured him as a saint. Peter
                    the Great, when founding St Petersburg, erected a magnificent monastery to the
                    east of the city in honour of the victory won there by his great predecessor,
                    and created in 1722 one of the eight Russian orders, that of Alexander Nevski.
                    The monastery is now one of the wealthiest in Russia, and has, according to
                    Eckhardt, a yearly revenue of half a million silver roubles.</p>
