                            Amherst)</hi></label>, born in 1773, was the nephew of Jeffery Amherst,
                    who, for his services in America, where he was commander-in-chief at the time of
                    the conquest of Canada, was raised to tha peerage as Baron Amherst in 1776. The
                    patent of nobility was renewed in 1788 with remainder to the subject of this
                    notice, who succeeded to the title in 1797. In 1816 he was sent as ambassador
                    extraordinary to the court of China, with the view of establishing more
                    satisfactory commercial relations between that country and Great Britain. On
                    arriving in the Peiho, he was given to understand that he could only be admitted
                    to the emperor’s presence on condition of performing the <hi rend="italic"
                        >ko-tou,</hi> a ceremony which Western nations have always considered
                    degrading, and which is,, indeed, a homage exacted by the Chinese sovereign from
                    his tributaries. This Lord Amherst, following the advice of Sir George T.
                    Staunton, who accompanied him as second, commissioner, refused to consent to, as
                    Lord Macartney had done in 1793, unless the admission was made that his
                    sovereign was entitled to the same show of reverence from-a mandarin of his
                    rank. In consequence of this he was not allowed to enter Peking, and the object
                    of his mission was frustrated. His ship, the “Alceste,” after a cruise along the
                    coast of Corea and to the Loo-Choo Islands, on proceeding homewards was totally
                    wrecked on a sunken rock in Gaspar Strait. Lord Amherst and part of his
                    shipwrecked companions escaped in the ship’s boats to Batavia, whence relief was
                    sent to the rest. The ship in which he returned to England in 1817 having
                    touched at St Helena, he had several interviews with the Emperor Napoleon
                    (Ellis’s <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Late Embassy to China,</hi> 1817;

                    of Aracan and Tenasserim to Great Britain. He was created Earl Amherst of Aracan
