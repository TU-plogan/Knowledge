                <p><label type="entry">UTRECHT</label>, capital of the above province, 22 miles by
                    rail south-south-east from Amsterdam, 38 north-east from Rotterdam, and 35
                    nearly west from Arnheim, is situated at the point where the Kromme Rijn
                    bifurcates into the Vecht and the Oude Rijn. The town is traversed by two canals
                    or arms of the river, which are crossed by numerous bridges; it is surrounded by
                    strong forts and strategically covers Amsterdam, though its old ramparts were
                    demolished in 1830 and have given place to shady promenades. The streets are
                    more regular, the squares more spacious, and the canals fewer than in most Dutch
                    towns. Of its twenty churches the most important is the old cathedral of St
                    Martin, a large Gothic building erected in 1254-67, on the site of the original
                    structure founded by <pb break="no"

                    Bishop Adelbold about 1015. Only the choir, transept, and western tower (338
                    feet) now remain, the nave having been blown down by a violent hurricane (1st
                    August 1674); the interior (30 feet wide and 115 feet in height) has been
                    clumsily fitted up with pews and galleries for Protestant worship, so that the
                    effect of its eighteen slender columns is almost entirely lost. On the south
                    side are fine Gothic cloisters, adjoining which are the plain buildings of the
                    university, founded in 1634 (with 41 professors and nearly 600 students);
                    connected with the university are a valuable library (150,000 volumes), a museum
                    of natural history, physical and chemical laboratories, a botanic garden, and an
                    observatory. The town-hall (built in 1830) and the Museum Kunstliefde have small
                    collections of pictures and other objects of art, and the archiepiscopal museum,
                    opened in 1872, also contains excellent examples of the sacred art of the
                    Netherlands. Among other buildings of interest may be mentioned the royal mint,
                    and the Paushuizen (“pope’s house”), built by Adrian Floriszoon Boeyens,
                    afterwards</p>
                <p>Pope Adrian VI., a native of Utrecht, in 1517. Utrecht has excellent schools and
                    several literary and scientific societies, besides barracks, a large military
                    hospital, and a veterinary school. The most important industrial establishments
                    are cigar-factories, manufactories of chemicals and earthenware, and
                    brass-foundries. There is an active trade in the produce of the manufactures,
                    and also in corn, cattle, butter, and cheese. To the east of the town is the
                    Maliebaan or Mall, a triple avenue of trees about half a mile in length. The
                    population of Utrecht in 1876 was 66,106, and in 1887 it was 79,166.</p>
                <p>Utrecht (“Oude Trecht” or “old ford”), the Trajectum ad Rhe-num of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Itinerary</hi> of Antoninus, was known as Wiltaburg by the
                    Frisians and Franks. Dagobert, king of the East Franks, built a chapel here in
                    630, and under St Willibrord Utrecht in 696 became an episcopal see. The bishops
                    rose to great power during the Middle Ages, and the city was frequently an
                    imperial residence. Conrad II. (1039) and Henry V. (1125) both died at Utrecht,
                    and their hearts were buried in the crypt of the cathedral. The city was handed
                    over to Charles V. by Bishop Henry in 1527. The first confederation of the Dutch
                    provinces was formed in Utrecht in 1579. The celebrated peace of Utrecht between
                    France and Great Britain, Savoy, Portugal, Prussia, and the states of Holland
                    was concluded here on 11th April 1713. Utrecht has since 1723 been the
                    headquarters of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Jansenists</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
