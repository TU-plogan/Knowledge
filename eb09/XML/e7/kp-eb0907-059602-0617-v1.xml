                <p><label type="entry">EAR-RING</label>, an ornament worn pendent from the ear, and
                    generally suspended by means of a ring or hook passing through the pendulous
                    lobe of the ear. The general usage appears to have been to have ear-rings worn
                    in pairs, the two ornaments in all respects resembling each other; in ancient
                    times, or sometimes more recently among Oriental races, a single ear-ring has
                    sometimes been worn. The use of this kind of ornament, which constantly was of
                    great value and sometimes was made of large size, dates from the remotest
                    historical antiquity, the earliest mention of ear-rings occurring in the book of
                    Genesis. It appears probable that the ear-rings of Jacob’s family, which he
                    buried with his strange idols at Bethel, were regarded as amulets or talismans,
                    such unquestionably being the estimation in which some ornaments of this class
                    have been held from a very early period, as they still are held in the East
                    Among all the Oriental races of whom we have any accurate knowledge, the Hebrews
                    and Egyptians excepted, ear-rings always have been in general use by both sexes;
                    while in the West, as well as by the Hebrews and Egyptians, as a general rule
                    they have been considered exclusively female ornaments. By the Greeks and Romans
                    also ear-rings were worn only by women; and the prevalence of this fashion among
                    the races of classic antiquity is illustrated in a singular manner by the ears
                    of the famous statue of the Venus de’ Medici being bored, evidently for the
                    reception of pendent jewels. Ear-rings invariably occupy important positions
                    among the various remains of ancient and mediaeval goldsmiths’ work that from
                    time to time have rewarded the researches of archaeological inquirers. And these
                    early relics, with rare exceptions objects of great beauty and delicacy, never
                    fail to exemplify the artistic styles of their periods, as they were prevalent
                    among the races by whom each individual jewel was produced. Ear-rings of costly
                    materials and elaborate workmanship have been brought to light in considerable
                    numbers in the Troad and in Peloponnesus by Dr Schliemann; jewels of the same
                    class, of exquisite beauty, and of workmanship that is truly wonderful, have
                    been rescued from the sepulchres of ancient Etruria and Greece by Signor
                    Castellani; other ear-rings of gold of characteristic forms have come down to
                    our own times from the ancient Egyptians; we know well what styles of ear-rings
                    were worn by the Romans of the empire and by the early Scandinavians; and recent
                    researches among the burial places of our Anglo-Saxon predecessors in the
                    occupancy of this island have led to the discovery of jewels in considerable
                    numbers, which among their varieties include ear-rings executedin a style that
                    proves the Anglo-Saxons to have made no inconsiderable advance in the arts of
                    civilization. These same ornaments, which never have fallen into disuse, enjoy
                    at the present day a very high degree of favour; like all other modern jewels,
                    however, the ear-rings of our own times as works of arts can claim no historical
                    attributes, because they consist as well of reproductions from all past ages and
                    of every race as of fanciful productions that certainly can be assigned to no
                    style of art whatever.</p>
