                <p><label type="entry">E</label> is the second vowel-symbol and the fifth letter in
                    our alphabet. In its original form among the Phoenicians it represented the
                    rough breathing—our <hi rend="italic">h:</hi> we have seen that A represented
                    the smooth breathing. As the Greeks had the sound <hi rend="italic">h</hi> at a
                    very early period, it might have been expected that this symbol would have been
                    taken by them with its original value. But the want of symbols to denote the
                    vowels was apparently felt to be more imperative; therefore all the Phoenician
                    symbols (corresponding to the Hebrew aleph, he, ayin) were taken to denote the
                    vowelsounds ct, <hi rend="italic">e, o</hi> respectively. The form of the symbol
                    E has varied little from the earliest Greek times to our own. In old Latin it is
                    sometimes, but rarely, found in the form 11. The typical sound of E in almost
                    all languages is one of those which we denote generally by <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi> in English, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in the word <hi
                        rend="italic">fate—</hi> that is, one of the simple sounds between A
                    (English <hi rend="italic">ah)</hi> and I (English <hi rend="italic">ee),</hi>
                    which are produced by raising the tongue gradually from its lowest position (at
                    A) to its highest position (at I): in this scale of sounds the lips are not
                    employed. The most clearly distinguished of these sounds are (1) that in <hi
                        rend="italic">men,</hi> (2) that in <hi rend="italic">fair, (f)</hi> that in
                        <hi rend="italic">fate.</hi> It will be observed that these sounds have here
                    different symbols; and if these were consistently employed in English we should
                    not have much reason to complain of our spelling; but <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    has also the I-sound in <hi rend="italic">here</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >see;</hi><hi rend="italic">ai</hi> in <hi rend="italic">wait</hi> has the
                    same sound as <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in <hi rend="italic">fate;</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> has many sounds. Other languages employ diacritical
                    marks to distinguish these sounds; thus in Italian we have è and <hi
                        rend="italic">e,</hi> called “open” and “close” <hi rend="italic">e</hi>
                    respectively; these correspond very nearly to (2) and (3) mentioned above. It is
                    probable that the same distinction of sound was given in Latin by employing <hi
                        rend="italic">ae</hi> to express the open <hi rend="italic">e:</hi> at least
                    open <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is commonly found in Italian words which were
                    written in Latin with <hi rend="italic">ae,</hi> or with <hi rend="italic"
                        >e</hi> short. It is possible that in Greece a similar distinction of close
                    open <hi rend="italic">e</hi> was expressed in early times by the symbols e
                    (epsilon) and <hi rend="italic">η</hi> (eta); but in Attica, at least after 403
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> the distinction seems to have been rather
                    quantitative than qualitative. For the history of eta see article H. It is clear
                    that in a perfect alphabet we ought to have at least three distinct symbols
                    between A and I: we ought not to be compelled to distinguish the simple sounds
                    by diphthongs or other modifications. Indeed yet more symbols would be
                    desirable, for there are other sounds in this scale, which, however, are not
                    easily distinguished from the above except by a practised ear.</p>
                <p>It is probable that <hi rend="italic">ee</hi> in English of the 16th and 17th
                    centuries had the sound still heard in Scotland in words like <hi rend="italic"
                        >ell, i.e.,</hi> the simple <hi rend="italic">e</hi> in our <hi
                        rend="italic">men</hi> pronounced long: this is not unlike the open <hi
                        rend="italic">e,</hi> but the back of the tongue is lower. But <hi
                        rend="italic">ee</hi> had acquired its present I sound in the last
                    century.</p>
