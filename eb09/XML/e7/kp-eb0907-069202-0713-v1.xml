                        rend="smallcaps">Van den</hi> (1621-1674), a painter, born at Amsterdam on
                    the 19th of August 1621, entered early into the studio of Rembrandt. Though a
                    companion pupil to F. Bol and Govaert Flinck, he was inferior to both in skill
                    and in the extent of his practice; yet at an early period he assumed Rembrandt’s
                    manner with such success that his pictures were confounded with those of his
                    master; and, even in our day, the Resurrection of the Daughter of Jairus, in the
                    Berlin Museum, and the Presentation in the Temple, in the Gallery of Dresden,
                    have been held to represent worthily the style of Rembrandt. As evidence of the
                    fidelity of Eeckhout’s imitation we may cite his Presentation in the Temple, at
                    Berlin, which is executed after Rembrandt’s print of 1630, and his Tobit with
                    the Angel, at Brunswick, which is composed on the same background as Rembrandt’s
                    “Philosopher in Thought.” Eeckhout not merely copies the subjects: he also takes
                    the shapes, the figures, the Jewish dress, and the pictorial effects of his
                    master. It is difficult to form an exact judgment of Eeckhout’s qualities at the
                    outset of his career. His earliest pieces are probably those in which he more
                    faithfully reproduced Rembrandt’s peculiarities. Exclusively his is a tinge of
                    green in shadows marring the harmony of the work, a certain gaudiuess of jarring
                    tints, uniform surface, and a touch more quick than subtle. Besides the pictures
                    already mentioned we should class amongst early productions on this account, the
                    Woman taken in Adultery, in the Museum of Amsterdam; Anna presenting her Son to
                    the High Priest, at the Louvre; the Epiphany, at Turin; and the Circumcision, at
                    Cassel. Eeckhout matriculated early in the Guild of Amsterdam. A likeness of a
                    lady at a dressing table with a string of beads, in possession of Mr Von
                    Stummer, at Vienna, beam the date of 1643, and proves that the master at this
                    time possessed more imitative skill than genuine mastery over nature. As he grew
                    older he succeeded best in portraits, a very fair example of which is the
                    historian Dappers (1669), in the Städel collection. Eeckhout occasionally varied
                    his style so as to recall in hter years the “small masters” of the Dutch school.
                    Waagen justly draws attention to his following of Terburg .n Gambling Soldiers,
                    at Stafford House, and a Soldiers’ Merrymaking, in the collection of the Marquis
                    of Bute. V Sportsman with Hounds, probably executed in 1670, aow in the Vander
                    Hoo gallery, and a Group of Children with Goats (1671), in the Hermitage at St
                    Petersburg, hardly exhibit a trace of the artist’s first education. Amongst the
                    best of Eeckhout’s works Christ in the Γemple (1662), at Munich, and the Haman
                    and Mordecai if 1665, at Luton House, occupy a good place. Eeckhout lied at
                    Amsterdam on the 22nd of October, 1674.</p>
