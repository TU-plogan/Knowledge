                            perhaps be explained by the existence of a mediaeval legend (of which,
                            however, be it said, he takes no notice), best known to English readers
                            byÄ1ι Longfellow’s pretty version of Mosen’s poem, to the effect that
                            the bird acquired its peculiar conformation of bill and coloration of
                            plumage in recognition of the pity it bestowed on the suffering Saviour
                            at tho crucifixion·.</p></note> ignorant of its being a piece of
                    mechanism most beautifully adapted to the habits of the bird, enabling it to
                    extract with the greatest ease, from fir-cones or fleshy fruits, the seeds which
                    form its usual and almost invariable food. Its mode of using this unique
                    instrument seems to have been first described by Townson <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Tracts on Nat. Hist.,</hi> p. 116, London: 1799), but only partially, and
                    it was Yarrell who, in 1829 <hi rend="italic">(Zool.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Journ.,</hi> iv. ρp. 457-465, pl. xiv. figs, l--7), explained fully the
                    means whereby the jaws and the muscles which direct their movements become so
                    effective in riving asunder cones or apples, while at the proper moment the
                    scoop-like tongue is instantaneously thrust out and withdrawn, conveying the
                    hitherto protected seed to the bird’s mouth. Without going into details it may
                    be observed that in the Crossbills the articulation of the mandible to the
                    quadrate-bone is such as to allow of a very considerable amount of lateral play,
                    and, by a particular arrangement of the muscles which move the former, it comes
                    to pass that so soon as the bird opens its mouth the point of the mandible is
                    brought immediately opposite to that of the maxilla (which itself is movable
                    vertically), instead of crossing or overlapping it—the usual position when the
                    mouth is closed. The two points thus meeting, the bill is inserted between the
                    scales or into the pome, but on opening the mouth still more widely, the lateral
                    motion of the mandible is once more brought to bear with great force to wrench
                    aside the portion of the fruit attacked, and then the action of the tongue
                    completes the operation, which is so rapidly performed as to defy scrutiny,
                    except on very close inspection. Fortunately the birds soon become tame in
                    confinement, and a little patience will enable an attentive observer to satisfy
                    himself as to the process, the result of which at first seems almost as
                    unaccountable as that of a clever conjuring trick.</p>
                <p>The Common Crossbill of the Palaearctic Region <hi rend="italic">(Loxia
                        curvirostra)</hi> is about the size of a Skylark, but more stoutly built.
                    The young (which on leaving the nest have not the tips of the bill crossed) are
                    of a dull olive colour with indistinct dark stripes on the lower parts, and the
                    quills oi the wings and tail dusky. After the first moult the difference between
                    the sexes is shown by the hens inclining tc yellowish-green, while the cocks
                    become diversified by orange-yellow and red, their plumage finally deepening
                    into a rich crimson-red, varied in places by a flame-colour. Their glowing hues
                    are, however, speedily lost by examples which may be kept in confinement, and
                    are replaced by a dull ofange, or in some cases by a bright golden-yellow, and
                    specimens have, though rarely, occurred in a wild state exhibiting the same
                    tints. The cause of these changes is at present obscure, if not unknown, and it
                    must be admitted that their sequence has been disputed by some excellent
                    authorities, but the balance of evidence is certainly in favour of the above
                    statement. Depending mainly for <pb break="no"

                    of Crossbills are irregular beyond those of most birds, and they would seem to
                    rove in any direction and at any season in quest of their staple sustenance. But
                    the pips of apples are also a favourite dainty, and it stands recorded by the
                    old chronicler Matthew Paris <hi rend="italic">(Hist.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Λngl.</hi> MS. fol. 252), that in 1251 the orchards of England were ravaged
                    by birds, “pomorum grana, &amp; non aliud de eisdem pomis comedentes,” which,
                    from his description, “Habebant autem partes rostri cancellatas, per quas poma
                    quasi forcipi vel cultello dividebant,” could be none other but Crossbills.
                    Notice of a like visitation in 1593 was published by Wats <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Vit.</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">Oſfar.</hi> &amp;c., 1640, p. 262), but of
                    late it has become evident that not a year passes without Crossbills being
                    observed in some part or other of England, while in certain localities in
                    Scotland they seem to breed annually. The nest is rather rudely constructed, and
                    the eggs, generally four in number, resemble those of the Greenfinch, but are
                    larger in size. This species ranges throughout the continent of Europe,<note

                <p>Three other forms of the genus also inhabit the Old World—two of them so closely
                    resembling the common bird that their specific validity has been often
                    questioned. The first of these, of large stature, the Parrot-Crossbill <hi
                        rend="italic">(L. pityopsittacus),</hi> comes occasionally to Great Britain,
                    presumably from Scandinavia, where it is known to breed. The second (2λ <hi

                    from the Himalaya Mountains. The third, the Two-barred Crossbill <hi
                        rend="italic">(L. taenioptera),</hi> is very distinct, and its proper home
                    seems to be the most northern forests of the Russian empire, but it has
                    occasionally occurred in Western Europe and even in England.</p>
                <p>The New World has two birds of the genus. The first <hi rend="italic">(L.
                        ameriaeanſ),</hi> representing our common species, but with a smaller bill,
                    and the males easily recognizable by their more scarlet plumage, ranges from the
                    northern limit of coniferous trees to the highlands of Mexico, or even further.
                    The other <hi rend="italic">(L. leucoptera)</hi> is the equivalent of the
                    Two-barred Crossbill, but smaller. It has twice occurred in England. <hi
