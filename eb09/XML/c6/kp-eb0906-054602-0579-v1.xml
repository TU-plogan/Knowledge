                    in 1544, said that he had very often seen its young (“<hi rend="italic">earum
                        pipiones</hi><hi rend="italic">saepissime</hi><hi rend="italic">υidιJ.</hi>
                    Notwithstanding the protection afforded it by sundry Acts of Parliament, it has
                    long since ceased from breeding in this country. Sir T. Browne (oδ. 1682) speaks
                    of it as being found in the open parts of Norfolk in winter. In Ray’s time it
                    was only known as occurring at the same season in large flocks in the fens of
                    Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire; and though mention is made of Cranes’ eggs and
                    young in the fendaws passed at a court held at Revesby in 1780, this was most
                    likely but the formal repetition of an older edict; for in 1768 Pennant wrote
                    that after the strictest inquiry he found the inhabitants of those counties to
                    be wholly unacquainted with the bird, and hence concluded that it had forsaken
                    our island. The Crane, however, no doubt then appeared in Britain, as it does
                    now, at uncertain intervals and in unwonted places, showing that the examples
                    occurring here (which usually meet the hostile reception commonly accorded to
                    strange visitors) have strayed from the migrating bands whose movements have
                    been remarked from almost the earliest ages. Indeed, the Crane’s aerial journeys
                    are of a very extended kind; and on its way from beyond the borders of the
                    Tropic of Cancer to within the Arctic Circle, or on the return-voyage, its
                    flocks may be descried passing overhead at a marvellous height, or halting for
                    rest and refreshment on the wide meadows that border some great river, while the
                    seeming order with which its ranks are marshalled during flight lias long
                    attracted attention. The Crane takes up its winter-quarters under tho burning
                    sun of Central Africa and India, but early in spring returns northward. Not a
                    few examples reach the chill polar soils of Lapland and Siberia, but some tarry
                    in the south of Europe and breed in Spain, and, it is supposed, in Turkey. The
                    greater number, however, occupy the intermediate zone and pass the summer in
                    Russia, North Germany, and Scandinavia. Soon after their arrival in these
                    countries the flocks break up into pairs, whose nuptial ceremonies are
                    accompanied by loud and frequent trumpet-ings, and the respective
                    breeding-places of each are chosen.</p>
                <p>The nest is formed with little art on the ground in large open marshes, where the
                    herbage is not very high—a tolerably dry spot being selected and used apparently
                    year after year. Here the eggs, which are of a rich brown colour with dark
                    spots, and always two in number, are laid. The young are able to run soon after
                    they are hatched, and are at first clothed with tawny down. In the course of the
                    summer they assume nearly the same grey plumage that their parents wear, except
                    that the elongated plumes, which in the adults form a graceful covering of the
                    hinder parts of the body, are comparatively undeveloped, and the clear black,
                    white, and red (the last being due to a patch of papillose skin of that colour)
                    of the head and neck are as yet indistinct. During this time they keep in the
                    marshes, but as autumn approaches the different families unite by the rivers and
                    lakes, and ultimately form the enormous bands which after much more trumpeting
                    set out on their southward journey.</p>
                <p>The Crane’s power of uttering the sonorous and peculiar trumpet-like notes, of
                    which mention has been made, is commonly and perhaps correctly ascribed to the
                    formation of its trachea, which on quitting the lower end of the neck passes
                    backward between the branches of the furcula and is received into a hollow space
                    formed by the bony walls of the carina or keel of the sternum. Herein it makes
                    three turns, and then runs upwards and backwards to the lungs. The apparatus on
                    the whole much resembles that found in the Whooping Swans <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Cygnus</hi><hi rend="italic">musicus,</hi><hi rend="italic">C.
                        buccinator,</hi> and others), though differing in some not unimportant
                    details; but at the same time somewhat similar convolutions of the trachea occur
                    in other birds which do not possess, so far as is known, the faculty of
                    trumpeting. The Crane emits its notes both during flight and while on the
                    ground. In the latter case the neck and bill are uplifted and the mouth kept
                    open during the utterance of the blast, which may be often heard from birds in
                    confinement, especially at the beginning of the year.</p>
                <p>As usually happens in similar cases, the name of tho once familiar British
                    species is now used in a general sense, and applied to all others which are
                    allied to it. Though by many systematists placed near or even among the Herons,
                    there is no doubt that the Cranes have only a superficial resemblance and no
                    real affinity to the <hi rend="italic">Ardeidae.</hi> In fact the <hi
                        rend="italic">Gruidae</hi> form a somewhat isolated group. Professor Huxley
                    has included them together with the <hi rend="italic">RalUdce</hi> in his <hi
                        rend="italic">Geranomorphae;</hi> but a more extended view of their various
                    characters would probably assign them rather as relatives of the Bustards—not
                    that it must bo thought that the two families have not been for a very long time
                    distinct. <hi rend="italic">Grus,</hi> indeed, is a very ancient form, its
                    remains appearing in the Miocene of France and Greece, as well as in the
                    Pliocene and Post-pliocene of North America. In France, too, during the
                    “Reindeer Period” there existed a huge species—the <hi rend="italic">G.
                        primigenia</hi> of Μ. Alphonse Milne-Edwards—which has doubtless been long
                    extinct. At the present time Cranes inhabit all the great zoogeographical
                    Regions of the earth, except the Neotropical, and some sixteen or seventeen
                    species are discriminated. In Europe, besides the <hi rend="italic">G.
                        communis</hi> already mentioned, we have as an inhabitant that which is
                    generally known as the Numidian or Demoiselle-Crane <hi rend="italic"
                        >{G.</hi><hi rend="italic">virgo),</hi> distinguished from every other by
                    its long white ear-tufts. This bird is also widely distributed throughout Asia
                    and Africa, and is said to have occurred in Orkney as a straggler. The eastern
                    part of the Palaearctic Region is inhabited by four other species that do not
                    frequent Europe <hi rend="italic">{G.</hi><hi rend="italic">antigone, G.

                    perhaps the finest of tho family, with nearly the whole plumage of a snowy
                    white. The Indian Region, besides being visited in winter by four of the species
                    already named, has two that are peculiar to it <hi rend="italic">(G.

                    The Australian Region possesses a large species known to the colonists as the
                    “Native Companion <hi rend="italic">” (G. australis)·,</hi> while the Nearctic
                    is tenanted by three species <hi rend="italic">(G. americana, G.

                        <hi rend="italic">(G. schlegeli),</hi> a little-known and somewhat obscure
                    bird, finding its habitat here. In the Ethiopian Region we have two species <hi

                        >G. carunculatd)</hi> which do not occur out of Africa, as well as two
                    others forming the group known as “Crowned Cranes ”—differing much from other
                    members of the family, and justifiably placed in a separate genus, <hi
                        rend="italic">Balearica.</hi> One of these <hi rend="italic">(B.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">pavonina)</hi> inhabits Northern and Western Africa, while the

                <p>With regard to the literature of this species, a paper “On the Breeding of the
                    Crane in Lapland” <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1859, p. 191), by the late M’r
                    John Wolley, is one of the most pleasing contributions to natural history ever
                    written, and an admirably succinct account of all the different species was
                    communicated by the late Mr Blyth to <hi rend="italic">The Field</hi> newspaper
                    in 1873 (vol. xl. p. 631, vol. xli. pp. 7, 61, 136,∙ 189, 248, 384, 408, 418),
                    which it is much to be regretted has not since been published in a more
                    accessible form; while a beautiful picture representing a flock of Cranes,
                    resting by the Rhine, during one of their annual migrations, is to be found in
