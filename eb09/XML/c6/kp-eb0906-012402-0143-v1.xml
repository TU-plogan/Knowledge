                    its full size in June or early in July. A smaller bulb is then formed from the
                    old one, close to its root; and this in September and October produces the
                    crocus-like flowers. In the succeeding January or February it sends up its
                    leaves, together with the ovary, which perfects its seeds during the summer. The
                    young corm, at first about the diameter of the flower-stalk, grows continuously,
                    till in the following July it attains the size of a small apricot. The parent
                    bulb remains attached to the new one, and keeps its form and size till April in
                    the third year of its existence, after which it decays. In some cases a single
                    corm produces several new plants during its second spring by giving rise to
                    immature corms.</p>
                <p>Colchicum owes its medicinal properties to an alkaloid, named <hi rend="italic"
                        >colchicine,</hi> which is present in all parts of the plant. It was
                    discovered by Pelletier and Caventon, and was identified as distinct from
                    veratrine by Geiger and Hesse in 1833. According to Oberlin, colchicine is a
                    complex body, containing a crystallizable neutral substance, colchiceine. Hübler
                    assigns to colchicine the formula C <hi rend="subscript"> 17</hi> H <hi
                        rend="subscript"> 19</hi> NO <hi rend="subscript"> 5</hi>, and considers it
                    to be isomeric with colchiceine <hi rend="italic">(Arch,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >der</hi><hi rend="italic">Pharm.,</hi> tom. cxi. 194; <hi rend="italic"

                        rend="italic">Chim.,</hi> tom. ii. 490, 4th ser). It is an intensely bitter
                    body, soluble in alcohol and water, but insoluble in ether, and is a powerful
                    poison, small quantities causing violent vomiting and purging; tannin, which
                    precipitates it from solution, has been recommended as an antidote for it.
                    Colchicine is present in smaller quantity in the seeds than in the bulbs; and in
                    the latter, according to Stolze, it is more abundant in spring than in autumn;
                    Shroff, however, states that the corms for medicinal use should be collected
                    after or during the time of flowering. The preparations of colchicum employed as
                    medicine are the extract, made by macerating dried shreds of the bulbs in sherry
                    or acetic acid, the expressed juice of the bulbs, purified and concentrated by
                    heating, straining, and evaporation at a temperature below 160° Fahr., and an
                    alcoholic tincture of the seeds. Whether swallowed or injected into the veins
                    colchicum acts as an irritant of the stomach and intestines and a nervine
                    sedative; small doses stimulate the secreting and excreting functions, but when
                    continued they impair the appetite, and much disturb the stomach. Large
                    quantities produce vomiting, profuse perspiration, heat in the abdomen,
                    considerable reduction of the rate of the pulse, and dysenteric symptoms, and
                    may cause death from exhaustion.</p>
                <p>Colchicum was known to the Greeks under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                        >KoKχεκAv,</hi> from Koλχiv, or Colchis, a country in which the plant grew;
                    and it is described by Dioscorides as a poison. In the 17th century the corms
                    were worn by some of the German peasantry as a charm against the plague. The
                    drug was little used till 1763, when Baron Storck of Vienna introduced it for
                    the treatment of dropsy. In febrile diseases it was first extensively employed
                    by Mr Haden. As a specific for gout colchicum was early employed by the Arabs;
                    and the preparation known as <hi rend="italic">eau médicinale,</hi> much
                    resorted to in the last century for the cure of gout, owes its therapeutic
                    virtues to colchicum; but general attention was first directed by Sir Everard
                    Home to the use of the drug in gout. Full doses are apt to provoke sickness and
                    diarrhoea, but give immediate relief from the sufferings caused by arthritic
                    disease; whereas small quantities are not effectual for several days. According
                    to Dr A. B, Garrod, the beneficial effects of colchicum are not explicable
                    either by its purgative properties, or by its sedative influence on the vascular
                    system; nor is there evidence that it produces any of its effects by causing an
                    increase in the elimination of urea and uric acid by the kidneys. Dr Graves
                    considers that colchicum operates in gout by lessening the formation of uric
                    acid in the system.</p>
                <p>Colchicum may often be employed in acute rheumatism, in the treatment of
                    bronchitis, asthma, eruptions of the skin, and of dyspepsia in gouty patients;
                    also as a cholagogue instead of mercurials. The “hermodactyl” of ancient writers
                    is supposed to be the same as the modern drug of that name, which consists of
                    the corms of a species of colchicum.</p>
