                    (1499-1592), was born at Malines, and studied under Bernard van Orlay, who
                    probably induced him to visit Italy. At Rome in 1532 he painted the chapel of
                    Cardinal Enckenvooit in the church de Anima; and Vasari, who knew him
                    personally, says with truth “that he fairly acquired the manner of an Italian.”
                    But Coxcie’s chief business in Italy was not painting. His principal occupation
                    was designing for engravers; and the fable of Psyche in thirty-two sheets by
                    Agostino Veneziano and the Master of the Die are favourable specimens of his
                    skill in this respect. During a subsequent residence in the Netherlands Coxcie
                    greatly extended his practice in this branch of art. But his productions were
                    till lately concealed under an interlaced monogram M.C.O.K.X.I.N. Coxcie, who
                    married in Italy, displayed the peculiar bias of his taste by christening his
                    eldest son Raphael. He returned in 1539 to Malines, where he matriculated, and
                    painted for the chapel of the guild of St Luke the wings of an altar-piece now
                    in Sanct Veit of Prague. The centre of this altar-piece, by Mabuse, represents
                    St Luke pourtraying the Virgin; the side pieces contain the Martyrdom of St
                    Vitus and the Vision of St John in Patmos. At Van Orlay’s death in 1541 Coxcie
                    succeeded to the office of court painter to the regent Mary of Hungary, for whom
                    he decorated the castle of Binche. He was subsequently patronized by Charles V.,
                    who often coupled his works with those of Titian; by Philip II., who paid him
                    royally for a copy of Van Eyck’s Agnus Dei; and by the duke of Alva, who once
                    protected him from the insults of Spanish soldiery at Malines. There are large
                    and capital works of his (1587-88) in St Rombaud of Malines, in Ste Gudule of
                    Brussels, and in the museums of Brussels and Antwerp. His style is Raphaelesque
                    grafted on the Flemish, but his imitation of Raphael, whilst it distantly
                    recalls Giulio Romano, is never free from affectation and stiffness. Coxcie was
                    working at a picture in Antwerp when he met with a fall. He was taken in an
                    ailing state to Malines, where he died on the 5th of March 1592.</p>
