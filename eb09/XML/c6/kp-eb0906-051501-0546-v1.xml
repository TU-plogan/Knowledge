                <p><label type="entry">COURLAND, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kurland</hi></label>, one
                    of the Baltic provinces of Russia, lying between 56° and 57° 45' N. lat. and 21°
                    and 27° E. long., is bounded on the N.E. by the River Düna, separating it from
                    the governments of Vitebsk and Livonia, N. by the Gulf of Riga, W. by the
                    Baltic, and S. by the government of Kovno. The area is 10,535 square miles, of
                    which 101 square miles are occupied by lakes. Population (1870), ’619,154. The
                    surface is generally low, and the coast-lands, which run out northwards,
                    inclosing the Gulf of Riga, by a broad promontory to the Domes-näs, opposite the
                    island of Oesel, are flat and marshy. The interior is characterized by wooded
                    dunes, covered with pine, fir, birch, and oak, with swamps and lakes and fertile
                    patches between. Usmaiten, the largest lake, is 24 miles in circuit. The highest
                    point of the province, called the Hüningsberg, in the neighbourhood of the
                    capital, is scarcely 700 feet above the sea. The Windau, Aa, and the frontier
                    river Düna pass through the province from the south-east. Owing to the numerous
                    lakes and marshes the climate is damp and foggy, and the winter is severe,
                    though less rigorous than that of Livonia. Agriculture is the chief occupation
                    of the inhabitants, the principal crops being rye, barley, and oats; flax, hemp,
                    and a little tobacco are also grow n. Fisheries, cattle-rearing, and hunting are
                    also carried on to some extent. Except in the making of tiles and in
                    distillation manufactures are insignificant. Iron and limestone are the chief
                    minerals of the province; amber is found on the coasts. The peasantry of
                    Courland are partly the Letts of Courland, or Kures, mixed with Polish and
                    Russian blood; partly Esthonian Letts, with German, Swedish, and Finnish
                    admixture, such as the Livs of the north west coast of the promontory of
                    Courland, and the “Krevinnes,” or Krivingians, living in the district of Bauske,
                    in the interior. The prevailing religion is the Lutheran,—only a small
                    proportion of the people belonging to the Greek Church. Mitau, centrally placed,
                    and in railway communication with Riga, is the capital of the province and its
                    largest town; but Libau and Windau on the Baltic coast are its busiest places.
                    Anciently Courland was an independent possession of the Teutonic knights, who
                    also owned Livonia, and it comprised the two duchies of Kurland and Semgall. As
                    Russian power continued to extend, and the knights could no longer hold their
                    own in Livonia, the duchies were placed, in 1561, under the feudal government of
                    Poland. By the marriage of Duke Frederick William of Kurland to the Russian
                    Princess Anna, daughter of Czar Ivan, in 1710, Courland came into close relation
                    with Russia, and remained for a long period an object of contention between that
                    country and Poland. Ultimately, in 1795, the assembly of nobles in Courland
                    resolved to place the country under the Russian sceptre. The Baltic
                    provinces—Esthonia, Livonia, and Courland—ceased to form collectively a general
                    government of the Russian empire by ukase of January 1876; their separate
                    administration is now based on the same general system as that of the other
                    governments of the empire, modified by some local and special dispositions.</p>
