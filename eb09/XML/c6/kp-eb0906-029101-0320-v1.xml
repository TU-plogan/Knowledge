                <p><label type="entry">CONSANGUINITY, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Kindred</hi></label>,
                    is defined by the writers on the subject to be <hi rend="italic"
                        >vinculum</hi><hi rend="italic">personarum ab eodem stipite
                        descendentium,</hi> that is, the connection or relation of persons descended
                    from the same stock or common ancestor. This consanguinity is either lineal or
                    collateral. Lineal consanguinity is that which subsists between persons of whom
                    one is descended in a direct line from the other, while collateral relations
                    descend from the same stock or ancestor, but do not descend the one from the
                    other. Collateral kinsmen, then, are such as lineally spring from one and the
                    same ancestor, who is the <hi rend="italic">stirps,</hi> or root, as well as the
                        <hi rend="italic">stipes,</hi> trunk, or common stock, whence these
                    relations branch out. It will be seen that the modern idea of consanguinity is
                    larger than that of <hi rend="italic">agnatio</hi> in the civil law, which was
                    limited to connection through males, and was modified by the ceremonies of
                    adoption and emancipation, and also than that of <hi rend="italic"
                        >cognatio,</hi> which did not go beyond the sixth generation, and was made
                    the basis of Justinian’s law of succession. The more limited meaning of <hi
                        rend="italic">consanguinei</hi> was brothers or sisters by the same father,
                    as opposed to <hi rend="italic">uterini,</hi> brothers or sisters by the same
                    mother. The degrees of collateral consanguinity were differently reckoned in the
                    civil and in the canon law. “The civil law reckons the number of descents
                    between the persons on both sides from the common ancestor. The canon law counts
                    the number of descents between the common ancestor and the two persons on one
                    side only,” and always on the side of the person who is more distant from the
                    common ancestor. A recent American writer, Lewis Morgan <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Systems of Consanguinity and Affinity in the Human Family,</hi> 1871), has
                    given the terms used to denote kindred in 139 languages. The Mongoloids, the
                    Malays, the Dravidas, and the American aborigines have the following system. All
                    the descendants of a common ancestor or ancestors of the same generation call
                    each other brother and sister; they call all males of the previous generation
                    fathers, and of the following one sons. From this he draws the mistaken
                    inference (shared by Lubbock) that the primitive marriage state was hetarism, or
                    community of wives. The linguistic facts are more probably connected with
                    considerations of social rank, and such associations as the vendetta. In fact,
                    except Egypt and Persia, nearly the whole world, both civilized and savage, have
                    joined in repudiating incest. The chief danger has now been seen to lie in the
                    risk of transmitting defects in an aggravated form. The force of the feeling is
                    seen in the custom of wife-stealing, or exogamy by violence. In many places even
                    identity of name is held to be an impediment to marriage. (See also M'Lennan <hi
