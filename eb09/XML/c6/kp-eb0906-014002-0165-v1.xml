                    (1517-1572), admiral of France, was son of the Marshal Gaspard de Coligni and
                    Louise de Montmorency, and was born at Chatillon-sur-Loing, the hereditary
                    domain of his house. At twenty-two he came to court, and there contracted a
                    friendship with Francis of Guise. In the campaign of 1543 Coligni distinguished
                    himself greatly, and was wounded at the sieges of Montmédy and Bains. In 1544 he
                    served in the Italian campaign under the Due d’Enghien, and was knighted on the
                    field of Cerisolles. Returning to France, he took part in <pb break="no"

                    been made colonel general of the infantry, exhibited great capacity and in
                    telligence as a military reformer. He was soon afterwards made admiral in room
                    of D’Annebaut. At the battle of Renty (1554) began the quarrel between him and
                    Francis of Guise, which was to bring such evil on both their houses, and on
                    their native land; and the enmity was increased tenfold in 1556 by the rupture,
                    at the instance of Guise, of the Treaty of Vauxcelles. In 1557 he was intrusted
                    with the defence of Saint Quentin. In the siege he displayed great courage,
                    resolution, and strength of character; but the place was taken, and he was
                    imprisoned in the stronghold of LΕcluse. On payment of a ransom of 50,000 crowns
                    he recovered his liberty. But he had by this time become a Huguenot, through the
                    influence of his brother Dandelot; and he busied himself secretly with
                    protecting his co-religionists, a colony of whom he sent to Brazil, whence they
                    were afterwards expelled by the Portuguese. On the death of Henry II. he placed
                    himself, with Louis, prince of Condé, in the front of his sect, and demanded
                    religious toleration and certain other reforms. In 1560, at the Assembly of
                    Notables at Fontainebleau, the hostility between Coligni and Francis of Guise
                    broke violently forth; the death of Francis IL and the policy of Catharine
                    precipitated matters to an issue; the civil war began; and the battle of Dreux
                    (1562), clearing the ground of the Constable Montmorency and the prince of
                    Condé, set the two great rivals at the head of their respective parties. In
                    1563, however, the Pacification of Amboise was effected; Francis of Guise was
                    assassinated; and peace was maintained for some years. The Huguenot attempt to
                    seize on the person of Charles IX. at Monceaux brought about a resumption of
                    hostilities. At St Denis (1567) Coligni defeated Montmorency; in 1569 he was
                    defeated at Jarnac by the duke of Anjou, and repaired with the remains of his
                    army to Cognac. There he was joined by the prince of Navarre, who was forthwith
                    placed at the head of the Protestant party; the two laid siege to Poitiers,
                    which was defended by Henry of Guise; but the siege was raised, and the
                    Huguenots were routed at Moncontour (1569) with terrible slaughter. A price of
                    50,000 crowns was set upon the admiral’s head; but the peace of St Germain was
                    concluded in 1570, and he returned to court. He grew rapidly in favour with
                    Charles IX. As a means of emancipating the king from the tutelage of his mother
                    and the faction of the Guises, the admiral proposed to him a descent on Spanish
                    Flanders, with an army drawn from both sects, and commanded by Charles in
                    person. The king’s regard for the admiral, and the bold front of the Huguenots,
                    alarmed the queen mother; and the massacre of St Bartholomew was the
                    consequence. On 22d August 1572 Coligni was shot in the street by Maurevert, a
                    bravo in the pay of Henry of Guise; the bullets, however, only tore a finger
                    from his right hand and shattered his left elbow. The king visited him, but the
                    queen mother prevented all private intercourse between them. On the 24th August,
                    the night of the massacre, he was attacked in his house by the minions of Guise,
                    led by a German named Behme, who slaw him and cast him from a window into the
                    courtyard at their master’s feet. His body was gibbeted at Montfaucon; it was,
                    however, carried off by his retainers, and buried at Chatillon, where it
                    remained till 1786, when Montesquieu had it reinterred at his own estate of
                    Maupertuis. His papers were seized and burned by the queen mother; among them,
                    according to Brantôme, was ahistory of the civil war “très-beau et très-bien
                    faict, et digne d’estre imprimé.”</p>
