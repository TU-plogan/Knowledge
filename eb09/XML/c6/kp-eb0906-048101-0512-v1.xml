                <p><label type="entry">COTTABUS</label> (Greek, <hi rend="italic">κoττaβoζ,
                        κoσσaβoς,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">oττaβofi),</hi> a game of skill for a
                    long time in great vogue in ancient Greece, frequently alluded to by the
                    classical writers of the period, and not seldom depicted on the ancient vases.
                    The object of the player was to cast a portion of wine left in his drinking cup
                    in such a way that without breaking bulk in its passage through the air, it
                    should reach a vessel set to receive it, and there produce a distinct noise by
                    it:: impact. The thrower, in the ordinary form of the game was expected to
                    retain the recumbent position that was usual at table, and in flinging the
                    cottabus, to make use of his right hand only. To succeed in the aim no small
                    amount of dexterity was required, and unusual ability in the game was rated as
                    high as corresponding excellence in throwing the javelin. Not only was the
                    cottabus the ordinary accompaniment of the festal assembly, but at least in
                    Sicily a special building of a circular form was sometimes erected so that the
                    players might be easily arranged round the basin, and follow each other in rapid
                    succession. Like all games in which the element of chanca found a place, it was
                    regarded as more or less ominous of the future success of the players,
                    especially in matters of love; and the excitement was sometimes further
                    augmented by some object of value being staked on the event. Various
                    modifications of the original principle of the game were gradually introduced,
                    and no fewer than nine different kinds, though some of these have no very
                    striking individuality, have been described by Groddeck in his essay on the
                    subject, published in his <hi rend="italic">Antiquarische Versuche,</hi> 1800.
                    In one variety a flotilla of shallow saucers was set swimming in a basin, and he
                    was regarded as the victor who sank the greatest number by his casts; in another
                    the difficulty of the task was increased by setting up a small figure called a
                        <hi rend="italic">μAvη&lt;i,</hi> and requiring the jet of wine first to
                    strike on this, and then to fall with a noise into the vessel beneath; while in
                    a third two scales were balanced in such a way that the weight of the liquid
                    cast into either scale caused it to dip down, and touch the top of an image. In
                    the boisterous mirth of convivial gatherings the players seem sometimes to have
                    set a slave or one of their companions whom they wished to annoy, in the place
                    of the <hi rend="italic">μAvη&lt;s</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and from this
                    ill-mannered custom the word <hi rend="italic">aπoκoττaβiζeιu</hi> is
                    occasionally used in the sense of to insult. The game appears to have been of
                    Sicilian origin, but it spread through Greece from Thessaly to Rhodes, and was
                    especially fashionable at Athens. Dionysius, Alcaeus, Anacreon, Pindar,
                    Bacchylides, AEschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Antiphanes, have
                    frequent and familiar allusion to the κoτταβos; but in the writers of the Roman
                    and Alexandrian period such reference as occurs shows that the fashion had died
                    out. In Latin literature it is almost altogether unknown.</p>
