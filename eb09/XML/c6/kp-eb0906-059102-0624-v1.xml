                        rend="smallcaps">Cavaliere,</hi> a Venetian painter, was born in the earlier
                    part of the 15th century. The only dates that can with certainty be given are
                    1468 and 1493; these are respectively the earliest and the latest years signed
                    on his pictures—the former on an altar-piece in the church of San Silvestro at
                    Massa near Fermo, and the latter on a picture in the Oggioni collection in
                    Milan. Though born in Venice, Crivelli seems to have worked chiefly in the March
                    of Ancona, and especially in and near Ascoli; there are only two pictures of his
                    proper to a Venetian building, both of these being in the church of San
                    Sebastian. He is said to have studied under Jacobello del Fiore, who was
                    painting as late at any rate as 1436; at that time Crivelli was probably only a
                    boy. The latter always signed as “Carolus Crivellus Venetus;” from 1490 he added
                    “Miles,” having then been knighted by Ferdinand II. of Naples. He painted in
                    tempera only, and is seen to most advantage in subject pictures of moderate
                    size. He introduced agreeable landscape backgrounds; and was particularly
                    partial to giving fruits and flowers (the peach is one of his favourite fruits)
                    as accessories, often in pendent festoons. The National Gallery in London is
                    well supplied with examples of Crivelli; the Annunciation, and the Beato
                    Ferretti (of the same family as Pope Pius IX.) in religious ecstasy, may be
                    specified. Another of his principal pictures is in San Francesco di Matelica; in
                    the Vatican Gallery is a Dead Christ, and in the Brera of Milan the painter’s
                    own portrait. Crivelli is a painter of marked individuality,— hard in form,
                    crudely definite in contour; stem, forced, energetic, almost grotesque and
                    repellent, in feature and expression; simply vigorous in his effect of
                    detachment and relief, and sometimes admitting into his pictures objects
                    actually raised in surface; distinct and warm in colour, with an effect at once
                    harsh and harmonious. His pictures gain by being seen in half-light, and at some
                    little distance; under favouring conditions, they grip the spectator with
