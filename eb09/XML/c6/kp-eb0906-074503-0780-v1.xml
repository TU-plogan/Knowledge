                    6 to 10 peltate woody scales, which terminate in a curved point, and open when
                    the seeds are ripe; the seeds are numerous and winged. All the species exude
                    resin, but no turpentine. <hi rend="italic">C. sempervirens,</hi> Linn., the
                    common cypress, is a native of the Levant and Persia. It is a tapering,
                    flame-shaped tree resembling the Lombardy poplar; its branches are thickly
                    covered with small, imbricated, shining-green leaves; the male catkins are about
                    3 lines in length; the cones are between 1 and 1J inches in diameter, sessile,
                    and generally in pairs, and are made up of large angular scales, slightly convex
                    exteriorly, and mucronate in the centre. In Britain the tree grows to a height
                    of 40 feet, in its native soil to 70 or 90 feet. In thrives best on a dry, deep,
                    sandy loam, on airy sheltered sites at no great elevation above the sea. It was
                    introduced into Great Britain before the middle of the 16th century. In the
                    climate of the south of England its rate of growth when young is between 1 and
                    1∣ feet a year. The seeds are sown in April, and come up in three or four weeks;
                    the plants require protection from frost during their first winter. The timber
                    of the cypress is hard, close-grained, of a fine reddish hue, and very durable.
                    Among the ancients it was in request for poles, rafters, joists, and for the
                    construction of wine-presses, tables, and musical instruments; and on that
                    account was so valuable that a plantation of cypresses was considered a
                    sufficient dowry for a daughter. Owing to its durability the wood was employed
                    for mummy cases, and images of the gods; a statue of Jupiter carved out of
                    cypress is stated by Pliny to have existed 600 years without showing signs of
                    decay. The cypress doors of the ancient St Peter’s at Rome, when removed by
                    Eugenius IV., were about 1100 years old, but nevertheless in a state of perfect
                    preservation. Laws were engraved on cypress by the ancients, and objects of
                    value were preserved in receptacles made of it; thus Horace speaks of poems <hi
                        rend="italic">levi</hi><hi rend="italic">servanda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >cupresso.</hi> The cypress, which grows no more when once cut down, was
                    regarded as a symbol of the dead, and perhaps for that reason was sacred to
                    Pluto; its branches were placed by the Greeks and Romans on the funeral pyres
                    and in the houses of their departed friends. Its supposed ill-boding nature is
                    alluded to in Shakespeare’s <hi rend="italic">Henry</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >^VI.,</hi> where Suffolk desires for his enemies “their sweetest shade, a
                    grove of cypress trees. ’ The cypress was the tree into which Cyparissus, a
                    beautiful youth beloved by Apollo, w as transformed, that he might grieve to all
                    time (Ovid, <hi rend="italic">Met.,</hi> x. iii.). In Turkish cemeteries the
                    cypress—</p>
                <p>“Dark tree, still sad when others’ grief is fled, The only constant mourner o’er
                    the dead ”—</p>
                <p>is the most striking feature, the rule being to plant one for each interment. The
                    tree grows straight, or nearly so, and has a gloomy and forbidding, but
                    wonderfully stately aspect. With advancing age its foliage becomes of a dark,
                    almost black, hue. Gilpin calls the cypress an architectural tree; “no Italian
                    scene,” says he, “is perfect without its tall spiral form, appearing as if it
                    were but a part of the picturesquely disposed edifices which rise from the
                    middle ground against the distant landscape.” The cypress of Somma, in Lombardy,
                    is believed to have been in existence in the time of Julius Caesar; it is about
                    121 feet in height, and 23 feet in circumference. Napoleon, in making the road
                    over the Simplon, deviated from the straight line in order to leave it standing.
                    The cypress, as the olive, is found everywhere in the dry hollows and high
                    eastern slopes of Corfu, of the scenery of which it is characteristic. Its
                    superior luxuriance in that island is attributed by Professor Ansted to the
                    calcareous nature of the soil. As an ornamental tree in Britain the cypress is
                    useful to break the outline formed by round-headed low shrubs and trees. The <hi

                    Pococke, is the only tree that grows towards the summit of Lebanon. The common

                    is known as <hi rend="italic">C. fasÜgiata;</hi> the other variety, <hi
                        rend="italic">C. horizontalis,</hi> which is little planted in England, is
                    distinguished by its horizontally-spreading branches, and its likeness to the
                    cedar. The species <hi rend="italic">G. torulosa</hi> of North India, so called
                    from its twisted bark, attains an altitude of 150 feet; its branches are erect
                    or ascending, and grow so as to form a perfect cone. In the Kulu and Ladakh
                    country the tree is sacred to the deities of the elements. It has been
                    introduced into England, but does not thrive where the winter is severe. The
                    wood, which in Indian temples is burnt as incense, is yellow ish-red,
                    close-grained, tough, hard, readily worked, durable, and equal in quality to
                    that of the deodar. Another East Indian species, <hi rend="italic">C.
                        lusitanica,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">glauca,</hi> the “Cedar of Goa,” is a
                    handsome tree, 50 feet in height when full-grown, with spreading branches
                    drooping at their extremities; it has been much planted in Portugal, especially
                    in the neighbourhood of Cintra. The species <hi rend="italic">C.

                    cypresses are <hi rend="italic">C. macrocarpa,</hi> which is 60 feet high when
