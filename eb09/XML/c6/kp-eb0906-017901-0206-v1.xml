                    (1797-1847), was born in Edinburgh, 27th October 1797. His name holds an
                    honoured place in the roll of sanitary reformers. Instead of waiting till
                    disease was developed, he sought its prevention by the adoption of a careful
                    system of hygiene. He served an apprenticeship in a surgery, and in 1817 passed
                    at Surgeons’ Hall. He proceeded to Paris to complete his medical studies, and
                    whilst there he investigated phrenology on anatomical principles. He became
                    convinced of the truth of the new science, and, as he acquired much skill in the
                    dissection of the brain, he subsequently gave additional interest to the
                    lectures of his brother George, by his practical demonstrations of the
                    convolutions. He returned to Edinburgh in 1819 with the intention of beginning
                    practice; but being attacked by the first symptoms of pulmonary disease, he was
                    obliged to seek health in the south of France and in Italy during the two
                    following winters. He began to practise in 1823, and by careful adherence to the
                    laws of health he was enabled to fulfil the duties of his profession for nine
                    years. During that period he assisted in editing the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Phrenological Journal</hi> and contributed a number of articles to it,
                    defended phrenology before the Royal Medical Society of Edinburgh,.published his
                        <hi rend="italic">Observations on Mental Derangement</hi> (1831), and
                    prepared the greater portion of his <hi rend="italic">Principles of Physiology
                        Applied to Health.</hi> The latter work was issued in 1834, and immediately
                    obtained extensive public favour. In 1836 he was appointed physician to Leopold
                    I., king of the Belgians, and removed, to Brussels. He had only been there a few
                    months, however, when another severe attack of haemoptysis warned him that the
                    climate was unsuitable, and would speedily render him unequal to the duties of
                    his position. Scrupulously conscientious in everything, he at once resigned. The
                    king and Baron Stockmar persuaded him to remain a few weeks longer in the hope
                    that he might recover; but they were disappointed. He continued, however, to
                    hold the position of consulting physician to his majesty. In Edinburgh he
                    proceeded to work with renewed energy; he published his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Physiology of Digestion,</hi> and resumed practice as a consulting
                    physician, his advice being eagerly sought by old and new patients and by his
                    professional brethren. In 1838 he was appointed one of the physicians
                    extraordinary to the queen in Scotland. Two years later he completed. his <hi
                        rend="italic">Physiological and Moral Management of Infancy,</hi> which he
                    believed to be his best work, and it was his last. He suffered at intervals from
                    extreme weakness, and iu 1842 the symptoms became alarming. His latter years
                    were mostly occupied in seeking at various health resorts some alleviation of
                    his disease; he spent two winters in Madeira, and tried a voyage to the L <hi
                        rend="superscript"> τ</hi> nited States, but was compelled to return within
                    a few weeks of the date of his landing at New York. He went on a visit to a
                    nephew at Gorgie, near Edinburgh, and there he died on the 9th August 1847. His
                    last literary effort was a paper on ship-fever, which was published in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Times</hi> after his death; its principal suggestions have
                    been carried out by the Act 12 and 13 Vict. c. 23. His biography, written by
                    George Combe, was published in 1850.</p>
