                    (1796-1849), the elder son of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, was born on the 19th of
                    September 1796, at Clevedon, a small village near Bristol. His early years were
                    passed at Keswick, where his education was conducted in a somewhat desultory
                    manner. He gave promise of great mental power, but derived less advantage from
                    systematic studies than from intercourse with S. T. Coleridge, Wordsworth,
                    Southey, De Quincey, and Professor Wilson. In 1815 he went to Oxford, as scholar
                    of Merton College, the means for his support being principally provided by
                    Southey. His university career, however, was very unfortunate. He had inherited
                    the weakness of purpose, as well as the splendid conversational powers, of his
                    father, and, having never enjoyed the benefit of a regular discipline, lost all
                    self-restraint amidst the gaieties of Oxford, and finally lapsed into habits of
                    intemperance. He was successful in gaining an Oriel fellowship, but at the close
                    of the probationary year was judged to have forfeited it. The authorities could
                    not be prevailed on to reverse their decision; but they awarded to him a free
                    gift of £300. With this, Hartley Coleridge came to London in 1821, and remained
                    there for two years, during which he wrote short poems for the <hi rend="italic"
                        >London Magazine.</hi> His next step was to set up school at Ambleside, but
                    this scheme failed, after five years of struggle in a position for which he was
                    wholly unfit. Coleridge then removed to Grasmere, where he lived in great
                    seclusion,—writing between 1826 and 1831 <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> for <hi

                    elaborate and artistic production. The closing decade of Coleridge’s life was
                    wasted in what he himself calls “the woeful impotence of weak resolve.” In 1848
                    his health became sensibly affected, and he expired on the 6th of January 1849.
                    The prose style of Hartley Coleridge is marked by much finish and vivacity; but
                    his literary reputation must chiefly rest on his poetical remains. Of these the
                        <hi rend="italic">Sonnets,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Prometheus,</hi> an
                    unfinished lyric drama, are the finest. The influence of Wordsworth is
                    discernible in his poetry, but it does not on that account want originality.
