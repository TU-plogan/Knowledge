                    average elevation of 13,500 feet, presents a broad and massive outline, and has
                    a mean breadth of from fifteen to twenty miles. It is really a prolongation of
                    the Sierra Madre of Mexico, and up to about 40* N. lat. it forms the dividing
                    line between the Atlantic and the Pacific versants. Beginning at the south we
                    have the following peaks :—Mount Bowles, 14,106 feet; twelve miles northward,
                    Mount Howard, 14,208; eleven miles to the north-east, La Plata Mount, 14,126;
                    seven miles from La Plata, Grizzly Peak, 13,786, and Mount Elbert, 14,150; and
                    six miles from Mount Elbert, Massive Mountain, 14,192. For about eighteen miles
                    north of this last elevation the range is comparatively low, but it rises again
                    in the great terminal peak of the Holy Cross, which attains a height of 13,478
                    feet, and owes its name to the figure emblazoned on its summit by the white
                    lines of its snow-filled ravines. Second only in importance to the Sawatch range
                    are the Elk Mountains, which strike off from it in a south-west direction, and
                    extend for a distance of upwards of thirty miles. They <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0189-0162"/> are geologically interesting for the almost
                    unexampled displacement of the strata of which they are composed, and the
                    apparent confusion which has thence arisen. Among the most remarkable of its
                    separate summits are Italian Mountain, 13,431 feet in height, so called because
                    it displays the red, white, and green of the Italian national colours; Whiterock
                    Mountain, 13,847 feet; Teocalli Mountain, 13,274; Crested Butte, 12,014; Gothic
                    Mountain, 12,491; Snow Mass, 13,961; Maroon Mountain, 14,000; Castlepeak,
                    14,106; Capitol, 13,992, and Sopris Peak, 12,972. Of less importance, but still
                    distinct and well defined, are the Wet Mountains in the south-east, the Raton
                    Mountains in the south, and the Uncompahgre Mountains in the south-west. The
                    eastern series of elevations which abut on the region of the plains are known as
                    the Front Range, and present a fine bold outline, broken by several peaks of
                    about 14,000 feet or upwards in height. One of the most remarkable features of
                    the orography of Colorado is the unusual development of its upland valleys, or
                    “parks,” to use the term that has become distinctively their own. The four most
                    extensive are known respectively as the North, the Middle, the South, and the
                    San Luis; the last is by far the finest of the four. They stretch almost in a
                    line from the southern to the northern boundary of the State, just on the
                    western side of the Front Range, and occupy an average breadth of 50 miles. The
                    San Luis Park is, as it were, an “immense elliptical bowl” with an area of 9400
                    square miles, bounded on the E. by the Wet Mountains and the Sangre de Cristo
                    range, and on the W. by the Sierra de San Juan, which is part of the great
                    Sierra Miembres. Its surface is nearly as flat as a lake, and it almost
                    certainly was at one time the bed of a great inland sea. The centre of the
                    northern part, which bears the distinctive title of the Rincon, is still
                    occupied by a considerable sheet of water, fed by nineteen mountain streams, and
                    accustomed in the winter to overflow a large stretch of the neighbouring
                    savannah. The southern part, which continues onwards into New Mexico, is
                    traversed by the Rio del Norte and several of its tributaries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Rivers.—</hi> Of the rivers of the Atlantic versant, the most
                    important are the South Platte, the Arkansas, and the Rio Grande del Norte;
                    those of the Pacific are all members of the great Colorado River. The South
                    Platte has its head waters in Buckskin Mountain, and its earlier tributaries
                    flow from the slopes of the northern part of the Front Range. At its source at
                    Montgomery it has a height above the sea of 11,176 feet; at its exit from the
                    upper canon it is still 7623, but by the time it reaches Denver it is only 5176.
                    The Arkansas rises in the same district, at a height of 10,176 above the sea, in
                    Tennessee Pass, but as it leaves Chalk Creek has come down to 7877. In the upper
                    part of its course it passes through a cañon from 1000 to 1500 feet in depth.
                    The Rio Grande del Norte has its head waters in the Sawatch range and the Sangre
                    de Cristo range, and flows south through the valley San Luis Park. The river
                    which gives its name to the State belongs to the territory only by some of its
                    most important tributaries, of which it is sufficient to mention the Bear River,
                    and the Gunnison and Grand River, which unite before they pass into the
                    territory of Utah. The numerous minor “creeks” which feed the main streams must
                    not be forgotten in forming an idea of the main features of the country.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Minerals.—</hi> Colorado is pre-eminently a mineral district,
                    and to this fact it owes its colonization. It possesses extensive deposits of
                    gold and silver ore, and between the years 1859 and 1872 it furnished to the
                    United States mint upwards of $20,000,000 worth of the former metal and
                    $1,114,542 of the latter. Iron is pretty widely diffused, and zinc and copper
                    occur in many of the mines. Coal is also found extensively on both sides of the
                    main range of mountains; the area occupied by the Tertiary deposits being no
                    less than 7200 square miles, and the annual yield about 200,000 tons. The mining
                    districts are five in number, and are distinguished as the district of the
                    northern mines, the mines of the eastern base, the Conejos county mines, the
                    southern mines, and the mines of Summit County. At Murphy’s mine, about twelve
                    miles from Denver, the stratum is about 16 feet thick, and the percentage of
                    fixed carbon is found to be 55’31.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cUmate of</hi> Colorado is remarkable for its regularity
                    and salubrity. During the day the thermometer not unfrequently rises to 90° in
                    summer, but the nights are always cool and dewless. In winter the weather is
                    generally mild,—the lowest thermometric marking being only 7° below zero, in
                    Middle Park 15°, and in Denver 13°. Snow often lies deep in the higher inhabited
                    districts, but in the lowlands it is never more than 10 or 12 inches, and it
                    disappears again almost immediately. All through the year the atmosphere is so
                    dry and light that butcher meat can be preserved by the simplest process of
                    desiccation. Between July and October there is very little rain, day after day
                    bringing a bright and cloudless sky. “An air more delicious to breathe,” says
                    Bayard Taylor, “cannot anywhere be found; it is neither too sedative nor too
                    exciting, but has that pure, sweet, flexible quality which seems to support all
                    one’s happiest and healthiest moods.” For asthmatic and consumptive patients it
                    exercises a restorative influence which cannot be disputed; and the State
                    consequently promises to become an extensive sanatorium for the eastern
                    districts of the continent. The only flaw in the climate of Colorado is its
                    violent storms of wind, and in some parts of the country heavy falls of hail. It
                    would seem, however, that the humidity is on the increase; and whatever be its
                    cause, the change is quite perceptible since the colonization of the territory.
                    The Cache à la Poudre, for instance, is said to be yearly increasing in volume,
                    and streams which formerly dried up in the summer now maintain a continuous
                    flow. Among the secondary hygienic advantages of which Colorado can boast, the
                    mineral wells hold an important place. They occur in various parts of the
                    country, and belong to different classes. Chalybeate waters are found at
                    Manitou, Carlisle, and Red Creek; soda springs at Manitou, Trinidad, and Cañon
                    City; sulphur springs at Fairplay, on the Navajo River, and at Idaho springs;
                    and thermal springs, partly sulphur and partly soda, exist at Pagosa, in the
                    Middle Park, in Seguache County, at Wagon Wheel Gap, and at Del Norte. Manitou
                    is already becoming a fashionable watering-place; the fountains and the
                    surrounding land were purchased by a company in 1870; and in 1873 there were
                    already six large hotels and numerous private residences erected round the spot.
                    In the lowland districts water for drinking is very scarce; but supplies can
                    frequently be obtained by the sinking of Artesian wells.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Vegetation.—</hi> The mountains of Colorado were, till a
                    comparatively recent date, richly clothed with forest; but owing partly to
                    natural causes, and still more to the lavish consumption and reckless
                    destruction of the early settlers, the quantity of growing timber in the State
                    is exceedingly small, and before long, if restorative measures are not adopted,
                    the Colorado demand for wood will require to be supplied from without. Whole
                    mountain sides often present the appearance of monstrous cheavaux-de-frise, the
                    dead trunks of the wind-thrown pines being tossed about in all directions. The
                    principal trees, after the pine, are the so-called hemlock and cedar, the cotton
                    wood, and the aspen (or <hi rend="italic">Populus tremuloides).</hi> The minor
                    flora of the country is exceedingly rich; and especially in the plain <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0906-0190-0163"/> region the abundance of flowers is amazing.
                    “The colour of the landscape,” says Dilke, “is in summer green and flowers; in
                    fall time yellow and flowers; but flowers ever.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi> Wherever irrigation can be obtained the soil
                    of eastern Colorado is well fitted for agriculture. Wheat, oats, and barley
                    afford heavy crops; potatoes succeed except in the extreme south, and owing to
                    the dryness of the atmosphere are easily kept; onions vie in size and flavour
                    with any in the continent; beans might be grown more extensively, but they
                    suffer from the attacks of a small insect, possibly a species of <hi
                        rend="italic">Haltica;</hi> and almost all the garden products of the same
                    latitude in Europe can be satisfactorily cultivated. The wheat affords a very
                    white dry flour, and competes with the finest in the markets of the world. The
                    yield often reaches forty or fifty bushels per acre, and in exceptional cases
                    considerably exceeds this amount. In the higher districts—the parks and the
                    mountain-valleys—a greater proportion of ground is devoted to pasture either of
                    sheep or cattle. The native grasses are of excellent quality as fodder; and
                    during the winter the natural hay that has withered where it grew is preferred
                    by the cattle to the best that can be furnished by the labours of the
                    husbandman. In certain districts the pastoral departments of husbandry have had
                    to be abandoned, owing to the presence of poisonous plants, the most important
                    of which seems to be <hi rend="italic">Oxytropis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Lamberti;</hi> but these districts are of very limited extent The cost of
                    pasturing is merely nominal, as the cattle can be driven over extensive
                    districts, under the charge of Mexican or Indian herdsmen. Wool can be produced
                    for ten cents per tt&gt;., and a four-year-old steer for ten dollars. The chief
                    plague of the agriculturist is the locust, or grasshopper, as it is called in
                    America. This insect is usually hatched in the month of June, when the cereals
                    are well advanced; but occasionally in dryer and warmer seasons it appears as
                    early as April and does great damage to the young crops. Another insect, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Doryphora decemlineata,</hi> popularly known as the Colorado
                    Beetle (see p. 134 of the present volume), has recently become famous for its
                    attacks on the potato, not only in this State but as far east as Ohio. It
                    appears formerly to have fed on the <hi rend="italic">Soιanum</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">rostratum,</hi> but to have found the new tuber a better
                    habitat.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">History.—</hi> Recent explorations have shown that the western
                    parts, at least, of the Colorado territory were at one time inhabited by a
                    native American race of considerable civilization, who were perhaps connected or
                    even identical with the Moquis of the regions further south. The first important
                    European mission was that of Vasquez Coronado, despatched from Mexico in 1540.
                    In 1821 the Rocky Mountains were visited by 8. T. Long, the American engineer;
                    and part of the northern district was pretty fully explored by Captain J. C.
                    Fremont during the great expedition of 1843. It was not till 1858 that the
                    Indian tribes were disturbed in their sparsely-peopled hunting grounds; but in
                    that year the discovery of gold by W. G. Russell, a Georgian, on the banks of
                    the River Platte, near the present city of Denver, attracted general attention,
                    and bands of pioneers poured in from Kansas, Nebraska, and Missouri. During
                    1860, 1861, and 1862, there was a continuous stream of immigration; Denver,
                    Black Hawk, Golden City, Central City, Mount Vernon, and Nevada city were all
                    founded in 1859; next year saw the rise of Breckenridge, Empire, and Gold Hill;
                    George Town and Mill City were added in 1861, and Ward District was settled in
                    1862. In 1861 the region was organized as a territory in accordance with the
                    wish of the inhabitants, who had held a convention at Denver in 1859; its area
                    was declared to include 47,657,000 acres previously assigned to the territories
                    of Utah and Kansas, 10,262,400 from that of Nebraska, and 8,960,000 from New
                    Mexico, making a total of 66,880,000. The first governor was William Gilpin, a
                    Pennsylvanian by birth and a Quaker in religion, who has done a great deal for
                    the development of the territory, and was the originator of the scheme by which
                    it was made to include part of both slopes of the Sierra. From 1862 to 1865 the
                    natural progress of immigrational movement was checked, partly by the great
                    national struggle, and partly by the local Indian war which broke out in 1864,
                    and for a time rendered the routes extremely unsafe, and even threatened the
                    existence of the new settlements. Many of the sites, indeed, were deserted, and
                    large numbers of the miners left the country. In this way Empire greatly
                    decayed, and Gold Dirt and Bakerville absolutely disappeared. Happily it was
                    only the Indians of the plains who took part in the attacks, and though they
                    numbered from 10,000 to 15,000, they were quickly quelled. In 1865 the
                    immigration again flowed on; and it was found that at the census of 1870 the
                    population was 39,864 citizens, distributed into 9358 families, and inhabiting
                    10,009 houses. The proportion of males to females was 24,820 to 15,044. <hi
                        rend="subscript"> ¼</hi> Since that date the population has very rapidly
                    increased, and it was estimated at 120,000 in 1874. Colorado was received into
                    the Union as a State in 1877.</p>
