                <p><label type="entry">CURRAGH</label>, a level stretch of open ground in the county
                    of Kildare, in Ireland, famous for its race-course and its military camp. It has
                    an area of upwards of 4800 acres; and its soft natural sward, which has never
                    been broken by the plough, affords excellent pasture for sheep. From the
                    peculiarity of its herbage, the district is known in the neighbourhood as “the
                    short grass ;” and the young men of Kildare are jocularly distinguished as the
                    “boys of the short grass.” The land is the property of the Crown, which appoints
                    a special officer as the ranger of the Curragh; but the right of pasturage is
                    possessed by the landowners of the vicinity. The oldest mention of the Curragh
                    occurs in the <hi rend="italic">Liber</hi><hi rend="italic">Hymnorum</hi> (the
                    manuscript of which probably dates ſrom the 10th century) in connection with St
                    Bridget, who is said to have received a grant of the district from the king of
                    Leinster, and is popularly credited with the honour of having turned it into a
                    common. It is evident, however, £hat long before the days of the saint the downs
                    of Kildare had afforded a regular place of assembly for the people of the south
                    of Ireland, and the turf had already become familiar with the hoofs of the
                    race-horse. The <hi rend="italic">Aenach Colmain,</hi> or Curragh fair, is
                    frequently mentioned in the Irish annals from the Book of Lecan downwards; and
                    the plain appears from time to time as the scene of hostile encounters between
                    the kings of Meath, Leinster, and Offaly. In 1234 the earl of Pembroke was
                    defeated there by the viceroy of Ireland, Lord Geoffrey de Monte Marisco; and in
                    1406 the Irish under the prior of Connell were routed by the English. In 1789
                    the Curragh was the great rendezvous for the volunteers; andin 1804 it saw the
                    gathering of 30,000 United Irishman. The camp was established at the time of the
                    Crimean war, and is capable of accommodating 10,000 men; 6769 was the number of
                    persons registered at the census of 1871. The races, for which Sir William
                    Temple obtained a grant of £100 a year from Government, are held in April, June,
                    September, and October. The early history of the Curragh has been investigated
                    by Mr W. Μ. Hennessy, <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Irish
