                <p><label type="entry">CONCORDANCE</label>, a verbal index, in which all the leading
                    words used by an author are alphabetically arranged, with a reference to the
                    place where each occurs. The want of such a work first made itself felt in the
                    department of biblical interpretation, and the earliest concordances were those
                    of the Scriptures. Hence the application of the term has been generally limited
                    to a Biblical index. The first of these was compiled under the direction of
                    Cardinal Hugo de St Caro, who died about 1262. This concordance was formed from
                    the Vulgate translation, and it is said that nearly 500 Dominican monks were
                    employed on it. The earliest Hebrew concordance, called <hi rend="italic">The
                        Light of the Way,</hi> was produced by Rabbi Mordecai Nathan (1438-48), and
                    published at Venice in 1523. This was followed by the much more complete and
                    accurate work of Marius de Calasio, a Franciscan friar, whose concordance, based
                    on that of Nathan, was published at Rome in 1621. Buxtorf’s is the next Hebrew
                    concordance that deserves mention—a work marked by much care and scholarship,
                    but following the Masoretic divisions of the Old Testament, and so less likely
                    to be of use to the general student. It was published at Basel in 1632, and
                    abridged by Ravius, under the title <hi rend="italic">Fount of Zion</hi>
                    (Berlin, 1677). In 1754, Dr John Taylor of Norwich published his <hi
                        rend="italic">Hebrew Concordance, Adapted to the English Bible, Disposed
                        after the Manner of Buxtorf.</hi> This held the first place among works of
                    the kind, until the appearance of Dr Julius Fürst’s <hi rend="italic">Hebrew and
                        Chaldee Concordance.</hi> Of Greek concordances to the Septuagint, the best
                    is that compiled by Abraham Trommius, minister of Groningen, which was published
                    at Amsterdam in 1718. This is a work distinguished by great industry and

                    Septuagint, all save the book of Daniel, which was not at that time included in
                    the Septuagint version. Among Greek concordances to the New Testament, the
                    principal place is held by that of Erasmus Schmid (1638), reprinted in a
                    corrected form at Gotha in 1717. An abridged edition of this valuable work is
                    published by Messrs Bagster, in their <hi rend="italic">Polymicrian Series.</hi>
                    The first of English concordances was one to the New Testament, published at
                    London, before 1540. The earliest concordance to the entire Bible, in English,
                    was formed by Marbeck (London, 1550). This work is very imperfect, and refers
                    only to chapters, not to verses. It was followed by various others, among which
                    may be noted the <hi rend="italic">Cambridge Concordance</hi> (1689). The <hi
                        rend="italic">Englishman’s Concordance,</hi> designed for the use of
                    students who are acquainted only with the vernacular, is valuable for purposes
                    of exegesis, and the comparison of different English translations of the same
                    Greek and Hebrew words. But all of these were thrown into the shade by the full
                    and trustworthy work of Alexander Cruden. This is entitled <hi rend="italic">A
                        Complete Concordance to the Holy Scriptures of the Old and New
                        Testament,</hi> and was published in 1737. It has been frequently re-edited,
                    and still retains its place as an authority. Besides concordances to the entire
                    Bible, verbal indexes to separate portions of it have been prepared. There is a
                        <hi rend="italic">Concordance of the Proverbs of Solomon, and of his
                        Sentences in Ecclesiastes;</hi> a <hi rend="italic">Concordance of the
                        Metrical Psalms and Paraphrases</hi> (Edin., 1856); and a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Concordance of the Prayer-Book Version of the Psalms.</hi> There is also a
                        <hi rend="italic">Concordance of the Apocrypha.</hi> Concordances to other
                    works than the Scriptures are of more recent date. The very earliest is a <hi
                        rend="italic">Concordance of Feudal Law,</hi> compiled at the end of the
                    17th century. Twiss and Ayscough each prepared a concordance to the works of
                    Shakespeare, but these were both incomplete and incorrect. Mrs Μ. Cowden Clarke,
                    in 1847, supplied the deficiency by her elaborate <hi rend="italic">Concordance
                        to Shakespeare.</hi> A <hi rend="italic">Concordance to Milton</hi> was
                    published in 1867. The latest works of this class are the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Concordance to the Works of Alfred Tennyson,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >D.C.L.,</hi> by D. B. Brightwell (1869), and that to the works of Alex.
