                    group of Deer, the members of which are indigenous to the southern and eastern
                    parts of Asia and the adjacent islands, and which are separated by very marked
                    characters from all their allies. They are also called “Kijang” or “Kidjang,”
                    and constitute the genus <hi rend="italic">Cervulus</hi> of Blainville and most
                    zoologists, <hi rend="italic">Stylocerus</hi> of Hamilton Smith, and <hi
                        rend="italic">Prox</hi> of Ogilby. They are all of small size compared with
                    the majority of Deer, and have long bodies and rather short limbs and neck. The
                    antlers, which as in most Deer are present in the male only, are small and
                    simple, and the main stem or beam after giving off a very short brow-antler
                    inclines backwards and upwards, is unbranched and pointed, and when fully
                    developed curves inwards and somewhat downwards at the tip. These small antlers
                    are supported upon pedicles or permanent processes of the frontal bones, longer
                    than in any other Deer, and the front edges of which are continued downwards as
                    strong ridges passing along the sides of the face above the orbits, and serving
                    to protect the large frontal cutaneous glands which lie on their inner sides.
                    The lacrymal pit of the skull, in which is lodged the large anteorbital gland or
                    crumen, is of great depth and extent. The upper canine teeth of the males are
                    strongly developed and sharp, curving downwards, backwards, and outwards,
                    projecting visibly outside the mouth as tusks, and loosely implanted in their
                    sockets. In the females they are very much smaller. The limbs exhibit several
                    structural peculiarities not found in other Deer. The lateral digits of both
                    fore and hind feet are very little developed, the hoofs alone being present and
                    their bony supports (found in all other Deer) wanting. In the tarsus the
                    navicular, cuboid, and ectocuneiform bones are united.</p>
                <p>The Muntjaks are solitary animals, very rarely even two being seen together. They
                    are fond of hilly ground covered with forests, in the dense thickets of which
                    they pass most of their time, only coming to the skirts of the woods at morning
                    and evening to graze. They carry the head and neck low and the hind-quarters
                    high, their action in running being peculiar and not very elegant, somewhat
                    resembling the pace of a sheep, hence in southern India they bear the popular
                    but erroneous name of “jungle sheep.” Though with no power of sustained speed or
                    extensive leap, they are remarkable for flexibility of body and facility of
                    creeping through tangled underwood. Another popular name with Indian sportsmen
                    is “barking deer,” which is given on account of their alarm-cry, a kind of short
                    shrill bark, like that of a fox but louder, which may often be heard in the
                    jungles they frequent both by day and by night. When attacked by dogs the males
                    use their sharp canine teeth with great vigour, inflicting upon their opponents
                    deep and even dangerous wounds.</p>
                <p>There is some difference of opinion among zoologists as to the number of species
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Cervulus.</hi> Sir Victor Brooke, who
                    investigated this question in 1878 (see <hi rend="italic">Proceedings of the
                        Zoological Society of London</hi> for that year, p. 898), came to the
                    conclusion that there are certainly three which are quite well marked.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">C. muntjac,</hi> found in British India, Burmah, the Malay
                    Peninsula, Sumatra, Java, Hainan, Banca, and Borneo. The general colour is a
                    bright yellowish red, darker in the upper parts of the back; the fore-legs from
                    the shoulder downwards and the lower part of the hind legs, dark bluish brown;
                    anterior parts of the face from the muzzle to between the eyes, brown—a blackish
                    line running up the inside of each frontal pedestal; chin, throat, inside of
                    hind legs, and under surface of tail, white. The female has a black bristly tuft
                    of hair on the spot from which the pedicles of the antlers of the male grow. The
                    average length of the male, according to Jerdon, is 3⅜ feet, tail 7 inches,
                    height 26 to 28 inches. The female is a little smaller. The specimens from Java,
                    Sumatra, and Borneo are of larger size than those from the mainland, and may
                    possibly be of distinct species or race.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">C. lacrymans</hi> of Milne-Edwards, or Sclater’s Muntjak of
                    Swinhoe, from Moupin, and near Hangchow, China.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">C. reevesi,</hi> a very small species from southern
                    China.</p>
                <p>Although the limbs of the modern genus <hi rend="italic">Cervulus</hi> have
                    attained a considerable degree of specialization, the characters of the cranium,
                    antlers, and teeth are primitive, and almost exactly reproduce those of an
                    extinct deer of the middle Miocene period, the remains of which are found
                    abundantly at Sansan in the south of France and Steinheim in Wurtemberg, which
                    has been described under the names of <hi rend="italic">Dicroccrus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">elegans</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cervus</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">furcatus</hi> (see <hi rend="italic">Die Fauna von
                        Steinheim,</hi> by Oscar Fraas, Stuttgart, 1870).</p>
