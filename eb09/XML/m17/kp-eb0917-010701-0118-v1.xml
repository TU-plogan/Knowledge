                <p><label type="entry">MUSK-DEER</label>, an animal belonging to the genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Moschus,</hi> of the section <hi rend="italic">Pecora,</hi> a
                    division of the <hi rend="italic">Arti,odactyle Ungulates</hi> (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> vol. xv. p. 430), and allied to the Deer <hi
                        rend="italic">{Cervidx).</hi> In many respects it differs from the typical
                    members of that group and stands by itself as an isolated zoological form,
                    retaining characters belonging to the older and more generalized types of
                    ruminants before they were distinctly separated into the horned and the antlered
                    sections now dominant upon the earth. One of these characters is that both sexes
                    are entirely devoid of any sort of frontal appendage. In this, however, it
                    agrees with one genus of true deer <hi rend="italic">(JHydropotes') ∙,</hi> and,
                    as in that animal, the upper canine teeth of the males are remarkably developed,
                    long, slender, sharp-pointed, and gently curved, projecting downwards out of the
                    mouth with the ends turned somewhat backwards. Among the anatomical
                    peculiarities in which it differs from all true deer is the presence of a
                    gall-bladder.</p>
                <p>Although, owing to variations of colour presented by different individuals in
                    different localities and seasons, several nominal species have been described,
                    zoologists are now generally agreed that there is but one, the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Moschus</hi><hi rend="italic">moschiferus</hi> of Linnaeus. In size it is
                    rather less than the European roe-deer, being about 20 inches high at the
                    shoulder. Its limbs, especially the hinder ones, are long. The feet are
                    remarkable for the great development of the lateral pair of hoofs, and for the
                    freedom of motion they all present, so that they appear to have the power of
                    grasping projecting rocky points,—a power which must be of great assistance to
                    the animal in steadying it in its agile bounds among the crags of its native
                    haunts. The ears are large, and the tail quite rudimentary. The hair covering
                    the body is long, coarse, and of a peculiarly brittle and pith-like character,
                    breaking with the application of an extremely slight force; it is generally of a
                    greyish-brown colour, sometimes inclined to yellowish red, and often variegated
                    with lighter patches. The Musk-deer has a wide distribution over the highlands
                    of central and eastern Asia, including the greater part of southern Siberia, and
                    extends to Kashmir on the south-west and Cochin-China on the southeast, always,
                    however, at great elevations,—being rarely found in summer below 8000 feet above
                    the sea-level, and ranging as high as the limits of the thickets of birch,
                    rhododendron, and juniper, among which it mostly conceals itself in the
                    day-time. It is a hardy, solitary, and retiring animal, chiefly nocturnal in its
                    habits, and almost always found alone, rarely in pairs and never in herds. It is
                    exceedingly active and surefooted, having perhaps no equal in traversing rocks
                    and precipitous ground; and it feeds on moss, grass, and leaves of the plants
                    which grow on the mountains among which it makes its home.</p>
                <p>Most of the animals of the group to which the Musk-deer belongs, in fact the
                    large majority of mammals, have some portion of the cutaneous surface peculiarly
                    modified and provided with glands secreting some odorous and oleaginous
                    substance specially characteristic of the species. This, correlated with the
                    extraordinary development of the olfactory organs, appears to offer the
                    principal means by which animals in a state of nature become aware of the
                    presence of other individuals of their own species, or of those inimical to
                    them, even at very great distances, and hence it is of extreme importance both
                    to the wellbeing of the individual and to the continuance of the race. The
                    situation of this specially modified portion of skin is extremely various,
                    sometimes between the toes, as⅛n sheep, sometimes on the face in front of the
                    eyes, as in many deer and antelopes. Sometimes it is in the form of a simple
                    depression or shallow recess, often very deeply involuted, and in its most
                    complete state of development it forms a distinct pouch or sac with a narrow
                    tubular orifice. In this sac a considerable quantity of the secretion can
                    accumulate until discharged by the action of a compressor muscle which surrounds
                    it. This is the form taken by the special gland of the Musk-deer, which has made
                    the animal so well known, and which has proved the cause of an unremitting
                    persecution to its possessor. It is found in the male only, and is a sac about
                    the size of a small orange, situated beneath the skin of the abdomen, the
                    orifice being immediately in front of the preputial aperture. The secretion with
                    which the sac is filled is of dark-brown or chocolate colour, and when fresh
                    described as being of the consistence of “moist gingerbread,” but becoming dry
                    and granular after keeping. It has a peculiar and very powerful scent, which
                    when properly diluted and treated forms the basis of many of our most admired
                    perfumes. When the animal is killed the whole gland or “pod” is cut out and
                    dried, and in this form reaches the market of the Western world, chiefly through
                    China.</p>
