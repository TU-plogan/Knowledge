                    Temminck, to a little bird, which, from the straightness of its claws,—a
                    character somewhat exaggerated by him,— its large feet and spiny tail, he judged
                    to be generically distinct from any other form. Concerning its affinities much
                    doubt has long prevailed, and this has been only lately set at rest. The typical
                    species, <hi rend="italic">O. spinicauda,</hi> is from south-eastern Australia,
                    where it is said to be very local in its distribution, and strictly terrestrial
                    in its habits. In the course of time two other small birds from New Zealand,
                    where they are known as the “Whitehead” and “Yellowhead,” were referred to the
                    genus, under the names of <hi rend="italic">O. albicilla</hi><note

                        ochrocephala,</hi> and then the question of its affinity became more
                    interesting. By some systematists it was supposed to belong to the otherwise
                    purely Neotropical <hi rend="italic">Dendrocolaptidae,</hi> and in that case

                    Australian Region. Others considered it one of the nearest relatives of <hi
                        rend="italic">Menura,</hi> and if that view were correct it would add a
                    third form to the small section of <hi rend="italic">Pseudoscines</hi> (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Lyre-Bird,</hi> vol. xv. p. 115); while Sundevall, in 1872,
                    placed it not far from <hi rend="italic">Timelia,</hi> among a group the proper
                    sorting of which will probably for years tax the ingenuity of ornithologists.
                    The late Mr W. A. Forbes shewed <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Soc.,</hi> 1882,
                    p. 544) that this last position was the most correct, as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Orthonyx spinicauda</hi> proved on dissection to be one of the true <hi
                        rend="italic">Oscines,</hi> but yet to stand, so far as is known, alone
                    among birds of that group, or any other group of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Passeres,</hi> in consequence of the superficial course taken by the (left)
                    carotid artery, which is nowhere contained in the subvertebral canal. Whether
                    this discovery will require the segregation of the genus as the representative
                    of a separate Family <hi rend="italic">Orthonycidae</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    which has been proposed by Mr Salvin <hi rend="italic">(Catal. Coll.
                        Strickland,</hi> p. 294)—remains to be seen. Forbes also demonstrated that
                    one at least of the two New-Zealand species above mentioned, <hi rend="italic"
                        >0. ochrocephala,</hi> had been wrongly referred to this genus, and they
                    therefore at present stand as <hi rend="italic">Clitonyx.</hi> This is a point
                    of some little importance in its bearing on the relationship of the fauna of the
                    two countries, for <hi rend="italic">Orthonyx</hi> was supposed to be one of the
                    few genera of Land-birds common to both.</p>
                <p>The typical species of Orthonyx—for the scientific name has been adopted in
                    English—is rather larger than a Skylark, coloured above not unlike a
                    Hedge-Sparrow. The wings are, however, barred with white, and the chin, throat,
                    and breast are in the male pure white, but of a bright reddish-orange in the
                    female. The remiges are very short, rounded, and much incurved, showing a bird
                    of weak flight. The rectrices are very broad, the shafts stiff, and towards the
                    tip divested of barbs. Two other species that seem rightly to belong to the
                    genus have been described— <hi rend="italic">0. spaldingi</hi> from Queensland,
                    of much greater size than the type, and with a jet-black plumage, and <hi
                        rend="italic">0.</hi><hi rend="italic">novae-guineae,</hi> from the great
                    island of that name, which seems closely to resemble <hi rend="italic">0.
                        spinicauda.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
