                    (1583-1654), Swedish statesman, was born at Fanö in Upland on the 16th of June
                    1583. He studied theology at Rostock, Wittenberg, and Jena; and in 1602, having
                    spent some time in visiting German courts, he returned to Sweden to take the
                    oath of allegiance to Charles IX., whose service he entered. In 1606 he was sent
                    as ambassador to the court of Mecklenburg, and in 1609 he became a member of the
                    Swedish senate. When Gustavus Adolphus succeeded to the throne, in 1611,
                    Oxenstierna was appointed chancellor, and in 1613 he was plenipotentiary in the
                    negotiations for the conclusion of peace between Sweden and Denmark. In 1614 he
                    went -with the king to Livonia, and helped to bring about the cessation of
                    hostilities between Sweden and Russia. After the intervention of Gustavus in the
                    Thirty Years’ War, Oxenstierna was made governor-general of all the districts in
                    Prussia which had been overrun by the Swedes; and, when the Imperialists were
                    preparing to besiege Stralsund, he negotiated with the duke of Pomerania for the
                    substitution of Swedish for Danish troops in the town, going subsequently to
                    Denmark to obtain the sanction of the Danish king. While Gustavus pushed on to
                    Franconia and Bavaria, Oxenstierna was entrusted with the supreme direction of
                    affairs, both political and military, in the Rhine country, and he took up his
                    headquarters at Mainz. In 1632, when Gustavus fell at the battle of Liitzen, the
                    responsibility for the maintenance of the Protestant cause fell chiefly upon
                    Oxenstierna; and in one of the greatest crises in the history of the world he
                    displayed splendid courage, discretion, and resource. At a congress held in
                    Heilbronn he was appointed director of the evangelical confederation, and in
                    this capacity he went <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0104-0093"/> to France and Holland to secure the aid of
                    these countries against the emperor. On his return he found the Protestants in a
                    very desponding mood. The battle of Nördlingen had been lost; the allies
                    distrusted one another; the troops were dissatisfied and resented any attempt to
                    subject them to strict discipline. Oxenstierna laboured indefatigably to restore
                    the confidence of his party, and to a large extent he succeeded. He then
                    returned, in 1636, to Sweden, where he resigned his exceptional powers and
                    resumed his place in the senate as chancellor of the kingdom. He acted also as
                    one of five guardians of Queen Christina, whom he carefully instructed in what
                    seemed to him the true methods of administration. Oxenstierna had the reputation
                    of being one of the wisest statesmen of his age, and during his absence from his
                    country he had drawn up the scheme of a system of government which had been
                    accepted in 1634 by the Swedish estates. Abroad he upheld vigorously the honour
                    of Sweden, and at home he maintained strict economy in public expenditure, while
                    encouraging, according to the ideas of his time, the development of industry and
                    the arts. In 1645, when he went back to Sweden after taking part in the
                    negotiations with Denmark at Brömsebro, he was raised to the rank of count by
                    the queen. He died on the 28th of August 1654.</p>
