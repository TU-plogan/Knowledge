                <p><label type="entry">STEINER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Jakob</hi></label> (1796—1863),
                    one of the greatest geometricians of all ages, was born on the 18th of March
                    1796 at the Swiss village of Utzendorf (canton Bern). Here he grew up helping
                    his father in his agricultural pursuits, learning to write only at the age of
                    fourteen. At eighteen he became a pupil of Pestalozzi, and afterwards studied at
                    Heidelberg. Thence he went to Berlin, earning a livelihood here as in Heidelberg
                    by giving private lessons. Here he became acquainted with Crelle, who,
                    encouraged by his ability and by that of Abel, then also staying at Berlin,
                    founded his famous <hi rend="italic">Journal</hi> (1826). After Steiner’s
                    publication (1832) of his <hi rend="italic">Systematische Entwickelungen</hi> he
                    got, through Jacobi’s exertions, who was then professor at Königsberg, an
                    honorary degree of that university; and through the influence of Jacobi and of
                    the brothers Alexander and Wilhelm von Humboldt a new chair of geometry was
                    founded for him at Berlin (1834). This he occupied till his death, which took
                    place in Bern on April 1, 1863, after years of bad health.</p>
                <p>Steiner’s mathematical work was confined to geometry. This he treated
                    synthetically, to the total exclusion of analysis, w'hich he hated, and he is
                    said to have considered it a disgrace to synthetical geometry if equal or higher
                    results were obtained by analytical methods. In his own field he surpassed all
                    his contemporaries. His investigations are distinguished by their great
                    generality, by the fertility of his resources, and by a rigour in his proofs
                    which rivals that of the ancients, so that he has been considered the greatest
                    geometrical genius since the time of Apollonius.</p>
                <p>In his <hi rend="italic">Systematische Entwickelung der Abhängigkeit
                        geometrischer Gestalten von einander</hi> he laid the foundation on which
                    synthetic geometry in its present form rests. He introduces what are now called
                    the geometrical forms (the row, flat pencil, &amp;c.), and establishes between
                    their elements a one-one correspondence, or, as he calls it, makes them
                    projective. He next gives by aid of these projective rows and pencils a new
                    generation of conics and ruled quadric surfaces, “which leads quicker and more
                    directly than former methods into the inner nature of conics and reveals to us
                    the organic connexion of their innumerable properties and mysteries. In this
                    work also, of which unfortunately only one volume appeared instead of the
                    projected five, we see for the first time the<pb break="no"

                    beginning as an immediate outflow of the most fundamental properties of the
                    plane, the line, and the point, so that a proof of its correctness is not
                    required.</p>
                <p>In a second little volume, <hi rend="italic">Die geometrischen Constructionen
                        ausgeführt mittelst der geraden Linie und eines festen Kreises</hi> (1833),
                    he shows, what had been already suggested by Poncelet, how all problems of the
                    second order can be solved by aid of the straight-edge alone without the use of
                    compasses, as soon as one circle is given on the drawing paper.</p>
                <p>The rest of Steiner’s writings are found in numerous papers mostly published in
                        <hi rend="italic">Crelle's Journal,</hi> the first volume of which contains
                    his first four papers. The most important are those relating to algebraical
                    curves and surfaces, especially the short paper <hi rend="italic">Allgemeine
                        Eigenschaften algebraischer Curvem</hi> This contains only results, and
                    there is no indication of the method by which they were obtained, so that,
                    according to Hesse, “they are, like Fermat’s theorems, riddles to the present
                    and future generations.” Eminent analysts succeeded in proving some of the
                    theorems, but it was reserved to Cremona to prove them all, and that by a
                    uniform synthetic method, in his book on algebraical curves. Other important
                    investigations relate to maxima and minima. Starting from simple elementary
                    propositions, Steiner advances to the solution of problems which analytically
                    require the calculus of variation, but which at the time altogether surpassed
                    the powers of that calculus. Connected with this is the paper <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vom Krümmingsschwerpuncte ebener Curven,</hi> which contains numerous
                    properties of pedals and roulettes, especially of their areas.</p>
                <p>Steiner’s papers have been collected and published in two volumes by the Berlin
                    Academy. His lectures on synthetic geometry, containing the theory of conics,
                    have been published since his death, edited by Geiser and Schröter. Biographical
                    notices are contained in Geiser’s pamphlet <hi rend="italic">Zur Erinnerung an
                        J. Steiner</hi> (Schaffhausen, 1874).</p>
