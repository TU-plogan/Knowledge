                    (1617-1655), one of the founders, of the French academy of painting, was born
                    19th Novem<pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit22newyrich/page/n643/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0643-0620"/> ber 1617 at Paris, where he passed his whole
                    life, and where he died on 30th April 1655. His early death and retired habits
                    have combined to give an air of romance to his simple history, which has been
                    decorated with as many fables as that of Claude. We are told that, persecuted by
                    Lebrun, who was jealous of his ability, he became the intimate friend and
                    correspondent of Poussin, and it is added that, broken-hearted at the death of
                    his wife, Le Sueur retired to the monastery of the Chartreux and died in the
                    arms of the prior. All this, however, is pure fiction. The facts of Le Sueur’s
                    life are these. He was the son of Cathelin Le Sueur, a turner and sculptor in
                    wood, who placed his son with Vouet, in whose studio he rapidly distinguished
                    himself. Admitted at an early age into the guild of master-painters, he left
                    them to take part in establishing the academy of painting and sculpture, and was
                    one of the first twelve professors of that body. Some paintings, illustrative of
                    the Hypnerotomachia Polyphili, which were reproduced in tapestry, brought him
                    into notice, and his reputation was further enhanced by a series of decorations
                    (Louvre) in the mansion of Lambert de Thorigny, which he left uncompleted, for
                    their execution was frequently interrupted by other commissions. Amongst these
                    were several pictures for the apartments of the king and queen in the Louvre,
                    which are now missing, although they were entered in Bailly’s inventory (1710);
                    but several works produced for minor patrons have come down to us. In the
                    gallery of the Louvre are the Angel and Hagar, from the mansion of De Tonnay
                    Charente; Tobias and Tobit, from the Fieubet collection; several pictures
                    executed for the church of Saint Gervais; the Martyrdom of St Lawrence, from
                    Saint Germain de l'Auxerrois; two very fine works from the destroyed abbey of
                    Marmoutiers; St Paul preaching at Ephesus,—one of Le Sueur’s most complete and
                    thorough performances, painted for the goldsmiths’ corporation in 1649; and his
                    famous series of the Life of St Bruno, executed in the cloister of the
                    Chartreux. These last have more personal character than anything else which Le
                    Sueur produced, and much of their original beauty survives in spite of injuries
                    and restorations and removal from the wall to canvas. The Louvre also possesses
                    many fine drawings (reproduced by Braun), of which Le Sueur left an incredible
                    quantity, chiefly executed in black and white chalk. His pupils, who aided him
                    much in his work, were his wife’s brother, Th. Gousse, and three brothers of his
                    own, as well as Claude Lefebvre and Patel the landscape painter. Most of his
                    works have been engraved, chiefly by Picart, B. Audran, Seb. Leclerc, Drevet,
                    Chauveau, Poilly, and Desplaces. Le Sueur’s work lent itself readily to the
                    engraver’s art, for he was a charming draughtsman; he had a truly delicate
                    perception of varied shades of grave and elevated sentiment, and possessed the
                    power to render them. His graceful facility in composition was always restrained
                    by a very fine taste, but his works often fail to please completely, because,
                    producing so much, he had too frequent recourse to conventional types, and
                    partly because he rarely saw colour except with the cold and clayey quality
                    proper to the school of Vouet; yet his St Paul at Ephesus and one or two other
                    works show that he was not naturally deficient in this sense, and whenever we
                    get direct reference to nature—as in the monks of the St Bruno series—we
                    recognize his admirable power to read and render physiognomy of varied and
                    serious type.</p>
