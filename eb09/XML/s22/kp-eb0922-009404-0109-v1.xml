                    (the official form), a city of Italy, in the province of Ancona, in 43° 43' 16"
                    N. lat., on the coast of the Adriatic, 17 miles by rail north of Ancona. It is
                    well built, with broad and well-paved streets, and has the general appearance of
                    a thriving commercial town. A modern cathedral, erected subsequent to 1787, a
                    large Jewish synagogue, a theatre, the communal buildings, and the old palace of
                    the dukes of Urbino are the more notable buildings. The communal library was
                    founded by Cardinal Nicola Antonelli in 1767; and the principal hospital and one
                    of the orphanages date from 1534. The port is formed by the lower reaches of the
                    Misa, a small stream which flows through the town between solid embankments
                    constructed of Istrian marble. Between July 20 and August 8 Sinigaglia annually
                    holds one of the largest fairs in Italy, which dates originally from 1200, when
                    Sergius, count of Sinigaglia, received from the count of Marseilles, to whose
                    daughter he was affianced, certain relics of Mary Magdalene. The fair has
                    diminished in importance since the opening of the railway, but formerly it used
                    to be visited by merchants from France, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and
                    especially the Levant. The population, exclusive of the suburbs, was 10,501 in
                    1861 and 6634 (commune 22,499) in 1881.</p>
                <p>Sinigaglia is the ancient <hi rend="italic">Sena (Σήvη)</hi> or (to distinguish
                    it from Sena Julia, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> Siena) <hi rend="italic">Sena
                        Gallica,</hi> a town of the Galli Senones (<hi rend="italic">Σήvωvες</hi>),
                    whose name appears as Senogallia as early as Pliny. Sena was made a Roman colony
                    immediately after the conquest of the Senones in 289 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.</hi> It was the rendezvous of the consuls Livius and Nero before the
                    battle of the Metaurus, also known as the battle of Sena, in which Hasdrubal was
                    defeated (207 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>). The sack of the town by Pompey,
                    Sulla’s lieutenant, in 82 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.,</hi> is the only other
                    notable fact in its ancient annals. Ravaged by Alaric, fortified by the exarch
                    Longinus, and again laid waste by the Lombards in the 8th century and by the
                    Saracens in the 9th, Sinigaglia was at length brought so low by the Guelf and
                    Ghibelline wars, and especially by the severities of Guido de Montefeltro, that
                    it was chosen by Dante as the typical instance of a ruined city. In the 15th
                    century it was captured and recaptured again and again by the Malatesta and
                    their opponents. Sigismond Malatesta of Bimini erected strong fortifications
                    round the town in 1450-1455. The lordship of Sinigaglia was bestowed by Pius I
                    I. on his nephew Antonio Piccolomini, but the people of the town in 1464 placed
                    themselves anew under Paul II., and Giacomo Piccolomini in 1472 failed in his
                    attempt to seize the place. Sixtus VI. assigned the lordship to the Della Rovere
                    family, from whom it was transferred to Lorenzo di Medici in 1516. After 1624 it
                    formed part of the legation of Urbino.</p>
