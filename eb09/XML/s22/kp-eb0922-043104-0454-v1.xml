                    (1825-1883), mathematician and physicist, was born in London, 11th January 1825.
                    His father, Andrew Spottiswoode, who was descended from an ancient Scottish
                    family, represented Colchester in parliament for some years, and in 1831 became
                    junior partner in the firm of Eyre &amp; Spottiswoode, printers. William was
                    educated at Laleham, Eton, Harrow, and Balliol College, Oxford. His bent for
                    science showed itself while he was still a schoolboy, and indeed his removal
                    from Eton to Harrow is said to have been occasioned by an accidental explosion
                    which occurred whilst he was performing an experiment for his own amusement. At
                    Harrow he obtained in 1842 a Lyon scholarship, and at Oxford in 1845 a
                    first-class in mathematics, in 1846 the junior and in 1847 the senior university
                    mathematical scholarship. In 1846 Spottiswoode left Oxford to take his father’s
                    place in the business, in which he was engaged until his death. In 1847 he
                    issued five pamphlets entitled <hi rend="italic">Meditationes Analytics,.</hi>
                    This was his first publication of original mathematical work; and from this time
                    scarcely a year passed in which he did not give to the world further
                    mathematical researches. In 1856 Spottiswoode travelled in eastern Russia, and
                    in 1860 in Croatia and Hungary; of the former expedition he has left an
                    interesting record entitled <hi rend="italic">A Tarantasse Journey through
                        Eastern Russia in the Autumn of 1856</hi> (London, 1857). In 1870 he was
                    elected president of the London Mathematical Society. In 1871 he began to turn
                    his attention to experimental physics, his earlier researches bearing upon the
                    polarization of light and his later work upon the electrical discharge in
                    rarefied gases. He wrote a popular treatise upon the former subject for the
                    “Nature” series (1874). In 1878 he was elected president of the British
                    Association, and in the same year president of the Royal Society, of which he
                    had been a fellow since 1853. He died of fever on 27th June 1883, and was buried
                    in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>As a mathematician he occupied himself with many branches of his favourite
                    science, more especially with higher algebra, including the theory of
                    determinants, with the general calculus of symbols, and with the application of
                    analysis to geometry and mechanics. The following brief review of his
                    mathematical work is quoted from the obituary notice which appeared in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Proceedings of the Royal Society</hi> (vol. xxxviii. p.
                    34):—“The interesting series of communications on the contact of curves and
                    surfaces which are contained in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                        Transactions</hi> of 1862 and<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0455-0432"/> subsequent years would alone account for the
                    high rank he obtained as a mathematician. . . . The mastery which he had
                    obtained over the mathematical symbols was so complete that he never shrank from
                    the use of expressions, however complicated—nay, the more complicated they were
                    the more he seemed to revel in them—provided they did not sin against the ruling
                    spirit of all his work,— symmetry. To a mind imbued with the love of
                    mathematical symmetry the study of determinants had naturally every attraction.
                    In 1851 Mr Spottiswoode published in the form of a pamphlet an account of some
                    elementary theorems on the subject. This having fallen out of print, permission
                    was sought by the editor of <hi rend="italic">Crelle</hi> to reproduce it in the
                    pages of that journal. Mr Spottiswoode granted the request and undertook to
                    revise his work. The subject had, however, been so extensively developed in the
                    interim that it proved necessary not merely to revise it but entirely to rewrite
                    the work, which became a memoir of 116 pages. To this, the first elementary
                    treatise on determinants, much of the rapid development of the subject is due.
                    The effect of the study on Mr Spottiswoode’s own methods was most pronounced;
                    there is scarcely a page of his mathematical writings that does not bristle with
                    determinants.” The Royal Society’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of Scientific
                        Papers</hi> (vols. i. - viii. ) shows a list of 49 papers by Spottiswoode,
                    to which must be added about 66 more, the titles of which have not yet been
                    printed in that catalogue. These were published principally in the <hi

                    papers, arranged according to the several journals in which they originally
                    appeared, with short notes upon the less familiar memoirs, is given in <hi
