                <p><label type="entry">SMITH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Alexander</hi></label>
                    (1830-1867), was the most prominent representative of the so-called “spasmodic”
                    school of poetry, whose peculiarities first gained for it a hasty reputation,
                    and then, having suffered under closer critical examination, it almost as
                    speedily dropped out of mind again. Smith has never yet perhaps had his true
                    position assigned to him. His first book, <hi rend="italic">A Life Drama and
                        other Poems</hi> (1853), which made his name, was a work of real promise.
                    Although deficient in dramatic grasp of subject, in restraint of expression, in
                    metrical quality, and although showing too obviously the influence of Keats and
                    Tennyson in certain exaggerations of epithet and phrase, the book yet contains
                    evidence of a poetic faculty which might, under more fortunate conditions, have
                    developed into genuine power. Alexander Smith was one of those writers who
                    require the critical safeguards of the schools to chasten their somewhat
                    importunate energies; and for want of these academic restrictions he wasted his
                    powers in discursive experiments of not much abiding value. Born at Kilmarnock
                    on the last day of 1830, he received the usual schooling common at that time;
                    and, his parents being too poor to send him to college, he was placed in a linen
                    factory to follow his father’s trade of a pattern designer. His literary
                    proclivities, however, soon showed themselves, and from time to time his early
                    poems appeared in the <hi rend="italic">Glasgow Citizen,</hi> in whose editor,
                    James Hedderwick, he found a sympathizing and appreciative friend. His poems,
                    having attracted the attention also of the Rev. George Gilfillan, found through
                    him an opening in the London <hi rend="italic">Citizen. A Life Drama and other
                        Poems,</hi> published in 1853, speedily ran through several editions, and
                    gained Smith the appointment of secretary to Edinburgh university in 1854. In
                    the same year Sydney Dobell, whose name is now familiarly associated with
                    Smith’s, came to Edinburgh, and an acquaintanceship at once sprang up between
                    the two, which resulted in their collaboration in a book of <hi rend="italic"
                        >War Sonnets,</hi> inspired by the Crimean War, which was published in 1855.
                    The volumes of verse issued independently by Alexander Smith in the ensuing
                    years did not receive much attention; their author then turned himself to prose,
                    after publishing <hi rend="italic">City Poems</hi> in 1857 and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Edwin of Deira,</hi> a Northumbrian epic poem, in 1861. His first prose
                    work was <hi rend="italic">Dreamthorpe,</hi> 1863; it was followed in 1865 by
                        <hi rend="italic">A Summer in Skye,</hi> which contains his best prose
                    writing, and is full of a quiet charm and true sympathy with nature. His last
                    work was an experiment in fiction, <hi rend="italic">Alfred Hagart's
                        Household</hi> (1866), which ran first through <hi rend="italic">Good Words.
                        In</hi> this the same faults of construction, conjoined with the same
                    incidental grace of description, that show themselves in his larger poems are
                    repeated. The strain produced by his literary and other work began to tell
                    towards the end of 1866, and his death followed on 5th January 1867.</p>
                <p>A memoir of Smith by P. P. Alexander is prefixed to a volume of remains, entitled
                        <hi rend="italic">Last Leaves,</hi> in which will be found a fairly complete
                    account of his life and writings.</p>
