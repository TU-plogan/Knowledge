                <p><label type="entry">SILO</label>. A modern silo is a pit or erection in which
                    green crops are preserved in an undried condition for fodder. The term is
                    derived from the Greek <hi rend="italic">σιρός</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                        >sirus),</hi> a pit for holding grain. It is only of recent years that <hi
                        rend="italic">ensilage, i.e.,</hi> the preservation of green food for cattle
                    by partial fermentation in silos, has become an important feature in
                    agricultural economy. In various parts of Germany a method of preserving green
                    fodder precisely similar to that used in the case of sauerkraut (see vol. iv. p.
                    618) has prevailed for upwards of a century. Special attention was first
                    directed to the practice of ensilage by a French agriculturist, ' M. Auguste
                    Goffart of Sologne near Orleans, who in 1877 published a work <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Manuel de la Culture et de l'Ensilage des Mais et autres Fourrages
                        Verts)</hi> detailing the experiences of many years in preserving green
                    crops in silos. An English translation of M. Goffart’s book by Mr J. B. Brown
                    was published in New York in 1879, and, as various experiments had been
                    previously made in the United States in the way of preserving green crops in
                    pits, M. Goffart’s experience attracted considerable attention. The conditions
                    of American dairy farming proved eminently suitable for the ensiling of green
                    maize fodder; and the success of the method was soon indisputably demonstrated
                    among the New England farmers. The favourable results obtained in America led to
                    much discussion and to the extensive introduction of the system in the United
                    Kingdom, where, with different conditions, success has been more qualified, but
                    still highly encouraging.</p>
                <p>It has been abundantly proved that ensilage forms a wholesome and nutritious food
                    for cattle. It can be substituted for root crops with advantage, because it is
                    succulent and digestible; milk resulting from it is good in quality and taste;
                    it can be secured largely irrespective of weather; it carries over grass from
                    the period of great abundance and waste to times when none would otherwise be
                    available; and a larger number of cattle can be supported on a given area by the
                    use of ensilage than is possible by the use of green crops.</p>
                <p>A silo should have a depth of at least 15 feet, and may either be a pit or a
                    building above ground, provided it is water-tight and, as far as possible,
                    air-tight. The crops suitable for ensilage are the ordinary grasses, clovers,
                    lucerne, vetches, oats, rye, and maize; but various weeds may also be stored in
                    silos with good, results, notably spurrey, (<hi rend="italic">Spergula
                        arvensis),</hi> a most troublesome plant in poor light soils. As a rule the
                    crop should be mown when in full flower, and deposited in the silo on the day of
                    its cutting. Fair dry weather is not essential; but it is found that when
                    moisture, natural and extraneous, exceeds 75 per cent. of the whole, good
                    results are not obtained. The material is spread in uniform layers over the
                    floor of the silo, and closely packed and trodden down. If possible, not more
                    than a foot or thereby should be added daily, so as to allow the mass to settle
                    down closely, and to heat uniformly throughout. When the silo is quite filled a
                    layer of straw or some other dry porous substance is spread over the surface,
                    then it is covered with boards, and a pressure of not less than 100 lb per
                    square foot is applied by weighting or other mechanical means.</p>
                <p>A silo thus contains, to begin with, a mass of living vegetable cells surrounded
                    with a minimum of oxygen. The activity of the cells continuing, oxygen is
                    absorbed and carbonic acid evolved, and part of the starch of the plants is
                    converted into sugar. In the atmosphere of carbonic acid thus created the acid
                    ferments manifest their vitality, and acetic, lactic, and butyric acids are
                    developed at the expense of the starch and sugar. These chemical changes are
                    accompanied with an evolution of heat, and the temperature of the mass rises,
                    till, when it attains 122° Fahr., the action of the ferments is arrested. Should
                    the heat rise to 150° the vitality of the vegetable cells themselves is
                    destroyed; and also when the available oxygen is exhausted chemical change
                    ceases and sweet silage is produced. When from excess of moisture or other cause
                    the temperature of the silo does not reach 122° Fahr., the acid ferments are not
                    killed, and they go on evolving chiefly acetic and lactic acids, the results
                    being sour silage. These ferments, requiring nitrogen for their existence, act
                    on the nitrogenous constituents of the plants, rendering the albuminoids partly
                    soluble, evolving peptones, and by further splitting up producing amides, urea,
                    and ammonia. The production of sour silage is accompanied by much greater
                    transformation and loss than is incident to sweet silage; and in extreme action
                    the material acquires a most disagreeable odour. There is, however, no sharp
                    line of distinction between the two, and both varieties are eaten freely by
                    stock. Frequently a considerable loss occurs around the edges, and at other
                    points where air gets access to the mass, by mildewing. See <hi rend="italic"
