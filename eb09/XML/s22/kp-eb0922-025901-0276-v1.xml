                        of</hi></label> (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1500- 1552), eldest brother of
                    Jane Seymour, Henry VIII.’s third wife, was created earl of Hertford in 1537, on
                    the birth of his nephew, afterwards Edward VI. In 1544 he commanded in the war
                    with Scotland, and sacked Edinburgh. Next year he again commanded against the
                    Scots; and he was employed by Henry in many important negotiations throughout
                    the latter part of his reign. On the accession of Edward VI. he was made
                    protector by the council, and was soon afterwards created duke of Somerset. He
                    at once made use of his power to encourage the extreme Reformers, and a general
                    destruction of ecclesiastical works of art was the result. In September 1547,
                    finding the Scots unwilling to listen to his proposals for a marriage between
                    Edward and Mary Stuart, he marched an army into Scotland and won the battle of
                    Γinkie Cleugh,—a worthless victory, which only threw Scotland into the arms of
                    France. War with that country followed, and the result was the loss of Boulogne.
                    Equally disastrous was the protector’s domestic policy. He was animated by a
                    dislike of arbitrary government, and by a desire to improve the condition of the
                    poor, but was at the same time a slave to his own ambition. He<pb break="no"

                    inconsiderate speed, repealed the Treason Acts of Henry VIII.’s reign, and
                    issued a commission to inquire into agricultural distress. The agitation into
                    which these measures threw the country produced insurrections in the west and
                    east, which were with some difficulty suppressed. Irritated by his arrogance,
                    rashness, and incapacity, the council, in October 1549, turned against him,
                    deprived him of the protectorate, and confined him in the Tower. Released in
                    1550, he recovered much of his influence through the misgovernment of his
                    successors, and contemplated a return to power at their expense. His plans being
                    discovered, he was tried on a charge of felony, and executed on January 22,
                    1552. His popularity was immense, and in some respects deserved; but he aspired
                    to a tyranny, and had he retained or recovered power he would have gone far
                    towards ruining the nation.</p>
