                    tropical members of the group, and especially by those of the Malayan region,
                    where nearly all the numerous species are brilliantly marked, and many are
                    ornamented with variously coloured longitudinal stripes along their bodies. One
                    of the commonest and best known of the striped species is the little Indian Palm
                    Squirrel <hi rend="italic">(S. palmarum),</hi> which in large numbers runs about
                    every Indian village. Another Oriental species (<hi rend="italic">S</hi>. <hi
                        rend="italic">caniceps)</hi> presents almost the only known instance among
                    mammals of the temporary assumption during the breeding season of a distinctly
                    ornamental coat, corresponding to the breeding plumage of birds. For the greater
                    part of the year the animal is of a uniform grey colour, but about December its
                    back becomes a brilliant orange-yellow, which lasts until about March, when it
                    is again replaced by grey. The squirrel shown in fig. 2 is a native of Burmah
                    and Tenasserim, and is closely allied to <hi rend="italic">S</hi>. <hi
                        rend="italic">caniceps,</hi> but goes through no seasonal change of
                    colour.</p>
                <p>The number of species in the genus <hi rend="italic">Sciurus</hi> is about 75, of
                    which 3 belong to the Palaearctic, 15 to the Ethiopian, about 40 to the
                    Oriental, and 16 to the combined Nearctic and Neotropical regions.</p>
                <p>Genus Rheithrosciurus.</p>
                <p>A single very striking species of squirrel, confined to Borneo, and as yet only
                    known from three or four examples, has been separated generically under the
                    above name. The general shape of its skull is very different from that of other
                    squirrels; but its most peculiar characteristic is the presence of from seven to
                    ten minute parallel vertical grooves running down the front face of its
                    incisors, both above and below, no other squirrel having really grooved incisors
                    at all, and no other member of the whole order of rodents incisor grooves
                    resembling these.. Its premolars only number <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> /
                        <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> and its molars are simpler and less ridged than
                    in the other genera. This squirrel (<hi rend="italic">Rh</hi>. <hi rend="italic"
                        >macrotis)</hi> is a magnificent animal, far larger than the English
                    species, with an enormously long bushy tail, long tufted ears, and black and
                    white bands down its sides.</p>
                <p>Genus Xenus.</p>
                <p>Fur coarse and spiny. Claws long and comparatively straight. Ear-conches minute
                    or entirely absent. Skull with the post-orbital processes short and directed
                    backwards, the bony palate prolonged considerably behind the tooth-row, and the
                    external ridge on the front face of the anterior zygoma-root more developed, and
                    continued much further upwards, than in <hi rend="italic">Sciurus.</hi>
                    Premolars <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>; molars
                    as in <hi rend="italic">Sciurus.</hi> This genus contains four well-marked
                    species, known as Spiny Squirrels, all natives of Africa. They are terrestrial
                    in their habits, living in burrows which they dig for themselves. <hi
                        rend="italic">X. getulus,</hi> a striped species of North Africa, has much
                    the size and appearance of the Indian palm squirrel; the others are all a little
                    larger than the English squirrel.</p>
                <p>Genus Tamias.</p>
                <p>The members of this genus are characterized by the possession of internal
                    cheek-pouches, and by their style of coloration, all being ornamented on the
                    back with alternate bands of light and dark colour. Their skulls are slenderer
                    and lighter than those of the true squirrels, from which they differ in several
                    unimportant details. There is only one functional premolar,—the small anterior
                    one usually found in <hi rend="italic">Sciurus</hi> being either absent
                    altogether or quite small and functionless. There are four species, all found in
                    North America, one extending also through Siberia into eastern Europe. They are
                    known in America as “Chipmunks,” and are among the commonest and best known of
                    the indigenous rodents. The members of this group seem rather to lead into the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Spermophilus</hi> (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Marmot)</hi>
                    of the sub-family <hi rend="italic">Arctomyina,</hi> so that the division of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Sciuridae</hi> into two sub-families, although very
                    convenient for classification and description, is rather of an artificial
                    nature, there being no well-defined line of separation between them.</p>
                <p>Genera Pteromys and Sciuropterus.</p>
                <p>The Flying Squirrels, although they cannot fly in the true sense of the word, can
                    yet float through the air for considerable distances by the aid of an extension
                    of skin connecting their fore and hind limbs, and forming a sort of parachute.
                    This parachute is merely a lateral extension of the ordinary skin of the body,
                    which passes outwards between the limbs and terminates at the wrists and ankles.
                    In addition to the lateral membrane there is a narrow and inconspicuous one
                    passing from the cheek along the front of the shoulder to the front of the
                    wrist, and another—at least in the larger species—stretching across behind the
                    body from ankle to ankle and involving the base of the tail. The flying
                    squirrels are divided into two genera, of which <hi rend="italic">Pteromys</hi>
                    contains the larger and <hi rend="italic">Sciuropterus</hi> the smaller species.
                    The two differ in certain details of dentition, and in the greater development
                    in the former of the expanded membranes, especially of the “interfemoral” or
                    posterior membrane, which is in the latter almost wholly absent. In <hi
                        rend="italic">Pteromys</hi> the tail is cylindrical and comparatively thin,
                    while in <hi rend="italic">Sciuropterus</hi> it is broad, flat, and laterally
                    expanded, and evidently compensates for the absence of the interfemoral membrane
                    by acting as a supplementary parachute. In appearance flying squirrels resemble
                    the non-flying forms, although they are even more beautifully coloured than the
                    latter. Their habits, food, &amp;c., are also very similar to those of the true
                    squirrels, except that they are more decidedly nocturnal, and are therefore less
                    often seen by the ordinary observer. Their method of leaping from tree to tree
                    and floating long distances on their extended parachutes is precisely similar to
                    that of the flying phalangers of Australia, a graphic description of which is
                    quoted in <hi rend="smallcaps">Phalanger</hi> (vol. xviii. p. 729). Of each of
                    the two genera there are about thirteen or fourteen species, all natives of the
                    Oriental region, except that one of <hi rend="italic">Sciuropterus</hi> is found
                    in North America, and another in Siberia and eastern Europe,—the latter, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Sciurus volans</hi> of Linnaeus’s <hi rend="italic">Systema
                        Naturae,</hi> being the first flying squirrel that was known to European
                    naturalists. (<hi rend="smallcaps">o. h.</hi>)</p>
