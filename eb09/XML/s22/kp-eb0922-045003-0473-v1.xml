                <p><label type="entry">STANISLAUS</label> (1677-1766), king of Poland. Stanislaw
                    Leszczynski or Leszinski was born at Lemberg on October</p>
                <p>20, 1677. His father, Raphael Leszczynski, was a Polish nobleman, distinguished
                    by his rank and the important offices which he held, but still more by his
                    personal qualities. Stanislaus, after visiting the courts of Vienna, Paris, and
                    Rome, was raised to the dignity of voivode of Posen, and in 1704 was sent as
                    ambassador by the assembly of Warsaw to Charles XII. of Sweden, who had just
                    declared the deposition of the recently elected Augustus II. The king was so
                    greatly taken with the ambassador that he recommended him to the diet as a
                    suitable candidate for the vacant throne; the election accordingly followed on
                    12th July 1704, but the coronation of Stanislaus and his wife Catharina
                    Opalinska did not take place until 4th October of the following year (compare
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Poland,</hi> vol. xix. p. 297). After the reverse of
                    Poltava in 1709 Augustus returned to Poland, and, assisted by the Russians,
                    compelled Stanislaus to leave the country. The next five years saw him leading a
                    wandering and somewhat adventurous life in Europe, one of his objects being to
                    procure a favourable peace for Charles (compare <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Charles</hi> XII.). He then settled on Charles’s estate at Zweibrücken, and
                    after Charles’s death in 1718 had a residence assigned to him by the French
                    court at Weissenburg in Alsace. In 1725 his daughter Maria became the wife of
                    Louis XV. of France. On the death of Augustus in 1733 Stanislaus once more
                    returned to Poland, where a majority declared for him, but his competitor, the
                    young elector of Saxony, had the advantage of the support of the emperor Charles
                    VI., and also of the empress of Russia. Dantzic, to which Stanislaus had
                    retired, was quickly taken by the Russians and the Saxons, and with great
                    difficulty the unfortunate prince succeeded in making good his escape in
                    disguise, after hearing that the Russians had set a price on his head. In 1736,
                    when peace was concluded between the emperor and France, it was agreed that
                    Stanislaus should abdicate the throne, but that he should be acknowledged king
                    of Poland and grand-duke of Lithuania, and continue to bear these titles during
                    life, and further, that he should be put in peaceable possession of the duchies
                    of Lorraine and Bar, but that immediately after his death those duchies should
                    be united for ever to the crown of France. The remaining years of his life were
                    prosperous and happy. He died at Lunéville on February 23, 1766, in consequence
                    of injuries received from his nightdress accidentally taking fire.</p>
                <p>Stanislaus, who was a patron of the arts and sciences, wrote several works in
                    politics and philosophy, which were collected and published at Paris in 1763, in
                    2 vols. 8vo, under the title <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres du Philosophe
                        Bienfaisant.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Oeuvres Choisies de Stanislas, Roi
                        de Pologne, Duc de Lorraine et de Bar,</hi> with an historical notice by
                    Madame de Saint-Ouen, were published in an 8vo volume at Paris in 1825.</p>
