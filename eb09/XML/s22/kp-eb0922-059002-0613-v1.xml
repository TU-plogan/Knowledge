                            Canning, Viscount</hi></label> (1786-1880), diplomatist, was the first
                    cousin of George Canning the statesman, and the youngest son of Stratford
                    Canning, who, having been disinherited for marrying beneath his rank, settled in
                    London as a merchant in Clement’s Lane, where young Canning was born 4th
                    November 1786. Shortly afterwards the father died, and the family removed to
                    Wanstead, the boy attending the village school and afterwards a school at
                    Hackney until 1794, when he went to Eton. Ultimately he became captain of the
                    school, and he also manifested his literary predilections by publishing, in

                    précis writer to his cousin, who had been appointed foreign minister. At the
                    close of the year he went to Copenhagen as one of the secretaries of a special
                    diplomatic mission, and after his return he was appointed in June 1808 first
                    secretary at Constantinople. On the removal of his chief Mr Adair to Vienna in
                    July 1810, Canning remained minister plenipotentiary, making use of the
                    opportunity to give indications of that overmastering purpose and bold yet
                    subtle diplomacy which were to have such an important influence on the history
                    of the Eastern question. In 1812 he succeeded in effecting the treaty of
                    Bucharest between Russia and Turkey, which was signed on the 12th May, shortly
                    before the arrival of his successor. This was properly the inauguration of that
                    English influence in Turkey which did not cease until within recent years. The
                    treaty was also of immense immediate advantage by freeing the Russian army to
                    act against Napoleon, and on his return to England Canning was rewarded by a
                    pension of £1200 a year. He remained in London, occupying himself with
                    literature, and contributing some articles to the <hi rend="italic">Quarterly
                        Review,</hi> then newly founded, until in May 1814 he was appointed by Lord
                    Castlereagh minister plenipotentiary to Switzerland, where he succeeded in
                    effecting the federation of the cantons as a neutral state. He returned to
                    England in 1817, and in August 1820 was sent as plenipotentiary to the United
                    States, to arrange certain outstanding differences between the States and
                    England; but, although a convention was signed 13th March 1824, this was
                    rejected by the American senate, and matters for several years remained, so far
                    as any actual arrangement was concerned, <hi rend="italic">in statu quo.</hi> In
                    October 1825 Canning was sent on a second commission to Constantinople, chiefly
                    to promote the independence of Greece, but after long and complicated
                    negotiations the attack, without the knowledge of the ambassadors, on the
                    Turkish fleet by the allies under Sir E. Codrington at Navarino, 20th October
                    1827, caused a conference then being held to be suddenly broken up, and rendered
                    necessary the withdrawal of the ambassadors from Constantinople. They, however,
                    again met at Poros towards the close of the following year, and ultimately
                    Turkey was compelled, by the treaty of Adrianople, 14th August 1829, following a
                    short war with Russia, to loose her grasp on Greece, and consent to the
                    arrangement of a frontier limit. On his return to England Canning was made
                    G.C.B. In 1828 he had been elected to the House of Commons for Old Sarum, and he
                    sat for different boroughs until 1841, when he again accepted the office of
                    ambassador to Turkey. During the next twelve years he gradually succeeded in
                    winning the confidence of the sultan, as well as awakening his wholesome awe, by
                    convincing him, not<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0922-0614-0591"/> merely of his sincere interest in the welfare
                    of Turkey, but of his sole ability to thwart the wiles of the Russian emperor.
                    There is no doubt a certain degree of exaggeration in Kinglake’s description of
                    Canning as the “Great Elchi,” at whose slightest frown the Turks were ready to
                    quail, and by whose matchless skill and coolness the emperor Nicholas was placed
                    at his wits’ end; but the consummate ability with which he managed the
                    negotiations connected with the question of the Holy Places, so as to place the
                    emperor as much as possible in the wrong, and to render his act of hostility on
                    3d July 1853—which led to the Crimean war—unjustifiable, cannot be denied.
                    During the war he retained his position at Constantinople, but at its conclusion
                    he returned in 1858 to London. In 1852 he had been raised to the peerage with
                    the title Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe. His later years were spent chiefly in
                    retirement, and, except when the Eastern question came prominently into notice,
                    he took little part in political discussion. On Eastern politics he contributed
                    several papers to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Nineteenth Century.</hi> He died without surviving male issue 14th August
                    1880.</p>
                <p>His essays were collected and published in 1881 under the title of the <hi
