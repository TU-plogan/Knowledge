                <p><label type="entry">SWABIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Suabia</hi>, or <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">Suevia</hi></label> (Germ. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Schwaben),</hi> is the name of an ancient duchy in the south-west part of
                    Germany, afterwards transferred to one of the ten great circles into which the
                    empire was divided in the reign of Maximilian I. (1493-1519). At present the
                    official use of the name is confined to a province of Bavaria (capital,
                    Augsburg), comprising a mere fragment of the former Swabia, but in common use it
                    is still applied to the. districts included in the old duchy. The duchy of
                    Swabia was bounded on the N. by the Rhenish Palatinate, on the E. by the Lech
                    (separating it from the duchy of Bavaria), on the S. by Switzerland, the Lake of
                    Constance, and Vorarlberg, and on the W. by the Rhine. It corresponds roughly to
                    the modern Würtemberg, Baden, and Hohenzollern, with part of Bavaria. The circle
                    of Swabia coincided more nearly than most with the duchy from which it was
                    named, but was rather more extensive. It was bounded by Switzerland, France
                    (after the cession of Alsace), and the circles of the Upper and Lower Rhine,
                    Franconia, Bavaria, and Austria. Its area was about 13,500 square miles. The
                    Swabian circle contained more independent states of the empire than any other,
                    including the countship (afterwards duchy) of Würtemberg, the margraviate of
                    Baden, the principalities of Hohenzollern and Liechtenstein, a whole series of
                    smaller secular and ecclesiastical principalities, and upwards of thirty free
                    imperial towns (Augsburg, Ulm, &amp;c.). Swabia is intersected from west to east
                    by the Danube, and is one of the most mountainous (Black Forest, Swabian Jura)
                    and picturesque parts of the German empire. It is also very fertile. The
                    Swabians are a strong, big-framed, and good-humoured race, and, though in
                    several popular legends the “Schwab” plays the part of a “wise man of Gotham,”
                    he is probably no denser than his neighbours.</p>
                <p>The use of the name of Swabia in connexion with the soutli-west part of Germany,
                    previously called Alemannia (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alemanni),</hi> begins
                    with the 5th century of our era, when the Suevi poured into the country and
                    amalgamated with the Alemanni. It was not, however, till the 8th century, when
                    the dukedom of Alemannia was abolished and Rhaetia and Alsace separated from it,
                    that Swabia became the recognized name of the district, henceforth administered
                    by nuncii camerae, as representatives of the Frankish emperors. One of these
                    nuncii, who usurped the ancient title of duke of Alemannia, was executed in 917,
                    but two years later Henry I. yielded to the popular will in allowing Count
                    Burkhard I. to style himself duke of Swabia. The dukedom thus founded, which
                    lasted for more than three centuries, repeatedly changed hands, and was
                    generally conferred by the emperors and kings of the Saxon and Franconian lines
                    on members of their own families. In 1079 it passed into the hands of Frederick
                    I. of Hohenstaufen, the progenitor of a line of German monarchs, and under his
                    successors Swabia had the reputation of being the most civilized and prosperous
                    part of Germany. As, however, the Hohenstaufen line gradually lost strength in
                    its hopeless struggle with the papacy, the Swabian nobles increased in power at
                    the expense of the dukes, and several of them became “immediate.” No duke of
                    Swabia was appointed after the death of Conradin, the last of the Hohenstaufen,
                    in 1268, and his place was henceforth filled in some degree by the count of
                    Würtemberg as <hi rend="italic">primus inter pares.</hi> For the next 250 years
                    or so the history of Swabia consists of an endless series of feuds between the
                    different members of the duchy, mingled with more or less abortive attempts of
                    the German emperors and others to restore peace. The lesser nobles fought with
                    the greater nobles, the towns banded themselves together against both, and
                    alliances and counter-alliances were formed and dissolved with bewildering
                    rapidity. The “Schleglerkrieg” is the name given to a bloody contest between the
                    counts of Würtemberg and the lesser noblesse in 1367. The most important of the
                    various leagues formed by the towns was the "Schwäbischer Städtebund” of 1376,
                    the point of which was directed against Würtemberg. In 1488 the Swabian
                    estates,—nobles, prelates, and towns,—weary of constant dissension, joined in
                    the Great Swabian Confederation, the object of which was to maintain peace
                    throughout the country. This league possessed a carefully drawn up constitution
                    and exercised executive and judicial functions throughout the whole of Swabia,
                    maintaining a standing army to give force to its decrees. Though not successful
                    in completely abolishing war within Swabia, the confederation was by no means a
                    failure. It was, for instance, the general of the confederation that put an end
                    to the calamitous Peasants’ War of 1525. The Reformation found ready acceptance
                    in Swabia. Würtemberg, Ulm, and some of the other estates even joined in the
                    Schmalkald League; but for this they afterwards had to pay large fines to the
                    emperor, while the towns lost their democratic constitution, and with it most of
                    their political importance. The outstanding feature of Swabian history for some
                    time afterwards may be said to be the struggle for supremacy between the
                    Protestant Würtemberg and the Roman Catholic Austria. In 1512, when all Germany
                    was divided into ten circles, one of them was named the Schwäbischer Kreis, or
                    Swabian Circle (see above). The circle received its complete organization in
                    1563, and retained it practically unchanged till the dissolution of the empire
                    in 1806. Swabia suffered severely in the Thirty Years War, and it was also one
                    of the scenes of the struggles consequent on the French Revolution. But its
                    modern history must be sought for under such headings as <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Würtemberg</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Baden.</hi></p>
