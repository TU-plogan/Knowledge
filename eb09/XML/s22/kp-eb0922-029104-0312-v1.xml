                    (1806-1854), a French novelist of merit, was born on April 15, 1806, and died on
                    July 5, 1854. He was a native of Morlaix, and his affection for Brittany
                    coloured most of his best work in after life. He had rather a chequered career
                    of employment besides his literary pursuits. He was by turns a bookseller’s
                    assistant, a private schoolmaster, a journalist, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >professeur</hi> at the grammar schools of Brest and Mulhouse. In 1848 he
                    received what may sound to English ears the odd appointment of “professor of
                    administrative style” in a school founded for the instruction of civil servants.
                    His literary work, however, was his labour of love. He began like most Frenchmen
                    with the drama, but was never very successful with it. In novel-writing he did
                    much better, and with Jules Sandeau (though on a somewhat lower level of
                    writing, construction, and grasp of character) may be said to rank as the chief
                    recent French novelist who deliberately aimed at making the novel an engine of
                    moral instruction. With less genius and less sense of art than</p>
                <p>Sandeau, he did not always escape the reproach of dulness. His best work is
                    undoubtedly to be found in the charming <hi rend="italic">Derniers Bretons</hi>
                    (1835-1837) and <hi rend="italic">Foyer Breton</hi> (1844) (where the folklore
                    and natural features of his native province are worked up into story form, with
                    a success hardly excelled by any other writer), and in <hi rend="italic">Un
                        Philosophe sons les Toits,</hi> which received the honour of an academic
                    prize in the year 1851. This Souvestre deserved, not merely for his sentiments,
                    but for his easy and agreeable style. He also wrote a not inconsiderable number
                    of other works—novels, dramas, essays, and miscellanies.</p>
