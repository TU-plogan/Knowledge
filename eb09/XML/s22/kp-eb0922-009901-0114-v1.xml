                    slender figure, being indeed rather short and stout of build. Yet it hardly
                    yields to them in activity or in the grace of its actions, as it seeks its food
                    from the catkins of the alder or birch, regardless of the attitude it assumes
                    while so doing. Of an olive-green above, deeply tinted in some parts with black
                    and in others lightened by yellow, and beneath of a yellowish-white again marked
                    with black, the male of this species has at least a becoming if not a brilliant
                    garb, and possesses a song that is not unmelodious, though the resemblance of
                    some of its notes to the running-down of a piece of clockwork is more remarkable
                    than pleasing. The hen is still more soberly attired; but it is perhaps the
                    Siskin’s disposition to familiarity that makes it so favourite a captive, and,
                    though as a cage-bird it is not ordinarily long-lived, it readily adapts itself
                    to the loss of liberty. Moreover, if anything like the needful accommodation be
                    afforded, it will build a nest and therein lay its eggs, but it rarely succeeds
                    in bringing up its young in confinement. As a wild bird it breeds constantly,
                    though locally, throughout the greater part of Scotland, and has frequently done
                    so in England, but more rarely in Ireland. The greater portion, however, of the
                    numerous bands which visit the British Islands in autumn and winter doubtless
                    come from the Continent— perhaps even from far to the eastward, since its range
                    stretches across Asia to Japan, in which country it is as favourite a cage-bird
                    as with us. The nest of the Siskin is very like that of the Goldfinch, but
                    seldom so neatly built; the eggs, except in their smaller size, much resemble
                    those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Greenfinch</hi> (vol. xi. p. 165).</p>
                <p>A larger and more brightly coloured species, <hi rend="italic">C. spinoides,</hi>
                    inhabits the Himalayas, but the Siskin has many other relatives belonging to the
                    New World, and in them serious modifications of structure, especially in the
                    form of the bill, occur. Some of these relatives lead almost insensibly to the
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Greenfinch</hi><hi rend="italic">(ut supra)</hi> and
                    its allies, others to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Goldfinch</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(ut supra),</hi> the Redpolls, and so on. Thus the Siskin perhaps may be
                    regarded as one of the less modified descendants of a stock whence such forms as
                    those just mentioned have sprung. Its striated plumage also favours this view,
                    as an evidence of permanent immaturity or generalization of form, since striped
                    feathers are so often the earliest clothing of many of these birds, which only
                    get rid of them at their first moult. On this theory the Yellowbird or
                    North-American “Goldfinch,” <hi rend="italic">C. tristis,</hi> would seem, with
                    its immediate allies, to rank among the highest forms of the group, and the
                    Pine-Goldfinch, <hi rend="italic">C. pinus,</hi> of the same country, to be one
                    of the lowest,—the cock of the former being generally of a bright jonquil hue,
                    with black crown, tail, and wings—the last conspicuously barred with white,
                    while neither hens nor young exhibit any striations. On the other hand, neither
                    sex of the latter at any age puts off its striped garb—the mark, it may be
                    pretty safely asserted, of an inferior stage of development. The remaining
                    species of the group, mostly South-American, do not seem here to need particular
                    notice. (A. N. )</p>
