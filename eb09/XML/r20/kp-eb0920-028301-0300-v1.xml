                <p><label type="entry">RAPIN</label><hi rend="smallcaps">Paul de</hi> (1661-1725),
                    sieur of Thoyras, French historian, was the son of Jacques de Rapin, avocat at
                    Castres (Tarn), where he was born on 25th March 1661. He was educated at the
                    Protestant academy of Saumur, and in 1679 he became an advocate, but soon
                    afterwards entered the army. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes in 1685 and
                    the death of his father, which happened two months afterwards, led him to come
                    to England; but, unable to find employment there, he crossed to Holland and
                    enlisted in the company of French volunteers at Utrecht commanded by Daniel de
                    Rapin, his cousin-german. He accompanied the prince of Orange to England in
                    1688, and the following year Lord Kingston made him ensign in his regiment, with
                    which he proceeded to Ireland. He took part in the siege of Carrickfergus and
                    the battle of the Boyne, and was shot through the shoulder at the battle of
                    Limerick. Soon afterwards he was promoted captain; but in 1693 he resigned in
                    order to become tutor to the earl of Portland’s son. His next change was to
                    return to his family, which he had settled at The Hague, and there he continued
                    some years. But, as he found his family increase, he resolved to retire to a
                    more economical residence, and accordingly removed in 1707 to Wesel, where he
                    commenced his great work <hi rend="italic">L·Histoire d'Angleterre.</hi> Though
                    he was of a strong con stitution, the seventeen years’ application entirely
                    ruined his health. He died in 1725.</p>
                <p>Rapin was also the author of a <hi rend="italic">Dissertation sur les Whigs et
                        les Torys,</hi> 1717. <hi rend="italic">L'Histoire d’Angleterre,</hi>
                    embracing the period from the invasion of the Romans to the death of Charles L,
