                <p><label type="entry">RANGPUR</label> a district of British India, in the
                    lieutenant-governorship of Bengal, lying between 25° 3' and 26° 19' N. lat. and
                    88° 47' and 89° 56' E. long., is bounded on the N. by Jalpdiguri district and
                    Kuch Behar state, on the E. by the Brahmaputra, separating it from Goalpara and
                    Maimansinh, on the S. by Bogra, and on the W. by Dinajpur and JalpAiguri. The
                    district is one vast plain; the greater part of it, particularly towards the
                    east, is inundated during the rains, and the remainder is traversed by a network
                    of streams which frequently break through their sandy banks and ])lough for
                    themselves new channels over the fields. Agricultural industry has taken full
                    advantage of the natural fertility of the soil, which is composed of a sandy
                    loam. The river system is constituted by the Brahmaputra and its tributaries,
                    chief of which are the Tista, Dharla, Sankos, and Dudhkumar. There are no
                    embankments or artificial canals in the district, nor does the alluvial soil
                    produce any minerals. The climate of Rangpur is generally malarious owing to the
                    numerous stagnant swamps and marshes filled with decaying vegetable matter. The
                    average annual rainfall is 86 T 4 inches. The Northern Bengal State Railway cuts
                    through the western half of the district from north to south, with a branch to
                    Rangpur town.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the population was 2,097,964 (males 1,067,701, females 1,030,263); Hindus
                    numbered 816,532, Mohammedans 1,279,605, and Christians 86. The population is
                    for the most part rural; the only towns containing upwards of 10,000 inhabitants
                    are <hi rend="smallcaps">Rangpur,</hi> the capital ( <hi rend="italic">q.v</hi>
                    .), Barakhatta (11,393), Bliogdabari (10,892), and Dimlah (10,503). The district
                    contains an area of 3486 square miles, Sbout three-fourths being under
                    continuous cultivation. The staple crops are rice, wheat, and other grains,
                    oil-seeds, and jute; among the miscellaneous crops are indigo, sugar-cane,
                    betel-leaf, betel-nut, and mulberry for silkworms. Spare land capable of
                    cultivation can hardly be said to exist,—even the patches of waste land yield a
                    valuable tribute of reeds and cane. Of industries the chief is the manufacture
                    of paper from jute fibre; other products are striped cotton carpets, silk cloth
                    woven from the cocoon of a worm fed on the castor-oil plant, baskets and mats,
                    brass-ware, and ornaments carved in ivory and buffalo horn. In 1883-84 the gross
                    revenue of Rangpur district was £165,165, of which the land-tax contributed
                    £102,248.</p>
                <p>The tract comprised within the district of Rangpur was formerly the western
                    outpost of the ancient Hindu kingdom of Kamrup. The realm appears to have
                    attained its greatest power and prosperity under Raja Nilambhar, who was
                    treacherously overthrown by Husain Shah, king of Bengal, at the close of the
                    15tli century. On the conquest of the kingdom of Bengal about 1542 by the
                    renowned Afghan Sher Shah, subsequently emperor of Delhi, Rangpur appears to
                    have become incorporated with the empire. During the turbulent period which
                    followed the death of Sher Shah it threw off allegiance to Delhi, but the
                    country was re-annexed by Akbar in 1584, though it was not completely subjugated
                    till the time of Aurangzeb, about 1661. Rangpur passed to the East India Company
                    in 1765 under the firman of the emperor Shah Alam. Numerous changes have since
                    taken place in the jurisdiction, in consequence of which the district area has
                    been much diminished.</p>
