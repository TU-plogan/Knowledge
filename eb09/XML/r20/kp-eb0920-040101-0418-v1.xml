                <p><label type="entry">RENNES</label> a town of France, formerly the capital of
                    Brittany and now the chief town of the department of Ille-et-Yilaine, is
                    situated at the meeting of the Ille and the Vilaine and at the junction of
                    several lines of railway connecting it with Paris (232 miles east-north-east),
                    St Malo (51 miles north), Brest (147 west-north-west), Ac. It is the seat of an
                    archbishop and the headquarters of the 10th corps d’armée (with a large arsenal
                    and barracks). For the most part rebuilt on a regular plan since the seven days’
                    fire of 1720, the town is rendered more monotonous by the houses being of
                    dark-coloured granite and nearly all after the same type. Of trade and industry
                    there is little trace in the dull and deserted streets. The main portion of the
                    old town occupies a hill which looks down on the confluence of the streams.
                    Along the north side flows the Vilaine in a deep hollow bordered with quays and
                    crossed by four bridges leading to the new town near the railway station. The
                    canalized Ille forms the first section of the Ille and Ranee Canal which unites
                    St Malo to Rennes, and then descends the Vilaine to Redon, and the canal from
                    Nantes to Brest. The cathedral of Rennes is rebuilt in a pseudo-ionic style on
                    the site of two churches dating originally from the 4th century. The
                    archbishop’s palace occupies in part the site of the abbey of St Melaine, whose
                    church is the sole specimen in the town of 11-13th century architecture. A
                    colossal statue of the Virgin was placed above the dome of this church in 1867.
                    In the palace is preserved the old altar screen from the cathedral, perhaps the
                    finest in all France. The Mordelaise Gate, by which the dukes and bishops used
                    to make their state entry into the town, is a curious example of 15th century
                    architecture, and accidentally preserves a Latin inscription of the 3d century,
                    a dedication by the Redones to the emperor Gordianus. Architecturally the finest
                    building in the town is the old parliament house (now the court-house), designed
                    by Jacques Debrosse in the 17th century, and decorated with statues of legal
                    celebrities, carved work, and paintings by Coypel and Jouvenet. The town-house
                    was erected in the first half of the 18th century by Gabriel, the architect· of
                    the Place de la Concorde in Paris. In the modern building occupied by the
                    faculties of law, science, and literature there are scientific collections of
                    various kinds, and one of the finest picture galleries outside of Paris, with
                    pieces by Paul Veronese, Tintoretto, Vandyck, Rembrandt, Rubens, Ac., and
                    sketches by Michelangelo, Titian, and other great masters. The town library
                    contains 50,000 volumes and 220 MSS.; and the municipal archives are of primary
                    importance for the history of Brittany. The Promenade du Thabor, with a statue
                    of Duguesclin, the adjoining botanic gardens, the Promenade de la Motte a little
                    lower down, and the Mail, a fine avenue planted in 1657 by the duke of Chaulnes,
                    add greatly to the beauty of Rennes. About 2 miles from the town is the castle
                    of La Prévalaye. The local industries are varied but not extensive. The
                    population of the town in 1881 numbered 57,430; that of the commune 60,974.</p>
                <p>Rennes, the chief city of the Redones, was formerly (like some other places in
                    Gaul) called Condate (hence <hi rend="italic">Condat,</hi> Condé), probably from
                    its position at the confluence of two streams. Under the Roman empire it was
                    included in Lugdunensis Tertia, and became the centre of various Roman roads
                    still recognizable in the vicinity. The name <hi rend="italic">Urbs Rubra</hi>
                    given to it in the oldest chroniclers is explained by the bands of red brick
                    still found in the foundations of its first circuit of walls. In 843 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> Nornenoé, Charles the Bald’s lieutenant, declared
                    himself independent and took the title of king of the Bretons; but the country
                    was afterwards torn to pieces by the struggles of the various counts who wished
                    to make themselves masters of it and by the invasions of the Normans. About the
                    close of the 10th century Conan le Tort, count of Rennes, subdued the whole
                    province, and it was his son and successor Geoffrey who first took the title
                    duke of <hi rend="smallcaps">Brittany</hi><hi rend="italic">(q. v.</hi> ). It
                    was at Rennes the dukes were crowned, and before entering the city by the
                    Mordelaise Gate they had to swear to preserve the privileges of the church, the
                    nobles, and the commons of Brittany. During the War of Succession the city was
                    captured by Jean de Montfort in 1341, by Charles of Blois in 1342, and again by
                    Jean de Montfort. During the troubles of the League the duke of Mercoeur
                    attempted to make himself independent at Rennes (1589), but his scheme was
                    defeated by the loyalty of the local parliament. Henry IV. entered the city in
                    state on May 9, 1598. An insurrection at Rennes caused by the taxes imposed by
                    Louis XIV., in spite of the advice of the parliament, was cruelly suppressed by
                    the duke of Chaulnes, governor of the province. The parliament was banished to
                    Vannes till 1689, and the inhabitants crushed with forfeits and in great numbers
                    put to death. The fire of 1720 which destroyed eight hundred houses completed
                    the ruin of the town. During the last year of the monarchy Rennes more than once
                    resisted the imposition of taxes not authorized by the states of Brittany. In
                    1765 the celebrated procureur-général La Chalotais was imprisoned, and in 1788
                    the parliament was suspended from May to October. At the commencement of the
                    Revolution Rennes was again the scene of bloodshed caused by the discussion
                    about doubling the third estate for the convocation of the states-general. On
                    January 26, 1789, the students, with Moreau (afterwards general) at their head,
                    broke into the hall where the nobles satin council in defiance of the decree of
                    suspension issued against them by the Government. During the Reign of Terror
                    Rennes suffered less than Nantes, partly through the courage and uprightness of
                    the mayor Leperdit. It was soon afterwards the centre of the operations of the
                    republican army against La Vendée. After the 10 th of Brumaire it was accused of
                    royalism and put to ransom by Brune. Besides La Chalotais, Gerbier the advocate
                    and Admiral De la Motte-Picquet were born at Rennes.</p>
