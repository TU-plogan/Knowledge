                    navigator rendered famous by his connexion with the early settlement of Florida
                        <hi rend="italic">(qrv.),</hi> was born at Dieppe, probably about 1520.
                    Appointed by Coligny to the command of a colonizing expedition (from which the
                    admiral was not deterred by the failure of Nicolas Durand de Villegagnon on a
                    similar mission), Ribault sailed on 18th February 1562 with two vessels, and on
                    1st May landed at St John’s river, or, as he called it, Rivière de Mai. Having
                    settled his colonists at Port Royal Harbour and built Fort Charles for their
                    protection, he returned to France to find the country in the throes of the civil
                    war. In 1563 he appears to have been in England and to have issued <hi

                    1564 Coligny was in a position to despatch another expedition under Laudonnière;
                    but meanwhile Ribault’s colony had come to an untimely end, the unfortunate
                    adventurers, destitute of supplies from home, having revolted against their
                    governor and attempted to make their way back to Europe in a boat which was
                    happily picked up, when they were in the last extremities, by an English vessel.
                    In 1565 Ribault was again sent out to satisfy the admiral as to Laudonnière’s
                    management of his new settlement, Fort Caroline, on the Riviere de Mai. While he
                    was still there the Spaniards under Menendez de Avila, though their country was
                    at peace with France, attacked the French ships at the mouth of the river.
                    Ribault set out to retaliate on the Spanish fleet, but his vessels were wrecked
                    by a storm near Cape Canaveral and he had to attempt to return to Fort Caroline
                    by land. The fort had by this time fallen into the hands of the Spaniards, who
                    had slaughtered all the colonists except a few who got off with two ships under
                    Ribault’s son. Induced to surrender by false assurances of safeguard, Ribault
                    and his men were also put to the sword in October 1565. The massacre was avenged
                    in kind by Dominique de Gourgues two years later.</p>
