                    the other hand, with its five or more lobes, is usually conspicuous, and in some
                    species so much so as to render these plants greatly prized in gardens. The free
                    stamens are usually ten, with slender filaments and anthers opening by pores at
                    the top. The ovary is five-or many-celled, ripening into a long woody pod which
                    splits from top to bottom by a number of valves, which break away from the
                    central placenta and liberate a large number of small bran-like seeds provided
                    with a membranous wing-like appendage at each end. The species are for the most
                    part natives of the mountainous regions of the northern hemisphere, extending as
                    far south as the Malay Archipelago and New Guinea, but not hitherto found in
                    South America or Australia. None are natives of Britain. They vary greatly in
                    stature, some of the alpine species being mere pigmies with minute leaves and
                    tiny blossoms, while some of the Himalayan species are moderate sized trees with
                    superb flowers. Some are epiphytal, growing on the branches of other trees, but
                    not deriving their sustenance from them. The varieties grown in gardens are
                    mostly derived from the Pontic species (A. <hi rend="italic">ponticum)</hi> and
                    the Virginian <hi rend="italic">R. catawbieηse.</hi> These are mostly hardy in
                    England. The common Pontic variety is excellent for game-covert from its
                    hardiness, the shelter it affords, and the fact that hares and rabbits rarely
                    eat it. Variety of colour has been infused by crossing or hybridizing the
                    species first-named, or their derivatives, with some of the more
                    gorgeously-coloured Indian varieties. In many instances this has been done
                    without sacrifice of hardihood, but even where the infusion of Indian blood has
                    brought about a tenderness of constitution the magnificence of the bloom amply
                    repays the very slight shelter which is requisite in winter.</p>
                <p>What are termed greenhouse rhododendrons are derivatives from certain Malayan and
                    Javanese species, and are consequently much more tender. They are characterized
                    by the possession of a cylindrical (not funnel-shaped) flower-tube and other
                    marks of distinction. Azaleas now referred to Rhododendron are derived from
                    Chinese and Japanese species chiefly. The “Indian” azaleas, so-called, have
                    nearly evergreen foliage like a rhododendron, but with stiff hairs on the under
                    surface of the leaf, and the flower-buds comprise leaves and not bud-scales only
                    as in true rhododendrons. Rhododendron (Azalea) indicum is truly a native of
                    China and Japan, but not of India. What are called in gardens Ghent azaleas are
                    hardy varieties with deciduous gummy foliage and tufts of fragrant,
                    brilliantly-coloured flowers. These are derivatives from A. calendulacea, A.
                    viseosa, and other north-east American species. Another group of garden azaleas
                    are derivatives from Rhododendron (Azalea) sinense (of which A. mollis is a
                    form). These are scarcely less hardy than the preceding. Azalea amoena of
                    gardens is a dwarf form of R. indicum, remarkable for having “hose in hose”
                    flowers, a state of things brought about by the fact that the calyx in this
                    variety becomes petaloid like the corolla. The foliage of rhododendrons contains
                    much tannin, and has been used medicinally. Whether the honey mentioned by
                    Xenophon as poisonous was really derived from plants of this genus as alleged is
                    still an open question.</p>
