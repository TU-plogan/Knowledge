                <p><label type="entry">RYAZAÑ</label>, capital of the above government, lies 119
                    miles to the south-east of Moscow, on the elevated right bank of the Trubej, a
                    mile above its junction with the Oka. A wide prairie dotted with large villages,
                    being the bottom of a former lake, spreads out from the base of the crag on
                    which Ryazan stands, and has the aspect of an immense lake when it is inundated
                    in the spring. Except one or two streets, the town is badly built, chiefly of
                    wood, and ill-paved. It has often suffered from fire, and has few remains of
                    former days. The large church of Uspensk dates from 1770. Those of Arkhangelsk
                    and Kresto-vozdvijensk have preserved, however, their old architecture, though
                    obliterated to some extent by subsequent repairs, as also the archiépiscopal
                    palace, formerly the “terem” of the great princes. The industries are
                    undeveloped, and the trade has less importance than might be expected from the
                    position of the town in so rich a region. It is, however, an important railway
                    centre, no less than 15,000,000 cwts., chiefly of corn, being brought from the
                    south-east and sent on to Moscow, while nearly 3,390,000 cwts. of various
                    manufactured and grocery wares are conveyed in the opposite direction. The
                    loading place on the Oka also has some importance. The population, 30,325 in
                    1883, is increasing but slowly.</p>
                <p>The capital of Ryazafi principality was Ryazafi—now Old Ryazafi, a village close
                    to Spassk, also on the Oka. It is mentioned in annals as early as 1097, but
                    continued to be the chief town of the principality only until the 14th century.
                    In the 11th century one of the Kieff princes—probably Yaroslaff Svyatoslavitch
                    in 1095—founded, on the banks of a small lake, a fort which received tho name of
                    Pereyaslaff-Ryazaiiskiy. In 1294 (or in 1335) the bishop of Murom, compelled to
                    leave his own town and probably following the usual policy of that epoch,—that
                    of selecting a new town with no municipal traditions, as the nucleus of a new
                    state, —settled in Pereyaslaff-Ryazanskiy, and thus gave new importance to this
                    formerly insignificant settlement. The great princes of Ryazaft followed his
                    example and by-and-by completely abandoned the old republican town of Ryazan,
                    transferring also its name to Pereyaslair-Ryazanskiy. In 1300 a congress of
                    Russian princes was held there, and in the following year the town was taken by
                    the Moscow prince. It continued, however, to be the residence of the Ryazafi
                    princes until 1517. In 1365 and 1377 it was plundered and burned by Tartars, but
                    in the two following centuries (in 1460, 1513, 1521, and 1564) it was strong
                    enough to repel them. Earthen walls with towers were erected after 1301; and in
                    the 17th century a “kreml” still stood on the high crag above the Trubej. Ryazan
                    became chief town of the Ryazan lieutenancy in 1778.</p>
