                <p><label type="entry">RUDOLPH I</label>. (1218-1291), German king, eldest son of
                    Albert IV., count of Hapsburg, was born on the 1st May 1218. By marriage and in
                    other ways he greatly extended his hereditary dominions, so that when he became
                    king he was lord not only of Hapsburg but of the counties of Kyburg and Lenzburg
                    and of the Iandgraviate of Alsace. At different times he carried on war with the
                    bishop of Strasburg, the abbot of St Gall, and the city of Basel. He was engaged
                    in his second struggle with Basel in 1273 when Frederick, burgrave of Nuremberg,
                    brought the intelligence that he had been elected to the German crown. Basel at
                    once submitted, and Rudolph went to Aix-Ia-Chapelle, where he was crowned on the
                    28th October 1273. The princes had become so independent during the Great
                    Interregnum that they would have preferred to have no supreme ruler; but Pope
                    Gregory X. had threatened that if they did not elect a king he would himself
                    appoint one. The pope now cordially supported Rudolph, who proved to be much
                    more energetic than the electors had anticipated. Having secured the friendship
                    of the palsgrave Louis and Duke Albert of Saxony by allowing them to marry his
                    daughters, he advanced against Ottocar, king of Bohemia, and Henry, duke of
                    Bavaria, both of whom had refused to do him homage. Henry was soon won over to
                    the new king’s side, and then Ottccar had to sue for peace. His request was
                    granted only on condition that he should cede Austria, Styria, Carinthia, and
                    Carniola. By and by Ottocar again rebelled, and was slain in 1278 in a battle
                    fought on the Marchfield. Rudolph gave Bohemia and Moravia to Wenceslaus,
                    OttocaFs son; but Austria, Styria, and Carniola he granted to his own sons,
                    Albert and Rudolph. Carinthia was given to Meinhard, count of Tyrol, who agreed
                    that if his descendants in the male line died out the land should pass to
                    Rudolph’s family. Rudolph compelled Otho, count of Upper Burgundy, and other
                    nobles, who tried to make themselves independent of the German crown, to
                    acknowledge his supremacy; and he recovered certain fiefs in what is now
                    Switzerland, which had been seized by the count of Savoy. He also restored peace
                    in Bohemia, and gave his daughter in marriage to the young king, Wences-laus. He
                    often visited troubled parts of the kingdom, settling local disputes, and
                    destroying the towers of robber barons. On the whole, his rule was a beneficent
                    one, but he did not succeed in re-establishing the authority of the Crown, nor
                    did he see how great an element of strength he might have found in an alliance
                    with the cities. The electors he was forced to confirm in the possession of
                    important rights, which were maintained under his successors. His reign is
                    memorable chiefly because he was the founder of the greatness of the house of
                    Hapsburg. In 1281 his first wife died, and in 1284 he married Elizabeth,
                    daughter of Hugo IV., duke of Burgundy. He died at Germersheim on the l5th July
                    1291.</p>
