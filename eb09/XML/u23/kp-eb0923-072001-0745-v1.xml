                <p><label type="entry">ULM</label>, an ancient and important commercial town in
                    Wurtemberg, and an imperial fortress of the first class, is situated on the left
                    bank of the Danube, in a fertile plain at the foot of the Swabian Alps, 45 miles
                    to the south-east of Stuttgart and 63 miles to the north-west of Munich. The
                    town, quaintly built with narrow and confined streets, still preserves the
                    dignified and old-fashioned appearance of an ancient imperial town, and contains
                    many mediaeval buildings, both of historic and of artistic interest. Among
                    these, besides numerous handsome private houses, are the town-house, of the 16th
                    century, in the Transition style from late Gothic to Renaissance; the Kornhaus
                    and market-buildings; the Ehingerhaus or Neubronnerhaus, now containing the
                    industrial museum; the “new building,” erected in 1603 on the site of a palace
                    of Charlemagne; and the commandery of the Teutonic order, built in 1712-18 on
                    the site of a habitation of the order dating from the 13th century. By far the
                    most important and conspicuous building in Ulm, however, is the magnificent
                    early Gothic cathedral, next to the cathedral of Cologne the largest church in
                    Germany, and capable of containing 30,000 people. Begun in 1377, and carried on
                    at intervals till the 16th century, the building was long left unfinished; but
                    in 1844 the work of restoration and completion was undertaken, and has steadily
                    progressed ever since. Ulm cathedral has double aisles and a pentagonal apsidal
                    choir, but no transepts. Its length (outside measurement) is 464 feet, its
                    breadth 159 -feet; the nave is 136 feet high and 47j wide; the aisles, which are
                    covered with rich net-vaulting, are 68 feet in height. The massive and richly
                    decorated square tower in the centre of the west façade, for centuries
                    terminated by a temporary spire, is now being completed according to the
                    original plans, by the addition of an octagonal story and a tall open spire,
                    which is to be carried up to the height of 534 feet. The towers of the choir
                    have also been rebuilt in the course of the present restoration; they are 282
                    feet high. The interior, which is unusually well lighted, produces an impression
                    of much dignity from the great height of the nave, the absence of obtrusive
                    decoration, and the massive manner in which the walls and piers are treated. It
                    contains some fine stained glass, the largest organ in Germany (1856), and a
                    number of interesting old paintings and carvings by Syrlin, Engelberger, and
                    other masters of the Swabian school. The cathedral belongs to the Protestant
                    Church. Trinity Church dates from 1617-21; and there are also a Roman Catholic
                    church and a modern synagogue in the town. The Danube, joined by the Iller just
                    above the town and by the Blau just below, becomes navigable at this point, so
                    that Ulm occupies the important commercial position of a terminal river-port.
                    The trade, especially in wood and grain, has an upward tendency; and the Ulm
                    market for leather and cloth is also rising in importance. Ulm is famous for its
                    vegetables (especially asparagus), barley, beer, pipe-bowls, and sweet cakes
                    (Ulmer Zückerbrot). Bleaching, brewing, and brassfounding are carried on, as
                    well as a large miscellany of manufactures, including hats, metal goods,
                    agricultural implements, tobacco and cigars, cement, paper, and chemicals. The
                    population in 1886 was 33,611.</p>
                <p>The various routes which converge at Ulm have made it at all times a strategic
                    point of great importance, and it has long been a fortress of the first rank. In
                    1844-59 the German Confederation carefully fortified it with walls, ramparts,
                    and ditches, and in 1876 the new German empire added a very comprehensive outer
                    girdle of detached forts, culminating in the powerful citadel of Wilhelmsburg.
                    The defensive works embrace also the Bavarian town of Neu-Ulm (7823
                    inhabitants), on the opposite bank of the Danube, united with the older city by
                    two stone bridges. Ulm is thus the basis of operations for the German army
                    behind the Black Forest, <pb break="no"

                    men; its peace garrison is 5600.</p>
                <p>Ulm is mentioned as early as the year 854. It subsequently became a free imperial
                    city, and the leading town in Swabia. In the 15th century it attained the summit
                    of its prosperity, and ruled over a district of many square miles, with a
                    population, rural and urban, of about 60,000. Towards the end of the Middle Ages
                    it frequently appears at the head of various Swabian leagues. In 1530 it adopted
                    the Augsburg Confession. In 1803 it passed to Bavaria, and in 1810 to
                    Wurtemberg. In 1805 General Mack, with 33,000 Austrians, capitulated to Napoleon
                    at Ulm. Ulm is remarkable in the history of German literature as the spot where
                    the “meistersänger” lingered longest, preserving, without text and without
                    notes, the traditional lore of their craft. In 1830 there were twelve
                    “meistersänger'* alive at Ulm; but in 1839 the four survivors formally made over
                    their insignia and guild property to a modern singing society, and closed the
                    record of “Meistergesang” in Germany. The last formal meeting of the Nuremberg
                    “meister” took place in 1770.</p>
