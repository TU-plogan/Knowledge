                <p><label type="entry">PHILEMON</label>, the oldest poet of the New Attic Comedy,
                    was the son of Damon, and was born at Soli in Cilicia, or, according to others,
                    at Syracuse; but early in life he settled at Athens. Since he died in 262 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> at an age variously stated at from 96 to 101
                    years, he must have been born somewhere about 360. He was thus older than his
                    contemporary and great rival Menander, whom he frequently vanquished in poetical
                    contests, and whom he long survived. Posterity, however, reversed the judgment
                    of their contemporaries and assigned the palm to Menander. Philemon’s first play
                    was put on the stage about 330, while Menander did not exhibit until 321. It
                    appears that, once being worsted in a poetical competition, Philemon went into
                    exile. He certainly made a journey to the East, but whether on the occasion of
                    his exile or in compliance with the invitation of Ptolemy, king of Egypt, we
                    cannot say. On this journey, being driven by a storm to the coast of Cyrene, he
                    was treated with cool contempt by Magas, king of Cyrene, whom he had satirized.
                    From the various legends told about his death he would seem to have died in the
                    full enjoyment and use of his poetical powers. Of the ninety-seven plays which
                    he is said to have composed none are extant; the titles of fifty-three have been
                    preserved, but some of these may have been the work of his son, the younger
                    Philemon, who is said to have composed fifty-four comedies. <hi rend="italic"
                        >The Merchant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">The Treasure</hi> of Philemon were
                    the originals respectively of the <hi rend="italic">Mercator</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Trinummus</hi> of Plautus. The New Attic Comedy, of which
                    Philemon was in a sense the founder, dealt mainly with subjects drawn from
                    private life, which were worked up in elaborate plots and treated in a prosaic
                    style, to the exclusion, on the whole, of the political tendency, stinging
                    personal satire, and warm poetical colouring, which had marked the Old Attic
                    Comedy. These characteristics of the New Comedy had already appeared, though in
                    a less degree, in the Middle and even in the Old Attic Comedy; so that to
                    Philemon belongs the credit, not of inventing, but of developing a style which
                    had occasionally been employed before. In its absence of poetical idealism and
                    restriction to the prosaic realism of daily life the New Comedy stands to the
                    Old somewhat as the comedies of Molière or Sheridan stand to those of
                    Shakespeare. Its repertoire was limited to a few stock characters—the imprudent
                    lover, the designing fair, the stingy father, the greedy parasite, the
                    blustering swashbuckler—and its plots rang the changes on the well-worn theme of
                    thwarted but faithful love, rescued from its difficulties by the discovery of a
                    long-lost relative and ending in marriage. In the many fragments of Philemon
                    preserved by Stobaeus, Athenaeus, and other writers there is much wit and good
                    sense.</p>
