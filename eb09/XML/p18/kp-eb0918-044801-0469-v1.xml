                <p><label type="entry">PEARSON, JOHN</label> (1612-1686), a learned English bishop,
                    was born at Great Snoring in the county of Norfolk, on the 28th of February
                    1612. After attending Eton, he entered Queens’ College, Cambridge, 10th June
                    1631, and was elected a scholar of King’s in April following and a fellow in
                    1634. Entering holy orders in 1639, he was collated to the prebend of Nether-A
                    von, in the church of Sarum. In 1640 he was appointed chaplain to the
                    lord-keeper Finch, by whom he was presented to the living of Thorington in
                    Suffolk during the same year. In 1650 he was made preacher of St Clement’s,
                    Eastcheap, in London. Seven years later he and Peter Gunning had a dispute with
                    two Roman Catholics upon the subject of schism, a one-sided account of which was
                    printed at Paris by one of the Roman Catholic disputants, under the title <hi
                        rend="italic">Schism Unmasked,</hi> 1658. In 1659 Pearson published at
                    London his celebrated <hi rend="italic">Exposition of the Creed,</hi> dedicated
                    to his parishioners of St Clement’s, Eastcheap, to whom the substance of that
                    now standard work had been preached several years before, and by whom he had
                    been desired to make it public. The same year he likewise published the <hi
                        rend="italic">Golden Remains of the ever-memorable Mr John Hales of
                        Eton,</hi> to which he prefixed a preface containing a character of that
                    eminent man, with whom he had been acquainted for many years, drawn up with
                    great elegance and force. Pearson had also a principal share in the editing of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Critici Sacri,</hi> first published in 1660. Soon after
                    the Restoration he was presented by Juxon, then bishop of London, to the rectory
