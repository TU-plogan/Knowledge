                <p><label type="entry">PASQUINADE</label> is a variety of 1ibel or lampoon, of which
                    it is not easy to give an exact definition, separating it from other kinds. It
                    should, perhaps, more especially deal with public men and public things. The
                    distinction, however, has been rarely observed in practice, and the chief
                    interest in the word is in its curious and rather legendary origin. According to
                    the received tradition, Pasquino was a tailor (others say a cobbler) who had a
                    biting tongue, and lived in the 15th century at Rome. His name, at the end of
                    that century or the beginning of the next, was transferred to a statue which had
                    been dug up in a mutilated condition (some say near his shop) and was set up at
                    the corner of the Palazzo Orsini (α∕. Palazzo Braschi). To this statue it became
                    the custom to affix squibs on the papal Government aħd on prominent persons. At
                    the beginning of the 16th century Pasquin had a partner provided for him in the
                    shape of another statue found in the Campus Martius, said to represent a river
                    god, and dubbed Marforio, <hi rend="italic">a foro Martis.</hi> The regulation
                    form of the pasquinade then became one of dialogue or rather question and
                    answer, in which Marforio usually addressed leading inquiries to his friend. The
                    proceeding soon attained a certain European notoriety, and a printed collection
                    of the squibs due to it (they were long written in Latin verse, with an
                    occasional excursion into Greek) appeared in 1510. In the first book of <hi
                        rend="italic">Pantagruel</hi> (1532 or there abouts) Rabelais introduces
                    books by Pasquillus arid Marρhurius in the catalogue of the library of St
                    Victor, and later he quotes some utterances of Pasquin’s in his letters to the
                    bishop of Maillezais. These, by the way, show that Pasquin was by no means
                    always satirical, but dealt in grave advice and comment. The 16th century was
                    indeed Pasquin’s palmy time, and in not a few of the rare printed collections of
                    his utterances Protestant polemic (which was pretty certainly not attempted on
                    the actual statue) is mingled. These utterances were not only called pasquinades
                    but simply pasquils <hi rend="italic">(Pasquillus, Pas-quillo,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Pasquille),</hi> and this form was sometimes used for the
                    mythical personage himself. Under this title a considerable satirical literature
                    of quite a different kind from the original personal squibs and political
                    comments grew up in England at the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th
                    century under the titles of <hi rend="italic">Pasquil</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s
                        Apology, Pasquil</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Nightcap,</hi> &lt;fcc. The
                    chief writers were Thomas Nash and, after his death, Nicholas Breton. These
                    pieces (of extreme rarity, but lately reissued by the Rev. A. B. Grosart, in
                    private reprints of the works of their authors) were in prose. The French
                    pasquils (examples of which may be found in Fournier’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Varietes</hi><hi rend="italic">Historiques et Littéraires)</hi> were more
                    usually in verse. In Italy itself Pasquin is said not to have condescended to
                    the vernacular till the 18th century. During the first two hundred years of his
                    career few mornings, if any, found him unplacarded, and the institution supplied
                    a kind of rough and scurrilous gazette of public opinion. But the proceeding
                    gradually lost its actuality, and was, moreover, looked on with less and less
                    favour by the authorities. Indeed a sentinel was latterly posted to prevent the
                    placarding. It is said, however, that isolated pasquinades, having at least
                    local appropriateness, occurred not many years ago. Marforio, it should be
                    added, was soon removed from his companion’s neighbourhood to the Capitol.
                    Contemporary comic periodicals, especially in Italy, still occasionally use the
                    Marforio-Pasquin dialogue form. But this survival is purely artificial and
                    literary, and pasquinade has, as noted above, ceased to have any precise
                    meaning.</p>
