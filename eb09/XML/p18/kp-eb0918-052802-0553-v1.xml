                        >b.c.</hi> and succeeded his father Cypselus as despot of Corinth in 625 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His rule appears to have been at first mild and
                    beneficent, but evil advice or domestic calamity converted him into a cruel
                    tyrant. There runs a well-known story that he sent to ask the advice of
                    Thrasybulus, tyrant of Miletus, who, instead of replying, walked with the
                    messenger through a cornfield and struck off as he walked the tallest and
                    fairest of the ears. Periander took the hint, and proceeded to exterminate the
                    most eminent of his subjects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>In Aristotle’s version of the story the rôles of
                            Periander and Thrasybulus are reversed.</p></note> Whatever the cause,
                    there seems no reason to doubt that the latter part of the despot’s life was
                    darkened by crime. Goaded by the slanders of concubines, he murdered his beloved
                    wife Melissa, daughter of Procles, tyrant of Epidaurus, and then, in a fit of
                    remorse, burned the slanderers alive.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>The relations of Periander to his dead wife form the
                            subject of a curious tale. It is said that he got a necromancer to call
                            up the spirit of Melissa (as Saul called up Samuel), in order to
                            question her about a hidden treasure, just as people in Wurtemberg used
                            to call up ghosts in churchyards for a similar purpose. But the ghost
                            refused to answer. “For,” said she, “I am cold; 1 cannot wear the
                            garments laid in my grave, because they have not been burned.” So
                            Periander called together all the women of Corinth in their best attire
                            as for a festival, stripped them, and burned their garments on the grave
                            of his wife, that her ghost might not go naked. Similar to this is the
                            story in Lucian of the ghost of a dead wife appearing to her husband and
                            begging him to find and burn one of her golden sandals which had fallen
                            underneath the chest and so had not been burned with the
                        other.</p></note> The murder of his wife alienated from the tyrant the
                    affection of his favourite son Lycophron, whom, failing to move either by rigour
                    or blandishments, he banished to Corcyra, then a dependency of Corinth. At last,
                    enfeebled by age, Periander offered to resign the tyranny to his son and to
                    retire himself to Corcyra; but the prospect alarmed the Corcyreans, and they put
                    Lycophron to death. The tyrant took his revenge by sending three hundred of the
                    noblest Corcyrean youths to Alyattes, king of Lydia, to be made eunuchs of; they
                    were rescued, however, by the Samians. Periander did not long survive his son;
                    he fell into a deep despondency, and died either of grief or by violence
                    voluntarily incurred in 585 B.c., at the age of eighty.</p>
                <p>The accounts of Periander’s character are at first sight discrepant. One writer
                    (Heraclides) describes him as just and moderate, an enemy of vice and luxury,
                    which he severely repressed. But more commonly he appears as cruel and
                    oppressive. He surrounded himself with a body-guard, and, according to
                    Aristotle, reduced tyranny to a system by putting down eminent and aspiring
                    citizens, impoverishing the rich, maintaining spies, and sowing distrust between
                    classes and individuals. His costly offerings to the gods drained the resources,
                    while his public works and constant wars taxed the energies and distracted the
                    attention of the citizens. The privilege of settling in Corinth was placed by
                    him under certain restrictions. On the other hand, he not only patronized
                    literature in the person of the poet Arion but was himself the author of a
                    collection of moral maxims in 2000 verses. His reputation for wisdom stood so
                    high that he was commonly reckoned amongst the seven wise men, though some, as
                    Plato, denied his claim. Amongst the wars to which he owed his military fame
                    were successful expeditions against Epidaurus and Corcyra. He built a fleet and
                    scoured the seas on both sides of the isthmus, through which it is said that he
                    meditated cutting a canal. To him were due the Greek colonies of Apollonia,
                    Anactorium, and Leucas. On the whole, Periander would appear to have been one of
                    those brilliant despots whose personal vices have not destroyed their literary
                    and artistic sense, and who by their abilities have raised the states which they
                    governed to a high pitch of outward prosperity and power. Certain it is that
                    with the close of his dynasty, which happened a few years after his death, when
                    his successor Psammetichus perished in a popular rising, the golden age of
                    Corinthian history came to an end.</p>
                <p>There was another Periander, tyrant of Ambracia, said to have been a relative of
                    the tyrant of Corinth. He was deposed by the people, probably not long after the
                    death of the latter.</p>
                <p>The chief authorities for the life of Periander are Herodotus (iii. 48-53; V.
                    92), Aristotle (PoZ., v. 11, 12), Heraclides Ponticus (v.), Nicol. Damasc. (59,
                    60), Diog. Laert. (i. 7). The letter’s in Diogenes ascribed to Periander are no
                    doubt spurious.</p>
