                <p><label type="entry">PAUSANIAS</label>, a prose-writer (λογογράφο?) of Greek
                    traditions, mythical and historical, and a critic of Greek art. His important
                    work, in ten books, called Έλλάδο? <hi rend="italic">H.epιηyηa∙ις,</hi> usually
                    known as <hi rend="italic">Pausaniae</hi><hi rend="italic">Descriptio</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Graeciae,</hi> has come down to us entire. It is strictly an
                    itinerary through the Peloponnesus, including Attica, Baeotia, and Phocis, with
                    a rather slight mention of the adjacent islands and some of the principal towns
                    on the Asiatic coast. It was evidently compiled by one whose interest was mainly
                    centred in making notes of art-collections as they existed in the Greek temples
                    and public places in the time of the Antonines. In connexion with these he
                    expatiates on the myths and legends locally preserved, and thus he has handed
                    down to us much valuable mythological material which would otherwise have been
                    lost. A large portion of his work, however, is devoted to Greek history,
                    properly so called, though, after the manner of Herodotus and the early
                    logographers, he draws no distinction between legend and history. In a general
                    sense he may be styled an antiquary rather than an art-critic, a man of industry
                    rather than of genius, and one who deserves praise more from the matter of his
                    work than for the manner of it. Of the personal history of Pausanias nothing is
                    recorded. He lived during the prosperous times of the Roman empire under
                    Hadrian, whom he often mentions by name, and his successors Antoninus Pius and
                    Marcus Aurelius, the latter of whom became emperor in 161 <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    his successful contest with the Moors. Mention is also made of the “wall” raised
                    between the Forth and the Clyde by the elder Antonine to keep off the assaults
                    of the Brigantes. About himself and his birthplace the author is singularly
                    reticent. Nor has his work any formal introduction or conclusion. He commences
                    abruptly with a description of Attica: “The mainland of Hellas off the Cyclades
                    and opposite the Aegean Sea is called Attica, the jutting headland of which is
                    Sunium. There is a harbour when you have sailed past this foreland, and a temple
                    of Athena the Sunian goddess on the height.” He goes on to describe Athens at
                    considerable length, and gives a valuable though too brief account of the
                    Parthenon and the great bronze statue of the goddess on the Acropolis, the work
                    of Phidias,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>i. 28, 2.

                    into the harbour from Sunium. On the ivory and gold statue of the goddess in the
                    Parthenon (c. 24) he writes very briefly; on the Erechtheum and its antiquities
                    he expatiates more largely. The great temple of Ephesus, the very site of which
                    was lost till Mr Wood’s explorations between 1863 and 1874, appears to have been
                    perfect in his time, but he does not describe it; he merely says<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>vii. (Achaica), 5,
                        2.</p></note> that “Ionia contains temples such as are not elsewhere to be
                    seen, and first of all that of the Ephesian goddess, remarkable for its size and
                    its wealth in general.”</p>
                <p>Like Herodotus and Strabo, Pausanias was a traveller and an inquirer. In some
                    respects it is probable that he imitates the manner of Herodotus, as in his
                        credulity<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>As when he
                            says, as if seriously (viii. 2,. 4), that it seems to him quite credible
                            that Lycaon was changed into a wolf and Niobe into a stone in the good
                            old times when the gods conversed with men on earth.</p></note> and the
                    affectation of reserve in sacred matters. But, while geography and ethnology
                    chiefly engaged the attention of Strabo, art and antiquities generally form the
                    staple of Pausanias’s work. The passion of the Romans for securing specimens of
                    Greek art had long been fed by the plunder of temples and the removal of statues
                    from the towns of the Greek provinces, so graphically described in the orations
                    against Verres. Pausanias comments on the great antiquity of this kind of
                    sacrilege. “It is clear,” he remarks,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>viii. 46, 2.</p></note> “that Augustus was not the first
                    who established the custom of carrying away offerings from the temples of
                    conquered nations, but that he merely followed a very old precedent.” And he
                    quotes many examples of statues removed by right of conquest, as from Troy, from
                    Brauron and Branchidae by Xerxes, from Tiryns by the Argives, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the age of the Antonines special attention was directed to the works of art
                    still remaining in the Greek cities. The work known as Antonine’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Itinerary,</hi> which is a kind of handbook of the whole Roman
                    empire and its complex system of roads and colonies, may have suggested to
                    Pausanias a “Description of Greece,” on the lines laid down by Herodotus and
                    Strabo; but we have no exact date of the composition of either work. Leland
                    compiled his <hi rend="italic">Itinerary</hi> or tour through Britain on much
                    the same principles, and his record of churches and castles as they remained in
                    the later years of Henry VIII. is a survey of mediaeval art which resembles the
                    notes of Pausanias formed from his own inquiry and observation.</p>

                    Hadrian, which are matters of history. Nevertheless, after the drain of more
                    than three centuries, “Pausanias,” says Mr. Westropp,<note anchored="true"

                <p>Whether Pausanias had any real taste or enthusiasm for or judgment of fine art
                    does not appear from his somewhat matter-of-fact accounts. He reminds us of a
                    catalogue of goods made with the view of a sale, <hi rend="italic">minus</hi>
                    the auctioneer’s “puffing.” Nor is his motive much more apparent; he may have
                    written to let connoisseurs know what was yet to be had, or to put on record
                    existing works, with the names of the artists, as a protest against further
                    spoliation, or he may have been commissioned by imperial authority to make a
                    list of the art-treasures still exhibited to travellers in the Roman provinces.
                    In the century from Augustus to Trajan Greek education in art, literature, and
                    philosophy was much affected by the rich and well-born Romans, and collections
                    of Greek bronzes and real or spurious articles of antiquity were keenly competed
                    for, as we know from many of the epigrams of Martial.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Propertius has a curious critique on the
                            relative merits of the Greek sculptors and painters (iv. 8, 9-16). In
                            elegy 4 of the same book, ver. 6, he disclaims the character of a
                            wealthy collector, “nec miser aera paro clade, Corinthe,
                        tua.”</p></note></p>
                <p>Pausanias does not usually say that an object is beautiful; he tells us what it
                    is, where it is, and who executed it; that is generally all. Occasionally he
                    remarks that a statue is “worth <pb break="no"

                    hardly ever attempted. In ii. 27, 5 he speaks highly of Polyclitus as an
                    architect, and says that none can rival him for beauty or proportion. In vii. 5,
                    2 he says the temples of Hera in Samos and of Athena at Phocaea “were objects of
                    admiration,” though they had been burned and greatly injured by the Persians.
                    Occasionally (as vit 5, 4; 26, 6) he guesses the name of an unknown artist from
                    the style of a sculpture; in vii. 25, 4 he describes some marble statues of
                    women as showing a good style of art, <hi rend="italic">(χoυσaι τiχwηs eb.</hi>
                    His descriptions of a series of designs, like those painted by Polygnotus in the
                    Lesche at Delphi,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>X.
                            (Phocica), 25-31.</p></note> are dry and without a glimpse of
                    discrimination,—mere lists of names and subjects, like modern “guides” to a
                    gallery or museum of art. At the same time the minuteness of observation and the
                    careful record of all the inscribed names are most commendable, and the value of
                    the account to us from a literary point of view, as showing what subjects were
                    regarded as “Homeric” in the time of Polygnotus, a contemporary of Pericles,
                    cannot be overrated. The same remarks apply to the account of the famous “chest
                    of Cypselus,” preserved at Olympia, and claiming a great antiquity from the
                    inscriptions being written <hi rend="italic">βουστροφηδόν,</hi> alternately from

                    of scenes chiefly taken from the <hi rend="italic">Troica</hi> with these
                        words:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>19, 2, p.
                            427.</p></note> “Who the maker of this chest was we had no means of
                    forming any conjecture. The inscriptions upon it may perhaps be by another hand;
                    but our general impression ιvas that the designer was Eumelus of Corinth, mainly
                    on account of the processional hymn which he composed for Delos.” This Eumelus
                    is believed to have flourished about 750 B.c. The suspicion of Pausanias that
                    the inscriptions were later make it probable that the whole design and
                    workmanship were imitative on an archaic model.</p>
                <p>Recent explorations, especially those at Olympia, are largely indebted to the
                    careful and detailed accounts of Pausanias.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Phocaea he merely mentions, his researches being limited to the cities of
                    western Greece.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>vii. 5,
                            4. Here occurs one of the few faint expressions of pleasure or praise
                            that the writer indulges in. “You would be pleased,” he says, “also with
                            the temple of Hercules at Erythrae, and that of Athena at Priene, the
                            latter on account of the statue, the Heracleum for its antiquity.” These
                            remarks show that he had visited and knew something of the temples in
                            Ionia. The tomb of Mausolus at Halicarnassus he mentions in terms
                            approaching to praise, viii. 16, 4.</p></note> His notes on the
                    topography of Athens, though he passes over several of the more important
                    buildings, as the great theatre and the Odeum, with little more than a mere
                    reference, are still the principal authority confinning the allusions in early
                    writers. He seems, indeed, to have admired objects more for their antiquity than
                    for their beauty. He often diverges into long details of history, largely mixed
                    with legend, as in his long account of the Messenian wars in book iv.; indeed,
                    mythology and history proper stand with Pausanias in precisely the same
                    category. He does not show any great advance in this respect from the times of
                    Hecataeus or Pherecydes of Syros.</p>
                <p>The style of Pausanias is simple and easy, but it is wanting in the quaintness
                    and vivacity of Herodotus, and it has not the florid eloquence of Plato or
                    Lucian. The simple and genuine credulity of Herodotus seems foolish or affected
                    in a writer who lived in a much more advanced period of human knowledge. Thus he
                    gravely tells us<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>viii.
                            (Arcadica), 18, 5.</p></note> that the water of the Styx will break
                    crystal and precious stones and vessels of clay, and cause metals, even gold, to
                    decay, and can only be kept in a horse’s hoof.</p>
                <p>The titles of the several books are taken from the divisions of the Peloponnesus,
                    together with the three lying immediately north of the isthmus; the first book
                    being devoted to Attica, the ninth to Baeotia, and the tenth to Phocis. The
                    remainder are (ii.) Corinthiaca, (iii.) Laconica, (iv.) Messeniaca, (v. and vi.)
                    Eliaca, (vii.) Achaica, (viii. ) Arcadica. In adopting this nomenclature he
                    probably followed the <hi rend="italic">Troica, Persica,</hi> &amp;c., of
                    Hellanicus. A vast mass of information is contained in these several books,
                    which may be closely compared in their treatment and in the great variety of
                    subjects with English “county histories.”</p>
                <p>Without the sustained interest and the genial humour which characterize the work
                    of Herodotus, composed as it evidently was for recital and not for private
                    reading, Pausanias is an accurate and diligent recorder of what he saw and knew.
                    He copied inscriptions, and, like Herodotus, he often quotes oracles; in
                    ascertaining the names of artists he is particularly careful. That he had made
                    great research into the history and topography of Greece is abundantly shown;
                    but he is rather chary in his reference to previous authors. Of Herodotus he
                    makes mention in eight or nine places, of Plutarch in one (i. 36, 4), of Plato
                    in four. Thucydides is referred to once (vi. 19, 5), Acusilaus once (ii. 16, 4),
                    Hellanicus twice, Hecataeus four times, Strabo nowhere. Of the poets, epic,
                    lyric, and dramatic, he displays a good knowledge, as well as of Pindar, whom he
                    frequently quotes. It is clear, therefore, that Pausanias was a literary man,
                    and perhaps it is more an idiosyncrasy than a fault that he is cold and prosaic
                    in his descriptions. Of the author’s birth, family, or country there are no
                    indications. The name is Doric, but the style is the Attic of Plutarch, Strabo,
                    and Lucian.</p>
                <p>The best editions of Pausanias are those of Sicbelis (5 vols. 8vo, Leipsic,
                    1822-28), and of Schubart and walz (3 vols. 8vo, Leipsic, 1838-40). Schubαrt <hi

                    vols. 12ιno, Leipsic. 1862), with •brief introductory critical notes and a very
                    careful and complete index. This is an excellent and accurate edition, and one
                    which leaves nothing to be desired. (F. A. P.)</p>
