                <p><label type="entry">PHILOXENUS</label>, one of the last of the dithyrambic poets
                    of Greece, was born in 435 B.c., in the island of Cythera. When the island was
                    conquered by the Athenians in 424 Philoxenus was sold as a slave to Agesylas,
                    who gave him the name of Myrmex (“ant”). On the death of Agesylas he was bought
                    by the dithyrambic poet Melanippides, who educated him, no doubt in his own
                    profession. Philoxenus afterwards resided in Sicily, at the court of Dionysius,
                    tyrant of Syracuse, whose bad verses he declined to praise, and was in
                    consequence sent to work in the quarries. Being fetched back again and asked by
                    the tyrant how he liked his verses now, the poet made no reply but “Take me away
                    to the quarries.” He is said to have quitted Sicily in disgust at the luxury and
                    vulgarity of the people, abandoning an estate which he owned in the island. From
                    Sicily he seems to have gone to Tarentum, and thence perhaps to Corinth. He
                    visited Colophon in Asia Minor and died at Ephesus in 380. According to Suidas,
                    Philoxenus composed twenty-four dithyrambs and a lyric poem on the genealogy of
                    the Aeacidae. In his hands the dithyramb seems to have been a burlesque drama in
                    verse, which was acted and sung to the accompaniment of elaborate instrumental
                    music and enlivened <pb break="no"

                    comic opera. The music, which Philoxenus himself composed, appears to have been
                    of a debased, Offenbachian character. His masterpiece was the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Cyclops or</hi><hi rend="italic">Galatea,</hi> a pastoral burlesque on the
                    love of the Cyclops for the fair Galatea. Its general style may probably be
                    gathered from the sixth idyl of Theocritus. The work must have been well known
                    before 388, for it was parodied by Aristophanes in his play the <hi
                        rend="italic">Plutus,</hi> performed in that year. Another work of
                    Philoxenus, sometimes attributed to a notorious parasite and glutton of the same
                    name, is the Δείττνου (Dinner), of which considerable fragments have been
                    preserved by Athenaeus. This poem, of which the text is very obscure and
                    corrupt, is little more than an elaborate bill of fare put into verse, and, as
                    such, possesses more interest for cooks than scholars. In the time of Aristotle
                    it was the one book read by the Athenian quidnuncs. The great popularity enjoyed
                    by Philoxenus is attested not only by the allusions to him in the comic poets of
                    his day but also by a complimentary resolution passed by the Athenian senate in
                    393 on the motion of the dithyrambic poet Cinesias. The intention of the decree
                    was doubtless mainly political—to propitiate Dionysius—but the poet was included
                    in it. Nor was his popularity transient: the poet Antipha.nes of the Middle
                    Comedy spoke of Philoxenus as a god among men; Alexander the Great had his poems
                    sent to him in Asia along with the tragedies of Aeschylus, Sophocles, and
                    Euripides; the Alexandrian grammarians received him into the canon; and down to
                    the time of Polybius his works λvere regularly learned and annually acted by the
                    Arcadian youth. The scanty fragments of his works are to be found in Bergk’s <hi
