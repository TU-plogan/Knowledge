                        rend="smallcaps">Lucius Aemilius,</hi> a distinguished Roman general, of the
                    patrician family of the Aemilii, was born about 229 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.</hi> He was the son of the consul of the same name who fell at Cannae.
                    As curule aedile in 192 he gave a proof of his integrity by prosecuting the
                    persons who made an illegal use of the public pastures. His first laurels were
                    won in Further Spain, whither he was sent as praetor in 191. Though at first
                    defeated with loss, he finally overthrew the enemy in a bloody battle (189) and
                    tranquillized Spain. In 182 he was consul, and in the following year subdued the
                    Ingauni, a piratical tribe of Liguria, dismantling their towns and carrying off
                    their ships. For this service he was granted a triumph. After a period of
                    retirement from public life he was elected consul a second time, for 168, and
                    entrusted with the command in the Macedonian war, which the incapacity of
                    previous Roman generals had allowed to drag on without success for three years.
                    Paulus brought the war to a speedy termination by the battle of Pydna, fought on
                    22d June (Julian calendar) 168. The battle decided the fate of Macedonia, which
                    was henceforward a Roman province. The Macedonian king Perseus surrendered
                    shortly afterwards and met with a courteous reception from the Roman general.
                    Paulus now availed himself of his position to make the tour of Greece, visiting
                    with an intelligent interest the places immortalized in Greek history and
                    legend. Afterwards, assisted by ten Roman commissioners, he arranged the affairs
                    of Macedonia. In obedience to the orders of the senate, on his return through
                    Epirus to Italy he gave up seventy towns to pillage and carried off 150,000 of
                    the inhabitants as slaves. A magnificent triumph, graced by the presence of the
                    captive king Perseus and his three children, rewarded the conqueror of Macedonia
                    (167). But his public glory was closely attended by private misfortune; of the
                    two sons borne him by his second wife one died a few days before, <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0918-0457-0436"/> the other a few days after, his triumph. The
                    veteran was thus left without a son to bear his name; for of his two sons by his
                    first wife Papiria, the elder had been adopted by Quintus Fabius Maximus,
                    Hannibal’s great opponent, and the younger by the son of Scipio Africanus. The
                    latter, known as P. Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, was the conqueror of Carthage
                    and Numantia. Paulus was censor in 164, and died in 160. At the funeral games
                    exhibited in his honour the <hi rend="italic">Hecyra</hi> of Terence was acted
                    for the second and the <hi rend="italic">Ádelphi</hi> for the first time.</p>
                <p>Paulus was a fine specimen of a Roman noble. An aristocrat to the backbone, he
                    was yet beloved by the people, whose favour he never deigned to court by
                    unworthy means. His integrity was perfect; of the vast sums brought by him into
                    the Roman treasury from Spain and Macedonia he kept not a penny to himself. At
                    his death his property with difficulty sufficed to pay his wife’s dowry. As a
                    general he was a strict disciplinarian; as an augur he discharged the religious
                    duties of his office with conscientious care and exactness. His piety passed
                    into superstition, as when before the battle of Pydua he* sacrificed to the
                    moon, then under eclipse. His sympathy with Greek learning and art is attested
                    by the Greek masters whom he procured for his sons, as well as by his travels in
                    Greece, the works of art he brought home, and his friendship for the historian
                    Polybius. His nobility of nature won him the affection and esteem of all who
                    knew him, of his enemies no less than of his countrymen. An affecting proof is
                    the fact recorded by Plutarch that his body was carried to the grave by
                    volunteers from all the nations he had conquered, while old men from Spain,
                    Liguria, and. Macedonia followed lamenting the man who (according to them} was
                    at once their conqueror and their saviour.</p>
                <p>There is a life of him by Plutarch, but his campaigns in Liguria and Macedonia
                    are more fully described by Livy (xl. 25-28; xliv. 17 - xlv. 41).</p>
