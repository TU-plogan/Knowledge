                <p><label type="entry">PARK, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mungo</hi></label> (1771-1806?), a
                    celebrated African traveller, was born in Selkirkshire, Scotland, on the 20th
                    September 1771, at Fowlshiels on the Yarrow,—the farm which his father rented
                    from the duke of Buccleuch. He was the seventh in a family of thirteen. Having
                    received a good education (at home from a private tutor, and afterwards at the
                    grammar school of Selkirk), he was apprenticed to a surgeon named Anderson, in
                    Selkirk, and then attended the university of Edinburgh for three sessions
                    (1789-91). By his brother-in-law, James Dickson, a botanist of repute, he was
                    introduced to Sir Joseph Banks, and through his good offices he obtained the
                    post of assistant-surgeon on board the “Worcester” East Indiaman. In this
                    capacity he made the voyage in 1792 toBencoolen in Sumatra, andon his return in
                    1793 he contributed a description of eight new Sumatran fishes to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Transactions</hi> of the Linnean Society. Park next offered
                    his services to the African Association, then looking out for a successor to the
                    unfortunate Major Houghton, and, again supported by the influence of Sir Joseph
                    Banks, he was successful in his application. On the 21st June 1795 he reached
                    the Gambia, but it was not till December 2d that he started for Pisania with
                    only two Negro servants (Johnson and Demba) on the hazardous and difficult
                    expedition into the interior, from which he was to return with the proud
                    distinction of being the first of modern Europeans to reach the well-nigh
                    fabulous waters of the Niger. Striking north-eastward across the upper basin of
                    the Senegal, he advanced through Kaarta and El Hodh, and descended upon the
                    great river of his quest at Segu on the north bank, about 13° 5 ’ N. lat. and 6°
                    20' W. long. Though he was not able to proceed down stream any farther than
                    Mursan and Silla, he managed on his home journey to follow the river valley as
                    far up as Bammako, a distance of about 300 miles. By the 10th June he was again
                    at Pisania, but he did not reach England till December 22, 1796. An account of
                    his journey was at once· drawn up for the Association by Bryan Edwards, and a
                    detailed narrative from his own pen appeared in 1799 <hi rend="italic">(Travels

                    holds its place as one of the acknowledged classics in this department of
                    literature. It seemed for a time as if Park was now to settle down quietly at
                    home; he married a daughter of his old master, Mr Anderson, and commenced
                    practice as a country doctor at Peebles, where at least he could enjoy “a glass
                    of strong beer and a peep at the sky through Mr Oman’s telescope”; but he was
                    ill at ease—his heart was in Africa. In 1804 the people of Peebles were amused
                    and alarmed by the vagaries of Sidi Omback Boubi from Mogador, who had come to
                    teach their doctor Arabic; and in autumn Park parted from Sir Walter Scott, who
                    had been one of his best friends, with the hopeful proverb on his lips, “Freits
                    (omens) follow those that look to them.” He had accepted Lord Hobart’s proposal
                    that he should take command of a Niger expedition. He sailed from Portsmouth on
                    January 30, 1805; and the expedition started from Pisania on May 4th.
                    Unfortunately the rainy season soon afterwards commenced; by the time Bammako
                    was reached the party was reduced from forty-four Europeans to eleven, and from
                    Sansanding the leader had to report “five only are at present alive, viz., three
                    soldiers (one deranged in his mind), Lieutenant Martyn, and myself.” Among those
                    who had died at Sansanding was his brother-in-law Mr Anderson. On November 19th
                    he set sail down the river from Sansanding with the “fixed resolution to
                    discover the termination of the Niger or perish in the attempt.” Isaaco, the
                    Mandingo guide who had accompanied the expedition up to this point, was
                    afterwards sent on a mission to find out the fate of the voyagers; it was
                    learned that they had managed to make their way through countless perils to
                    Bussa (Boussa) between 9° and 10° N. lat., and that they were there attacked by
                    the natives, and were drowned in endeavouring to escape. Park was 6 feet in
                    height, active and robust; his countenance was prepossessing, his manner in
                    company plain and simple, but somewhat cold and reserved.</p>
