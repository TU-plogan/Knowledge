                    (1518-1580), a native of Vicenza in the north of Italy, one of the chief
                    architects of his century. Palladio’s early student life was spent in Rome,
                    where he learned the practical part of his profession, and spent several years
                    in making drawings of the buildings of ancient Rome. In 1547 he returned to his
                    native city Vicenza, where he designed a very large number of fine
                    buildings—among the chief being the Barbarano, Porti, and Chieregati palaces, as
                    well as many others for various nobles of Vicenza and the neighbourhood. Perhaps
                    his finest work in Vicenza itself was the Palazzo della Ragione, with two
                    stories of open arcades of the Tuscan and Ionic orders. Most of these buildings,
                    however, look better on paper than in reality, as they are mainly built of
                    brick, covered with stucco, now in a very dilapidated condition. This does not
                    affect the merit of their design, as Palladio intended them to have been
                    executed in stone. His fame extended widely throughout Italy, and Pope Paul III.
                    sent for him to Rome to report upon the state of St Peter’s. In Venice, too,
                    Palladio built many stately churches and palaces, such as S. Giorgio Maggiore,
                    the Capuchin church, and some large palaces on the Grand Canal. His last great
                    work was the Teatro Olimpico at Vicenza, designed after a classical model; he
                    died before its completion, and it was finished, though not altogether after the
                    original design, by his pupil and fellow-citizen Scamc zzi.</p>
                <p>In addition to his town buildings, Palladio designed many country villas in
                    various parts of northern Italy. The villa of Capra is perhaps the finest of
                    these, and has frequently been imitated. Palladio was a great student of
                    classical literature, and was much influenced by Vitruvius’s great work on
                    architecture. He also published in 1575 an edition with notes of Caesar’s <hi

                <p>His great literary work was <hi rend="italic">I quattro</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >libri</hi><hi rend="italic">dell'</hi><hi rend="italic">Architettura,</hi>
                    first published at Venice in 1570, which has passed into countless editions, and
                    been translated into every European language. The original edition is a small
                    folio, richly illustrated with well-executed full-page woodcuts of plans,
                    elevations, and details of buildings,—chiefly either ancient Roman temples or
                    else palaces designed and built by himself. The influence of this book on the
                    architecture of Europe has been enormous. Among many others, an edition with
                    notes was published in England by Inigo Jones, most of whose works, and
                    especially the palace of Whitehall, of which only the banqueting room remains,
                    owed much to Palladio’s inspiration. Though other Italian architects in the 16th
                    century worked out and developed the same style, yet, in England at least, the
                    term Palladian has been used to include all the results of this revival of
                    classicalism. Vignola, Scamozzi, and Serlio were among the chief of Palladio’s
                    contemporaries. The style adopted and partially invented by Palladio expressed a
                    kind of revolt against the extreme licence both of composition and ornament into
                    which the architecture of his time had fallen. Though often noble, dignified,
                    and full of the most harmonious proportions, Palladio’s style is dull and
                    lifeless, dominated by scholasticism, and regardless of considerations of
                    utility and convenience.</p>
                <p>He was fascinated by the stateliness and beauty of proportion which are the chief
                    charms of the buildings of ancient Rome, and did not stop to reflect that
                    reproductions of these, however great their archaeological accuracy, could not
                    but be lifeless and unsuited to the wants of the 16th century. Palladio’s
                    carefully measured drawings of ancient buildings are now of great value, as in
                    many cases the buildings have altogether or in part ceased to exist.</p>
