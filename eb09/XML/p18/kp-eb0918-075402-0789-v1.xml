                <p><label type="entry">PHILIPS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ambrose</hi></label>
                    (1671-1749), English man of letters, was born of a good Leicester family in
                    1671. While at St John’s College, Cambridge, he gave evidence of literary taste
                    and skill, in verses forming part of a memorial tribute from the university on
                    the death of Queen Mary. Going to London on the completion of his studies,
                    Philips speedily became “one of the wits at Button’s,” and thereby a friend of
                    Steele and Addison. He began to write for Tonson, working at such heterogeneous
                    subjects as translated “Persian Tales” and a summary of Hacket’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Life of Archbishop Williams.</hi> The first product really
                    characteristic of the author, after his settlement in London, is the series of
                        <hi rend="italic">Pastorals</hi> which opened the sixth volume of Tonson’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Miscellanies</hi> (1709). Pope’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pastorals,</hi> curiously enough, closed the same volume, and the emphatic
                    preference expressed in the <hi rend="italic">Guardian,</hi> in 1713, for
                    Philips’s pastoral style over all other successors to Spenser gave rise to
                    Pope’s trenchant ironical paper in No. 40 of the same periodical. The breach
                    between these two wits speedily λvidened, and Philips was at length concerned in
                    the great quarrel between Pope and Addison. He had come to be a man of some note
                    both for literary work and political activity. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Spectator</hi> had loaded with praises the drama of <hi rend="italic">The
                        Distress'd Mother,</hi> which Philips adapted from Racine’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Androτnaque</hi> and brought upon the stage in 1712, and he
                    was thus a recognized member of Addison’s following. There is some doubt as to
                    the particular part he played in the notorious contest of the two chiefs, but,
                    whether he threatened to beat Pope or not (with the rod which he is said to have
                    hung up at Button’s for that purpose), there is ample evidence to show that both
                    Pope and his friends had a bitter feeling towards him. Not only is he honoured
                    with two separate lines in the <hi rend="italic">Dunciαd,</hi> but he figures
                    for illustrative purposes in <hi rend="italic">Martinus Scrιblerus,</hi> and he
                    receives considerable attention in the letters of both Pope and Swift. The
                    latter found occasion for special allusion to Philips during Philips’s stay in
                    Ireland, whither he had gone as secretary to Archbishop Boulter. He had done
                    good work in the <hi rend="italic">Freethinker</hi> (1711) along with Boulter,
                    whose services to the Government in that paper gained him preferment from his
                    position as clergyman in Southwark, first to the bishopric of Bristol and then
                    to the primacy of Ireland. Up to this time Philips had shown disinterested zeal
                    in the Hanoverian cause, though he had received no greater reward than the
                    positions of justice of peace and commissioner of the lottery (1717). He had
                    also written some of his best epistles, while in 1722 he published two more
                    dramatic works— <hi rend="italic">The Briton</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Humphry,
                        Duke of Gloucester</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> neither of which has had the
                    fortune, like their predecessor, to be immortalized by romantic criticism. It
                    was, no doubt, a grateful change for Philips to go to Ireland under the
                    patronage of Archbishop Boulter, and to represent, through the same influence,
                    the county of Armagh in the Irish Parliament, while his sense of his own
                    political worth must have been flattered when he became secretary to the lord
                    chancellor in 1726, and in 1733 judge of the prerogative court. After the
                    archbishop’s death he by and by returned to London, and dedicated a collected
                    edition of his works to the duke of Newcastle. He died in 1749.</p>
                <p>ΛVlιile it can hardly be said that Philips’s <hi rend="italic">Pastorals</hi>
                    show poetic quality of a high order, they must be commended—and perhaps the
                    third in particular—for ease and fluency and rhetorical vigour. In these
                    features they are not surpassed by the pastorals in <hi rend="italic">The
                        Shepherd's Week,</hi> which Gay wrote, at Pope’s instigation, as a burlesque
                    on Philips’s work; but the grasp of rustic simplicity and the exquisite play of
                    fancy possessed by Gay are manifest advantages in his performance. The six
                    epistles evince dexterous management of the heroic couplet, an energetic
                    directness of purpose, and (particularly the “winter piece” addressed to the
                    earl of Dorset) a noticeable appreciation of natural beauty. Similar felicitous
                    diction and sympathetic observation, together with a determined bias towards
                    weakness of sentiment, are characteristic of the poet’s odes, some of
                    which—addressed to children—gave occasion for various shafts from both Swift and
                    Pope, as well as for the nickname of “Namby-Pamby,” coined by Henry Carey as a
                    descriptive epithet for Philips. The epigrams, and the translations from Pindar,
                    Anacreon, and Sappho, need merely be named as completing the list of the
                    author’s works.</p>
