                        >Jerôme</hi></label> (1753-1794), was the son of a procureur at Chartres,
                    where he was born in 1753. He himself became an avocat in his native place in
                    1778, and at once began to try to make a name in literature. His first printed
                    work was an essay, <hi rend="italic">Sur les Moyens de prévenir</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Infanticide,</hi> which failed to
                    gain the prize for which it was composed, but pleased Brissot so much that he
                    printed it in vol. vii. of his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque philosophique des
                        Législateurs.</hi> Pétion’s next works, <hi rend="italic">Les Lois
                        Civiles,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Essai sur le Mariage,</hi> in which he
                    advocated the marriage of priests, confirmed his position as a bold reformer,
                    and when the elections to the States-General took place in 1789 he was elected a
                    deputy to the Tiers Etat for Chartres. Both in the assembly of the Tiers Etat
                    and in the Constituent Assembly Pétion showed himself a radical leader. He
                    supported Mirabeau on 23d June, attacked the queen on 5th October, and was
                    elected president on 4th December 1790. On 21st June 1791 he was chosen one of
                    three commissioners appointed to bring back the king from Varennes. After the
                    last meeting of the assembly on 30th September 1791 Robespierre and Pétion were
                    made the popular heroes and were crowned by the populace with civic crowns.
                    Pétion received a still further proof of the affection of the Parisians for
                    himself on 14th November 1791, when he was elected second mayor of Paris in
                    succession to Bailly. In his mayoralty he exhibited clearly his republican
                    tendency and his hatred of the old monarchy, especially on 20th June 1792, when
                    he allowed the mob to overrun the Tuileries and insult the royal family. For
                    neglecting to protect the Tuileries he was suspended from his functions by the
                    Directory of the department of the Seine, but the leaders of the Legislative
                    Assembly felt that Pétion’s cause was theirs, and rescinded the suspension on
                    13th July. On 3d August, at the head of the municipality of Paris, Pétion
                    demanded the dethronement of the king, and on 10th August, while the monarchy
                    was falling with the Tuileries, he patiently underwent a form of detention in
                    his own mairie. He was still mayor of Paris when the massacres of September in
                    the prisons took place, and must bear the blame of not having endeavoured to
                    interfere. He was elected to the Convention for Eure-et-Loir, and became its
                    first president. Manuel then had the folly to propose that the president of the
                    Assembly should have the same authority as the president of the United States;
                    his proposition was at once rejected, but Pétion got the nickname of “Roi
                    Pétion,” which contributed to his fall. His jealousy of Robespierre allied him
                    to the Girondin party, as did also his assiduous attention at Madame Roland’s
                    salon. With the Girondins he voted for the king’s death and for the appeal to
                    the people, as one of them he was elected to the first committee of general
                    defence in March 1793, as their representative he attacked Robespierre on 12th
                    April, and it is no matter of wonder, therefore, that his name was among those
                    of the twenty-two Girondin deputies proscribed on 2d June. Pétion was one of
                    those who escaped to Caen and raised the standard of provincial insurrection
                    against the Convention; and when the Norman rising failed he fled with Guadet,
                    Buzot, Barbaroux, Salle, and Louvet to the Gironde, and hid in a grotto at St
                    Émilion. At last, but a month before Robespierre’s fall in June 1794, the
                    escaped deputies felt themselves tracked down, and deserted the grotto; Louvet
                    found his way to Paris, Salle and Guadet to Bordeaux, where they were soon
                    taken; Barbaroux committed suicide; and the bodies of Pétion and Buzot were
                    found in a field, half-eaten by wolves.</p>
