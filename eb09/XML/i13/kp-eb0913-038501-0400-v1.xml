                        >Inarime,</hi> and the mediaeval <hi rend="italic">Iscla,</hi> a volcanic
                    island of Italy, is situated at the north entrance to the Bay of Naples, about
                    15 miles south-west of the Cape of Miseno. The circumference, omitting the
                    irregular indentations of the coast-line, is about 19 miles, and the superficial
                    area about 26 square miles. Monte Epomeo or San Nicola, the ancient Epomeus or
                    Epopeus, which rises to the height of 2600 feet above sea-level, is the highest
                    point. The principal summit is surrounded by twelve inferior volcanic cones,
                    from one of which the last eruption in the island took place in 1302. The
                    valleys between the mountains and the plain which occupies a part of the
                    interior are remarkable for their luxuriant vegetation and beautiful scenery.
                    The vegetable products of Ischia are very rich and various. Most of the
                    cultivated land is occupied by vines, from which a somewhat acrid white wine is
                    manufactured. Corn, oil, and southern fruits are produced in luxuriant
                    profusion. Oak and chestnut groves, thickets of myrtle and lentiscus,
                    cotton-trees, mulberries, and arbutus stretch up the mountain sides and along
                    the pastures. Iron and sulphur are found on the island, and bricks, tiles, and
                    pottery are manufactured at Casamicciola. The great sources of wealth to the
                    island are the numerous thermal mineral springs, which are among the strongest
                    and most efficacious in Europe. Casamicciola is the headquarters of the water,
                    hot-air, and sand baths, but Lacco is also popular in the season. Though the
                    nominal bathing season lasts from June to September, the exquisite climate and
                    lovely situation of Ischia allure visitors all the year round. The island has
                    suffered heavily from earthquakes. A very severe shock in March 1881 occasioned
                    great loss of life and property. The inhabitants, about 25,000 in number, are
                    distinguished by a peculiar dialect and figure, and are chiefly engaged in
                    tillage and fishing. The chief town is Ischia (6500) on the east coast, the seat
                    of a bishop, with an old castle of the 15th century. Other towns are Forio
                    (6100) on the west coast, Casamicciola and Lacco on the north, Panza, and
                    Moropano.</p>
                <p>Ischia was first colonized by Greeks from Chaicis in Euboea, but although the
                    colony rose to prosperity it was driven from the island by volcanic outbreaks.
                    Similar convulsions dispersed a second colony established by Hiero of Syracuse.
                    From the Neapolitans, who were the next settlers, the island passed into the
                    hands of Rome, but Suetonius informs us that Augustus again restored it to
                    Naples, in exchange for the inferior Capreae. The name of Ischia does not often
                    occur in Roman history, but it seems to have been early in repute as a resort
                    for invalids. After the fall of Rome, it suffered much and repeatedly at the
                    hands of the successive invaders and rulers of Italy. In 1299 it was captured by
                    Charles II. of Naples, since which time it has had a full share of the
                    vicissitudes that are so characteristic of the history of Italian towns and
                    provinces.</p>
