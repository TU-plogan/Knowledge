                <p><label type="entry">INNKEEPERS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Law relating
                    to</hi></label>. By the common law of England innkeepers are under certain
                    peculiar obligations, the most important of which are the duty of supplying
                    accommodation to such travellers as may desire it, and their responsibility for
                    the safety of the goods belonging to persons staying in their inns. An inn is a
                    place “instituted for passengers and wayfaring men,” and in a recent case, in
                    which the proprietor of a restaurant was prosecuted for refusing refreshment on
                    demand, it was held that a tavern, or shop for the retail of spirits across the
                    counter, is not within the definition, and that a person <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit13newyrich/page/n91/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0091-0082"/> resident in the neighbourhood of the inn is
                    not a traveller. An innkeeper may be indicted for refusing accommodation to a
                    traveller, who may also of course have a remedy by civil action. To render an
                    innkeeper liable for loss of goods at common law, the following are stated by
                    Chitty <hi rend="italic">{Law of Contracts)</hi> to be necessary conditions
                    :—(1) that the inn be a “common” inn; (2) that the guest be a traveller or
                    passenger; (3) that the goods or chattels must be in the inn, or at all events
                    under the protection of the innkeeper as such; (4) that there be default on the
                    part of the innkeeper, which is, however, implied in all cases not arising from
                    the negligence of the guest, the act of God, or of the queen’s enemies. An
                    innkeeper receiving goods in any other capacity, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> as
                    a warehouseman or generally as bailee, or allowing the guest exclusive
                    possession of a room for special purposes, is not liable for loss. Nor is the
                    innkeeper liable for loss of goods by the theft of the guest’s servant or
                    companion, or by the negligence of the guest himself. A recent Act, 26 &amp; 27
                    Vict. c. 4, limits the liability of the innkeeper by the following provisions
                    :—No innkeeper shall be liable to make good loss or injury to goods or property
                    (not being a horse, or other live animal, or gear appertaining thereto, or a
                    carriage) to a greater sum than £30, except in the following cases—(1) when the
                    loss has been caused by the default or neglect of the innkeeper or his servants,
                    (2) when such goods have been deposited expressly for safe custody with the
                    innkeeper, who may require them to be deposited in a safe or other receptacle
                    and sealed by the person depositing the same. Innkeepers are not entitled to the
                    benefit of the Act if they refuse to receive goods for safe custody, or
                    otherwise prevent their deposit as before provided for, or if they fail to have
                    one copy at least of the first section of the Act exhibited in a conspicuous
                    place in the inn. The liability of innkeepers was recognized in the civil law.
                    On the other hand, the innkeeper has a lien on the goods of his guest for the
                    amount of his bill. It does not extend to the clothes of the guest or justify
                    his personal detention, but it includes articles in the possession of the guest
                    belonging to third persons, at least when they are of a kind that travellers
                    might ordinarily be expected to have. When a professional artist living at an
                    inn had a piano on hire, the innkeeper, who knew it did not belong to her, was
                    held to have no lien thereon. In a recent case the lien has been held to cover a
                    hired piano in the possession of a family staying at an inn. In some American
                    cases it has been held that the possession of a licence does not produce, nor
                    does the absence of a licence prevent, the liabilities of an innkeeper at common
                    law. An inn is distinguished from a boarding-house in this, that in the latter
                    the guest is under an express contract for a certain time at a certain rate, in
                    the former under an implied contract from day to day. Even if a boarding-house
                    keeper entertains guests in the capacity of an innkeeper, he is not liable as
                    such to his boarding-house guests.</p>
