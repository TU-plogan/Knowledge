                <p><label type="entry">INNOCENT VI</label>., Stephen Aubert, pope at Avignon from
                    1352 to 1362, the successor of Clement VI., was a native of the diocese of
                    Limoges, and, after having taught civil law at Toulouse, became bishop
                    successively of Noyon and of Clermont. In 1342 he was raised to the dignity of
                    cardinal. On the death of Clement VI., after the cardinals had each bound
                    himself by a solemn agreement as to a particular line of policy should he be
                    elected, Aubert was chosen (December 18, 1352); one of the first acts of his
                    pontificate was to declare the paction to have been illegal and null. His
                    subsequent policy compares favourably with that of the other Avignon popes. He
                    brought about many needed reforms in the administration of church affairs, and
                    by his legate, Cardinal Albornoz, who was accompanied by Rienzi, he sought to
                    restore order in Rome, where in 1355 Charles IV. was with his permission
                    crowned, after having previously come under an oath that he would quit the city
                    on the day of the ceremony. It was largely through the exertions of Innocent
                    that the peace of Bretigny (1360) between France and England was brought about.
                    During this pontificate also John Palaeologus offered to submit the Greek Church
                    to the Roman see on condition of assistance being rendered him against John
                    Cantacuzenus. The resources at the disposal of the pope, however, were all
                    required for exigencies nearer home, and the offer was declined. Innocent was a
                    liberal patron of letters, and, if the extreme severity of his measures against
                    the Fraticelli be kept out of account, had a deservedly high reputation for
                    justice and mercy. He died September 12, 1362, and his successor was Urban
                    V.</p>
