                    at Segovia in 1703, and became a member of the Society of Jesus, in which he
                    distinguished himself both as a teacher and as a preacher; on the expulsion of
                    his order from Spain in 1767 he betook himself to Bologna, where after some
                    years of impaired health he died in 1783. His first literary experiment was the

                    1727), a cleverly disguised satirical account of a festival celebrated in 1727
                    at Salamanca in honour of two young Jesuits who had recently been canonized by
                    Benedict XIII., iu which he was assisted by a brother priest named Losada; it
                    was followed iu 1746 by his <hi rend="italic">Triuηfo del Amor</hi><hi

                    accession of Ferdinand VI. of Castile had been celebrated in Pampe-lona. This
                    was written in so delicate a vein of satire that at first the parties chiefly
                    ridiculed felt really flattered, and expressed their gratitude to the author;
                    ultimately, however, its true meaning was discerned, and so strong was the
                    reaction that he had to leave the locality. The work on which Isla’s claim to a
                    place in the history of the literature of his country rests, however, is his <hi

                        >Gerundio</hi><hi rend="italic">de Campazas,</hi> in which in course of an
                    imaginary biography of a preaching friar named Gerundio many of the absurdities
                    that deformed the Spanish pulpit at that time are ably held up to ridicule. The
                    first volume appeared at Madrid in 1758, duly approved by the ecclesiastical
                    authorities, who probably were not unwilling that the faults then glaringly
                    prevalent among preachers should be chastized and if possible corrected; so
                    great was the offence given, however, to the religious orders, and especially to
                    the Dominicans, by the causticity of <hi rend="italic">Fray</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Gerundio,</hi> that the royal authority was at last called in
                    to prohibit the book. The second volume, which therefore could only appear
                    surreptitiously, is dated “Campazas” <hi rend="italic">(i.e.,</hi> Madrid),
                    1770, and like the first bears on the title page the name of Don Francisco Lobon
                    de Salazar as its author. An anonymous translation by Thomas Nugent <hi
                        rend="italic">(The History of the famous preacher Friar Gerund de Campazas,
                        otherwise Gerund Zotes)</hi> appeared in London, in two volumes, in 1772.
                    Six volumes of <hi rend="italic">Sermones,</hi> written between 1729 and 1754,
                    and published in 1792, show that Isla’s own high reputation as a preacher was
                    not undeserved; and his <hi rend="italic">Cartas</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Familiares</hi> (6 vols., Madrid, 1785-86) are written iu an easy and
                    attractive style. He is also well known iu the Peninsula as the eminently
                    successful translator of Gil Blas <hi rend="italic">(Gil Blas de Sxηtillaηa

                        rend="italic">patria,</hi> printed at Madrid in 1787), although his
                    strenuously asserted theory that La Sage had borrowed that popular story
                    wholesale from a Spanish source is now entirely exploded.</p>
