                <p><label type="entry">ISÈRE</label>, a department of south-eastern France, formed
                    from the southern part of the old province of Dauphiné, is bounded on the N. by
                    the department of Ain, E. by Savoie and Hautes-Alpes, S. by Hautes-Alpes and
                    Drome, and W. by Drôme, Loire, and Rhone. It lies between 44° 43'and 45° 43' 19"
                    N. lat., and between 4° 43' 32" and 7° 6' 9" E. long., being about 100 miles
                    long from northwest to south-east and 60 miles broad from north-east to
                    south-west. It derives its name from the river Isère, which flows through it
                    from north-east to south-west. The Rhone, with several tributaries, is the other
                    chief stream. Lake Paladuc is the largest of several lakes in the department.
                    The surface is mountainous, especially in the south-east, which is occupied by
                    lofty offshoots of the Alps, some of whose summits are covered with perpetual
                    snow. The Belledonne, the Grandes-Rousses, the Oisans, the Grande Chartreuse,
                    famous for its monastery, the Vercors, the Lans, and the Dévoluy are the chief
                    groups and ranges which are found either wholly or partly within Isère. The
                    highest point is the Aiguille du Midi (9800 feet). Towards the north and west
                    the country gradually slopes down in fertile terraces to the Rhone. The river
                    valleys are remarkable for their extent and fertility; that of Graisivaudan is
                    reckoned one of the richest in France. The climate of Isère varies according to
                    the irregularity of the surface, but is on the whole colder and ruder than is
                    usual at its latitude. Agriculture occupies about four-fifths of the
                    inhabitants, although less than half the total area is suited for cultivation.
                    Wheat, barley, rye, oats, buckwheat, maize, potatoes, hemp, colza, and fruit,
                    and, on the southern slopes, vines, walnuts, mulberries, and almonds, are the
                    principal crops. Valuable pastures, on which mules and large flocks of sheep are
                    bred, extend up the mountain to meet the large forests stretching down from the
                    snow-line. Silkworms are reared easily and profitably; fish is exported in
                    considerable quantity to Paris; and the cheese of the department is much
                    esteemed. Gold and silver are found in small quantities. The chief minerals are
