                    Church of England, was born at Oxford in October 1602. In June 1618 he became a
                    scholar of Trinity College, and after a course of logic and philosophy he was
                    admitted to the degree of Master of Arts in 1623, and was made a fellow of
                    Trinity College in June 1628. In those days he industriously cultivated the art
                    of disputation, as was the fashion among the young theologians of the
                    university. He also excelled in mathematics, and gained some credit as a writer
                    of verses. The controversy between the Church of England and that of Rome was

                    consequence of the marriage of Charles with Henriette of France. Missionaries of
                    the Church of Rome were busy throughout the country. The J esuits made the
                    universities their special point of attack; and one, named Fisher, who had his
                    sphere at Oxford, succeeded in making a convert of young Chillingworth. To
                    secure his conquest, Fisher prevailed upon Chillingworth to go to the Jesuit
                    college at Douay. While he was there, Laud, who was his godfather, and who then
                    was bishop of London, pressed him with arguments against the doctrine and
                    practice of the Church of Rome, which had the effect of determining him to make
                    an impartial inquiry into the claims of the two churches. For this purpose he
                    quitted Douay in 1631 after a brief stay there, returned to England, and at
                    Oxford, of which Laud was chancellor, he devoted his energies to a free inquiry
                    into religion. On grounds of Scripture and reason he at length declared for
                    Protestantism, and wrote in 1634, but did not publish, a confutation of the
                    motives which had led him over to Rome. This paper was lost; the other, on the
                    same subject, was probably written on some other occasion at the request of his
                    friends. His return to Protestantism was attended with some scruples, which he
                    expressed in a letter to Dr Sheldon, and which probably gave rise to the report
                    that he had turned papist a second time, and then Protestant again. The extreme
                    sensitiveness of his theological conscience was evinced by the grounds on which
                    he refused a preferment offered to him in 1635 by Sir Thomas Coventry, Lord
                    Keeper of the Great Seat He was in difficulty about subscribing the Thirty-nine
                    Articles. As he informed Dr Sheldon in a letter, he was fully resolved on two
                    points— that to say the Fourth Commandment is a law of God appertaining to
                    Christians is false and unlawful, and that the damning clauses in St
                    Athanasius’s Creed are most false, and in a high degree presumptuous and
                    schismatical. To subscribe, therefore, he felt would be to “subscribe his own
                    damnation.” At this time his principal work was far towards completion. It was
                    undertaken in defence of Dr Christopher Potter, provost of Queen’s College in
                    Oxford, who had for some time been carrying on a controversy with a Jesuit known
                    as Edward Knott, but whose real name was Matthias Wilson.</p>
                <p>Laud, now archbishop of Canterbury, was not a little solicitous about
                    Chillingworth’s reply to Knott, and at his request, as “the young man had given
                    cause why a more watchful eye should be held over him and his writings,” it was
                    examined by the vice-chancellor of Oxford, and two professors of divinity, and
                    published with their approbation in 1637, with the title <hi rend="italic">The
                        Religion of Protestants a Safe Way to Salvation.</hi> The work was well
                    received, two editions being published within less than five months; and it
                    called forth a shower of pamphlets from the opposite eide. In the preface
                    Chillingworth expresses a totally different view about subscription to the
                    articles. “For the Church of England,” he there says, “I am persuaded that the
                    constant doctrine of it is so pure and orthodox, that whosoever believes it, and
                    lives according to it, undoubtedly he shall be saved, and that there is no error
                    in it which may necessitate or warrant any man to disturb the peace or renounce
                    the communion of it. This, in my opinion, is all intended by subscription.” His
                    scruples having thus been happily overcome, he was, in the following year
                    (1638), promoted to the chancellorship of the church of Sarum, with the prebend
                    of Brixworth in Northamptonshire annexed to it. He was in the king’s army at the
                    siege of Gloucester, and invented certain engines for assaulting the town.
                    Shortly afterwards he accompanied Lord Hopton, general of the king’s troops in
                    the west, in his march; and being laid up with illness at Arundel Castle, he was
                    there taken prisoner by the Parliamentary forces under Sir William Waller. As he
                    was unable to go to London with the garrison, he was conveyed to Chichester, and
                    died there in January 1644. His last days were spent in controversy with a
                    redoubtable preacher, Francis Cheynell, about the dispute between the king and
                    the parliament.</p>
                <p>Besides his principal work, Chillingworth wrote a number of minor pieces of a
                    controversial kind, and some of his sermons have been preserved. In politics he
                    was a zealous Royalist, asserting that even the unjust and tyrannous violence of
                    princes may not be resisted, although it might be avoided in terms of our
                    Saviour’s direction, “when they persecute you in one city, flee into another.”
                    His writings long enjoyed a high popularity. The <hi rend="italic">Religion
                        of</hi><hi rend="italic">Protestants</hi> is characterized by much fairness
                    and acuteness of argument, and was commended by Locke as a discipline of
                    “perspicuity and the way of right reasoning.” The charge of Socinianism was
                    frequently brought against him, but, as Tillotson thought, “for no other cause
                    but his worthy and successful attempts to make the Christian religion
                    reasonable.” His creed, and the whole gist of his argument, is expressed in a
                    single sentence, which is not without significance even for the present time,—“I
                    am fully assured that God does not, and therefore that men ought not to require
                    any more of any man than this, to believe the Scripture to be God’s word, to
                    endeavour to find the true sense of it, and to live according to it.”</p>
