                <p><label type="entry">CHELSEA</label>, formerly a village about two miles west of
                    London, on the left bank of the Thames, but now an integral part of the great
                    metropolis. It gives its name to a parish and a parliamentary borough, the
                    former with 71,089 inhabitants, and the latter, which includes Fulham,
                    Hammersmith, Kensington, and part of Willesden, with 258,050, at the census of
                    1871. It is connected with the district of Battersea on the other side of the
                    river by three bridges, known respectively as Battersea, Albert, and Chelsea
                    suspension bridges. Like many of the suburban villages of London, it has an
                    interesting history of its own. In 785 it is mentioned by the name of Cealscythe
                    as the seat of an ecclesiastical synod; and in <hi rend="italic">Domesday
                        Book</hi> it appears as Cercehede or Chelched. The name was still written
                    Chelchith in the time of Sir Thomas More, who had a house in the village, but it
                    began to assume the form of Chelsey in the 16th century. The manor was bestowed
                    by Henry VIII. on Catharine Parr, <pb break="no"

                    the possession of the duke of Northumberland, Lord Cheyne, and Sir Hans Sloane.
                    It was at Chelsea that Sir John Danvers introduced the Italian style of
                    gardening, which was so greatly admired by Bacon and soon after became prevalent
                    in England; and here in our own day were the gardens of the English botanist
                    William Curtis, arranged according to the Linnean system. During the 18th
                    century the village was the residence of many of the most famous men of the
                    period. Atterbury, Swift, and Arbuthnot lived in Churchlane; Guy, Smollett, and
                    Steele were for a time inmates of Monmouth House; and Count Zinzendorf
                    established a Moravian society at Lindsay House. Sir Robert Walpole’s residence
                    was extant till 1810; and till 1824 the bishops of Winchester had a palace at
                    the end of Cheyne Walk, a fine promenade extending along the river and now
                    fronted by part of the Thames embankment, which has greatly improved its
                    appearance. The house and grounds of the earl of Ranelagh were a favourite
                    resort from 1742 till 1803; and Cremorne, which was built by the earl of
                    Huntingdon, father of Steele’s “Aspasia,” is still a place of popular amusement.
                    The old church and churchyard contain the tombs of Sir Thomas More, Sir Hans
                    Sloane, George Herbert’s mother, Thomas Shadwell, Woodfall the printer of
                    Junius, and other persons of celebrity. Of greater importance than any of the
                    buildings already mentioned is the great Chelsea Hospital for invalid soldiers,
                    built by Sir Christopher Wren (1682-1690), on the site of King James’s College;
                    and to the north of the hospital is the Royal Military Asylum, founded by
                    Frederick Duke of York, for the education of children connected with the army.
