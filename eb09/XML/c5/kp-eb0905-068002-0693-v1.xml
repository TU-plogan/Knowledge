                    North American tribe, now settled in the Indian Territory along the northern
                    banks of the Red River, where they possess about 10,450 square miles. When first
                    known to Europeans they occupied the district now forming the southern part of
                    Mississippi and the western part of Alabama. On the settlement of Louisiana they
                    formed an alliance with the French, and assisted them against the Natchez and
                    Chickasaws; but by degrees they entered into friendly relations with the
                    English, and at last, in 1786, recognized the supremacy of the United States by
                    the treaty of Hopewell. Their emigration westward began about 1800, and the last
                    remains of their original territory were ceded in 1830. In their new settlements
                    the Choctaws continued to advance in prosperity till the outbreak of the civil
                    war, which considerably diminished the population and ruined a large part of
                    their property. They sided with the Confederates, and their territory was
                    occupied by Confederate troops; and accordingly at the close of the war they
                    were regarded as having lost their rights. Part of their land they were forced
                    to surrender to the Government; their slaves were emancipated; and provision was
                    claimed for them in the shape of either land or money. Since then they have
                    considerably recovered their position. In 1873 they numbered 16,000, had 50,000

                    to the value of upwards of $4,700,000. They are governed by a chief and a
                    national council of 40 members, according to a written constitution, which dates
                    in the main from 1838; and they possess a regular judicial system and employ
                    trial by jury. Missions are maintained amongst them by the American Board of
                    Commissioners, the Presbyterians, the Methodists, and the Baptists. The Choctaw
                    language has been reduced to writing, and brought to some degree of literary
                    precision by the efforts of the missionaries, who have produced in the language
                    the Bible, school-books, and hymnals. A newspaper is published weekly in Choctaw
                    and English at New Boggy; and a grammar was composed by the late Rev. C.
