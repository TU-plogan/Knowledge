                    (1717-1806), a celebrated lady scholar, and translator of the works of
                    Epictetus, was the daughter of the Rev. Dr Carter of Deal in Kent, and was born
                    in that town, December 16, 1717. Her mother, Margaret Swayne of Bere, in Dorset,
                    lost her fortune by investing it in the South Sea Stocks, and died of a decline
                    when Elizabeth was about ten years old. Dr Carter educated his children, boys
                    and girls alike; but Elizabeth’s slowness of apprehension tired out his
                    patience, and it was only by great perseverance that she conquered her natural
                    incapacity for learning. She studied late at night and early in the morning,
                    taking snuff and chewing green tea to keep herself awake; and she so injured her
                    health by this that she suffered throughout her life from severe headaches. Miss
                    Carter learned Greek and Latin from her father, and was specially proficient in
                    Greek, so that Dr Johnson said concerning a celebrated scholar, that he
                    “understood Greek better than any one whom he had ever known except Elizabeth
                    Carter.” She learned also Hebrew, French, German, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese,
                    and lastly some Arabic. She studied astronomy, ancient geography, and ancient
                    and modern history. In 1734 some of her verses appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gentleman's Magazine</hi> under the signature “Eliza,” Carr the editor
                    being a friend of her father. In 1738 she published a small collection of poems,
                    and next year she translated from the French an attack on Pope’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Essay on Man</hi> by Μ. Crousaz. In 1739 appeared her

                    Epictetus was undertaken in 1749 to please her friends Dr Seeker (afterwards
                    archbishop of Canterbury) and Miss Talbot, to whom the translation was sent,
                    sheet by sheet, as it was done. This work was published by guinea subscription
                    in 1758. In 1762 Miss Carter printed a second collection of poems. Dr Carter,
                    from 1762 to his death in 1774, lived with his daughter in a house at Deal,
                    which she had purchased. Her literary earnings were augmented by an annuity
                    settled on her in 1761 by Sir William Pulteney and his wife, who had inherited
                    the fortune of her old friend Lord Bath; and she had another annuity from Mrs
                    Montagu after that lady had become a widow. Among Miss Carter’s friends and
                    correspondents may be mentioned—Johnson (whom she came to know through Cave the

                    lived to the age of eighty-nine. She died in Clarges Street, Piccadilly, 1806;
