                <p><label type="entry">CAYENNE</label>, a seaport town, and the capital of French
                    Guiana, on the north-west extremity of the island of Cayenne, and near the mouth
                    of the river of that name, in 4° 56' 5'' N. 1at. and 52° 20' W. long. The town
                    forms an almost perfect square, and has clean and well-macadamized streets. The
                    houses, mostly of two stories, are of wood, strengthened on the first and ground
                    floors by brickwork. In the old town, which contains the Governmenthouse and
                    Jesuits’ College, the streets are not so regularly and well built as in the new.
                    The Place d’Armes, a fine quadrangular space, lies between them. The streets are
                    lighted with oil lamps, which burn for nearly twelve hours. Cayenne has a parish
                    church, three Roman Catholic chapels, a nunnery, and two schools; also a bank
                    and savings bank under Government supervision, military and civil hospitals, and
                    a hospital for leprosy; but it has no hotel, theatre, club, reading-room, or any
                    place of amusement. To the right of the governor’s house is Mount Cépéron, on
                    which stand Fort St Michell, the marine barracks, the signal station, and the
                    light-house. Here, too, are the capacious reservoirs for the water-supply of the
                    town, the source of which is a lake to the south of the island. The harbour is
                    shallow at its entrance, but sufficiently deep within to float vessels of 800
                    tons’ burthen; craft drawing much water are obliged to load and unload at a
                    distance of seven or eight miles from the town. There is no dock for the repair
                    of vessels; and the quay is small, though of sufficient size to meet
                    requirements. The principal exports of Cayenne are native gold, raw sugar,
                    arnotto, cocoa, coffee, limes (in brine), rum, molasses, isinglass, cotton,
                    hides, woods, and spices. In 1873 the gold which paid export duty weighed 2206
                    ß&gt; troy. The imports are French wines, spirits, and liqueurs; vinegar, silk
                    and cotton stuffs, tobacco, hardware, glass, earthenware, clothing, preserved
                    meat, fish, and vegetables, maize, flour, hay, bran, oils, and cattle. The value
                    of the total exports in 1873 was £120,014, of the imports £282,808, —the import
                    trade having increased and the export trade sensibly diminished during the
                    preceding thirty-five years. In 1872 the vessels cleared were 90, tonnage
                    19,688; the vessels entered, 87, tonnage 18,530. There is a regular mail service
                    between Cayenne, the West Indies, and Europe, once a month. The ports trading
                    with Cayenne are Martinique, Nantes, Bordeaux, and Marseilles, and Salem in the
                    United States. Cayenne is the seat of the Government of French Guiana, and a
                    penal settlement for political offenders. It is provided with an efficient
                    police force, and is well governed. Food as well as clothing is exorbitantly
                    dear, the only cheap articles of consumption being bread and French wines. The
                    temperature of Cayenne is between 76° and 88° Fahr, throughout the year; but the
                    heat is tempered by easterly winds. Between December and March a north wind
                    blows, unfavourable to weak constitutions. Yellow and other fevers often attack
                    the inhabitants of the town, which, owing apparently to the vast swamp that
                    flanks one side of it is far from healthy. The death-rate amongst the coolies is
                    especially high. Population, about 7000.</p>
