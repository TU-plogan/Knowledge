                <p><label type="entry">CHARLES VII</label>. (1403-1461), king of France, the son of
                    Charles VI., was betrothed at ten to Mary of Anjou, daughter of Louis, king of
                    Sicily, whom he married nine years after. He became dauphin at the age of
                    thirteen; and while only fourteen, on account of the insanity of his father, he
                    held the position of lord-lieutenant of the kingdom. At first the strong hand of
                    Bernard of Armagnac, the constable, guided the government; but the triumph of
                    the Armagnacs, crowned by the murder of John of Burgundy in the very presence of
                    the dauphin, brought the most serious trouble upon France. Aided by the

                    that in 1420 the treaty of Troyes conferred the succession upon their king,
                    Henry V., who had married Catherine, the daughter of Charles VI. In August 1422,
                    however, Henry died, and Charles VI. a few weeks after. Bedford became English
                    regent of France; and the ability of his administration resisted all hostile
                    attempts. The defeats of the French at Crevant (1423) and Verneuil (1424) were
                    disastrous, and their successes were few and unimportant It was plain that
                    Charles, intent upon nothing but a round of frivolous dissipation, would never
                    effect the independence of the country. Though he was capable of being roused to
                    energy, the weakness of his character was conspicuous. He was dependent upon a
                    succession of advisers, which included both the worst and the greatest men and
                    women of his day. No king was ever cursed by more worthless favourites than
                    Charles during his youth, and no French court was ever in a state of more
                    miserable anarchy than that of the first years of his reign; but yet to none
                    could the title of “Well-Served” have been more fitly applied, for none has
                    borrowed more undeserved glory from the great men who surrounded him. Favourite
                    at first rapidly followed favourite,—Tannegui Dûchatel, the lawyer Louvet,
                    Pierre de Giac, the haughty Lecamus de Beaulieu, and La Trémouille.</p>
                <p>But France was not entirely left to these selfish courtiers. A national spirit
                    was rising, and she possessed many bold soldiers who were willing to fight her
                    battles. The constable Richemont, though violent, and though he unfortunately
                    laboured under a superstitious terror of heresy and sorcery, was honest and
                    capable. Under him fought Dunois the bastard of Orleans, La Hire, Xaintrailles,
                    Brézé, Jean and Gaspard Bureau, and the three brothers Chabannes. But the
                    greatest impulse was given to the French arms by the noble country maiden, Joan
                    of Arc, who, after placing the king firmly on the throne, received from him as
                    reward nothing but jealousy and the most heartless desertion (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Joan of Arc).</hi> The benefit which she wrought for France
                    did not end with her life. The English were still forced to give way. In 1435,
                    by the treaty of Arras, Philip the Good of Burgundy broke with them, and joined
                    the French; the death of Bedford in the same year left them no chance of
                    rallying, and soon Paris received its rightful sovereign.</p>
                <p>In the meantime a great change had come over the court and the king. Charles had
                    fallen into better hands. A most beneficial influence has been ascribed to
                    Yolande of Aragon, his mother-in law, Isabel of Lorraine, his sister-in-law, and
                    Agnes Sorel, his mistress. And, more important still, a great revolution had
                    taken place in the royal council, a large part of which now consisted, not of
                    nobles, but of commoners. The greatest of these was Jacques Coeur, who, having
                    amassed a vast fortune by financial speculations and commerce, had become the
                        <hi rend="italic">argentier</hi> of the king, and gradually acquired power
                    in all the branches of administration. Surrounded by men of energy and
                    patriotism, Charles’s facile nature reflected both these virtues, and he
                    appeared in the battle-field among his troops. Normandy was recovered by Dunois
                    and Richemont (1449); the English were driven out of Guienne; and in 1453 there
                    remained to them nothing but the single fortress of Calais. Among the other
                    important events that had meanwhile taken place may be mentioned the
                    ratification in 1438 of the “Pragmatic Sanction,”and extensive army reforms
                    whereby both privates and officers became immediately dependent upon the
                    sovereign.</p>
                <p>In 1450 Agnes Sorel died Soon after, and in connection with her death, occurred
                    Charles’s second great act oí ingratitude. Jacques Coeur, by aid of whose
                    abilities and money much of the success of the reign had been achieved, was
                    accused of intrigues with the dauphin, and charged with poisoning Agnes at his
                    instigation. He cleared himself of these charges, but others were immediately
                    substituted, which, so far as they were true, afford no excuse for Charles. He
                    was condemned to death; and though his life was spared, his property was
                    confiscated, and himself banished from the country (1453).</p>
                <p>Towards the close of Charles’s life his condition became even more scandalous and
                    wretched than it had been in the troublous times of his youth. With the death of
                    Agnes all show of dignity and decency was cast aside, and the king at length
                    died, the miserable victim of his own faults. Bitter ill feeling had arisen
                    between him and the dauphin; the latter had fled; his father’s repeated
                    entreaties could not induce him to return; and Charles, insane through his fear
                    that his son would seek to get rid of him by means of poison, refused to eat,
                    and on the 22d July 1461 died at Mehun cf starvation.</p>
                <p>During this reign there had taken place three events of the first importance to
                    France,—the expulsion of the English and of the free companies, the
                    establishment of a standing army, supported by a large permanent tax, and the
                    enactment of the Pragmatic Sanction. Besides these, the university of Paris has
                    been brought under the jurisdiction of the Parliament, and other reforms, such
                    as the shortening of the legal processes, and the strict prohibition of all
                    presents to members of the court, had been effected. In case of vacancies it was
                    decreed that the Parliament should nominate two or three persons, from whom the
                    king should select one. The Court of Aids was also instituted, to decide all
                    cases connected with the levying of taxes; but its constitution was extremely
                    faulty, as it gave to the same persons, viz., the treasurers, the power of
                    extortion and of trying for extortion.</p>
