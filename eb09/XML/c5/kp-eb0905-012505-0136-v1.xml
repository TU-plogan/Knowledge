                    (1768-1821), wife of George IV. of Great Britain, second daughter of Charles
                    William Ferdinand, duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, was born on the 17th May
                    1768. She was brought up with great strictness, and her education did not fit
                    her well for her after station in life. In 1795 she was married to George, the
                    Prince of Wales, who disliked her, and separated from her after the birth of a
                    daughter in January 1796. The princess resided at Blackheath; and as she was
                    thought to have been badly treated by her profligate husband, the sympathies of
                    the people were strongly in her favour. About 1806 reports reflecting on her
                    conduct were circulated so openly, that it was deemed necessary for a commission
                    to inquire into the circumstances. The princess was acquitted of any serious
                    fault, but various improprieties in her conduct were pointed out and censured.
                    In 1814 she left England and travelled on the Continent, residing principally in
                    Italy. On the accession of George in 1820, orders were given that the English
                    ambassadors should prevent the recognition of the princess as queen at any
                    foreign court. Her name also was formally omitted from the liturgy. These acts
                    stirred up a strong feeling in favour of the princess among the English people
                    generally, and she at once made arrangements for returning to England and
                    claiming her rights. She rejected a proposal that she should receive an annuity
                    of £50,000 a year, on condition of renouncing her title and remaining abroad.
                    Further efforts at compromise proved unavailing; the princess arrived in England
                    on the 6th June, and one month later a Bill to dissolve her marriage with the
                    king on the ground of adultery was brought into the House of Lords. The trial
                    began on the 17th August 1820, and on the 10 th November the Bill, after passing
                    the third reading, was abandoned. The public excitement had been intense; the
                    boldness of the queen’s counsel, Brougham and Denman, unparalleled; and the
                    ministers felt that the smallness of their majority was virtual defeat. The
                    queen was allowed to assume her title, but she was refused admittance to
                    Westminster Hall on the coronation day, July 19, 1821. Mortification at this
                    event seems to have hastened her death, which took place on the 7th August of
                    the same year.</p>
