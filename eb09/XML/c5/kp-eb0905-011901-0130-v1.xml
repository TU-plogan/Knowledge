                    the eastern coast about 600 miles in length, and from 50 to 100 miles in
                    breadth. It was bounded on the N. by the Guntoor circar, the limit being the
                    small River Gundezama, which falls into the sea at Muntapilly, and thence it
                    stretched southward to Cape Comorin. It was divided into the Southern, Central,
                    and Northern Carnatic. The region south of the River Coleroon which passes the
                    town of Trichinoρoly, was called the Southern Carnatic. The principal towns of
                    this division were Tanjore, Trichinopoly, Madura, Tranquebar, Negapatam, and
                    Tinevelly. The Central Carnatic extended from the Coleroon River to the River
                    Pennar; its chief towns were Madras, Pondicherry, Arcot, Vellore, Cuddalore,
                    Pullicat, Nellore, &lt;fcc. The Northern Carnatic extended from the River Pennar
                    to the northern Emit of the country; and the chief towns were Ongole, Carwaree,
                    and Samgaum. The Carnatic, as above defined, comprehended within its limits the
                    maritime provinces of Nellore, Chingleput, South Arcot, Tanjore, Madura, and
                    Tineveíly, besides the inland districts of North Arcot and Trichinopoly. The
                    population of this region consists chiefly of Brahmanical Hindus, the Mahometans
                    being but thinly scattered over the country. The Brahmans rent a great
                    proportion of the land, and also fill different offices in the collection of the
                    revenue and the administration of justice. Throughout the country they
                    appropriate to themselves a particular quarter in every town, generally the
                    strongest part of it. The country in former times was the scene of unremitting
                    violence and strife between the numerous chieftains and petty potentates, among
                    whom it was divided; and forts and fortresses accordingly crown almost all the
                    elevated points. They are built of a square form; from the long period of
                    internal tranquillity which the country has enjoyed, they are now rapidly
                    falling into decay. Large temples and other public monuments of civilization
                    abound. The temples are commonly built in the middle of a square area, and
                    enclosed by a wall 15 or 20 feet high, which conceals them completely from the
                    public view, as they are never raised above it.</p>
                <p>In the early centuries of the Christian era, the Carnatic or Carnata seems to
                    have been formed part of the Panja or Pandion kingdom; but about the middle of
                    the 11th century it passed under the power of the Bclalas, a family of Rajput
                    race, which at that time was making itself supreme in Southern India. Of the
                    greatness of this dynasty the ruins of Bisnagar, their capital, still give
                    striking witness; but it succumbed before the mightier Mahometan potentates.</p>
                <p>The Carnatic was first invaded by this new power in 1310 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >a.d.,</hi> when they defeated the Hindu sovereign and conquered the
                    country, which, after being divided between the kingdoms of Bijapore and
                    Golconda, became ultimately tributary to the sovereigns of the Deccan. In the
                    17th century it was overrun by the armies of Aurungzebe; but it was again
                    dismembered from the Mongol empire in 1717, when Nizam ul-Mulk obtained
                    possession of the Deccan and the south of India. In 1743 he appointed Anwar
                    ud-Deen nabob of the Carnatic, with his capital at Arcot; in 1754 a competition
                    for the government arose; and after a long and tedious war, in which the English
                    and the French took different sides, Mahomet Ali was left in possession of that
                    portion of the Carnatic which was the fruit of the successes achieved by the
                    British. Central Carnatic was laid completely waste by Hyder Ali, but was again
                    reconquered by the British in 1783. In 1801 all the possessions of the nabob of
                    the Carnatic were transferred to the British by a treaty, the conditions of
                    which were, that a revenue of several lacs of pagodas should be reserved to the
                    nabob annually, and that the British should undertake to support a sufficient
                    civil and military force for the protection of the country and the collection of
                    the revenue. On the death of the nabob in 1853 it was determined to put an end
                    to the nominal sovereignty, a liberal establishment being provided for the
                    family.</p>
                <p>The Southern Carnatic, when it came into the possession of the British, was
                    occupied by military chieftains called polygars, who ruled over the country, and
                    held lands by doubtful tenures. They were unquestionably a disorderly race; and
                    the country, by their incessant feuds and plunderings, was one continued scene
                    of strife and violence. Under British rule they have been reduced to order, and
                    their forts and military establishments have been destroyed.</p>
