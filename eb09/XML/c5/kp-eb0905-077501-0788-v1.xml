                <p><label type="entry">CIDER</label>, an alcoholic beverage obtained by the
                    fermentation of the juice of apples. The manufacture is chiefly carried on by
                    the cultivators of the fruit, and it has been conducted from very remote times
                    in Hereford, Worcester, Gloucester, Somerset, and Devonshire in England, and in
                    Normandy in France. Cider is also largely prepared and consumed in Upper
                    Austria, Wurtemberg, in the districts of the Maine and the Moselle, and in
                    Holland; and it is besides a common beverage in the New England and Western
                    States of America. In the south-west of England the most esteemed varieties of
                    apple cultivated for cidermaking are the Royal Wilding, the Foxwhelp, White
                    Normandy Beech, Yellow Sty re, Handsome Mandy, and Skyrme’s Kernel. For a
                    superior quality of cider the large well matured apples of several varieties are
                    selected, and are ground up to a fine pulp either in an old-fashioned cider
                    mill, or in one of several newer machines which have been introduced for pulping
                    the fruit. The old form of mill consists of a circular trough around which a
                    huge heavy stone wheel or runner, weighing about a ton, is drawn by a horse.
                    Into the trough a charge of apples, to the amount of from 8 to 10 bushels, is
                    thrown, and the mill is kept in motion till the whole mass is reduced to a fine
                    uniform pulp, which is technically called “the cheese.” The old-fashioned mills
                    are now generally superseded by modem inventions, of which Coleman’s cider press
                    may be taken as the type. It consists of two pairs of rollers mounted in a
                    strong wooden frame. The first and upper pair are of hard wood, studded with
                    iron teeth or knives, set immediately under a hopper into which the fruit is
                    fed. In passing between the first pair the fruit is sliced into small pieces
                    which fall between the second pair of rollers, placed immediately below. These
                    consist of heavy cylinders of stone set quite close so that the opposing
                    surfaces press against each other, and the sliced apples in passing between them
                    are bruised to a fine pulp which is received into a trough placed directly
                    under. The pulp or cheese is, or ought to be, laid aside for at least a night to
                    allow fermentation to set in before the juice is expressed. By this means the
                    aromatic oil contained in the seeds is extracted, communicating its aroma to the
                    mass, and a richer, fuller-flavoured beverage is the result. The cheese is
                    placed in hair-cloths in a strong framed box for expressing the juice, an
                    operation which must be gently and carefully performed, so that the liquid may
                    be obtained as pure and clear as possible. The juice ought to have a specific
                    gravity of from 1O7 to 1 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 08, and should contain
                    10 or 11 per cent, of sugar and 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 6 to 0 ’ 7 per
                    cent, of malic acid. The liquor is strained and placed for fermenting either in
                    large vats or in separate casks. In the fermentation which ensues an abundant
                    sediment is thrown to the bottom and a scum rises to the surface. In a week or
                    ten days this action should leave the liquid clear and bright if the
                    fermentation has continued steady and moderate. The liquidis then racked off
                    into casks, as free as possible from scum and sediment, and excluded from
                    atmospheric influence to stop the further action of the ferment. If in the early
                    part of the following spring it is found to be still clear, nothing further is
                    required except to cask it up for the market; but should it have become thick
                    and ropy it must be “fined” either by means of isinglass or with stewed and
                    mashed apples. It is frequently found necessary, in order effectually to stop
                    fermentation, to expose the liquor to the influence of sulphurous acid gas,
                    which is done by burning a sulphur tipped stick inside a cask half filled with
                    cider, and shaking the cask so as to make the liquor absorb the acid gas. Such
                    “matched” cider is readily detected by connoisseurs. The artificial colouring of
                    cider, when practised, is done either with burnt sugar, the juice of red beet,
                    logwood, or cochineal; and in Germany a flavour is sometimes communicated to the
                    beverage with elder flowers, cinnamon, cloves, or other aromatics. The following
                    analysis of a pint of common cider such as is supplied to agricultural labourers
                    in Somersetshire is by Dr Voelcker :—</p>

                <p>Cider is very prone to undergo acetous fermentation, and develop a rough, sharp,
                    vinegary taste; and in that condition its consumption readily causes diarrhoea
                    and colic. Roughness may be much reduced by treatment with various compounds
                    prepared for the purpose which contain lime, or by the addition of a quantity of
                    hops boiled with treacle or honey to the acetified cider. When sound it is a
                    wholesome, agreeable, and refreshing stimulant beverage. In Germany a spirit,
                    apple brandy, is distilled from cider.</p>
