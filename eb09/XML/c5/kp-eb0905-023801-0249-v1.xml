                <p><label type="entry">CATILINA</label>, Lucius <hi rend="smallcaps">Sergius,</hi> a
                    member of an ancient patrician family of Rome, first appears in history during
                    the proscription of Sulla, conspicuous among the ruthless band of murderers,
                    slaying his inoffensive brother-in-law with his own hand, and torturing and
                    mutilating the muchloved Gratidianus. His foul vices were unconcealed; he was
                    believed to have made away with his wife and his son to win the profligate and
                    wealthy Aurelia Orestilla; it was even suspected that he had been guilty of an
                    intrigue with the Vestal Fabia. Nevertheless, in 66 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b,c.,</hi> he found himself qualified for the consulship, and only
                    incapacitated by the impeachment brought against him by P. Clodius Pulcher for
                    extortion during his government in Africa. Catiline would not brook even delay
                    in his advance to power, and accordingly he formed a conspiracy, in which
                    Autronius, Piso, and even, according to rumour, Crassus and Caesar were
                    concerned. The new consuls were to be murdered while offering up their vows on
                    the 1st of January; and the fasces were to be seized by Catiline and Autronius.
                    The plot failed, but only because the signal was given too hastily; and the
                    discovery brought no punishment upon those implicated, for the intervention of a
                    tribune was readily obtained. Soon after, Catiline, having bribed both judges
                    and accuser, was acquitted in the trial for extortion. His scheme was forthwith
                    immensely widened. The city was to be fired, and those who opposed the
                    revolution were to be slain; all debts were to be cancelled; and there was to be
                    a proscription of all the wealthy citizens. Among the conspirators were many men
                    of the first rank and influence. Arms and money were collected, soldiers were
                    enlisted, and the assistance of the slaves was sought. But Catiline’s hopes were
                    again disappointed; once more he failed to obtain the consulship; and, moreover,
                    it soon became apparent that one of the new consuls Cicero, was mysteriously
                    able to thwart all the schemes of the conspirators. He was, in fact, informed of
                    every detail, through Fulvia, the mistress of Curius, one of the plotters, who
                    was himself soon persuaded to turn informer. Before the next <hi rend="italic"
                        >comitia consularia</hi> assembled, the orator had given so impressive a
                    warning of the danger which was impending, that Catiline was once more rejected
                    and the consuls were invested with absolute authority. The other consul, C.
                    Autronius, being absent in Macedonia, Cicero had everything in his own hands. On
                    the 8th of November, he again rose in the senate to make so vigorous an attack
                    upon Catiline that he rushed from the temple, amid the curses of the senators,
                    and fled to the army. Next day Cicero awoke the terror of the people by a second
                    declaration which he delivered in the Forum. Still not one of the rebels
                    deserted, though a free pardon and great rewards were offered to informers,—a
                    remarkable proof, it has been said, of the wretchedness and discontent of the
                    lower orders at that time. It has also, however, been suggested that there
                    existed no conspiracy of a kind concerning which any member of the lower orders
                    could give information. Legal evidence of the plot was, nevertheless, obtained
                    by the means of the Allobrogian ambassadors, implicating Lentulus, Cethegus, and
                    Statilius, who, on the nones of December, were condemned to be strangled by the
                    common executioner in the vile dungeon of the Capitol. This act of speedy
                    vengeance, which was opposed as illegal by Julius Caesar, was strenuously
                    advocated by Cato and, indirectly, by Cicero. Thus a heavy blow was dealt to the
                    cause of Catiline, who, in the beginning of 62 B.C., saw his legions, partially
                    armed and diminished by desertion, shut in between those of Metellus Celer and
                    Antony. Near Faesulae he hazarded battle with the forces of the latter,
                    commanded by Μ. Petreiuβ, for the proconsul was or pretended to be ill. So
                    terrible an engagement ensued that the bravest of the victors were slain, and of
                    the conquered not one was taken alive. Catiline’s body was found far in advance
                    of his own ranks, amidst a heap of the enemy whom he had slain.</p>
                <p>Such is the account of the conspiracy of Catiline, and such is the character of
                    its author, as we find them in the speeches of Cicero, and the histories of
                    Sallust and Dion Cassius. Though there is nothing incredible in either, it must
                    not be forgotten that our sole authorities for these statements were all members
                    of one political party, and that the aristocratical. Some of the incidents given
                    as facts by Dion Cassius are manifest absurdities; and Cicero shared the common
                    habit of ancient orators, and paid more regard to the effect than the
                    truthfulness of an accusation.</p>

                <p>We find him at one time admitting that Catiline had almost persuaded him of his
                    honesty and merit, nay, even seeking a political union with him; at another,
                    when his alliance had been rejected and an election was at hand, declaiming
                    against him as a murderer, and as a profligate horribly conspicuous among
                    profligates. And, lastly, though Sallust’s vivid narrative is consistent
                    throughout, it is not hard to see that he cherished very bitter feelings against
                    the democratical party. Nevertheless, we have certainly no ground for accepting
                    the view which makes Catiline a worthy successor of the Gracchi, an honest enemy
                    of the hateful oligarchy, and a disinterested champion of the provincials. The
                    following is probably as accurate a statement of the case as can now be given.
                    There was at the time on the part of many of the Roman nobles a determination to
                    raise themselves to power, despite the opposition of the senate, while the
                    bolder among them were quite prepared to resort to force, if that appeared
                    likely to be for their advantage. When, therefore, the senatorial party
                    successfully assumed the aggressive, and its leader, Cicero, ventured on the
                    bold course which we have described, they at once took up arms. Among them
                    Catiline stands out conspicuous, and receives all the attacks of their enemies.
                    Whether he was morally worse than the rest we cannot say with confidence; it was
                    enough that he was far the foremost in force of body and of mind.</p>
