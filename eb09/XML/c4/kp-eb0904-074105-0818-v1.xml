                    a learned theologian, was born at Glasgow about 1579, and received his early
                    education in his native city. After having taught Greek in the university for
                    twelve months, he removed to Bordeaux, where he was soon appointed a regent in
                    the College of Bergerac. He did not remain long at Bordeaux, but accepted the
                    offer of a chair of philosophy at Sedan, where he passed two years. He then
                    returned to Bordeaux, and in the beginning of 1604 he was nominated one of the
                    students of divinity who were maintained at the expense of the church, and who
                    for the period of four years were at liberty to prosecute their studies in any
                    Protestant seminary. During this period he acted as tutor to the two sons of
                    Calignon, chancellor of Navarre. They spent one year at Paris, and two at
                    Geneva, whence they removed to Heidelberg, where they remained nearly twelve
                    months. In this university, on the 4th of April 1608, he gave a public proof of
                    his ability by maintaining a series of theses, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi

                    works. The same year he was recalled to Bordeaux, where he was appointed the
                    colleague of Dr Primrose; and when Gomarus was removed to Leyden, Cameron, iu
                    1618, was appointed professor of divinity at Saumur, the principal seminary of
                    the French Protestants.</p>
                <p>In 1620 the progress of the civil troubles in France obliged Cameron to seek
                    refuge for himself and family in England. For a short time he read private
                    lectures on divinity in London; and in 1622 the king appointed him principal of
                    the university of Glasgow in the room of Robert Boyd, who had been removed from
                    his office in consequence of his adherence to Presbyterianism. His successor
                    appears to have been more favourably inclined to Episcopacy,—a circumstance that
                    may have tended to diminish the cordiality of his reception in his native city.
                    Here he also taught divinity with great reputation, but he resigned his office
                    in less than a year. Calderwood says that “Cameron was so misliked by the people
                    that he was forced to quit his place soon afterwards.”</p>
                <p>He returned to France, and fixed his residence at Saumur; and after an interval
                    of a year he was appointed professor of divinity at Montauban. The country was
                    still torn by civil and religious dissensions; and as Cameron maintained the
                    doctrine of passive obedience, he excited the indignation of the more strenuous
                    adherents of his own party. He withdrew to the neighbouring town of Moissac; but
                    he soon returned to Montauban, and a few days afterwards he died at the age of
                    about forty-six. Cameron left by his first wife several children, whose
                    maintenance was undertaken by the Protestant churches in France. All his works
                    were published after his death.</p>
                <p>His name has furnished a designation to a party of Calvinists in France, who
                    asserted that the will of man is only determined by the practical judgment of
                    the mind; that the cause of men’s doing good or evil proceeds from the knowledge
                    which God infuses into them; and that God does not move the will physically, but
                    only morally, by virtue of its dependence on the judgment of the mind. This
                    peculiar doctrine of grace and free-will was adopted by Amyraut, Cappel,
                    Bochart, Daillé, and others of the more learned among the Reformed ministers,
                    who judged Calvin’s doctrines on these points too harsh. The Cameronites are
                    moderate Calvinists, and approach to the opinion of the Arminians. They are also
                    called <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit04newyrich/page/n819/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0819-0742"/> Univerealists, as holding the universal
                    reference of Christ’s death, and sometimes Amyraldists. The rigid adherents to
                    the Synod of Dort accused them of Pelagianism, and even of Manicheism, and the
                    controversy between the parties was carried on with great zeal <hi rend="italic"
                        >;</hi><hi rend="italic">yet</hi> the whole question between them was only,
                    whether the wiU of man is determined by the immediate action of God upon it, or
                    by the intervention of a knowledge which God impresses on the mind. The Synod of
                    Dort had laid down the position that God not only illuminates the understanding,
                    but gives motion to the will by making an internal change therein; whereas
                    Cameron admitted only the illumination by which the mind is morally moved, and
                    attempted to explain the decision of the Synod of Dort so as to make the two
                    opinions consistent.</p>
