                <p><label type="entry">CALVADOS</label>, a department in the north of France,
                    extending from 48° 46' to 49° 25' N. lat., and from 0° 26' E. to l <hi
                        rend="superscript"> o</hi> 10' W. long., formed out of that part of Lower
                    Normandy which comprised Bessin, Bocage, the Champagne de Caen, Auge, and the
                    western part of Lieuvin. It is said to have received its name from a ledge of
                    rocks, stretching along the coast for a distance of about 15 miles between the
                    mouths of the rivers Orne and Vire, on which the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Calvados,</hi> a vessel of the Spanish Armada, was wrecked in 1588. It is
                    bounded N. by the English Channel, E. by the department of Eure, S. by that of
                    Orne, W. by that of Manche, and has an area of 2132 square miles. The southern
                    part of the department is somewhat elevated, being crossed by a mountain range,
                    and forms a continuation of the great water-shed between the basins of the Seine
                    and Loire; but the rest of the surface is gently undulating, and consists of
                    extensive valleys watered by numerous streams which fall into the English
                    Channel. The coast is high, and generally inaccessible, except at the mouths of
                    the principal rivers, such as the Touques, the Dives, the Orne, and the Vire,
                    which are navigable at high tide for several miles inland, and are indicated by
                    lighthouses at their mouths. The valleys, which generally slope in a direction
                    from south to north, afford abundant pasturage for horses and cattle, and the
                    agriculture of the district is superior to that of most of the other
                    departments. Wheat, potatoes, and all kinds of vegetables are raised in great
                    quantities for the markets of the interior and for exportation. The orchards of
                    the Auge district produce a very superior kind of cider, of which upwards of
                    30,000,000 gallons are made in the department; while Isigny is the centre of a
                    large domestic and export trade in butter, cheese, and other dairy produce.
                    Poultry is reared to a considerable extent for the Paris market. In the larger
                    towns, of which on account of the agricultural pursuits of the inhabitants there
                    are very few, there are manufactories of lace, woollen yarn and cloth, linen,
                    calicoes, flannel, shawls, cutlery, and earthenware. Besides these the
                    paper-mills, oil-mills, tanneries, refineries of beet-root and foreign sugar,
                    distilleries, and bleach-fields, scattered throughout the department, give
                    employment to a great number of hands. Although seams of coal are found and
                    wrought at Ligny, most of the coal used in the department is imported from
                    England or Belgium. Building stone and fuller’s earth are plentiful. The
                    fisheries along the coast are extensively prosecuted for Parisian consumpt, and
                    consist chiefly of lobster, oyster, herring, and mackerel fishing. There is a
                    canal from Caen to Ouistreham. A line of railway from Paris to Cherbourg runs
                    through the country and gives off five branches. The department is divided into
                    six arrondissements,—Caen, Falaise, Bayeux, Vire, Lisieux, and Pont 1’jûvêque,
                    the chief towns of which bear the same name. The principal port is Honfleur. The
                    population in 1872 was 454,012.</p>
