                    Germany, Spain, Italy, Belgium, and the United States— probably of a still wider
                    circle of the principal coining countries in the world—contain nine-tenths of
                    pure metal. The coinage of Russia is on the British standard of eleven-twelfths,
                    as nearly as it can be expressed in simple fractions of pure gold and silver,
                    the alloy in silver being a little more in all cases than the alloy in gold.
                    Bullion; whether in the form of coins, or of bars and ingots stamped, is
                    subject, as a general rule of the London market, not only to weight but to
                    assay, and receives a corresponding value.</p>
                <p>The recognition of gold and silver from the earliest times as a convenient means
                    of purchase, their ultimate adoption as a prevailing standard of value, their
                    coinage by all the richer states into pieces of money, in virtue of which their
                    circulation and absorption have been immensely increased, and the extent to
                    which they have become the necessary financial reserve of Governments, banks,
                    trading companies, and merchants, have given to these metals a greatly more
                    extended use and importance than they could have acquired in the ordinary
                    process of arts and manufactures; though even in this latter sphere, as gold and
                    silver become more abundant and communities richer, the purposes to which they
                    are applied and the demand for them are susceptible of much expansion. Writers
                    of high authority have attempted at various periods to estimate the production
                    of gold and silver, and correlatively their use and consumpt in the monetary
                    system and the arts; but there is scarcely any subject of statistical inquiry on
                    which it is so difficult to arrive at more than conjectural results. Yet in view
                    of the theoretical speculations that arose on the Californian and Australian
                    gold discoveries, the produce of these new fields of supply may here be worthy
                    of notice. The Californian mines were computed to have in three years yielded
                    gold to the value of £35,000,000 sterling. The Australian mines, still more
                    prolific, were estimated in three years from their opening to be equal to an
                    annual produce of £20,000,000 sterling. Such results, sustained over a
                    considerable period of years, presented a phenomenon similar to the more slowly
                    developed effects of the discovery of the South American mines in the 16th
                    century; and it must be admitted that California and Australia, after many
                    reverses in their mining industry, remain the most gold-productive countries in
                    the world. But their produce of bullion has of late years much fallen in
                    amount.</p>
                <p>The director of the United States’ Mint, in his report for 1875, estimates the
                    annual yield of gold and silver in California and other United States
                    possessions at $100,000,000, or about £20,000,000. The total export of bullion
                    and specie from Australia, after deducting the import (chiefly intercolonial),
                    varied in the fifteen years 1858-1872 from 11⅜ to 7⅜ millions sterling per annum
                    the general tendency being towards the lower amounts in the later years <hi

                    £9,747,635, and must be held to measure amply the produce of the gold and silver
                    mines of Australia. The annual production of bullion in the United States and
                    Australia cannot, on these data, be estimated at more than 28 millions sterling.
                    Humboldt found the annual produce of the gold and silver mines of America,
                    Europe, and Northern Asia, at the beginning of the century, to be about
                    £9,700,000. The yield of gold and silver from the same sources in 1850-57 was
                    estimated by M <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> Culloch, in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Commercial Dictionary,</hi> to be £14,000,000. The old gold and silver
                    mines can hardly have become more productive since the advent of the Californian
                    and Australian diggings, so that it would appear the latter have increased the
                    visible annual supply of gold and silver about threefold, or from £14,000,000 to
                    £42,000,000. Japan, so far as can be judged from the exchanges, must now be
                    added to the list of gold-producing countries. For several years in succession
                    Japan has exported considerable and apparently increasing amounts of treasure,
                    or gold and silver coins of its own mint. In 1874 this export amounted to
                    $13,332,794, or nearly three millions sterling (Sir Henry Parkes’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Summary of Consular Reports').</hi> During the first six
                    months of 1875 the imports of bullion from Yokohama to London were £1,257,170
                    gold, £95,080 silver; and not improbably the next great access of the product of
                    goldmines may be from that part of the world. But notwithstanding this marked
                    increase of gold and silver since 1850, when one considers the increase of
                    population, the still greater increase of trade and industry, and the vast
                    extension of financial and commercial affairs in the same period, it may be held
                    doubtful whether gold and silver have lost any of their old proportion to the
                    need for them and to the work they have to do.</p>
                <p>When the coffers of the great banks of Europe were filled with the virgin gold of
                    California and Australia, one of the first consequences was a desire on the part
                    of countries in which silver was either a collateral standard of value with
                    gold, or the sole standard of value, to discard the silver standard and adopt
                    gold as the sole standard, involving in either case a large displacement of
                    silver coinage and reserve, and a large infusion in its room of gold coinage and
                    reserve. This result was exhibited in the mint operations both of France and
                    England. In the former country silver retains its quality of legal tender in a
                    modified degree; but the proportion of silver authorized by the Bank Charter Act
                    of 1844 has long disappeared from the bullion reserve of the Bank of England,
                    which now consists wholly of gold. It was one of the first resolutions of the
                    German Empire, on the conclusion of the war of 1870-71, not only to make gold
                    the sole standard, but to dislodge all the old silver money of the German
                    States; and in the same connection it may be observed, that the director of the
                    United States’ Mint, in reporting £20,000,000 as the annual produce of the
                    United States’ mines, uses this fact as an argument for the immediate resumption
                    of specie payment—or, in other words, that the American people, by a strenuous
                    effort, should strive to keep as much of the bullion-product of their mines at
                    home as may enable the whole currency of the Union* to become either gold and
                    silver, or of convertible gold value. This preference for the more precious
                    metal as the sole standard of value, and for gold and silver coin as a medium of
                    general circulation, may be expected to extend throughout the world in
                    proportion as the produce of the mines may be increased; and in this respect
                    alone there is a vast opening for the beneficial use both of gold and silver. It
                    gives some idea of the immense service of bullion in the international
                    exchanges, as well a3 in the replenishment of the internal metallic
                    circulations, to observe that in the thirteen years 1858-70 the annual average
                    registered import of gold and silver (real value) to the United Kingdom was
                    £27,083,330, the average annual export £22,095,346; and that in the same
                    thirteen years the average annual coinage of gold and silver in the Royal Mint
                    was £4,854,661, or nearly equal to the annual excess of imports over exports of
                    bullion, which flows in all this volume through London to and from every part of
                    the globe— <hi rend="italic">(Statistical Abstract for United Kingdom,</hi>
                    1872).</p>
                <p>While the production of gold has declined of late years from the maximum attained
                    after the Californian and Australian discoveries, the production of silver has
                    begun to increase, and in the rapid development of minerals containing this
                    metal, is generally expected to increase in the future. But it would seem
                    premature from the facts of past experience to anticipate any permanent
                    depreciation of the value of silver in relation to gold. The price of silver in
                    the market of London from 1833 to 1873 ranged from 59d. to 62∣d. per oz., and
                    during that time fully maintained its standard value in par with that of gold—
                        <hi rend="italic">(Table</hi> of Messrs Pixley and Abell, bullion-brokers,
                    London). But in the subsequent years a decline in the price of silver has
                    occurred, and it fell in 1875 to 56d. per ounce. This may be the result of
                    temporary causes, such as (1) the fact of £20,000,000 of German silver,
                    displaced by the new gold coinage hanging over the market; and (2) a cessation
                    of demand for India and China, which the exchanges of the East with Europe may
                    at any time alter.</p>
