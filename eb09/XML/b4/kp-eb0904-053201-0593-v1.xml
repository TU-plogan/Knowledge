                    (1770-1844), Baronet, was born on the 25th of January 1770. The rudiments of his
                    education he received at Westminster school, whence he removed in due time to
                    Oxford. He did not wait to graduate at that university, but in 1790 set out on a
                    Continental tour, in the course of which he became strongly imbued with the
                    revolutionary principles then dominant in France and other countries. On his
                    return to England in 1793 he married the youngest daughter of Thomas Coutts, a
                    London banker, with whom he received a large fortune. In 1796, through the
                    influence of the duke of Newcastle, he was chosen M.P. for Boroughbridge, on
                    which occasion he had as colleague John Scott, afterwards Lord Eldon. In 1797 he
                    succeeded his grandfather in the baronetcy, his father and elder brother having
                    predeceased him. At the outset of his political career he was a zealous
                    supporter of ultra-liberal measures. In 1802, after a protracted contest, he was
                    elected M.P. for Middlesex, in opposition to the former member, Mr Mainwaring.
                    The election, however, was declared void, and in the subsequent canvass he was
                    defeated. In 1806 he again stood for Middlesex and was again defeated, but when
                    he stood for Westminster in the same year he was elected by a large majority. In
                    March 1810 he wrote a letter to his constituents, denying the right of
                    Government to commit for libel, as they had recently done. This letter was
                    brought under the notice of the House, and the speaker issued a warrant for the
                    committal of Sir Francis to the Tower. The baronet, however, disputed the right
                    of the House, and had to be removed from his own residence by force. There was
                    some collision in consequence between the military and the populace who were
                    devoted to Sir Francis. At the prorogation of parliament he was released, and
                    lost no time in prosecuting the Speaker and the Sergeant-at-arms, but without
                    success. On the occasion of the Manchester riots in 1819 he wrote a letter to
                    his constituents, for which he was tried for libel, found guilty, and condemned
                    to three months’ imprisonment, and to pay a fine of £1000. In 1837 he ceased to
                    represent Westminster, and when he was returned for North Wiltshire he joined
                    the Conservative party, which he supported during the remainder of his political
                    career. He died January 23, 1844.</p>
