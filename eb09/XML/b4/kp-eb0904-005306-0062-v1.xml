                    to the death of their father has been related under <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Alexander</hi> VI. (vol. i. p. 487). Alexander’s sudden decease at an
                    unfavourable conjuncture proved the ruin of Caesar, who, as he subsequently told
                    Machiavelli, had provided for every contingency except that of his father and
                    himself being disabled at the same time. Though suffering from a dangerous
                    illness, popularly believed to be the effect of poison, he possessed himself of
                    his father’s treasures, and exerted sufficient influence in the conclave to
                    procure the election of a friendly pope. The pontificate of Pius III., however,
                    only endured for a few weeks, and his successor, Julius II., the hereditary
                    enemy of the Borgias, threw Caesar into the prison of St Angelo, where he was
                    detained until he had consented to deliver up all his fortresses. He was then
                    sent to Naples, where the Spanish viceroy, Gonsalvo de Cordova, in violation of
                    his pledge, caused him to be arrested and sent to Spain. After two years’
                    confinement in the castle of Medina del Campo, he escaped and took refuge with
                    his brother-in-law, the king cf Navarre, in whose service he was slain before
                    Viana, March 12, 1507. Caesar possessed considerable abilities, but these are in
                    general much overrated by historians, especially by Lord Macaulay in his essay
                    on Machiavelli. His extraordinary success was not so much owing to the
                    superiority of his qualities as to his utter emancipation from every restraint
                    of conscience and honour. As a ruler he was intelligent and sagacious; his
                    subjects regretted him, and his mercenaries served him with remarkable fidelity.
                    Lucretia Borgia’s life, after her marriage to the duke of Ferrara’s son, was
                    prosperous and uneventful, or at most onlj ’ troubled by the not very well
                    attested homage of Cardinal Bembo. She obtained universal respect by her piety
                    and prudence, and her patronage of men of letters, and died in 1520. In fact,
                    although intelligent and highly educated she was essentially a connnon-place
