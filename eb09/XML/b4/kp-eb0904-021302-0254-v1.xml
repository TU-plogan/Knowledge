                        rend="smallcaps">Lazzart,</hi> one of the most celebrated architects of
                    Italy, famous also as a painter, was born at Casteldurante, in Urbino, in July
                    1444. He showed a great taste for drawing, and was at an early age placed under
                    a painter of some distinction, Fra Bartolommeo, called Fra Carnavale. But though
                    he afterwards gained some fame as a painter, his attention was soon absorbed by
                    the sister art, architecture. He appears to have studied under Scirro Scirri, an
                    architect in his native place, and perhaps under other masters. He then set out
                    from Urbino, and proceeded through several of the towns of Lombardy, executing
                    works of various magnitudes, and examining patiently all remains of ancient art.
                    At last he reached Milan, drawn thither by the fame of the great Duomo, and
                    remained there for several years. Information as to this part of his life is
                    singularly scanty, but he seems to have left Milan for Rome about 1500. He
                    painted some frescoes at Rome, and devoted himself to the study of the ancient
                    buildings, both in the city and in all the district as far south as Naples.
                    About this time the Cardinal Caraffa, hearing of his studies in architecture,
                    commissioned him to rebuild the cloister of the Convent della Pace. The celerity
                    and skill with which Bramante accomplished his task gained for him the good
                    offices of the cardinal, who introduced him to Pope Alexander VI. He began to be
                    consulted on nearly all the great architectural operations in Rome, and executed
                    for the Pope the palace of the Cancelleria, or chancery, which was much admired.
                    But under Alexander’s successor, Julius IL, Bramante’s talents began to obtain
                    an adequate sphere of exercise. His first large work was to unite the straggling
                    buildings of the palace and the Belvedere. This he accomplished by means of two
                    long galleries or corridors enclosing a court. The design was only in part
                    completed before the death of Julius and of the architect. So impatient was the
                    Pope and so eager was Bramante, that the foundations were not sufficiently well
                    attended to; great part of it had therefore soon to be rebuilt, and the whole is
                    now <hi rend="smallcaps">go</hi> much altered that it is hardly possible to
                    decipher the original design.</p>
                <p>Besides executing numerous smaller works at Rome and Bologna, among which is
                    specially mentioned by older writers a round temple in the cloister of San
                    Pietro-a-Montorio, Bramante was called upon by Pope Julius to take the first
                    part in one of the greatest architectural enterprises ever attempted, the
                    rebuilding of St Peter’s. Bramante’s designs were complete, and he pushed, on
                    the work so fast, that before his death he had erected the four great piers and
                    their arches, and completed the cornice and the vaulting in of this portion. He
                    also vaulted in the principal chapel. After his death in 1514 his design was <pb

                    carry on the work, and in particular by,Michel Angelo. Competent judges are
                    strongly of opinion that Bramante’s designs, if carried out, would have had a
                    much greater effect than those which were finally adopted.</p>
                <p>Bramante had a great influence in Italy. By his careful study of the ancient
                    forms of art he became the real introducer of the so-called classical style. His
                    own genius was bold aud inventive, delighting in mass and breadth, but
                    occasionally failing in the perfection of detail.</p>
