                <p><label type="entry">BUSIRIS</label>, the name of a mythical king of Egypt not
                    found either on the monuments or in the chronological lists, but mentioned by
                    the later Greek writers and mythologists. By Apollodorus he was made the son of
                    Aegyptus, and an Egyptian king, or else the son of Poseidon and Lyssianassa.
                    After Egypt had been afflicted for nine years with famine Phrasius, a seer of
                    Cyprus, arrived in Egypt and announced that the cessation of the famine would
                    not take place until a foreigner was yearly sacrificed to Zeus or Jupiter.
                    Busiris commenced by sacrificing the prophet, and continued the custom by
                    offering a foreigner on the altar of the god. It is here that Busiris enters
                    into the circle of the myths and <hi rend="italic">parerga</hi> of Heracles, who
                    had arrived in Egypt from Libya, and was seized and bound ready to be killed and
                    offered at the altar of Zeus. Heracles burst the bonds which bound him, and,
                    seizing his club, slew Busiris with his son Amphidamas, and his herald Chalbes.
                    This exploit is often represented on vase paintings, the Egyptian monarch and
                    his companions being represented as negroes. Although some of the Greek writers
                    made Busiris an Egyptian king and a successor of Menes, about the sixtieth of
                    the series, and the builder of Thebes, those better informed by the Egyptians
                    rejected him altogether; they do not even admit that lie was the lieutenant of
                    Osiris set over the lands opposite Phoenicia and the Mediterranean, nor do they
                    recognize him as living two centuries after Perseus and later than Heracles.
                    Various esoterical explanations were given of the myth, and the name not found
                    as a king is recognized in that of one or more cities of the same name in
                    Northern Egypt. The legend was unknown both to Homer and to Hesiod, and appears
                    after the Greeks were more intimately acquainted with Egypt, and had seen the
