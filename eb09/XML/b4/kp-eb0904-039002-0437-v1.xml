                    eminent traveller, was born at Great-Tower-Hill, London, July 25, 1768. At
                    seventeen he was sent to Oriel College, Oxford. Having had a moderate competence
                    left him by his father, on leaving the university he applied himself entirely to
                    literary pursuits. But the fame of Bruce’s travels, and of the first discoveries
                    made by the African Association, determined him to become an explorer of Central
                    Africa. Accordingly, he left England at the close of 1791 and arrived at
                    Alexandria in January 1792. He spent a few months in visiting Siwah, the
                    supposed site of the temple of Jupiter Ammon, and employed the remainder of the
                    year in examining the whole of Egypt. In the spring of 1793 he visited Suez and
                    Sinai, and in May set out for Darfûr. This was his most important journey, in
                    which he acquired a great variety of original information. He endured much
                    hardship, and was unable to effect his purpose of returning by Abyssinia. He did
                    not reach Egypt till 1796; after this he spent a year in Syria, and did not
                    arrive in London till September 1798. In 1800 he published his travels in
                    Africa, Egypt, and Syria, from the year 1792 to 1798, in one volume 4to. The
                    work was highly esteemed, and is classed by Major Rennell <pb break="no"

                    but, from the abruptness and dryness of the style, it never became very popular.
                    In 1800 Browne again left England, and spent three years in visiting Greece,
                    some parts of Asia Minor, and Sicily. In 1812 he set out on amore extensive
                    journey, proposing to penetrate to Samarkand, and survey the most interesting
                    regions of Central Asia. He spent the winter in Smyrna, and in the spring of
                    1813 proceeded through Asia Minor and Armenia, made a short stay at Erzeroum,
                    and arrived on the 1st of June at Tabriz, where he met Sir Gore Ouseley. About
                    the end of the summer of 1813 he left Tabriz for Teheran, intending to proceed
                    thence into Tartary; but unhappily he never reached that destination. Near the
                    banks of the Kizil-Ouzen his party were attacked by banditti, and, according to
                    the report of the survivors, Browne was plundered and murdered. Suspicion
                    attached to his companions, and even to the Persian Government, but nothing
                    occurred to confirm these surmises. Some bones, believed to be his, were
                    afterwards found and interred near the grave of Thevenot, the celebrated French
                    traveller. His volume of travels in Africa has already been mentioned. Robert
                    Walpole published in the second volume of his Mémoire relating to European and
                    Asiatic Turkey (4to, 1820), from papers left by Browne, the account of his
                    journey in 1802 through Asia Minor to Antioch and Cyprus; also “Remarks written
                    at Constantinople.”</p>
