                <p><label type="entry">BURY ST EDMUNDS</label>, a market-town and municipal and
                    parliamentary borough of England, in the county of Suffolk, on the Lark, 26
                    miles N.W. of Ipswich, and 71 miles from London. It is governed by a mayor, six
                    aidermen, and eighteen councillors, and returns two members to Parliament. The
                    town is pleasantly situated on a gentle eminence, in a fertile and richly
                    cultivated district, is clean and well built, and has a good drainage system. It
                    is supposed to be the <hi rend="italic">Villa JVaustini</hi> of the Romans, and
                    numerous Roman remains have been dug up on the spot. It was the Beodericsworth
                    of the Saxons, and by them was made a royal town of East Anglia. Its present
                    name is derived from St Edmund, the king and martyr, who was taken prisoner and
                    put to death by the Danes in 870. In 1020 a monastery was founded there by
                    Canute, which for magnificence and splendour surpassed every other establishment
                    of the kind in Britain, with the exception of that of Glastonbury. It was 505
                    feet long and 212 w ide; and contained twelve chapels. The abbot had a seat in
                    Parliament, with the power to inflict capital punishment, and judged in_all
                    civil causes within the liberty. The privilege of coining was granted to the
                    abbot by Edward the Confessor, and both Edward I. and Edward II. had mints in
                    the town. In 1327 the people of the town and neighbourhood attacked the
                    monastery and reduced a large part of it to ashes. The tower or church-gate, one
                    of the finest specimens of Norman architecture in the kingdom, and the western
                    gate, erected about the middle of the 14th century, with a small portion of the
                    walls, are all that now remains of that magnificent structure. St Mary’s church,
                    a fine Gothic edifice, with a beautifully carved roof, was erected in the
                    earlier part of the 15th century, and contains the tomb of Mary Tudor, Queen of
                    Louis XII. of France. St James’s church is also a very fine building, containing
                    several handsome monuments. The free grammar school, founded by Edward VI., has
                    two scholarships at Cambridge, and six exhibitions to each university. The town
                    has a shire-hall where assizes for the county and liberty are held, a handsome
                    and commodious corn exchange, a guildhall, news and assembly rooms, a theatre, a
                    savings-bank, botanic gardens, a county jail, a general hospital, and about 100
                    almshouses. The market-days are Wednesday and Saturday. Wednesday’s market is
                    very important, both for com and cattle, but particularly for the latter, being
                    second only to that of Norwicn, which is the largest in the Eastern counties.
                    About a mile below the town the river becomes navigable for barges to Lynn,
                    whence coals and other commodities were tormeιly brought, but of late years,
                    since the formation of the railway, the river has been but little used, <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0904-0635-0574"/> There are four lines of railway,—in
                    connection with London and Cambridgeshire for the north, Thetford to Norwich and
                    West Norfolk, Ipswich and East Suffolk, and Colchester for Essex. In the
                    vicinity is Ickworth, the magnificent seat of the marquis of Bristol. The town
                    was the birthplace of Bishop Gardiner, and gives the title of viscount to the
                    Keppel family (Earls of Albemarle). Population in 1871, 14,928.</p>
