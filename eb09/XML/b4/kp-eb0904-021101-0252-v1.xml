                <p><label type="entry">BRAHMAPUTRA</label>, one of the largest rivers of India, with
                    a total length of 1800 miles, rises near the lake Mânsarowar in the plateau of
                    Thibet, where it is known by the name of Sânpu, flows eastward for about 1000
                    miles, and skirting round the eastern passes of the Himalayas not far from the
                    Yang-tse-kiang and the great river of Cambodia, enters the plain of British
                    India on the north-eastern frontier of Assam. It then runs westward, dividing
                    the province of Assam into two unequal portions, turns southward into Eastern
                    Bengal, and joins the Ganges opposite Goâlanda, the terminus of the Eastern
                    Bengal Railway. The united stream then flows south-west, joins the Meghnâ, and
                    after another southern stretch of about 100 miles, empties itself into the Bay
                    of Bengal. The body of water formed by the union of these three noble rivers,
                    the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghnâ, expands during the latter part of its
                    course into a vast estuary, studded with large islands. The Brahmaputra proper
                    in Assam is formed by the union of three streams, in 27° 45' N. lat. and 95° 30'
                    E. long.,—the Sânpu or Dihang, the Dibang, and another stream, which, although
                    the least of the three, the Hindus have taken as the main branch, honouring it
                    with the name of Brahmaputra, and sanctifying it in their mythology. This
                    branch, which many European writers have accepted as the main Brahmaputra, takes
                    its rise in a valley called the Brahmakunda, on the side of the eastern
                    extremity of the Himalaya Mountains beneath the snowy range.</p>
                <p>The upper part of the Brahmaputra is entirely in Thibet, and divides the broad
                    plateau drained by the very elevated Thibetian lakes from the narrow plateau
                    which divides the northern and southern Himalayan ranges, where the affluents of
                    the Ganges spring from perennial snow. At the western extremity of the
                    Brahmaputra basin the main river is 14,000 feet above the sea, and after a
                    course of 600 miles it is still 11,000feet high. Nothing is known of its passage
                    across the Himalaya Mountains. The features of the passage are probably similar
                    to those exhibited by the gorge of the Sutlej; but it is a reproach to the
                    science and enterprise of the 19th century to allow such a problem to remain
                    unsolved. Eastward the basin of the Brahmaputra is bounded by that of the
                    Yang-tse-Kiang, which here flows through tremendous gorges on its way to the
                    plains of China and the Yellow Sea. Some contend that the basins of the Irawadi,
                    Salwin, and Cambodia rivers, are interposed between the Brahmaputra and the
                    Yang-tse-Kiang, although they approach each other within 150 miles. On the
                    south, the Pâtkai Mountains, terminating in the Manipur and Chittagong hills,
                    separate the Brahmaputra from the Irawadi and the basins of the Arakan coast.
                    The principal tributaries of the Brahmaputra are the Dibru, Buri Dihing, Disang,
                    Subansiri, Manâs, BAghmi, Dharlâ, and Tista. The Brahmaputra forms many islands
                    during its course; among which that of Mijuli, enclosed by the Brahmaputra and
                    its branch the Lohit, contains an area of 282,165 acres, ana is well inhabited
                    and cultivated. In Assam the Brahmaputra also bears the name of the Hiranya, and
                    above its junction with the Ganges it is called the Jamuna. The principal towns
                    on its banks in Assam are Dibrugarh, Tezpur, Gauhati, Goalpara, and in Bengal
                    Sirajganj. Its volume of water has been computed at Goâlpara during its lowest
                    ebb at 146,188 cubic feet per second. During the rains, when the river attains a
                    height of 30 to 40 feet above its common level, its body of water may fairly be
                    computed at four times the above quantity. The Brahmaputra is navigable as far
                    as Dibrugarh, but in the dry season only for steamers of light draught. In the
                    rains it overflows its banks and spreads over the country for hundreds of square
                    miles. At Goâlanda, where it joins the Ganges, the current is so strong during
                    the rains, and the eddies and whirlpools formed by the meeting of the waters so
                    numerous, that large and powerful river steamers are often unable to make
                    headway, and have to lie for days until the river subsides. The main branch of
                    the Brahmaputra formerly flowed through the eastern district of Maimansinh, but
                    the greater part of its water now finds its way through the Jamuna. The total
                    length, as above stated, is 1800 miles; but if its source be taken at the
                    Brahmakunda, the length of the river only amounts to 930 miles. Until 1765 the
                    Brahmaputra River was unknown in Europe as a first-class river, and Major
                    Rennel, on exploring it, was surprised to find it larger than the Ganges. The
                        <hi rend="italic">tore,</hi> or upward wave caused by the sudden influence
                    of the tide, occurs in all the passages between the islands of the estuary
                    formed by the united streams of the Brahmaputra, Ganges, and Meghnâ. (W. W. H.
