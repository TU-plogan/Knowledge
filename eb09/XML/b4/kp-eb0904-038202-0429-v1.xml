                        >Bursa,</hi> a city of Asiatic Turkey, in the province of Anatolia, and
                    capital of the sanjak of Khodavendkiar, is situated in a fertile valley, at the
                    northern foot of Mount Olympus or Keshislι Dagh, 57 miles S.S.E. of
                    Constantinople. Its streets are narrow and dark, and its houses are for the most
                    part built of wood; but its numerous minarets give it a magnificent appearance
                    from a distance, and the rich variety of colouring that everywhere meets the eye
                    has a very striking effect. It is abundantly supplied with water, which flows
                    down the middle of many of the streets, and rises every here and there in
                    beautiful fountains. On the top of a rock in the heart of the town stands the
                    ancient citadel, the walls of which date from thel3th century, and are of Greek
                    construction; and on the west side is the Byzantine church of Elijah, which is
                    now known as the Daud Monasteri mosque, and contains the tomb of Orkhan. The
                    most important of the other mosques, the number of which is said to be upwards
                    of 600, are <hi rend="italic">Oglú Jami,</hi> or the mosque of the three
                    sultans; tlιe <hi rend="italic">Yeshil Jami,</hi> or the green mosque; and <hi

                    are also in the town three Greek churches, one Armenian, and several synagogues.
                    Many of its colleges, bazaars, and caravanserais are buildings of considerable
                    importance, and bear comparison with those of Constantinople. Broussa is the
                    seat of a provincial governor, of a mollah or judge, who ranks as third in the
                    kingdom, and of a mufti or spiritual chief. The Greeks and Armenians have each
                    an archbishop in the town. As a commercial city Broussa ranks with the most
                    flourishing in the empire. The town of Gemlik at the head of Mudani Bay, from
                    which it is about 20 miles distant, serves as its port. It manufactures carpets,
                    tapestry, and various kinds of silk goods, the material for the latter being
                    obtained from the mulberry-plantations of the neighbourhood. In 1862 there were
                    nc fewer than sixty silk factories belonging to Italians, Frenchmen, and
                    Germans. About a mile and a half from the town are the famous baths of Broussa,
                    which are fed bj several mineral springs varying in temperature up to 184°. and
                    from a hill in the vicinity is obtained a good supplj of meerschaum clay. The
                    population of Broussa is various!) estimated,—by Mostrás <hi rend="italic"

                    Bithynian kings. It continued to flourish under the Roman and Byzantine emperors
                    till the 10th century, when it was captured and destroyed by Seif-ed-daulet of
                    Aleppo. Restored by the Byzantines, it was again taken in 1327 by the Ottomans
                    after a siege of ten years, and continued to be their capital till Amurath I.
                    removed to Adrianople. In 1402 it was pillaged by the Tatars; in 1413 it
                    resisted an attack of the Karamanians; in 1512 it fell into the power of Ala
                    Eddin; and in 1607 it was burnt by the rebellious Kalenderogli. In 1833 it was
                    seized by Ibrahim Pasha, and from 1852-55 afforded an asylum to Abd-el-Kader. In
                    modern times it has suffered several times from earthquake and conflagration,
                    especially in 1855.</p>
