                <p><label type="entry">BRÜNN</label>, the capital of the Austrian margraviate of
                    Moravia, is situated for the most part between two hills at the confluence of
                    the Schwarzawa and the Zwittawa, 69 miles N. of Vienna and 115 W.S.W. of Prague,
                    with both of which it is connected by railway. Lat. 49° 1Γ 39" N., long. 16° 39'
                    35" E. On one of the hills known as the Spielberg stands the castle of the same
                    name, which has long been used as a prison, and is famous for its connection
                    with the patriotic Silvio Pellico, who was confined within its walls for about
                    eight years. The old town, which is comparatively small, still retains some of
                    its fortifications, but most of them have given place to promenades. Its streets
                    are narrow and crooked but well-paved, and it contains many of the most
                    important buildings in the city. Extensive suburbs have grown up around it, and
                    since 1849 form portions of the same commune. There are fine public gardene and
                    a large park known as the Augarten, presented to the town by the Emperor Joseph
                    II. The Rathhaus, which dates from 1511, has a fine Gothic portal, and contains
                    several interesting antiquities. The ecclesiastical buildings comprise the
                    cathedral of St Peter’s, situated on the lower hill; the fine Gothic church of
                    St James, built in the 15th century, with its iron tower added in 1845, and a
                    remarkable collection of early typography; the church of the Augustine friars,
                    dating from the 14 th century; that of the Minorites with its frescoes, its holy
                    stair, and its Loretto-house; the bishop’s palace; a splendid Jewish synagogue;
                    and several monastic establishments. As the capital of the province Brünn is the
                    seat of the chief legal and military courts, and thus possesses various official
                    edifices, the old Jesuit convent having been turned into barracks. It is also
                    the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop and of a Protestant consistory. Its
                    educational and benevolent institutions comprise a theological seminary, a
                    gymnasium, several academies and schools, an agricultural society, a botanic
                    garden, an infirmary, an orphanage, a blind asylum, a deaf-mute institution, a
                    lunatic asylum, and several hospitals, of which the most important is the great
                    hospital of St Anna. The national museum for Moravia and Silesia, though com

                    woollen manufacture in the Austrian dominions, and the centre of a large
                    miscellaneous trade. Considerable quantities of silk and cotton goods are
                    manufactured, as also leather, paper, tobacco, oil, and sugar. There are also
                    steam-flour-mills, engineering Works, and breweries. There is a remarkable
                    viaduct in the immediate neighbourhood of the town. Brünn probably dates from
                    the 9th century. In the 11th it was bestowed by Duke Wratislas II. on his son
                    Otto. Brünn is a place of great <pb break="no"
