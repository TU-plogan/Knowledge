                    picturesquely situated on the hilly and well-wooded banks of the Neckar, at the
                    junction of the Ammer and Stein-lach, 18 miles south of Stuttgart, and on the
                    S.E. border of the Black Forest. The older town is irregularly built and
                    unattractive, but the newer suburbs, the chief of which is the Wilhelmsstrasse.
                    are handsome. The most <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0923-0624-0603"/> conspicuous building is the old ducal castle
                    of Hohen-tübingen, built in 1507-1540 on a hill overlooking the town, and now
                    containing the university library, observatory, chemical laboratory, &amp;c.
                    Among the other chief buildings are the quaint old Stiftskirche (1469-83), and
                    the new aula and numerous institutes of the university, all of which are modern.
                    A monument was erected in 1873 to the poet Uhland (1787-1862), who was born and
                    is buried here. Tubingen’s chief claim to attention lies in its famous
                    university, founded in 1477 by Duke Eberhard. The university adopted the
                    Reformed faith in 1534, and in 1536 a Protestant theological seminary—the
                    so-called Stift—was incorporated with it. In 1817 a Roman Catholic theological
                    faculty (the “Convict ”) and a faculty of politics and economics were added, and
                    in 1863 a faculty of science. The leading faculty has long been that of
                    theology, and an advanced school of theological criticism, the founder and chief
                    light of which was F. C. <hi rend="smallcaps">Baur</hi> (<hi rend="italic"
                        >q.v.</hi>), is known as the Tübingen school. Melanchthon was lecturer at
                    Tübingen before he was summoned to Wittenberg. The university is attended by
                    about 1400 students, a considerable proportion of whom are foreigners, and has a
                    teaching staff of 53 professors, 17 extraordinary professors, and 10 lecturers.
                    The commercial and manufacturing industries of the town are slight. Printing,
                    book-selling, the manufacture of surgical and philosophical instruments, and the
                    cultivation of hops, fruit, and vines are among the leading occupations of the
                    inhabitants. The population in 1885 was 12,660 (11,708 in 1880). The country in
                    the neighbourhood of Tübingen is very attractive; one of the most interesting
                    points is the former Cistercian monastery of Bebenhausen, founded in 1185, and
                    now a royal hunting-chateau.</p>
                <p>Tübingen is mentioned as a strong fortress in 1078. In 1342 it was purchased by
                    the count of Würtemberg, whose descendants afterwards acquired the title of
                    duke. The treaty of Tübingen is the name given in German history to an
                    arrangement made in 1514 between Duke Ulrich and his subjects, by which the
                    latter acquired various rights and privileges on condition of relieving the
                    former of his debts. The town was captured by the Swabian League in 1519, by
                    Turenne in 1647, and again in 1688 by the French, who destroyed the
                    fortifications. Tübingen was made a garrison town in 1875.</p>
