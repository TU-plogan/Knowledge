                    virtues, trials, and final deliverance of Tobit, a pious Israelite who was
                    carried to Nineveh in the captivity of the ten tribes, and, after rising into
                    favour and wealth as a trader at the royal court, was reduced to poverty because
                    he habitually buried those of his nation whom the tyrant slew and ordered to be
                    cast forth unburied. Besides this he lost his eyesight through an accident.

                    father’s money, but by killing a fish which attacks him as he washes his feet in
                    the Tigris, becomes possessed of two invaluable drugs, its liver with the heart
                    and its gall. By fumigation with the former he drives away the demon Asmodeus,
                    who had slain the seven bridegrooms of a virtuous Jewish maiden, Sara of
                    Ecbatana, his own kinswoman, and so wins a good wife, and with the gall he heals
                    his father’s eyes. In spite of the absurd machinery and other puerilities, the
                    story is ingeniously constructed, and the picture of Tobit’s piety is natural
                    and touching, so that the whole is a very good exhibition of the weakness and
                    the strength of Judaism as it was among the Israelites of the dispersion.</p>
                <p>The date of the book cannot be precisely determined. It was written before the
                    destruction of the temple (xiv. 5), and is cited by early Christian writers. On
                    the other hand, it is in the highest degree probable that the Greek text is
                        original,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See the
                            arguments of Nöldeke, <hi rend="italic">Moηαtsb. Berk Ak.,</hi> 1879, p.

                    in which case the book can hardly be earlier than the 2d century B.c. A date
                    about the middle of this century, or a little earlier, at the time of bitter
                    conflict with the Greeks, seems to accord best with the tone of the book. The
                    sympathy shown for the victims of tyranny, to whom burial was denied, acquires
                    fresh meaning when compared with such a passage as 2 Mac. v. 10, and the
                    prominence given to eschatological hopes in the closing verses fits a time when
                    interest in the prophecies of Israel’s future glory was revived by the struggle
                    for national independence in Judaea.</p>
                <p>That Tobit was written by a Jew of the Eastern dispersion (so, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.,</hi> Ewald, <hi rend="italic">Gesch.,</hi> iv. 269) will hardly be
                    maintained by any one who accepts the Greek text as original. The book remained
                    almost unknown to the Syriac church, a fact which tells strongly against the
                    hypothesis of an Eastern origin; and at the period to which the work can be best
                    referred Egypt is the only probable place for a Jewish-Greek composition. The
                    writer knows nothing about the geography of the East beyond a few names which
                    every Jew must have heard,— the Tigris, which, by an error common among the
                    Greeks but hardly possible to an Oriental Jew, he regards as flowing between
                    Nineveh and Media; Rhagae, which was a royal residence of the Parthians; the
                    famous city of Ecbatana; and Elymais (ii. 10), which was associated with the
                    disaster of Antiochus Epiphanes. And in both forms of the Greek text (vi. 9 in
                    the common text, and v. 6 in the longer) Rhagae is falsely represented as quite
                    near Ecbatana.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nöldeke
                            shows that the same error in a less gross form appears in both texts in
                            chap. ix. The further erroneous statement of the longer text that
                            Ecbatana lies in a plain occurs also in Diod., ii. 13, 6, in a passage
                            dependent on Ctesias, from whom the addition may have been
                        taken.</p></note> Nöldeke surmises, as others have done before him, that the
                    “fish” which attacked Tobias was the Egyptian crocodile, and this conjecture is
                    raised almost to certainty when we read in Kazwini i. 132 that the smell of the
                    smoke of crocodile’s liver cures epilepsy and that its dung and gall cure
                    leucoma, which was the cause of Tobit’s blindness.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Very similar statements as to the medical
                            virtues of the crocodile (aquatic or terrestrial) occur in Greek and
                            Latin writers.</p></note> Thus the cures of Sara and Tobit are natural
                        <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi> the longer Greek text, vi. 4 <hi rend="italic"
                        >sq.)</hi>; the angel’s help is necessary only to secure the medicaments and
                    explain their use.</p>
                <p>But though the story may have been written in Egypt it contains Persian elements.
                    There is no inconsistency in this, for the authors of Jewish Haggada generally
                    borrowed the themes which they embellished, and that from very various quarters.
                    In fact, at the close of our book there is a brief allusion to another
                        story,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The story of
                            Nadab and Achiacharus. The names are uncertain, and one text substitutes
                            Aman (Haman) for Nadab. But the allusion is not to the book of
                            Esther.</p></note> quite unknown to us, which the author evidently did
                    not invent. The proof of a Persian element in the tale lies, not in the
                    localities, but in the angelology and demonology. Asmodeus is the Iranian evil
                    spirit Aeshmâ Daevâ, and Raphael, as the guardian of Tobias, has a strong
                    resemblance to the Iranian Çraosha. Such precise adaptations of Zoroastrian
                    ideas were hardly the common property of Judaism at so early a date; they lead
                    us to conjecture that the writer borrowed from an Iranian story.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Compare what is said

                        Esther.</p></note> And only in this way can we explain the appearance of the
                    dog who goes out and returns with Tobias and Raphael. This trait is so
                    inconsistent with Jewish feelings towards the unclean animal that it is omitted
                    in the Hebrew and Chaldee versions. But to the Iranians the dog was not only a
                    sacred animal, the protector of herds and homes, but was the companion of the
                    protecting spirit Çraosha <hi rend="italic">(Bundahesh</hi><hi

                <p>The Greek text of Tobit is found in a shorter recension (the usual text) and in a
                    longer form preserved in the Codex Sinaiticus (published by F. H. Reusch, 4to,
                    Bonn, 1870). There are fragments of another form of the longer text in several
                    cursives. All the forms are given in Fritzsche’s <hi rend="italic">Libri
                        Apocryphi,</hi> Leipsic, 1871. The shorter text, in the judgment of
                    Fritzsche and Nöldeke, is the earlier. The longer text is also represented by
                    the Latin versions, the second part of the rare Syriac version (the first part
                    is from the hexaplar Greek), and two closely allied Jewish versions, the Aramaic
                    (published by Neubauer, from a unique Midrash in the Bodleian, Oxf., 1878) and
                    the Hebrew, first printed in Constantinople (1516), reprinted by Münster in 1542
                    (whence its common name <hi rend="italic">Ilebraeus Λfunsteri)</hi> and included
                    in Neubauer’s edition. The Aramaic seems to be a late form of the text known to
                    Jerome, and of which he made use for the Vulgate Latin; it is certainly a
                    translation from the Greek. There are recent commentaries on Tobit by Fritzsche
