                <p><label type="entry">TANAGER</label>, a word adapted from the quasi-Latin <hi
                        rend="italic">Tanagra</hi> of Linnaeus, which again is an adaptation,
                    perhaps with a classical allusion, of <hi rend="italic">Taηgara,</hi> used by
                    Brisson and Buffon, and said by Marcgrave <hi rend="italic">(fHst. Ker. Nat.
                        Brasiliae,</hi> p. 214) to be the Brazilian name of certain birds found in
                    that country. From them it has since been extended to a great many others mostly
                    belonging to the southern portion of the New World, now recognized by
                    ornithologists as forming a distinct Family of <hi rend="italic">Oscines,</hi>
                    and usually considered to be allied to the <hi rend="italic">FringiUidae
                        (cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Finch,</hi> vol. ix. p. 191); but, as may be
                    inferred from Prof. Parker’s remarks in the Zoological <hi rend="italic"
                        >Transactions</hi> (x. pp. 252, 253, and 267), the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tanagridae</hi> are a “feebler” form, and thereby bear out the opinion
                    based on the examination of many types both of Birds and Mammals as to the lower
                    morphological rank of the Neotropical Fauna as a whole <hi rend="italic"
                        >(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> vol. iii. p. 743).</p>
                <p>The Tanagers are a group in which Mr Sclater has for many years interested
                    himself, and his latest treatment of them is contained in the British Museum <hi
                        rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> (xi. pp. 49-307). Therein he admits the
                    existence of 375 species, which he arranges in 59 genera, forming six
                    Subfamilies, <hi rend="italic">Procniatinae, Euphoniinae, Tanagrinae,
                        Lamprotinae, Phoenicophilinae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pitylinae.</hi>
                    These are of very unequal extent, for, while the first of them consists of but a
                    single species, <hi rend="italic">Procnias tersa,—</hi> the position of which
                    may be for several reasons still open to doubt,—the third includes more than
                    200. Nearly all are birds of small size, the largest barely exceeding a
                    Song-Thrush. Most of them are remarkable for their gaudy colouring, and this is
                    especially the case in those forming the genus called by Mr Sclater, as by most
                    other authors, <hi rend="italic">Calliste,</hi> a term inadmissible through
                    preoccupation, to which the name of <hi rend="italic">Tanagra</hi> of right
                    seems to belong, while that which he names <hi rend="italic">Tanagra</hi> should
                    probably be known as <hi rend="italic">Thraupis.</hi> The whole Family is almost
                    confined to the Neotropical Region, and there are several forms peculiar to the
                    Antilles; but not a tenth of the species reach even southern Mexico, and not a
                    dozen appear in the northern part of that country. Of the genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Pyranga,</hi> which has the most northern range of all, three
                    if not four species are common summer immigrants to some part or other of the
                    United States, and two of them, <hi rend="italic">P. rubra</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">P. aestiva,—</hi> there known respectively as the Scarlet
                    Tanager and the Summer Redbird, — reach even the Dominion of Canada, visiting as
                    well, though accidentally, Bermuda. <hi rend="italic">P. aestiva</hi> has a
                    western representative, <hi rend="italic">P. cooperi,</hi> which by some authors
                    is not recognized as a distinct species. The males of all these are clad in
                    glowing red, <hi rend="italic">P. rubra</hi> having, however, the wings and tail
                    black. The remaining species, <hi rend="italic">P. ludoviciana,</hi> the males
                    of which are mostly yellow and black, with the head only red, does not appear
                    eastward of the Missouri plains, and has not so northerly a range. Another
                    species, <hi rend="italic">P. hepatica,</hi> has just shewn itself within the
                    limits of the United States. In all these the females are plainly attired; but
                    generally among the Tanagers, however bright may be their coloration, both sexes
                    are nearly alike in plumage. Little has been recorded of the habits of the
                    species of Central or South America, but those of the north have been as closely
                    observed as the rather retiring nature of the birds renders possible, and it is
                    known that insects, especially in the larval condition, and berries afford the
                    greater part of their food. They have a pleasing song, and build a shallow nest,
                    in which the eggs, generally 3 in number and of a greenish-blue marked with
                    brown and purple, are laid.</p>
                <p>On a whole the <hi rend="italic">Tanagridae,</hi> may perhaps be considered to
                    hold the same relation to the <hi rend="italic">FringiUidae</hi> as the <hi
                        rend="italic">Icteridae</hi> do to the <hi rend="italic">Sturnidae</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mniotiltidae</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Sylviidae</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Turdidae,</hi> in each case the purely New-World Family
                    being the “feebler” type. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
