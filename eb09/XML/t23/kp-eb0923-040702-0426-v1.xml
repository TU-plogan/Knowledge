                <p><label type="entry">TIRESIAS</label>, a famous Theban seer of Greek legend, was a
                    son of Everes and Chariclo, and a descendant of Udaeus, one of the men who had
                    sprung up from the serpent’s teeth sown by Cadmus. He was blind, for which
                    various causes were alleged. Some said that the gods had blinded him because he
                    had revealed to men what they ought not to know. Others said that Athene (or
                    Artemis) blinded him because he had seen her naked; when his mother prayed
                    Athene to restore his sight, the goddess instead purged his ears so that he
                    could understand the speech of birds and gave him a staff wherewith to guide his
                    steps. Another story was that on Mount Cyllene (or on Cythaerum) he saw two
                    snakes coupling; he killed the female and became himself a woman. Seven years
                    afterwards he saw the same sight, and killing the male became himself a man
                    again. When Zeus and Hera disputed whether more pleasure was enjoyed by the male
                    or the female sex, they referred the question to Tiresias, as he had experience
                    of both. He decided in favour of the female sex, and Hera in her anger blinded
                    him; but Zeus gifted him with long life and infallible divination. He lived for
                    seven or, according to others, nine generations. In the war of the Seven against
                    Thebes he foretold to the Thebans that they would be victorious if Menaeceus
                    offered himself in sacrifice. In the war of the Epigoni he advised the Thebans
                    to flee. They fled, and he with them; but coming to the Tilphusian well he drank
                    of it and died. According to others, Tiresias was taken prisoner by the
                    victorious Argives and died while they were taking him to Delphi. The Argives
                    took his daughter Manto (or Daphne) prisoner and sent her to Apollo at Delphi,
                    where, being as skilled a seer as her father, she gave oracles. A different
                    version of the legend of Tiresias was given by the elegiac poet Sostratus
                    (reported by Eustathius on <hi rend="italic">Od., x.</hi> 492). According to
                    him, Tiresias was originally a girl, but had been changed into a boy by Apollo
                    at the age of seven; after undergoing several more transformations from one sex
                    to the other, she (for the final sex was feminine) was turned into a mouse and
                    her lover Arachnus into a weasel. Tiresias’s grave was at the Tilphusian spring;
                    but there was a cenotaph of him at Thebes, where also in later times his
                    “observatory,” or place for watching for omens, was pointed out. He had an
                    oracle at Orchomenus, but during a plague it became silent and remained so in
                    Plutarch’s time. According to Homer, Tiresias was the only person in the world
                    of the dead whom Proserpine allowed to retain intelligence. He figured in the
                    great paintings by Polygnotus in the Lesche at Delphi. The story of his
                    transformation into a woman is perhaps to be explained by the custom of
                    medicine-men dressing like women, which prevails in Borneo, Patagonia, Kadiak
                    (off Alaska), and probably elsewhere.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
