                <p><label type="entry">THAYETMYO</label>, a district in the Irrawaddy division of
                    Burrnah, having an area of 2397 square miles, and lying between 18° 50' and 19°
                    30' N. lat. and between 94° 30' and 95° 50' E. long. It is bounded on the N. by
                    the newly acquired territory of Burmah, on the E. by Toungιi district, on the S.
                    by Prome, and on the W. by Sandoway. On the west is the Arakan Yoma range, and
                    on the east the Pegu Yoma; and the face of the country, where it does not rise
                    into mountains, is everywhere broken by low ranges of hills, many of which are
                    barren and destitute of all vegetation. The greater part of the district is
                    wooded, and the Yomas east and west are covered with forests now mostly
                    preserved. The chief river is the Irrawaddy, which traverses Thayetmyo from
                    north to south. The country is well drained; the drainage finds its way to the
                    Irrawaddy by three main streams (the Pwon, Ma-htùn, and Ma-de) on the west, and
                    by two (the Kye-nee and Bhwotlay) on the east. Several salt and hot springs
                    occur in many localities of the district; petroleum is also found, and extensive
                    lime quarries exist a few miles south of Thayetmyo. The principal wild animals
                    are leopards, wild cats, barking deer, elephants, rhinoceroses, tigers, black
                    bears, and wild hogs. Silver pheasants and partridges are found in large
                    numbers, especially in the mountains.</p>
                <p>In 1881 the number of inhabitants in the district was 169,560 (males 87,308,
                    females 82,252); Hindus numbered 2620, Mohammedans 1861, Christians 2349, and
                    Buddhists 148,629. The chief town is Thayetmyo, with a population (1881) of
                    16,097; it is situated in 19° 18 ’ 43" N. lat. and 95° 15 ’ 40" E. long., on the
                    right bank of the Irrawaddy. Of the total area of 1,534,080 acres, only 108,167
                    were under cultivation in 1885-86; 547,631 were available for cultivation; and
                    forests occupied 256,256 acres. The chief products are rice, cotton, oil seeds,
                    and tobacco; cutch is also very abundant, and the manufacture of the dye-stuff
                    is carried on extensively. Coal has recently been found in the district, and
                    earth oil-wells exist, but neither coal nor oil has yet been extracted in any
                    quantity. The revenue of the district in 1885-86 was returned at £36,702, of
                    which the land contributed £10,482. On the annexation of Pegu by the British in
                    1852-53, Thayetmyo was formed into a subdivision of Prome district; and in 1870
                    it was erected into a separate jurisdiction and placed under a
                    deputy-commissioner.</p>
