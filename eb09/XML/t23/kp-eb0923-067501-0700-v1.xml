                    1484-1536), translator of the New Testament and Pentateuch (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">English Bible,</hi> vol. viii. pp. 384, 385), was born in
                    Gloucestershire, possibly in the parish of Slimbridge, about the year 1484. Of
                    his early education nothing is known; about his twentieth year he went to
                    Oxford, where tradition has it that he was entered of Magdalen Hall. He
                    afterwards resided at Cambridge. Ordained to the priesthood, probably towards
                    the close of 1521, he entered the household of Sir John Walsh, Little Sodbury,
                    Gloucestershire, in the capacity of chaplain and domestic tutor. Here he spent
                    two years, and in the course of his private studies began to contemplate
                    seriously the work of translating the New Testament into English. His sympathy
                    with the “new learning,” which he had not concealed in conversation with the
                    higher clergy of the neighbourhood at Sir John’s table, led to his being
                    summoned before the chancellor of Worcester as a suspected heretic; and “with
                    the goodwill of his master” he left for London in the summer of 1523. There he
                    preached a little at St Dunstan-in-the-West, and worked at his translation,
                    living for some months in the house of Humphrey Monmouth, an alderman; but
                    finding publication impossible in England he sailed for Hamburg in May 1524.
                    After visiting Luther at Wittenberg, he settled in Cologne, where he made some
                    progress with a quarto edition of his New Testament, when the interference of
                    the authorities of the town compelled his flight to Worms. The octavo edition
                    (see vol. viii. p. 384) was here completed in 1526. Where Tyndale resided in the
                    interval between 1526 and 1530—the year of publication of his translation of the
                    Pentateuch—is not known; his <hi rend="italic">Parable of the Wicked Mammon</hi>
                    (1527), <hi rend="italic">Obedience of a Christian Man</hi> (1528), and <hi
                        rend="italic">Practice of Prelates</hi> (1530), all bear to have been
                    printed at “Marlborowe in the land of Hesse” or “Marborch.” From 1530 onwards he
                    appears to have lived chiefly in Antwerp, but of his life there hardly anything
                    is recorded, except that as a marked man he was continually the subject of plots
                    and intrigues, and that at last he was arrested and thrown into prison in the
                    castle of Vilvorde, some six miles from Brussels, in 1535. Having been found
                    guilty of heresy, he was put to death by strangling, and his body afterwards
                    burnt at the stake on October 6, 1536.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Works</hi> of Tyndale were first published along with those
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Frith</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> and Barnes,
                    “three worthy Martyrs and principal Teachers of the Church of England,” by John
                    Daye, in 1573 (folio). His <hi rend="italic">Doctrinal Treatises and
                        Introductions to Different Portions of the Holy Scripture</hi> were
                    published by the Parker Society in 1848. For biography, see Demaus, <hi
                        rend="italic">William Tyndale</hi> (London, 1871); also the Introduction to
                    Mombert’s critical reprint of Tyndale’s Pentateuch (New York, 1884), where a
                    full bibliography is given. There seems no reason to doubt that the translation
                    of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings, and Chronicles in Matthew’s Bible is
                    substantially the work of Tyndale.</p>
