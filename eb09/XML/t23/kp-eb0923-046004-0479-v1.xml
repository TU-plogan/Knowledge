                <p><label type="entry">TORTOSA</label>, a fortified city of Spain, in the province
                    of Tarragona, and 40 miles by rail to the south-west of that town, is
                    picturesquely situated on the 1eft bank of the Ebro (here crossed by a bridge of
                    boats), 22 miles above its mouth. It is for the most part an old walled town,
                    with narrow, crooked, and ill-paved streets; the houses are lofty, and massively
                    built of granite. The slope on which it stands is crowned with an old ruined
                    castle, commanding a splendid view. The cathedral is a conspicuous building near
                    the river; it occupies the site of a mosque built in 914 by <hi
                        rend="superscript"> t</hi> Abd al-Rahmán; the present structure, which dates
                    from 1347, has its Gothic character disguised by a classical façade with Ionic
                    pillars and much tasteless modernization. The stalls in the choir, carved by
                    Cristobal de Salamanca in 1588-93, and the sculpture of the pulpits, as well as
                    the ironwork of the choir-railing and some of the precious marbles with which
                    the chapels are adorned, deserve notice. None of the other public buildings,
                    which include an episcopal palace, a town-hall, and numerous churches, require
                    special mention. The manufactures of Tortosa include paper, hats, leather,
                    porcelain, majolica, soap, and spirits. There is an important fishery in the
                    river, and an active trade is carried on through the harbour, which is
                    accessible to vessels of 100 tons burden, corn, wine, oil, wool, silk, fruits,
                    and liquorice (a specialty of the district) being among the leading articles of
                    export. Near Tortosa are rich quarries of marble and alabaster, and the whole
                    surrounding country is very fertile and beautiful. The population within the
                    municipal boundaries in 1878 was 24,057.</p>

                    was a city of the ∏ercaαnes in Hispania Tarraconensis. Under the Moors it became
                    a place of great importance as the key of the Ebro valley. It was taken by Louis
                    the Pious in 811 (after an unsuccessful siege two years before), but was soon
                    recaptured. Having become a haunt of.pirates, and exceedingly injurious to
                    Italian commerce, it was made the object of a crusade proclaimed by Pope
                    Eugenius III. in 1148, and was accordingly captured by Raymond Berengar,
                    assisted by Templars, Pisans, and Genoese. Tortosa fell into the hands of the
                    duke of Orleans in 1708, and was again surrendered in the War of Independence in
                    1811 to the French under Suchet, who held it till 1814.</p>
