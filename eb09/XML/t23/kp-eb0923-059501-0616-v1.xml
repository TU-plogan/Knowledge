                <p><label type="entry">TRURO</label>, a city, municipal borough, and port of
                    Cornwall, England, is situated on a kind of peninsula formed by the rivers Allen
                    and Kenwyn, which below the town unite with a branch of Falmouth harbour called
                    Truro creek or river. Truro is 300 miles south-west of London by the Great
                    Western Railway, and 11 north of Falmouth, to which there is a branch line. The
                    town is regularly built, chiefly of granite, with spacious streets, through the
                    principal of which there flows a stream of water. The new cathedral of St Mary
                    by Mr Pearson, R.A., one of the most important modern ecclesiastical buildings
                    in England, is a fine example of Early English at its best period. The old south
                    aisle of the church previously existing is ingeniously incorporated in the new
                    edifice. The secular buildings include the town-hall and market-house in the
                    Italian style (1846), the corn exchange, the theatre, the public rooms, the
                    music-hall, and the county library (1792). There is also a theological library,
                    presented by Bishop Phillpotts in 1856 and largely augmented by a bequest of
                    books in 1883. Among the educational and benevolent institutions are the
                    grammar-school (founded by a member of the Borlase family, and having two
                    exhibitions at Exeter College, Oxford), the cathedral divinity schools, the
                    Wesleyan middle schools, the literary institution, the royal Cornwall infirmary,
                    the dispensary, and a hospital for ten widows. There is sufficient depth of
                    water in the channel of Truro creek to permit vessels of 70 tons burden to come
                    up to the town quay. The principal imports are coal from Wales and timber from
                    Norway, and the exports consist of tin, iron ores, lead, and zinc, from the
                    mines in the neighbourhood. The population of the municipal borough (area 1171
                    acres) in 1871 was 11,049, and 10,619 in 1881.</p>
                <p>Truro is one of the oldest towns in England. It is the seat of the stannary and
                    other courts connected with the duchy of Cornwall (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Cornwall,</hi> vol. vi. p. 427). It was one of the ancient privileged tin
                    coinage towns. Anciently it was called Tueura, Treura, and Truruburgh. It was a
                    borough by prescription, but was incorporated by Reginald, earl of Cornwall. In
                    the 12th century it belonged to Richard de Lucy. In a charter of Henry VII. it
                    is called the “ville de Teuro.” The government was vested in a mayor and
                    burgesses by Elizabeth, who gave the corporation jurisdiction over the port of
                    Falmouth, the port dues of that town being collected by them until its
                    incorporation by Charles II. Norden, writing of Truro in 1574, says, “there is
                    not a towne in the west part of the shire more commendable for neatness of
                    buyldinges, nor more discommendable for the pride of the people.” In 1642 Sir
                    Ralph Hopton levied here a large body of men for the king. By the Municipal Act
                    Truro was divided into two wards, and is governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and
                    eighteen councillors. The corporation act as the urban sanitary authority. Truro
                    sent two representatives to parliament from the 23d year of Edward I., but
                    ceased to be separately represented in 1885. By Act 39 and 40 Vict. c. 54 it was
                    constituted the head of a new diocese comprising the archdeaconry of
                    Cornwall.</p>
