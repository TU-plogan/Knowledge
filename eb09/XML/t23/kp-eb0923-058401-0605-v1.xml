                <p><label type="entry">TROGUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cn. Pompeius</hi></label>, a
                    Roman historian, nearly contemporary with Livy. Although the epitome of his
                    historical writings by Justin, and a few fragments, are all that have come down
                    to us, there is abundant reason to believe that he deserves a place in the
                    history of Roman literature by the side of Sallust, Livy, and Tacitus. Of his
                    life little is known. He was almost certainly of Greek descent. His grandfather
                    served with Pompey in the war against Sertorius, and received through the
                    influence of that general the Roman citizenship; hence the name Pompeius, which
                    was adopted as a token of gratitude to the benefactor. The father of Trogus was
                    an officer of Caesar. Trogus himself seems to have been a man of encyclopaedic
                    knowledge. He wrote, after Aristotle and Theophrastus, books on the natural
                    history of animals and plants, used by the elder Pliny, who calls Trogus “one of
                    the most precise among authorities” <hi rend="italic">(auctor ipse e
                        severissimis).</hi> But the principal work of Trogus consisted of forty-four
                        <hi rend="italic">Libri Historiarum Philippicarum.</hi> This was a great
                    history of the world, or rather of those portions of it which came under the
                    sway of Alexander and his successors. The tale began with Ninus, the founder of
                    Nineveh, and ceased at about the same point as Livy’s great work, viz., 9 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> The last event recorded by the epitomator <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Justin</hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi> is the recovery of
                    the Roman standards captured by the Parthians (20 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.).</hi> The history of Rome was treated as merely subsidiary to that of
                    Greece and the East. The work was based upon the writings of Greek historians,
                    such as Theopompus, Ephorus, Timaeus, Polybius. It has been contended that
                    Trogus did not gather together the information from the leading Greek historians
                    for himself, but that it was already combined into a single book by some Greek,
                    whom Trogus followed closely with some superficial errors. But the assumption
                    appears improbable in itself, merely on a review of the remains of the
                    historical writings, and is moreover inconsistent with what we know of the works
                    in natural history, for which Trogus certainly went back to what were regarded
                    in his time as first-hand authorities. It is generally admitted that Trogus had
                    genuine qualifications for writing history, though he could not rid himself
                    entirely of the faults of his authorities. His idea of history was more severe
                    and less rhetorical than that followed by Sallust and Livy, whom he blamed for
                    putting elaborate speeches in the mouths of the characters of whom they wrote.
                    Yet his own Latin style had a vivid force which is still to be recognized in the
                    extracts made by Justin. For the ancient history of the East, Trogus, even in
                    the present mutilated state of his historical work, often proves to be an
                    authority of great importance.</p>
