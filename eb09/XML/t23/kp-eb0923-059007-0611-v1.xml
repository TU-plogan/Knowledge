                    Atlantic, did not long survive the inroads of the Teutonic tribes who in western
                    Europe divided the inheritance of the Latin world. All the early Teutonic codes,
                    being based, however remotely, on the right of private war and private
                    vengeance, might discourage, but were powerless to abolish, the instinct which
                    impels the members of half-civilized communities to avenge their own wrongs.
                    Hence the <hi rend="italic">pax Romana</hi> died with the empire; nor could the
                    splendid organization of Charlemagne do more than effect a very partial
                    resuscitation of it. Throughout the 9th and 10th centuries, as the
                    life-benefices of the later Carolingian kings became gradually transformed into
                    hereditary fiefs, the insecurity of life and property grew greater; for there
                    was no central power to curb the injustice of the petty dukes and counts who
                    warred and pillaged at their will. At this moment, when western Europe
                    threatened to sink back into the chaos from which it had been won by Rome, the
                    church came forward to arrest the process of its dissolution. Speaking at first
                    in her own interest and in that of the poor, whose great protector she claimed
                    to be, she decreed a special peace for the unarmed clerk and the industrious
                    husbandman. The council of Charroux in Poitou led the way in 989. With the
                    opening of the next century the movement spread over Aquitaine and the rest of
                    France. Everywhere the bishops set themselves to exact from the whole diocese,
                    noble and simple alike, a novel oath to abstain from violence and to respect the
                    sanctity of churches. William V. of Aquitaine, the most powerful lord of
                    southern France, lent his influence to the cause at the councils of Limoges
                    (994) and Poitiers (999). The latter council prescribed the methods by which all
                    who violated their solemn engagement should be punished. The times, however,
                    were hardly ripe for the inauguration of an era of peace. Gerard of Soissons,
                    perhaps, was not the only bishop who eyed this dream of universal harmony
                    askance, as tending to encroach on the king’s prerogative (see Bouquet, x. 201);
                    and, on the whole, it may be said that the “Peace of God” was at best but a
                    somewhat ineffectual protection to churches, priests, and labourers. If there
                    was any hope of restraining the mutual feuds of the barons it must be by other
                    means. And here the church again, recognizing the impossibility of absolutely
                    stopping all feudal warfare, endeavoured to limit it. This limitation of the
                    right of perpetual warfare, reduced to writing, sanctioned by an oath, and
                    confirmed by the decrees of councils, assumed the name of the “Truce of God” <hi
                        rend="italic">(treva</hi> or <hi rend="italic">treuga Dei).</hi> The truce
                    of God seems to have been first established at the synod of Tuluges, near
                    Perpignan in Roussillon, on 16th May 1027. In accordance with its decrees all
                    warfare was to be suspended from noon on Saturday till prime on Monday; and the
                    peace of God was permanently extended to all monks, clerks, bishops, and
                    churches. Like the <hi rend="italic">pax ecclesiae,</hi> this laudable example
                    was soon followed elsewhere. About 1041 it extended itself over Aquitaine and
                    all France; in 1042 the council of Caen, under the sanction of Duke William,
                    established it in Normandy—a country in which, according to a contemporary
                    writer (Rodolph Glaber, v. 1), it was not at first accepted. By this time its
                    terms had been much enlarged; and we may perhaps take the provisions of a second
                    synod at Tuluges (1041) as representing its normal form. According to this synod
                    the <hi rend="italic">treuga Dei</hi> was to last from the Wednesday evening to
                    the Monday morning in every week, from the beginning of Advent to the octave of
                    the Epiphany, from the beginning of Lent till the octave of Pentecost, for the
                    feasts of the Holy Cross, the three great feasts of the Virgin, and those of the
                    twelve apostles and a few other saints. More usually the interval between the
                    Epiphany octave and Lent and that from Easter to Rogations were left subject to
                    the weekly truce only. Thus from being a mere local institution it spread
                    rapidly over all France, and seems to have crossed into Germany, Italy, Spain,
                    and England. It had also its special courts and methods of procedure.
                    Excommunication and banishment for seven or thirty years were its penalties.
                    Before long both the <hi rend="italic">pax ecclesiae</hi> and the <hi
                        rend="italic">treuga Dei</hi> were sanctioned by the holy see. Special
                    clauses were added to protect pilgrims, women, merchants, monks, and clerks;
                    while the cattle and agricultural implements of the peasant —his ox, horse,
                    plough, and even his olive-trees—were covered by the aegis of the church. The
                    first clause of the council of Clermont (1095), at which Urban II. preached the
                    first crusade, proclaimed the weekly truce for all Christendom, and perhaps
                    enjoined it in its most extended form, adding also a clause by which the oath
                    was to be renewed every three years by all men above the age of twelve, whether
                    noble, burgess, villain, or serf.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    council seems to have accorded safety to all who took refuge at a wayside cross

                        fugientes).</hi> The truce of God was most powerful in the 12th century,
                    during which period it was sanctioned both by local and papal councils, such as
                    that held at Rheims by Calixtus II. in 1119, and the Lateran councils of 1139
                    and 1179. With the 13th century its influence began to decline, as the power of
                    the king gradually led to the substitution of the king’s peace for that of the
                    church.</p>
