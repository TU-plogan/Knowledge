                <p><label type="entry">TULLOCH, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1823-1886),
                    Scottish theologian, was born at Bridge of Earn, Perthshire, in 1823, went to
                    school at Perth, and received his university education at St Andrews and
                    Edinburgh. In 1845 he became minister of St Paul’s, Dundee, and in 1849 of
                    Kettins, in Strathmore, where he remained for six years. His literary gifts,
                    shown in his contributions to various reviews, as well as his talent for society
                    drew attention to him, and in 1854 he was appointed to the principalship of St
                    Mary’s College, St Andrews. The appointment was immediately followed by the
                    appearance of his Burnet prize essay on <hi rend="italic">Theism.</hi> At St
                    Andrews, where he held along with the principalship the post of professor of
                    systematic theology and apologetics, his work as a teacher was distinguished by
                    several features which at that time were new. He lectured on comparative
                    theology and treated doctrine historically, as being not a fixed product but a
                    growth. From the first he secured the attachment and admiration of his students.
                    In 1862 he was appointed one of the clerks of the General Assembly, and from
                    that time forward he took a leading part in the councils of the Church of
                    Scotland. In 1878 he was chosen moderator of the Assembly. No one, except
                    perhaps Dr Robert Lee, has done more during the last generation to widen the
                    national church. Two positions on which he repeatedly insisted in the Assembly
                    have taken a firm hold of the mind of that church,—first, that it is of the
                    essence of a church to be comprehensive of various views and tendencies, and
                    that a national church especially should seek to represent all the elements of
                    the life of the nation; secondly, that subscription to a creed can bind no one
                    to all its details, but only to the sum and substance, or the spirit, of the
                    symbol. For three years before his death he was convener of the church interests
                    committee of the Church of Scotland, which had to deal with a great agitation
                    for disestablishment. He was also deeply interested in the reorganization of
                    education in Scotland, both in school and university, and acted as one of the
                    temporary board which settled the primary school system under the Education Act
                    of 1872. His death took place at Torquay on 13th February 1886.</p>
                <p>Tulloch’s best known works are collections of biographical sketches of the
                    leaders of great movements in church history, such as the Reformation and
                    Puritanism. His most important book, <hi rend="italic">Rational Theology and
                        Christian Philosophy (1872),</hi> is one in which the Cambridge Platonists
                    and other leaders of dispassionate thought in the 17th century are similarly
                    treated. He delivered the second series of the Croall lectures, on the <hi
                        rend="italic">Doctrine of Sin,</hi> which were afterwards published. He also
                    published a small work, <hi rend="italic">The Christ of the Gospels and the
                        Christ of History,</hi> in which the views of Renan on the gospel history
                    were dealt with; a monograph on <hi rend="italic">Pascal</hi> for Blackwood’s
                    Foreign Classics series; and a little work, <hi rend="italic">Beginning
                        Life,</hi> addressed to young men, written at an earlier period. A <hi
                        rend="italic">Life</hi> of Tulloch by Mrs Oliphant is in preparation.</p>
