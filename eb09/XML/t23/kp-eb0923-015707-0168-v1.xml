                    true fresco pigments; moreover, the medium used, being soluble in water, will
                    not stand the rain. Its advantages are that the painter can work at leisure, and
                    can also transfer or sketch his whole design on the dry finished surface; while
                    in fresco work each portion of the design is hidden piecemeal as each new patch
                    of stucco is applied (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Raphael,</hi> vol. XX. p. 279).
                    Another important point is that a far greater variety of pigments can be used in
                    tempera painting, as they are not subjected to the caustic action of wet lime.
                    Lastly, tempera painting can be applied to any substance, such as dry plaster,
                    wood, stone, terracotta, vellum, and paper.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            were painted with very finely ground colours mixed with a tempera
                            medium.</p></note> Various media have been used for tempera work, such
                    as the glutinous sap of the fig and other trees, various gums which are soluble
                    in water, and size made by boiling down fish-bones, parchment, and animals’
                    hoofs. In more recent times a mixture of egg and vinegar has been found to make
                    a good medium, especially when it is desirable to apply the colours in
                    considerable body or <hi rend="italic">impasto.</hi> Painting in tempera is
                    probably the oldest method of all, and was used in ancient Egypt very largely,
                    as can be seen by an examination of the many existing examples on papyrus or w

                    Nineveh, and for internal work it appears to have been much employed by the
                    Greeks. To some extent tempera was used by the Romans, though in most cases a
                    combination of fresco and encaustic (hot wax) was employed for their mural
                    decoration (see vol. xvii. p. 42).</p>

                <p>In mediaeval times, from the 6th century in the Byzantium of Justinian down to
                    the 14th century, most painting, whether on walls or panels, was executed in
                    tempera, though in many cases it appears to have been the custom to put in the
                    coloured ground in true fresco, and, when that was dry, paint on it the complete
                    picture with a tempera medium. This was the method used in the Byzantine
                    wall-paintings in the churches of Thessalonica, Mount Athos, and elsewhere. A
                    similar practice existed in England and other northern countries,<note

                    walls and vault of the chancel of Kempley church, Gloucestershire, dating from
                    about 1100. Most commonly, however, in England as in France and Germany the
                    whole painting was done in tempera, the finished surface of the plaster being
                    first covered with a wash of old slaked lime or whitening. As a rule every inch
                    of stone, whether carved, moulded, or plain, in the cathedrals and other
                    churches of mediaeval France, England, and other countries was covered with this
                    thin coating of white, and then elaborately decorated with tempera painting. In
                    those rare cases where want of money prevented the application of colour the
                    stone-work of the interior received the coat of white, so that at any future
                    time the colouring might be added, and also because the feeling of the Middle
                    Ages evidently was that bare stone inside a building had an unfinished and
                    uncomfortable look,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    as unsuitable in a richly decorated and furnished cathedral as it would now be

                <p><hi rend="italic">Tempera in Italy.—</hi> For panel and canvas paintings tempera
                    continued in use till nearly the end of the 15th century, when the Flemish
                    method of oil painting gradually took its place. In many cases with panel
                    pictures of the latter part of the 15th century it is now difficult, if not
                    impossible, to be sure whether they were painted in tempera or in oil, either
                    because both methods were combined—the picture being begun in tempera and
                    finished with oil glazings—or because an oil varnish has been laid over the
                    tempera pictures, and so the pigments have absorbed oil out of the varnish and
                    have thus practically become associated with an oil medium. In some cases slight
                    peculiarities of brush-work bear witness to one medium or the other; but these
                    appearances are often deceptive, and any real certainty on the point is
                    unattainable. The round panel of the Madonna and St Joseph by Michelangelo may
                    be mentioned as an example of these doubtful cases.</p>
                <p>In the main the earlier tempera easel pictures were painted on wood, —pear,
                    poplar, or walnut being commonly used; but a few painters preferred in some
                    cases to use canvas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                            order to ensure an even surface some painters prepared their panels by
                            covering them with linen or vellum, over which the gesso priming was
                            laid.</p></note> The National Gallery of London possesses a very
                    beautiful example of this,—the Entombment, attributed to Van der Weyden (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Schools of Painting,</hi> vol. xxi. p. 438, fig. 29), which
                    is most delicately and yet powerfully painted on linen without any priming.
                    Usually both panels and canvas were prepared for tempera by being covered with a
                    fine priming or coating of gesso (plaster). Some later painters used marble
                    dust; others unfortunately used white lead, which has since blackened through
                    the absorption of gases from the air.</p>
                <p>In the case of wall paintings, both tempera and fresco<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Fresco” here means “fresco buono,” or
                            true fresco.</p></note> were used together,—the proportion of fresco
                    work being gradually increased. In the 13th and most of the 14th century little
                    more than the groundwork of the picture was painted in fresco, though this
                    varied according to the custom of each painter. In the 15th century increased
                    technical skill and rapidity of execution allowed much more complete work to be
                    done in fresco, till at last nothing but a few finishing touches were done in
                    tempera. For this, exceptional certainty of touch and speed of execution were
                    required, and some weaker painters never attained to a very complete mastery
                    over the fresco process. The brilliant series of wall paintings by Pinturicchio
                    in the cathedral library at Siena contain a very large proportion of tempera
                    work, in spite of which they are still in a wonderful state of preservation.
                    Raphael’s rapid advance in the mastery of fresco-work is clearly shown in his
                    paintings in the Vatican stanze, each one of which is carried to a further stage
                    in true fresco than the preceding. Thus the earliest painting of the series (the
                    Disputa) is very largely executed in tempera, while some of the later ones are
                    nearly completed in fresco, and show the most perfect skill in that difficult
                    process. Michelangelo was specially remarkable for his great power in fresco,
                    and carried his Sistine paintings to a very advanced stage before touching them
                    with tempera. Sad to say, what tempera finishing touches he did apply have
                    mostly been scraped off during the many cleanings and repairs that these works
                    have undergone; and the same misfortune has happened to a large number of other
                    important pictures. Tempera was specially used for paintings on canvas which
                    were intended to be hung like tapestry, as, for example, the fine 15th-century
                    series at Rheims and Mantegna’s Triumph of Julius Caesar at Hampton Court.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See vol. xvii. p.
                        38.</p></note> It was also much used for large cartoons, such as Raphael’s
                    tapestry designs, now in the South Kensington Museum. After the first half of
                    the 16th century the increasing use of oil painting, assisted by the artistic
                    decadence of the age, caused the gradual disuse of both fresco and tempera.</p>
                <p>A third process, often used during the earlier Middle Ages, was a sort of
                    compromise between tempera and fresco. A finished stucco surface was prepared as
                    for ordinary tempera, but before each day’s painting the plaster was soaked with
                    water, so that the pigments, laid on to the wet plaster, to some extent sank
                    below the surface, though without penetrating as deeply as they would on newly
                    mixed stucco. <hi rend="smallcaps">(j.</hi> H. Μ.)</p>
