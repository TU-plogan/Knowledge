                <p><label type="entry">TSCHUDI, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Schudy</hi></label>, the
                    name of one of the oldest and most distinguished families of the land of Glarus,
                    Switzerland. From 1029 to 1253 a member of the clan held the office of steward
                    of the abbess of Säckingen on the Rhine, the lady of the manor; and after Glarus
                    joined the Swiss Confederation in 1352 various members of the family held high
                    political offices at home, and were distinguished abroad as soldiers and in
                    other ways. In literature, its most eminent member was <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Giles</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Aegidius Tschudi</hi> (1505-1572), who,
                    after having served his native land in various offices, in 1558 became the chief
                    magistrate or “landammann.” Originally inclined to moderation, he became later
                    in life more and more devoted to the cause of the counter-Reformation. It is,
                    however, as the historian of the Swiss Confederation that he is best known; by
                    incessant wanderings and unwearied researches amongst original documents he
                    collected material for three great works, which therefore can never wholly lose
                    their value, though his researches have been largely supplemented and corrected
                    by those of more recent students. In 1538 his book on Rhaetia, written in 1528,
                    was published in Latin and in German— <hi rend="italic">De prisca ac vera Alpina
                        Rhaetia,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Die uralt wahrhafftig Alpisch

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Beschreibung Galliae Comatae</hi> appeared under Gallati's
                    editorship in 1758, and is mainly devoted to a topographical, historical, and
                    antiquarian description of ancient Helvetia and Rhaetia, the latter part being
                    his early work on Rhaetia revised and greatly enlarged. This book was designed
                    practically as an introduction to his <hi rend="italic">magnum opus,</hi> the
                        <hi rend="italic">Chronicon Helveticum,</hi> part of which (from 1100 to
                    1470) was published by J. R. Iselin in two stately folios (1734-36); the rest
                    (to 1564) consists only of rough materials. The value of the work rests very
                    largely on the constant use of original documents, no fewer than 750 being
                    printed in Iselin’s edition, though the transcripts do not always in point of
                    accuracy come up to the standard demanded by the modern critical historian. Many
                    ballads are incorporated and also many oral traditions, both being employed to
                    give life and picturesqueness to his story, though often at the expense of
                    historical truth, the stock instance of which is the manner in which he
                    completed and elaborated the Tell legend (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Tell).</hi>
                    In many ways his book, save in its flowing and quaint German, is rather like the
                    work of a 14th-century chronicler than a critical history; but it has been the
                    source from which all later Swiss writers have drawn their information, and in
                    many cases preserves the evidence of original documents which have since
                    disappeared. It is in short a history rather resembling that of Livy than that
                    of Hallam or Stubbs.</p>
                <p>Subjoined is a list of other prominent members of the family. <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Dominic</hi> (1596-1654) was a Benedictine monk at Muri and
                    wrote a painstaking work, <hi rend="italic">Origo et genealogia gloriosissimorum
                        comitum de Habsburg</hi> (1651). <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph,</hi> a
                    Benedictine monk at Einsiedeln, wrote a useful history of his abbey (1823). The
                    family, which became divided in religious matters at the Reformation, also
                    includes several Protestant ministers,— <hi rend="smallcaps">John Henry</hi>
                    (1670-1729), who wrote <hi rend="italic">Beschreibung des Lands Glarus</hi>
                    (1714); <hi rend="smallcaps">John Thomas</hi> (1714-1788), who left behind him
                    several elaborate MSS. on the local history of Glarus; and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >John James</hi> (1722-1784), who compiled an elaborate family history from
                    900 to 1500, and an account of other Glarus families. <hi rend="smallcaps">John
                        Louis</hi> (d. 1784), who settled in Metz and contributed to the <hi

                    (1820-1886), the author of <hi rend="italic">Das Thierleben der Alpenwelt,</hi>
                    were distinguished naturalists. Among the soldiers may be mentioned <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Christopher</hi> (1571-1629), a knight of Malta and an
                    excellent linguist, who served in the French and Spanish armies; while the
                    brothers Louis <hi rend="smallcaps">Leonard</hi> (1700- 1779) and <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Joseph Anthony</hi> (1703-1770) were in the Neapolitan
                    service. <hi rend="smallcaps">Valentine</hi> (1499-1555), the cousin of Giles,
                    was, like the latter, a pupil of Zwingli, whom he afterwards succeeded as pastor
                    of Glarus, and by his moderation gained so much influence that during the thirty
                    years of his ministry his services were attended alike by Catholics and
                    Protestants.</p>
