                    Three theologians of this name figure in the history of Genevan theology.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Benoit Turretin</hi> (1588-1631), the son of Francesco
                    Turretini, a native of Lucca, who settled in Geneva in 1579, was born in that
                    town on 9th November 1588. He was ordained a pastor in Geneva in 1612, and
                    became professor of theology in 1618. In 1620 he represented the Genevan Church
                    at the national synod of Alais, when the decrees of the synod of Dort were
                    introduced into France; and in 1621 he was sent on a successful mission to the
                    states general of Holland, and to the authorities of the Hanseatic towns, with
                    reference to the defence of Geneva against the threatened attacks of the duke of
                    Savoy. He published in 1618-20 a defence of the Genevan translation of the
                    Bible. Benoit Turretin died at Geneva on 4th March 1631.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">François Turretin</hi> (1623-87), son of the preceding,
                    was born at Geneva on 17th October 1623. After studying theology in Geneva,
                    Holland, and France, he became a pastor in Geneva in 1647; after a brief
                    pastorate at Leyden, he again returned to Geneva as professor of theology in
                    1653. He was one of the most influential supporters of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Formula Consensus Helvetica,</hi> drawn up chiefly by Heidegger, in 1675,
                    and of the particular type of Calvinistic theology which that symbol embodied.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Institutio Theologiae, Elencticae</hi> (3 vols. 4to,
                    Geneva, 1680-83) has passed through frequent editions, the last reprint having
                    been made in Edinburgh in 1847. F. Turretin died at Geneva on 28th September
                    1687. He was also the author of volumes entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                        Satisfactione Christi Disputationes</hi> (Geneva, 1666) and <hi

                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jean Alphonse Turretin</hi> (1671-1737), son of the
                    preceding, was born at Geneva on 13th August 1671. He was educated at Geneva and
                    in Holland, and after travelling in England and in France was received into the
                    “Vénérable Compagnie des Pasteurs” of Geneva in 1693. In 1697 he became
                    professor of church history. During the next forty years of his life he enjoyed
                    great influence in Geneva as the advocate of a more liberal theology than had
                    prevailed under the preceding generation, and it was largely through his
                    instrumentality that the use of the <hi rend="italic">Formula Consensus
                        Helvetica</hi> as a symbol was discontinued in 1725. He also wrote and
                    laboured for the promotion of union between the Reformed and Lutheran Churches,
                    his most important work in this connexion being <hi rend="italic">Nubes Testium
                        pro Moderato et Pacifico de Rebus Theologicis Judicio, et Instituenda inter
                        Protestantes Concordia (Geneva,</hi> 1719). Besides this he wrote <hi
                        rend="italic">Cogitationes et Dissertationes Theologicae,</hi> on the
                    principles of natural and revealed religion (Geneva, 1737); and commentaries on
                    Thessalonians and Romans were published posthumously. He died at Geneva on 1st
                    May 1737.</p>
