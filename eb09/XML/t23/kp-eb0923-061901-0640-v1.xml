                <p><label type="entry">TUNING FORK</label>, a small bar of cast tool steel with
                    tolerably defined edges, bent into a fork with two prongs. A handle of the same
                    metal extending from the bend of the fork serves as a sound-post to transmit the
                    vibrations of the fork to any resonance board or body convenient for reinforcing
                    the sound. The fork is set in vibration by striking one of the prongs against
                    any hard substance, by pressing the prongs together if the fork is a light one,
                    or, if it is large, by drawing a double bass bow across one of the prongs. The
                    larger forks are sometimes made with a worm upon the handle in order that they
                    may be screwed into a resonance box, the dimensions of which should agree with
                    the pitch of the fork. The ordinary use of a tuning fork is to serve as a pitch
                    carrier or standard, for which it is particularly suited owing to the permanence
                    with which it maintains the pitch to which it may be tuned. It is flattened by
                    heat and sharpened by cold about 1 vibration in 20,000 for every degree Fahr.,
                    so that the exact pitch always depends upon the temperature. A tuning fork is
                    tuned by filing the ends of the prongs or between them near the ends to make it
                    sharper, or by filing between them near or at the bend to make it flatter. Less
                    filing is required to flatten than to sharpen. It should be allowed to rest
                    after tuning, on account of the disturbance of the molecular structure by the
                    filing, and after a few days should be compared again with the pitch required,
                    and corrected. The tuning fork is also of value in certain physical
                    investigations, from the constancy of its rate of vibration. In England it is
                    generally tuned to C in the treble clef, because organ-builders start their
                    tuning from that note; in France it is tuned to A in the treble clef, which is
                    the note of the third open string of the violin. The French diapason normal is
                    tuned to A at 15° C. ( = 59° Fahr.) and is fixed at 435 double vibrations in a
                    second. The inventor of the tuning fork was John Shore, royal trumpeter in 1711,
                    sergeant trumpeter at the entry of George I. in 1714, and lutanist to the chapel
                    royal in 1715.</p>
                <p>According to Chladni, whose analysis of the tuning fork has been generally
                    accepted, it has two nodes or points of least vibration at the bend, with a
                    ventral or vibrating loop between, by which its vibrations are transmitted to
                    the handle. That this is not the case has been shown by Mr W. F. Stanley.<note

                    note appears to be an octave below the note which the ear recognizes as the
                    pitch of the fork. Helmholtz, Tyndall, and others accept the latter as the
                    fundamental, and Helmholtz expressly says that each prong may be regarded as an
                    elastic rod fixed at one end.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    bent elastic rod vibrating at both ends, with a node at the bend, through which,
                    and in the same way as with the bridge of any stringed instrument, the
                    vibrations are conducted. As well as the second partial, the third and fourth
                    are in large forks frequently distinguishable, but such partials above the
                    octave are very weak. In addition to the lower harmonic partials it is generally
                    easy to produce with a blow a very high inharmonic tinkle or ringing metallic
                    note, that will continue to sound for some time without blending with the true
                    note of the fork. The precise interval varies, but is usually two octaves and
                    between a flat fifth and a major sixth above the recognized pitch of the fork.
                    With ordinary tuning forks this tinkling note is to be found amongst the highest
                    treble notes of the pianoforte. Theorists give other inharmonic proper tones in
                    due ascending order; they are derived from calculation on the assumption that
                    they proceed as the squares of the odd numbers, but are beyond practical
                    verification owing to their extreme position in the scale of musical sounds and
                    the variation of power in different ears to distinguish them.</p>
                <p>The tuning fork was used by Scheibler (1777-1837) as the easiest means for
                    correctly determining the pitch numbers of vibrations. To make a Scheibler
                    tonometer, take a fork in which the octave can be easily heard and intercalate
                    as many forks as, giving countable beats with each other, will fill up the
                    octave. The addition of the whole number of beats and their fractions in the
                    octave will be the vibrating number, in double vibrations per second, of the
                    lower fork. In order to measure the fractions of vibrations accurately forks
                    should be chosen that are audible for 40, or at least 20 seconds. For instance,
                    60 beats counted in 20 seconds would be 3 a second, and 65 in the same time
                    3∙25. The forks should remain for three months after filing before their
                    differences are finally determined, and the whole examination should be
                    conducted in a known, uniform temperature. Scheibler considered four beats a
                    second between two forks a good number for counting; but Mr A. J. Ellis, who has
                    used Scheibler’s invention as a basis for an exhaustive historical statement of
                    musical pitch<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“On the
                            History of Musical Pitch,” in <hi rend="italic">Journ. Soc. of
                                Arts,</hi> 5th March and 2d April 1880; see also 7th January
                            1881.</p></note> and as the novel and exact means for determining the
                    non-harmonic musical scales of various nations, especially Eastern nations,<note

                    This would increase the number of intermediate forks.</p>
                <p>Attempts have been made to use tuning forks instead of strings for key-board
                    instruments, the object being to obtain permanence of tuning with the soft,
                    unexciting quality of tone furnished by the fork. The inventions of Clagget,
                    London, 1788, of Riffelsen (the melodikon), Copenhagen, 1803, and of Schuster
                    (the adiaphonon), Vienna, 1819, were of this nature. The latest adaptation of a
                    keyboard to tuning forks has been effected by Mr Machell of Glasgow; it was
                    shown at the Inventions Exhibition, South Kensington, London, 1885.</p>
