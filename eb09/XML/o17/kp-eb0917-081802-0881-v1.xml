                <p><label type="entry">ORCHOMENUS</label>, the name borne by two cities of ancient
                    Greece.</p>
                <p>I. A Boeotian city, situated in the angle between the Cephissus and its tributary
                    the Melas, on a long narrow hill which projects south from Mount Acontium. Its
                    position is exceedingly strong, being defended on every side by precipice or
                    marsh or river, and it was admirably suited to be the stronghold of an early
                    kingdom. The acropolis is at the north end of the hill, on a peak which is
                    overhung by Acontium, but at a distance sufficient to be safe from an enemy with
                    the weapons of early warfare posted on the mountain. At the foot of the
                    acropolis are. the springs of the Melas. Orchomenus was the capital of the
                    Minyae, a race famous in the half-legendary history of early Boeotia; the sway
                    of the Minyae once extended over Boeotia, including even Thebes, but the Aeolic
                    Boeotians who made Thebes their stronghold broke the power of the Orchomenian
                    kings. The most remarkable relic of the early power of Orchomenus is the
                    so-called “treasury,” which is said to be the oldest in Greece. It was larger
                    than the buildings of similar style at Mycenae (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Mycenae),</hi> and the admiration which Pausanias expresses for it is
                    justified by the beautiful ornamentation, especially of the roof, which has been
                    brought to light by Schliemann’s excavations. The monument, undoubtedly the tomb
                    of some ancient ruler, or of a dynasty, lies outside the city walls. The worship
                    of the Charites (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Graces)</hi> was the great cultus of
                    Orchomenus, and the site of the temple is now occupied by a chapel, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Κοίμησις της</hi> Παναγίας. The Charites were worshipped under
                    the form of rude stones, which had fallen from heaven during the reign of
                    Eteocles; and it was not till the time of Pausanias that statues of the
                    goddesses were placed in the temple. Near this was another temple dedicated to
                    Dionysus, in whose festival, the ’ Aγptoivια, are apparent the traces of human
                    sacrifice in early times. The city was destroyed by the Thebans in the 4th
                    century; the men were slain, and the women and children sold as slaves. About
                    thirty years later, after the battle of Chaeronea (338 B.c.), Philip of Macedon
                    restored the city. The name is spelt on the dialectic inscriptions and coins ’
