                <p><label type="entry">ORINOCO</label>, a river in the north of South America, which
                    falls into the Atlantic on the north-east seaboard between 60° 20' and 62° 30'
                    W. long., after draining an area of at least 366,000 square miles (belonging to
                    Venezuela and Colombia) in a course of about 1500 miles. Between the source of
                    its westmost affluent, the Guaviare, and that of its eastmost, the Caroni, there
                    is a difference of 14 degrees of longitude. The head-waters of the main stream
                    rise on the southern slope of the Sierre Parime; but the branch which keeps the
                    name Orinoco has not yet been traced by any European, and the position of the
                    lake from which, according to native report, it issues can only be vaguely
                    fixed. Michelena y Rôjas, who ascended the Orinoco as far as the mouth of the
                    Mawaca (itself about 30 feet deep), found it even there a deep and navigable
                    river; and a little way lower down it receives no inconsiderable accession from
                    the Ocamo and Padamo. Below Esmeralda, a settlement in 65° 50' W. long., long
                    known as the limit of definite exploration, occurs one of the most remarkable
                    bifurcations in the world; while the main stream holds on in a north-west
                    direction, a branch called the Casiquiare turns south and, increased by numerous
                    small tributaries, runs for about 180 miles to the Rio Negro (an affluent of the
                    Amazons) with so rapid a current that, while a boat takes only four natural days
                    to descend, the return voyage requires twenty to thirty days. In the
                    neighbourhood of San Fernando de Atabapo (in 4° 2' N. lat. and 68° 10' W. long.,
                    a miserable village, but officially the capital of the Venezuelan province of
                    the Amazons, and famous in the history of the river) the Orinoco is joined by
                    the united waters of the Atabapo, the Ynirida, and the Guaviare,—the Guaviare
                    receiving the Ynirida <pb break="no"

                    then meeting the Atabapo opposite the village. The Guaviare is the first of the
                    great rivers which bring down the waters of the Andes to the Orinoco, and is fit
                    for steamboat traffic a long way up. From its junction with the Guaviare to the
                    great rapid of Mariapiri (a distance of about 180 miles) the Ynirida, which was
                    explored in 1872 by Frédéric Montolieu, hastens through a rugged country with a
                    swift and frequently interrupted stream; above Mariapiri, and as far as
                    Guacamayo (Montolieu’s farthest), it forms, on the other hand, a succession of
                    lakes and lagoons with hardly any current <hi rend="italic">{Bull.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Soc. Gêogr.,</hi> Paris, 1880). Though smaller than either the
                    Guaviare, the Ynirida, or the Orinoco, the Atabapo gives its northward direction
                    to the united river, which below the confluence widens out into a noble flood
                    several miles broad, but before long has its channel contracted and twisted and
                    broken by the rough granitic rocks of the country through which it has to force
                    its way. About 80 miles bring the river to the great cataracts of Maypures, and
                    a few miles more to that of Atures; both are complete barriers to upward
                    navigation, and, since Humboldt’s glowing description, have been ranked among
                    the most striking pieces of river scenery in South America (Humboldt and
                    Bonpland, <hi rend="italic">Voy.</hi><hi rend="italic">au</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Nouv. Continent,</hi> vol. ii. pp. 360-363). Some distance below Atures is
                    the confluence of the Meta, a powerful many-watered affluent from the Andes,
                    which has been ascended by steamer within 60 miles of Bogota; but the Orinoco
                    still continues northward till, meeting the Apure, which drains the whole Merida
                    Cordillera, it turns westwards through the great Venezuelan valley. In its
                    onward course it receives a great many tributaries from both north and south,
                    the former being comparatively short, but the latter, especially the Caura and
                    Caroni, rising in the highlands hundreds of miles away. About 50 miles below the
                    mouth of the Caroni and 120 miles from the sea begins the enormous delta,
                    embracing 200 miles of coast. The southmost branch, Boca de Navios or Boca de
                    Varime, continues in the line of the river; the Manamo or Vagre branch strikes
                    off almost at right angles northward to the Gulf of Paria or Golfo Triste. The
                    annual inundation of the Orinoco, which makes a kind of false start in April,
                    and, gradually increasing in May, June, and July, reaches its height in
                    September, is extensive enough to lay the country under water in some places for
                    scores of miles inland. As most of the regions through which it passes are in a
                    state of nature, and there is hardly, with the exception of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Angostura (⅛.v.),</hi> a town of any considerable size on the banks of
                    either main stream or affluents, this noble river-system is but little turned to
                    account for commerce. Not only, however, is it easily navigable for steamers for
                    nearly 800 miles, but, as the lower part of its course lies in the line of the
                    trade-winds, sailing craft are able to make their way slowly upwards against the
                    current. Even at the junction of the Guaviare the height above the sea is only
                    744 feet.</p>
                <p>In 1498 Columbus entered Golfo Triste, and probably observed the northern mouths
                    of the Orinoco, and in 1499 the main channel appears to have been noted by
                    Ojeda. The first to attempt the ascent of the river was Diego de Ordaz in 1535,
                    who reached the mouth of the Meta. For its scientific exploration we are mainly
                    indebted to José Γturriaga and José Solano (1756), Humboldt (1800), and
                    Michelena y Rojas (1855-1856).</p>
