                <p><label type="entry">OPIE, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label> (1761-1807),
                    historical and portrait painter, was born at St Agnes near Truro in May 1761. He
                    early showed a taste for drawing, and for scholarship also, having at the age of
                    twelve mastered Euclid and opened an evening school for arithmetic and writing.
                    Before long he won some local reputation by portrait-painting; and in 1780 he
                    started for London, under the patronage of Dr Wolcot (Peter Pindar), who hoped
                    to win credit, and still more substantial benefits, from the fame of his young
                    protégé. Opie was introduced to the town as “The Cornish Wonder,” a self-taught
                    genius. The world of fashion, ever eager for a new sensation, was attracted; the
                    carriages of the wealthy blocked the street in which the painter resided, and
                    for a time he reaped a rich harvest by his portraits. But soon the fickle tide
                    of popularity flowed past him, and the painter was left neglected. He now
                    applied himself with redoubled diligence to correcting the defects which marred
                    his art, meriting the praise of his rival Northcote—“Other artists paint to
                    live; Opie lives to paint.” At the same time he sought to supplement his early
                    education by the study of Latin and French and of the best English classics, and
                    to polish the rudeness of his provincial manners by mixing in cultivated and
                    learned circles. In 1786 he exhibited his first important historical subject,
                    the Assassination of James I., and in the following year the Murder of Rizzio, a
                    work whose merit was recognized by the artist’s immediate election as associate
                    of the Academy, of which he became a full member in 1788. He was employed on
                    five subjects for Boydell’s “Shakespeare Gallery”; and until his death, on the
                    9th of April 1807, his practice alternated between portraiture and historical
                    work. His productions are distinguished by breadth of handling and a certain
                    rude vigour, individuality, and freshness. They are wanting in grace, elegance,
                    and poetic feeling. Opie is also favourably known as a writer on art by his <hi
