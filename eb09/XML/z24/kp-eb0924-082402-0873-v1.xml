                    inhabit for the most part the tropical districts of the Old World, from Africa
                    to most of the islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and northwards in Asia
                    through India and China to Amurland and Japan.</p>
                <p>The birds of this group are mostly of unpretending appearance, the plumage above
                    being generally either mouse-coloured or greenish olive; but some are
                    sufficiently varied by the white or bright yellow of their throat, breast, or
                    lower parts, and several have the flanks of a more or less lively bay. It is
                    remarkable that several islands are inhabited by two perfectly distinct species,
                    one belonging to the brown and the other to the green section, the former being
                    wholly insular. The greater number of species seem to be confined to single
                    islands, often of very small area, but others have a very wide distribution, and
                    much interest has been excited by the undoubted fact that the type-species, <hi
                        rend="italic">Z. caerulescens,</hi> has of late years largely extended its
                    range. First described from New South Wales, where it is very plentiful, it had
                    been long known to inhabit all the eastern part of Australia. In 1856 it was
                    noticed by naturalists as occurring in the South Island of New Zealand, when it
                    became known to the Maories by a name signifying “Stranger,” and to the English
                    settlers as the “Blight-bird,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>By most English-speaking people in various parts of the

                            mentioned.</p></note> from its clearing the fruit-trees of a blight by
                    which they had lately been affected. It soon after appeared in the North Island,
                    where it speedily became common, and it has thence not only spread to the
                    Chatham Islands, but, as Sir Walter Buller states (<hi rend="italic">Birds N.
                        Zealand,</hi> ed. 2, i. p. 79), it has been met with in considerable numbers
                    300 miles from land, as though in search of new countries to colonize. Yet this
                    author believes it to be indigenous to the west coast of the South Island, and
                    Sir James Hector joins in that opinion. If they be right, it is, however, pretty
                    certain that until the year before mentioned it must have been confined to an
                    extremely small district, and the only assignable cause of its spreading so
                    rapidly, when it did extend its range, is that of a large surplus population
                    unable to find a living at home. It is known to propagate at a high rate of
                    increase, and at times numbers have been found dead, apparently for want of
                    food. In any case it is obvious that this Zosterops must be a comparatively
                    modern settler in New Zealand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            differentiation had been set up; but the variation would doubtless have
                            been greater had the species been an ancient colonist.</p><p>It is a

                            length, is confined to so small a spot as Norfolk Island, where also
                            another, <hi rend="italic">Z. tenuirostris,</hi> not much less in size,
                            occurs; while a third, of intermediate stature, <hi rend="italic">Z.

                            is found on one of the New Hebrides; but, after these giants of their
                            kind, the rest fall off considerably, being from one-fifth to one-third
                            less in length, and some of the smaller species hardly exceed 3⅜ inches

                                >Zosterops</hi> are by no means clear. Placed by some writers, if
                            not systematists, with the <hi rend="italic">Paridae (cf.</hi><hi

                            removes it from the first and third, and from most of the forms
                            generally included among the second. On the whole it seems safest to
                            regard the genus, at least provisionally, as the type of a distinct
                            Family— <hi rend="italic">Zosteropidae—</hi> as Families go among
                            Passerine birds; but, whether the Australian genera <hi rend="italic"

                            under that heading, as has been done, remains to be proved, and in the
                            meanwhile may be reasonably doubted. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.
