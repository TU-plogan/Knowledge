                <p><label type="entry">ZACATECAS</label>, a city of Mexico, capital of the state of
                    the same name, lies 340 miles by rail north-west of Mexico, in 22° 46' N. lat.
                    and 102° W. long. Zacatecas, which had a population of 46,000 in 1886, is the
                    centre of one of the oldest and most productive silver-mining districts in the
                    republic, and the town itself stands on the rich vein discovered here by Juan de
                    Tolosa in 1546. It lies on the great Mexican tableland, 7976 feet above the sea,
                    in a narrow ravine surrounded by rolling hills, all containing almost
                    inexhaustible deposits of the precious metal. Within half an hour’s walk of the
                    centre of the town are situated twelve mines, some of which have been worked
                    with little interruption for over three hundred years. Owing to the irregular
                    nature of the ground and the great value of the land, the city is laid out in
                    narrow tortuous streets, which, unlike most other Mexican towns, are lined by
                    high houses of three and four stories. Noteworthy amongst the public buildings
                    are the cathedral, with a finely sculptured façade, the Government palace, the
                    city hall, the theatre, and the mint; this last, during the period from 1772 to
                    1865, issued silver money to the value of £41,000,000, besides £110,000 in gold.
                    The streets, although narrow, are well paved and partly lit by electricity.
                    Since the completion of the Central Mexican Railway to this place in 1884 it has
                    increased in population and prosperity. From the Bufa Hill, 500 feet high, lying
                    to the north of the city, an extensive view is commanded of the surrounding
                    district, which is of an extremely rugged character and almost destitute of
                    vegetation. In the neighbourhood are nine small lakes, yielding an abundance of
                    salt and carbonate of soda. Zacatecas, which received the title of city from
                    Philip II. in 1585, is supplied with water by a large, well-constructed
                    aqueduct.</p>
                <p>The state of Zacatecas lies between Coahuila and Jalisco north and south
                    respectively, and is elsewhere conterminous with Guanajuato, Durango, and San
                    Luis Potosi. It has an area of 25,227 square miles and a population (1882) of
                    422,506, of whom a preponderating proportion are Indians or mestizos. It stands
                    at a mean altitude of over 7000 feet above sea-level, and is traversed by the
                    Mazapil, Norillos, Guadaloupe, and other metalliferous ranges, this state
                    ranking among the first in the republic for mineral wealth. Next to the Veta
                    Madre of Guanajuato and the famous Comstock lode, Nevada, the Veta Grande of
                    Zacatecas is held to be the most remarkable silver vein in North America. The
                    chief mining districts are Zacatecas, Espiritu Santo, Chapala, Los Arcos,
                    Norias, Ipala, Santa Lucia, Naranjal, and Santo Martino; and in 1886 about 324
                    mines were open (21 gold, 67 gold and silver, 167 silver alone, 15 copper, 37
                    lead, and 16 quicksilver). Besides its minerals the state possesses considerable
                    agricultural resources, the southeastern parts especially being very fertile and
                    well watered by the rivers Tlaltenango and Juchipila. Maize, wheat, fruits—such
                    as peaches, apricots, grapes,—and all kinds of vegetables are extensively
                    cultivated, the annual maize crop being valued at over £1,000,000, wheat at
                    about £250,000, and the remaining crops at about £600,000. Even in the bleak and
                    arid northern districts there are some extensive grazing-grounds, where cattle,
                    horses, mules, sheep, and goats thrive well. Some of the slopes are well
                    timbered, the chief species being the mountain cedar, oak, elm, ash, and
                    cotton-wood. Besides the capital, the chief mining towns are Fresnillo (pop.
                    15,000), Garcia (8000), Villanueva (7000), Linos (7000), Sombrerete (6000), and
                    Nieves (3000).</p>
