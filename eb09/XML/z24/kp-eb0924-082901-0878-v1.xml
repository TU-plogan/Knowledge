                <p><label type="entry">ZURBARAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Francisco</hi></label>
                    (1598-1662), a distinguished Spanish painter, was born at Fuente de Cantos in
                    Estremadura on 7th November 1598. His father was named Luis Zurbaran, a country
                    labourer, his mother Isabel Marquet. The lot apparently marked out for Francisco
                    was that of tilling the ground, like his father; but his natural faculty had
                    decided otherwise. In mere childhood he set about imitating objects with
                    charcoal; and his father was quick-witted and long-headed enough to take him
                    off, still extremely young, to the school of Juan de Roélas in Seville.
                    Francisco soon became the best pupil in the studio of Roélas, surpassing the
                    master himself; and before leaving him he had achieved a solid reputation, full
                    though Seville then was of able painters. He may probably have had here the
                    opportunity of copying some of the paintings of Michelangelo da Caravaggio; at
                    any rate he gained the name of “the Spanish Caravaggio,” owing to the very
                    forcible realistic style in which he excelled. He constantly painted direct from
                    nature, following but occasionally improving on his model; and he made great use
                    of the lay-figure in the study of draperies, in which he was peculiarly
                    proficient. He had a special gift for white draperies; and, as a natural
                    consequence, Carthusian monks are abundant in his paintings. To these rigidly
                    faithful methods of work Zurbaran is said to have adhered throughout his career,
                    which was always eminent and prosperous, wholly confined to his native Spain,
                    and varied by few incidents beyond those of his daily laborious and continually
                    productive diligence. His subjects were mostly of a severe and ascetic
                    kind,—religious vigils, the flesh chastised into subjection to the spirit,—the
                    compositions seldom thronged, and often reduced to a single figure. The style is
                    more reserved and chastened than Caravaggio’s, the tone of colour often bluish
                    to a morbid excess. Exceptional effects are attained by the precise finish of
                    foregrounds, largely massed out in light and shade. Zurbaran married in Seville
                    Leonor de Jordera, by whom he had several children. Towards 1630 he was
                    appointed painter to Philip IV.; and there is a story that on one occasion the
                    sovereign laid his hand on the artist’s shoulder, saying, “Painter to the king,
                    king of painters.” It was only late in life that Zurbaran made a prolonged stay
                    in Madrid, Seville being the chief scene of his operations. He died in 1662 in
                    Madrid.</p>
                <p>In 1627 he painted the great altarpiece of St Thomas Aquinas, now in the Seville
                    museum; it was executed for the church of the college of that saint in the same
                    city. This is Zurbaran’s largest composition, containing figures of Christ and
                    the Madonna, various saints, Charles V. with knights, and Archbishop Deza
                    (founder of the college) with monks and servitors, all the principal personages
                    being beyond the size of life; this work is full of fine portrait-like heads,
                    and it ranks, both in importance and in elevated style, as the painter’s
                    masterpiece. It had been preceded by the numerous pictures of the screen of St
                    Peter Nolasco in the cathedral. In the church of Guadalupe he painted various
                    large pictures, eight of which relate to the history of St Jerome, and in the
                    church of St Paul, Seville, a famous figure of the Crucified Saviour, in
                    grisaille, presenting an illusive effect of marble. In 1633 he finished the
                    paintings of the high altar of the Carthusians in Jerez. In the palace of
                    Buenretiro, Madrid, are four large canvases representing the Labours of
                    Hercules, an unusual instance of non-Christian subjects from the hand of
                    Zurbaran. A very fine specimen is in the London National Gallery, a whole-length
                    life-sized figure of a kneeling Franciscan holding a skull (figured in vol. xxi.
                    p. 440, fig. 36).</p>
                <p>The principal scholars of this master, whose style has as much affinity to that
                    of Ribera as to Caravaggio’s, were Bernabe de Ayala and the brothers
                    Polanco.</p>
