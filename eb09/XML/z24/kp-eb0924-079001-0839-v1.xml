                <p><label type="entry">ZITTAU</label>, the centre of the Saxon linen trade and the
                    most populous town in the district of Bautzen, in the kingdom of Saxony, is
                    situated on the left bank of the Mandau, near its confluence with the Neisse, 25
                    miles south-east of Bautzen and 48 east-south-east of Dresden. The town is built
                    in a regular and modern style. The town-house dates from 1844, and contains a
                    public library of 30,000 volumes. The church of St John was rebuilt in 1834-37;
                    and the church of St Peter and St Paul, with its elegant tower, belonged to an
                    old Franciscan monastery. The latter was restored in 1882 and part of it fitted
                    up as an historical museum. There are five other churches in the town. Zittau is
                    well equipped with schools, including a gymnasium (founded in 1586) and a
                    commercial school, both accommodated in the Johanneum, and several technical
                    institutions. The leading branch of industry is linen and damask weaving; but
                    woollen stuffs, trimmings, &amp;c., are also produced in the factories of the
                    town, and in the surrounding weaving villages, 37 of which, with 70,000
                    inhabitants, are included in the municipal jurisdiction. The town, which is one
                    of the best endowed in Saxony, also owns valuable forests on the mountains of
                    Upper Lusatia. There are various steam-mills, iron-foundries, brick-fields, and
                    potteries near the town, and extensive deposits of lignite, employing over 1000
                    hands. Zittau is situated near the border of Bohemia, with which it carries on
                    some trade. In 1885 the population was 23,215, of whom less than one-fifth were
                    Roman Catholics; in 1834 the population was 8508.</p>
                <p>Zittau is of Wendish origin (Chytawa is its Wendish name), and was made a town by
                    Ottocar II. of Bohemia. It was one of the six towns of the Lusatian league
