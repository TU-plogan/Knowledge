                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0157-0146"/> forests, now greatly reduced, still cover
                    about 18 per cent, of the surface of the government. The climate is
                    comparatively mild, the mean temperature at Kovno being 44° Fahr. The population
                    (1,156,040 in 1870) is very varied, consisting of Lithuanians proper and Zhmuds,
                    Jews, Slavs, and Germans; 82 per cent, are Catholics, 13 Jews, 3 Protestants,
                    and 2 belong to the Greek Church. The Poles number only 3000, and the Russians
                    (White, Little, and Great) 182,000. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is
                    agriculture, 60 per cent, of the whole surface being under crops; both grain and
                    potatoes are exported. The yield of corn (2,270,000 quarters prior to 1857) is
                    now about 2,879,000 quarters per annum. Flax is also cultivated, and the linseed
                    is exported. Stock-breeding is not carried on to any considerable extent; but,
                    owing to the number of lakes, the fishing industry has some importance. The
                    manufacturing industries, if distillation be left out of account, are trifling.
                    Trade, especially the transit trade, is brisk, from the situation of the
                    government on the Prussian frontier, the custom houses of Yurburg and Taurogen
                    being among the most important in Russia. Kovno has seven districts :—Kovno,
                    Novoalexandrovsk, Ponevyezh, Rossieny, Shavli, Telshi, and Vilkomir. The
                    principal towns are Kovno (32,050 inhabitants), Shavli (15,400), Vilkomir
                    (11,150), Rossieny (10,700), and Novoalexandrovsk (8250).</p>
                <p>The territory which now constitutes the government of Kovno was formerly part of
                    Lithuania. During the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries the Livonian and Teutonic
                    knights continually invaded and plundered it, especially the western part which
                    was peopled with Zhmuds. In 1569 it was annexed, along with the rest of the
                    grand principality of Lithuania, to Poland; and it suffered very much from the
                    wars of Russia with Sweden and Poland, and from the invasion of Charles XII. in
                    1701. In 1795 the principality of Lithuania was annexed to Russia, and until
                    1872, when the government of Kovno was constituted, the territory now forming it
                    was a part of the government of Vilna.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Kovno,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Kaune</hi> of the
                    Lithuanians, capital of the above government, is situated on the railway between
                    St Petersburg and Berlin, 503 miles south-west from the former. It consists of
                    two parts, the new town, built on the right bank of the Niemen, and an old town,
                    situated on the left bank of the Vilia which here joins the Niemen. By its
                    situation at the confluence of two navigable rivers, some few miles above the
                    mouth of the Nevyaja, and close to a place where the Niemen sharply changes its
                    northern direction into a western one, Kovno, which is supposed to have been
                    built in the 11th century, soon acquired importance both as a fortified place
                    and as a centre for trade. In its early history it often suffered from the
                    attacks of the crusaders, and fell alternately under their dominion and under
                    that of Lithuanians. Its citadel was destroyed in 1400, and from that time it
                    became the centre of an active trade, being visited by German and English
                    merchants. In the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries it was the chief emporium for
                    trade with Lithuania, and rivalled Königsberg. Henry of Valois said it was the
                    best jewel of the kingdom. But continuous wars destroyed this commerce, and,
                    when Kovno became a Russian town, in 1795, it was already a very poor place,
                    which numbered in 1817 but two hundred houses. Owing to its advantageous
                    situation, it has again acquired commercial importance. It has several
                    remarkable old churches, two of which have been transferred to the Greek
                    confession, and a beautiful old guild-hall now transformed into an imperial
                    palace. Its population (33,050) is most varied; one half are Jews engaged in
                    petty trades and commerce. Salt, salted fish, coal, and various manufactured
                    wares are brought here from Prussia on vessels which return with cargoes of
                    corn, linseed, timber, rags, bones, and wool, purchased in the governments of
                    Vilna, Minsk, Grodno, and Tchernigoff.</p>
