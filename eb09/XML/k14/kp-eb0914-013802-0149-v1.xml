                    (Hungarian, <hi rend="italic">liév-Komârom),</hi> a royal free town of Hungary,
                    and capital of the trans-Danubian county of Komârom, lies at the eastern
                    extremity of the island of Csallököz or Schütt, and at the Confluence of the
                    Waag with the Danube, 48 miles west-north-west from Budapest, with which city as
                    also with Vienna it is directly connected by railway, in 47° 46' N. lat., 18° 7'
                    E. long. Komorn is celebrated chiefly for its fortifications, which, owing to
                    their favourable position and extended line of tôtes-de-pont, are believed to be
                    impregnable, and are capable of holding a force of some 30,000 defenders. The
                    town is the seat of the county administration, and of a royal court of law, and
                    has Roman Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, a Jewish
                    synagogue, Roman Catholic and Protestant gymnasia, county and town halls, a
                    military hospital, two savings banks, and a shipping agency. The streets are for
                    the most part narrow, irregular, and gloomy. The commercial relations of Komorn
                    with the chief towns on the Danube are facilitated by its important steam-packet
                    station. The inhabitants carry on a brisk trade in grain, timber, wine, flour,
                    and fish. The civil population at the end of 1880 amounted to 13,108, mostly
                    Magyars and Germans by nationality.</p>
                <p>The walls of the fortifications of Komorn were commenced from the land side in
                    1272. They were much strengthened and extended two hundred years later by King
                    Matthias (Corvinus). The new fort was begun by Ferdinand I. about 1547, and
                    received additions in 1673 under Leopold I. In 1543, 1594, 1598, and 1663 Komorn
                    was beleaguered by the Turks. It was raised to the dignity of a royal free town
                    in 1751. In 1767, 1768, September 1848, and April 1854 it suffered severely from
                    fire, and in 1763, 1822, and 1851 from earthquakes. The fortifications, having
                    been neglected during the latter half of the 18th century, were enlarged and to
                    a great extent reconstructed between 1805 and 1809. During the revolutionary war
                    of 1848-49 Komorn was a principal point of military operations, and was long
                    unsuccessfully besieged by the Austrians, who on the 11th July 1849 were
                    defeated there by General Gorgei, and on the 3d August by General Klapka. On the
                    27th September the fortress capitulated to the Austrians upon honourable terms,
                    and on the 3d and 4th October was evacuated by the Hungarian troops. The
                    treasure of the Austrian national bank was removed here from Vienna in 1866,
                    when that city was threatened by the Prussians.</p>
