                            rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label> (1788-1830), one of the most
                    genial, prolific, and gifted poets of Hungary, and especially celebrated as the
                    regenerator of the national drama, was born on the 6th of February 1788, at Tét,
                    in the county of Györ. His birth cost his mother her life, which unfortunate
                    circumstance preyed upon the father’s mind and caused him to view the child with
                    feelings akin to aversion. The austerity of his father and the loss of his
                    mother were, however, in a great measure made amends for to Kâroly by the love
                    of his elder sister Teréz, who tended him during his early years with maternal
                    care, and remained devoted to him through his whole life. In 1799 he was sent to
                    the gymnasium at Györ (Raab), where he made only moderate progress in his
                    studies, whilst the impetuosity of his disposition often involved him in
                    trouble. Placed as a cadet in Duke Eszterhâzy’s regiment in 1804, he saw a good
                    deal of service, rising to the rank of captain. In 1811 he quitted the army with
                    the intention of marrying. Offended at this step, his father withdrew from him
                    all support, and his affianced bride rejected him upon finding him at variance
                    with his father. His sister, then the wife of Captain Gâbor Farkas, offered him
                    an asylum in her home, where he remained during the winter of 1811-12; but,
                    unwilling to eat the bread of dependence, Kâroly removed to Pest and afterwards
                    to Vienna, where he tried to live by his skill in painting. He at this time
                    began assiduously to study the works of Shakespeare, Schiller, and Lessing,
                    became a frequent visitor at the Vienna theatre, and made the acquaintance of
                    its official poet Theodore Körner, whose drama <hi rend="italic">Zrvnyi</hi> was
                    written at Kisfaludy’s suggestion. Rendered impatient by ill success, he soon
                    left Vienna, and <pb break="no"

                    through Germany, Switzerland, France, and Italy as far as Rome, obtaining as
                    before a precarious livelihood as an artist. At length subdued by misfortune,
                    and longing for his home and a more honourable career, he in 1817 sought by the
                    aid of his sister reconciliation with his father, who, though still hard to be
                    entreated, allowed him a slight pecuniary assistance. Although not without
                    friends at Pest, where he now took up his abode, he continued to support himself
                    by his brush until the spring of 1819. It was on the 3d of May in this year that
                    the successful performance at Pest of his national drama, in five acts, <hi
                        rend="italic">The Tatars in Hungary,</hi> placed the name of Kâroly
                    Kisfaludy on the roll of literary fame. It was rapidly followed by other dramas,
                    all of which met with popular favour. Not only was he now admired by his own
                    countrymen, but by means of the German translations of Gaal in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Theater</hi><hi rend="italic">der Magyaren</hi> (Brünn, 1820)
                    he soon became known abroad. Freed from pecuniary embarrassment, Kâroly
                    Kisfaludy was now able to devote his best energies to literature, poetry, and
                    the drama. In 1822 he started an annual under the name ef <hi rend="italic"
                        >Aurora,</hi> which he continued to edit until the year of his death.
                    Although its success was great and his popularity continued to increase, he
                    became ever more and more critical with regard to his own productions; and, if
                    his earlier pieces must be regarded rather as the outcome of natural talent than
                    as the result of matured consideration, his later productions bear evidence to
                    the high culture of his mental powers. In recognition of his exceptional
                    literary merit, he was in 1826 rewarded with the prize of the Marczibânyi
                    foundation; about this time also he came into possession of the estate at Tét
                    through the death of his father. Towards the close of 1829 his health began to
                    fail, and, though he rallied for a time, consumption, accelerated by the news of
                    his sister’s death, brought his career to a close on the 21st November 1830, at
                    the early age of forty-two, while his friends were rejoicing at the tidings of
                    his election as a member of the Hungarian academy of sciences. The first edition
                    of his collected works was published by Toldy in 10 vols. (Buda, 1831). To the

                    of 1872, we are indebted for many of the foregoing particulars.</p>
