                <p><label type="entry">KERTCH</label>, the ancient l’anticapaeon, a seaport town of
                    Russia in the government of Taurida, situated at the eastern extremity of the
                    Crimea, on the Cimmerian Bosphorus (Strait of Yenikale or Strait of Kertch). It
                    is 133 miles north-east of Simpheropol and 50 miles from Theodosia, in 45° 21'
                    N. lat. and 36° 30' E. long. Like most towns built by ancient Greek colonists,
                    it occupies a beautiful situation clustering round the foot and climbing the
                    sides of the hill (now named after Mithradates) on which stood the ancient
                    acropolis. In 1876 it contained twelve churches (including one Catholic and one
                    Armenian), two synagogues, and a mosque, a local bank, two hospitals (one at
                    Yenikale), three prisons, two gymnasiums, and a “noble maidens’ institute.” The
                    church of John the Baptist, which, according to an inscription, was founded in
                    717</p>
                <p>A. D., presents a good example of the purely Byzantine style of architecture. The
                    church of Alexander Nevski was formerly the famous Kertch museum of local
                    antiquities, founded in 1825. The more valuable objects were afterwards removed
                    to the Hermitage at St Petersburg, and those which remained were wantonly
                    scattered during the English occupation of the town. The present “museum” is a
                    small collection in a private house. Among the products of local industry are
                    leather, tobacco, cement, beer, aerated waters, lime, candles, and soap.
                    Fish-curing is carried on, and there are steam saw-mills and flour-mills.
                    Previous to the deepening of the Strait of Yenikale so as to admit vessels
                    drawing 17 feet of water (1876), the harbour was visited by a large number of
                    vessels which now pass on to the Azoff ports. The imports comprise coal, wines,
                    olive oil, &amp;c.; and grain, fish, linseed, rapeseed, wool, and hides are
                    exported. The harbour was improved by dredging at the same time as the strait. A
                    promenade extends along the sea-wall, and beyond the town lie public gardens.
                    About 6 miles to the north-east is the town and old Turkish fortress of
                    Yenikale, which is united with Kertch to form a separate administrative circle
                    or mayoralty, including, according to the surveys of 1843-44, an area of 42,103
                    acres. In 1876 the population of Kertch, exclusive of the temporary garrison of
                    13,745, amounted to 21,211.</p>
                <p>The Greek colony of Panticapaeon was founded about the middle of the 6th century
                    B.C., by the people of Miletus. From about 438</p>
                <p>B. c. till the conquest of this region by Mithradates the Great about 100 B.c.,
                    the town and territory formed the so-called kingdom of the Bosphorus, ruled over
                    by an independent dynasty. Phanacer, the son of Mithradates, became the founder
                    of a new line under the protection of the Romans, which continued to exist till
                    the middle of the 4th century A. D., and extended their power over the maritime
                    parts of the Tauris. After this time the town—which had already begun to be
                    known as Bosphora or Bospora—passed into the hands of the Eastern empire, of the
                    Khazars, and of various barbarian tribes. In 1318 the Tartars, who had come into
                    possession in the previous century, ceded the town to the Genoese, who soon
                    raised it into new importance as a commercial centre. They usually called the
                    place Cerchio, by a corruption of the Russian name K’rtcheff (whence Kertch),
                    which appears in the 11th century inscription of Tmutorokansk. Under the Turks,
                    whose rule dates from the end of the 15th century, Kertch was a military port:
                    and as such it plays a part in the Russo-Turkish wars. Captured by the Russians
                    under Dolgorakoff in 1771, it was ceded to them along with Yenikale by the peace
                    of Kertchuk-Kainardji, and it became a great centre of Russian naval activity.
                    Its importance <pb break="no"

                    and Taganrog; and in 1820 the fortress was dismantled. Opened to foreign
                    commerce and made a quarantine station, it attained a certain degree of
                    prosperity, but again suffered severely during the Crimean War.</p>
                <p>Archaeologically Kertch is of particular interest, the kurgans or sepulchral
                    mounds of the town and vicinity having yielded a rich variety of the most
                    beautiful works of art. Since 1825 (the date of Blaramberg’s discoveries) a
                    large number of tombs have been opened. In the so-called Zolotai (z.e., Golden)
                    kurgan, or Abtrim-oba, was found a great stone vault similar in style to an
                    Egyptian pyramid; and within, among many objects of minor note, were golden
                    dishes adorned with griffins and beautiful arabesques. In the Kul-oba, or Mound
                    of Cinders (opened in 1830-31 by Dubrux), was a similar tomb, in which were
                    found what would appear to be remains of one of the kings of the Bosphorus, of
                    his queen, his horse, and his groom. The ornaments and furniture were of the
                    most costly kind; the king’s bow and buckler were of gold; his very whip
                    intertwined with gold; the queen had golden diadems, necklace, and
                    breast-jewels, and at her feet lay a golden vase. In the Pavlovskoi kurgan
                    (opened in 1858) was the tomb of a Greek lady, containing among other articles
                    of dress and decoration a pair of fine leather boots (a unique discovery) and a
                    beautiful vase on which is painted the return of Persephone from Hades and the
                    setting out of Triptolemus for Attica. In a neighbouring tomb was what is
                    believed to be “the oldest Greek mural painting which has come down to us,”
                    dating probably from the 4th century B.c. Among the minor objects discovered in
                    the kurgans perhaps the most noteworthy are the fragments of engraved boxwood,
                    the only examples known of the art taught by the Sicyonian painter
                    Pamphilus.</p>
