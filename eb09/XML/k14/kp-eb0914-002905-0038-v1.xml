                    Laminarias yield what is termed drift-weed kelp, obtainable only when cast up on
                    the coasts by storms or other causes. The species of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fucus,</hi> on the other hand, growing within the tidal range, are cut from
                    the rocks at low water, and are therefore known as cut-weeds. In the preparation
                    of kelp, the weeds are first dried in the sun, and are then collected into
                    shallow pits on the ground and burned till they form a fused mass, which while
                    still hot is sprinkled with water in order to break it up into convenient
                    pieces. A ton of kelp is obtained from 20 to 22 tons of wet sea-weed. The
                    average composition may vary as follows :—sulphate of potash, 10 to 12 per
                    cent.; potassium chloride, 20 to 25 per cent.; sodium carbonate, 5 per cent.;
                    other soda and magnesia salts, 15 to 20 per cent.; and insoluble ash from 40 to
                    50 per cent. The relative richness in iodine of different samples varies
                    largely, good drift kelp yielding as much as 10 to 15 lb per ton of 22⅛ cwts.,
                    whilst cut-weed kelp will not give more than 3 to 4 ff&gt;. The rude manner in
                    which kelp is prepared causes much of the iodine to be volatilized; but Mr E. C.
                    C. Stanford has successfully introduced a process for treating sea-weeds by
                    destructive distillation, whereby the whole of that valuable body is saved. See

                <p>Previous to the introduction of the Leblanc process for the manufacture of sodium
                    carbonate, kelp was the principal source of that substance, as well as a source
                    of potassium salts, and consequently was a raw material of much importance in
                    chemical industries. About the beginning of the 19th century the value of the
                    kelp prepared on the coast and islands of the west of Scotland was not less than
                    £400,000 per annum, representing 20,000 tons of kelp. With the gradual
                    introduction and improvement of the Leblanc process, and the reduction of the
                    duty on salt and other causes, the value of kelp decreased from £20 and upwards
                    to about £2 a ton, a price altogether unremunerative. Towards the middle of the
                    century, however, a new impetus was given to the trade by the rise of the
                    manufacture of iodine, of which kelp was at first the only commercial source.
                    The introduction of Chili saltpetre <hi rend="italic">(caliche)</hi> as a source
                    of iodine, and the development of the Stassfurth salt-mines for the production
                    of potash salts, have in their turn had a depressing influence on the kelp
                    manufacture, and it is only by the most careful utilization of all the salts
                    contained in the kelp, and the use of most approved methods of preparing the
                    material, that the industry is continued as a remunerative undertaking. The
                    production of kelp in the British Islands varies greatly from year to year. It
                    may be stated to average about 7000 tons, at a value of about £4 per ton.
                    Two-thirds of this quantity is produced in Ireland, and the remainder on the
                    Scottish coast and islands. The quantity produced in France is probably now
                    somewhat less than the British yield.</p>
