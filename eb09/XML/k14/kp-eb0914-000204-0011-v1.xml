                    Jewish sect of the Middle Ages, claiming to be distinguished by adherence to
                    Scripture as contrasted with oral tradition, whence the name (from K"∣p, as if
                    “readers,” <hi rend="italic">scripturarii·,</hi> sometimes also N∏ρo 'J5). They
                    have frequently been identified with the Sadducees or with the Samaritans, with
                    neither of whom have they any historical connexion or much spiritual affinity.
                    The schism arose at Baghdad about the middle of the 8th century, when the
                    hereditary claims of Anan, a learned Talmudist, to the office of Resh Galutha
                    were set aside by the Gaonim or heads of rabbinical schools at Sura and
                    Pumbeditha because he was believed to undervalue the authority of the Talmud. An
                    appeal by Anan to the caliph proved unsuccessful, and he appears even to have
                    been. imprisoned for some time; but ultimately he was permitted to migrate along
                    with his followers to Palestine, where they erected in Jerusalem a synagogue
                    which continued to be maintained until the time of the crusades. From this
                    centre the sect diffused itself thinly over Syria, spread into Egypt, and
                    ultimately reached south-eastern Europe. Anan, who is said to have died in 765
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">a,d.,</hi> was the author of a commentary on the
                    Pentateuch and other works in Talmudic Hebrew and Arabic,—all of which
                    unfortunately are lost; for our knowledge of the distinctive principles
                    maintained by him we are thus left entirely dependent on the hostile indications
                    of opponents. In general we know that he showed great bitterness against the
                    Talmud and its upholders (the “Rabbanites ”) for their falsification of the
                    written law by arbitrary additions and subtractions, but there is nothing to
                    indicate that he himself had the insight or the fervour by which he could have
                    become the pioneer of any really great reformation in religion or morals. The
                    questions in dispute appear to have turned entirely on points of very minute
                    detail. Several of them related to the regulation of the calendar, the new moon,
                    for example, being fixed by the Karaites by direct observation, not by
                    astronomical calculation, and the intercalary year also being determined
                    empirically; others related to paschal and pentecostal ritual, such as the
                    precise hour for killing the lamb or for burning its remains. The differences
                    which affected social life most deeply were those relating to Sabbath observance
                    and the forbidden degrees of marriage, the Karaites not recognizing any
                    distinction between relationships of consanguinity and those of affinity, while
                    in their zeal to avoid all risk of infringement of the sacredness of the day of
                    rest they prohibited the burning of any light at all in their houses from sunset
                    to sunset. Little information as to the Karaites can be derived from their
                    liturgies, which are comparatively modern; though differing from those used by
                    the Rabbinical Jews, they are not characterized by any marked divergence in
                    principle. The controversies as to the rule of faith which so deeply divided the
                    Christian church in the 16th century gave to this obscure sect an illusory and
                    passing importance, the Catholics frequently hurling the epithet Karaei, in
                    token of contempt, at the Protestants, who in their turn willingly accepted it
                    as sufficiently descriptive of their attitude towards Scripture. The Karaites
                    never have been numerous; the present community in Jerusalem numbers only about
                    ten families. They occur in Constantinople and elsewhere in Turkey, but are
                    chiefly met with in southern Russia, and especially in the Crimea, where in 1874
                    they numbered some 6000, chiefly in Eupatoria, Theodosia, and Sebastopol. In the
                    Crimea their historical capital and chief synagogue was formerly the
                    “Jews’Castle” (Tshufut-Kale), near Bakhchisarai. The place is now deserted; its
                    cemetery was the seat of Firkowitsch’s notorious forgeries (inscriptions of 1st
                    century), by which he sought to establish a fabulous antiquity for his sect.
                    According to Strack <hi rend="italic">(A. Firkowitsch u. seine</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Entdeckungen,</hi> 1876) the oldest tombstones do not go back
                    beyond the 14th century. The modern Karaites are generally well spoken of for
                    their honesty, perseverance, and simple habits of life; but their enslavement to
                    tradition is quite as complete as that of any Talmudist could possibly be.</p>
