                        <hi rend="italic">Cassovia),</hi> an ancient royal free town, and capital of
                    the cis-Tisian county of Abauj, Hungary, is pleasantly situated on the right
                    bank of the Hernâd, in a valley surrounded by sloping vineyards, about 130 miles
                    north-east from Budapest, with which city, as also with Cracow, Lemberg, and
                    other centres, it is connected by railway, 48° 42' N. lat., 21° 17' E. long.
                    Kaschau is the see of a Roman Catholic bishop suffragan of Eger (Erlau), the
                    headquarters of the general administration for the county, and has royal and
                    magisterial courts of law, as well as boards of assay, finance, and postal
                    direction, and the supervision of the tobacco manufacture. Kaschau is one of the
                    best built towns in Hungary, and consists of the inner town, intersected by the
                    Csermel, which forms an island and is crossed by several bridges, and three
                    suburbs (upper, middle, and lower) approached by a broad glacis. The most
                    remarkable edifice, considered the grandest masterpiece of architectural skill
                    in Hungary, is the cathedral of St Elizabeth, situated in the great square, and
                    built in a faultless Gothic style. Commenced about 1270 by Stephen V., the
                    structure was continued 1324-82 by Queen Elizabeth, wife of Charles I., and her
                    son Louis I., and finished about 1468, in the reign of Matthias I. (Corvinus).
                    The interior was transformed in the 18th century to the Renaissance style, and
                    restored in 1859-65. The church of St Michael and the Franciscan or Garrison
                    church date from the 13th century. The royal law academy, founded in 1659, and
                    sanctioned by golden bull of King Leopold I. in 1660, has an extensive library;
                    there are also a museum, a Roman Catholic upper gymnasium and seminary for
                    priests, and other schools and benevolent institutions. Kaschau is the centre of
                    the trade for the surrounding counties in wine, gall-nuts, salt, and most
                    descriptions of grain, and from its commercial importance forms a kind of
                    provincial capital. About 3 miles north-west of the town are the baths of Banké,
                    with alkaline and ferruginous springs. The population of Kaschau in 1880
                    amounted to 26,422 (in 1870 it was 21,742), consisting of Magyars, Germans,
                    Slovaks, and Ruthens. The majority are Roman Catholics.</p>
                <p>Kaschau consisted originally of two villages, Upper and Lower Kassa, of which the
                    latter was created a town and granted special privileges by Béla IV. (1235).
                    Under Stephen V. (1270) the two separate portions λvere united, and raised to
                    the rank of a royal free town. In 1290 it was surrounded with walls. The
                    subsequent history presents a long record of revolts, sieges, and disastrous
                    conflagrations. In 1430 the plague earned off a great number of the inhabitants.
                    In 1458 the right of minting money according to the pattern and value of the
                    Buda coinage was granted to the municipality by King Matthias I. The bishopric
                    was established in 1804. In the revolutionary war of 1848-49 the Hungarians were
                    twice defeated before the walls of Kaschau by the Austrians under General
                    Schlick, and the town was held successively by the Austrians, Hungarians, and
                    Russians.</p>
