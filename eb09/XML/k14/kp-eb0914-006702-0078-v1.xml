                <p><label type="entry">KHOTAN</label>, a city and district of eastern Turkestan,
                    lying between the northern slopes of the Kuenlun mountains and the eastern
                    portion of the Gobi (Takla Makan) desert. The district is well watered by a
                    number of rivers, the most important of which, the Karakash and the Khotan
                    Daria, meet to the north of the city. Both soil and climate are excellent, and
                    the vegetation is characterized at once by variety and luxuriance. Indian corn,
                    barley, jowar, buckwheat, rice, olives, pears, peaches, apricots, mulberries,
                    grapes, currants, melons, the charas plant, the cotton plant, are all produced
                    in abundance. Willows, poplars, and tamarisks are the ordinary trees; in some
                    parts they form extensive forests. Of the mineral wealth of the country glowing
                    accounts are given,—gold, copper, iron, antimony, salt, sulphur, coal, jade, and
                    a variety of precious stones being the principal items. Upwards of twenty gold
                    mines are known to exist, and those of Sorghak and Kappa are worked by 4000 and
                    3000 men respectively. Jade is obtained, more especially in the Karakash
                    district. Among the wild animals are goats, wolves, jackals, foxes, and hares;
                    and the Khotanese keep camels, horses, mules, asses, goats, sheep, geese, ducks,
                    and fowls (the goats and the fowls being particularly numerous). The total
                    number of the inhabitants is variously estimated at from 130,000 to 250,000, and
                    the country is capable of maintaining a much denser population. Females
                    preponderate to as much as 25 per cent. There are six districts, each with a
                    town of its name—Khotan or Ilchi (42,000), Karakash (7000), Yurung Kush (7000),
                    Tchira (28,000), Kiria (28,000), and Naya (3500). The city of Khotan (in Chinese
                    Hu-tan, locally Ilchi) is situated 150 miles south-east of Yarkand and 90 miles
                    due east of Sanju, and is only 6 miles distant from the borders of the desert.
                    It has long been celebrated as a great industrial centre, silks, felts, rich
                    carpets (of either silk or wool), paper, and articles in jade being the chief
                    productions; and its traders maintain an active traffic with Tibet.</p>
                <p>As early as the 1st century the town contained (according to Chinese authorities)
                    3300 families. Cotan, as he calls it, was one of the places visited by Marco
                    Polo. In modern times the first European who reached the city was Mr Johnson in
                    1865. At that time it was governed by a local khan, the Chinese having been
                    expelled by their Mohammedan subjects, in 1863; and since then it has been
                    subjugated by Yakub Khan of Kashgar (who perpetrated a terrible massacre at his
                    capture of the place), and again recovered by the Chinese forces.</p>
