                        Jacques</hi></label> (1783-1865), commonly called Dupin the Elder, a
                    celebrated French advocate, president of the Chamber of Deputies and of the
                    Legislative Assembly, was born at Varzy, in Nièvre, on the 1st February 1783. He
                    was educated by his father, who was a lawyer of eminence, and at an early age he
                    became principal clerk of an attorney at Paris. On the establishment of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Academie</hi><hi rend="italic">de Legislation</hi> he entered
                    it as pupil from Nièvre. In 1800 he was made advocate, and in 1802, when the
                    schools of law were opened, he received successively the degrees of licentiate
                    and doctor from the new faculty. He was in 1810 an unsuccessful candidate for
                    the chair of law at Paris, and in 1811 he also failed to obtain the office of
                    advocate-general at the court of cassation. About this time he was added to the
                    commission charged with the classification of the laws of the empire, and, after
                    the interruption caused by the events of 1814 and 1815, was charged with the
                    sole care of that great work. When he entered the Chamber of Deputies in 1815 he
                    at once took an active part in the debates, and strenuously opposed the election
                    of the son of Napoleon as emperor after his father’s abdication. At the election
                    after the second restoration Dupin was not re-elected. He defended with great
                    intrepidity the principal political victims of the reaction, among others, in
                    conjunction with Berryer, Marshal Ney; and in October 1815 boldly published a
                    tractate entitled <hi rend="italic">Libre</hi><hi rend="italic">Défense</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">des Accuses.</hi> In 1827 he was again elected a member of the
                    Chamber of Deputies, and in 1830 took part in counselling the revolution, and in
                    exhorting the citizens to resistance. In August of that year he became a member
                    of Louis Philippe’s cabinet, and more than any one else contributed to the
                    formation of the new <hi rend="italic">régime.</hi> At the end of 1832 he became
                    president of the chamber, which office he held succesively for eight years. On
                    Louis Philippe’s abdication in 1848 Dupin introduced the young count of Paris
                    into the chamber, and proposed him as king with the duchess of Orleans as
                    regent. This attempt failed, but Dupin submitted to circumstances, and,
                    retaining the office of <hi rend="italic">procureur-général,</hi> his first act
                    was to decide that justice should henceforth be rendered to the “name of the
                    French people.” In 1849 he was elected a member of the Assembly, and became
                    president of the principal committee—that on legislation. After the <hi
                        rend="italic">coup d'etat</hi> of 2d December 1851 he still retained his
                    office of <hi rend="italic">procureur-général,</hi> and did not demit it till
                    effect was given to the decrees confiscating the property of the house of
                    Orleans. In 1857 he was offered his old office by the emperor, and accepted it,
                    explaining his acceptance in a discourse, a sentence of which may be employed to
                    describe his whole political career. “I have always,” he said, “belonged to
                    France and never to parties.” He died 8th November 1865. Among Dupin’s works,
                    which are numerous, may be mentioned <hi rend="italic">Principia</hi><hi
