                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0392-0373"/> Cicely, daughter of Sir John Baker of
                    Sissinghurst in Kent, and in 1557 he entered public life as member of parliament
                    for Westmoreland. In the following year he sat for East Grinstead in Sussex, and
                    the record of his activity is still to be found in the Journals of the House of
                    Commons. Queen Elizabeth, who had just come to the throne, was attracted by the
                    handsome person, high culture, and evident ability of her young poet-kinsman,
                    who was accordingly, to quote his own words, “selected to a continual private
                    attendance upon her own person,” which did not, however, prevent him from
                    appearing again in the Parliament of 1563 as member for Aylesbury in
                    Buckinghamshire. A visit to the Continent in 1565 was interrupted by an
                    unexplained imprisonment at Rome, and terminated by the news of his father’s
                    death, which took place on 21st April 1566. On his return he was knighted in the
                    queen’s presence, and obtained the title of Lord Buckhurst, by which he
                    continued to be known through the most of his life. Apartments were provided for
                    him in the queen’s palace at Shene, where his mother was in charge; but the
                    simplicity of his mode of life is shown by the fact that, when in 1568 he had to
                    entertain Odet de Coligni, Cardinal de Châtillon, at the queen’s command, he
                    failed to satisfy the luxurious desires of his guest, and thus fell under her
                    majesty’s displeasure. In 1571 he was sent to France to congratulate Charles IX.
                    on his marriage with Elizabeth of Austria; in 1572 he was one of the peers who
                    tried Thomas Howard, earl of Norfolk; and in 1586 he was employed to convey to
                    Queen Mary of Scotland the sentence of death. A more difficult task was found
                    for him in 1587; as ambassador to the Hague he was expected “to expostulate in
                    favour of peace with a people who knew that their existence depended on war, to
                    reconcile those to delay who felt that delay was death, and to heal animosities
                    between men who were enemies from their cradles to their graves.” With what
                    fearlessness, fidelity, and sagacity he discharged his duty, has been told in
                    detail by the historian of <hi rend="italic">The United Netherlands,</hi> who
                    asserts that there is not a single line in all the ambassador’s correspondence
                    which does not reflect honour on his name. But his expostulations with the queen
                    on her parsimonious policy, and his independent conduct towards the royal
                    favourite Leicester, procured him, on his return to England, instead of
                    approbation and reward for his services, an order confining him to his house for
                    nine or ten months in token of her majesty’s displeasure. On the death of the
                    earl, however, he was again received into favour; in 1588 he was presented with
                    the Order of the Garter; in 1591 he was elected chancellor of the university of
                    Oxford, his claims having been supported by a royal letter; and, in 1599, on the
                    death of Lord Burghley, he succeeded to the office of Lord High Treasurer of
                    England. In the following year he had to pronounce sentence as High Steward on
                    the earl of Essex, who had been his rival for the chancellorship and his
                    opponent in politics. The change of the dynasty which took place in 1603 left
                    his position unimpaired; his office of Lord Treasurer was confirmed to him by
                    King James, and on 13th of March 1604, he was created earl of Dorset. He died
                    suddenly on April 19th 1608, while sitting at the council table in Whitehall,
                    and left his earldom to his son Robert Sackville.</p>
                <p>In the history of English literature Thomas Sackville occupies an honourable
                    position. We no longer possess any of the “sonnets finely sauced” for which, in
                    his student days, he was praised by Jasper Heywood, but we may still read the
                        <hi rend="italic">Ferrex and Porrex</hi> by which he takes rank as the first
                    writer of genuine English tragedy, the <hi rend="italic">Induction to the Mirror
                        oſ Magistrates,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Complaint of Henry Duke of
                        Buckingham.</hi> The first was written with the assistance of Thomas Norton,
                    during Sackville ’ s connection with the Inner Temple, was acted before Queen
                    Elizabeth in 1561, appeared without the author’s permission in 1565, and again
                    in authorized editions in 1570-1 and 1590. The second is a stately allegorical
                    poem of the kind so much in vogue in the reign of Elizabeth, with elaborate
                    personifications of sorrow, death, old age, &lt;kc., intended to stand as
                    preface to a series of poems descriptive of the tragic fates of famous men; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Complaint</hi> was to form the first of the series. They
                    all display a lively fancy, and no small command of pure and sonorous English,
                    but hardly awaken any regret that the author soon laid aside the poet’s for the
                    diplomatist’s pen.</p>
