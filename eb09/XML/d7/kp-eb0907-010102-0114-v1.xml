                <p><label type="entry">DEPTFORD</label>, a town of England situated at the junction
                    of the Ravensbourne with the Thames, 3∣ miles east of London Bridge. It forms
                    the western portion of the parliamentary borough of Greenwich, occupying an area
                    of about 1650 acres, situated mostly in the county of Kent, and partly in
                    Surrey. It comprises two parishes—that of St Nicholas, including Lower Deptford
                    on the Thames, and St Paul’s, or the landward part of the town, which extends
                    into Surrey and includes Hatcham Manor. Lower Deptford consists of irregular
                    narrow streets, and the houses are mostly of a mean description. It contains the
                    site of the old dockyard, and the royal victualling yard is also situated there.
                    The former was discontinued as a dockyard in 1869; it was filled up and
                    converted into a foreign cattle market by the corporation of London, but this
                    was given up in 1873. The victualling yard immediately to the west of it is the
                    most important establishment of its kind in the kingdom, supplying the navy with
                    provisions, medicines, furniture, &lt;fcc., which are manufactured or stored in
                    the large warehouses that constitute the establishment. As many as 500 hands are
                    employed in the warehouses and at the lading wharf. The only other industrial
                    employment of importance in the place is to be found in the engineering works,
                    which are carried on near the river. Of public buildings the most noteworthy are
                    St Nicholas Church, with a square embattled tower, built on the site of an older
                    structure at the beginning of the last century, and St Paul’s, of classic
                    design, erected in 1730. There is also the hospital for master mariners,
                    maintained by the corporation of the Trinity House, which was originated here.
                    Of the mansion known as Sayes Court, with which Deptford is historically
                    identified, nothing now remains but the garden. The house—taken down in 1729—
