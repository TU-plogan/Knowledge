                    (1823-1864), a Brazilian poet and historian, was born at the little town of
                    Caxias, in Maranhão, with the charms of which he has made his readers familiar.
                    From the university of Coimbra, in Portugal, he returned to his native country
                    well-equipped with legal lore, and obtained an official appointment at Maranhão;
                    but the literary tendency which was strong <pb break="no"

                    author at Rio de Janeiro. Here he wrote for the newspaper press, ventured to
                    appear as a dramatist, and at last in 1846 established his reputation by a
                    volume of poems— <hi rend="italic">Primieros Cantos—</hi> which appealed to the
                    national feelings of his Brazilian readers, were remarkable for their
                    autobiographic impress, and by their beauty of expression and rhythm placed
                    their author at the head of the lyric poets of his country. In 1848 he followed
                    up his success by <hi rend="italic">Secundos Cantos e sex</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Tillιas</hi><hi rend="italic">de Frei Antão,</hi> in which, as the title
                    indicates, he puts a number of the pieces in the mouth of a simple old Dominican
                    friar; and in the following year, in fulfilment of the duties of his new post as
                    professor of Brazilian history in the imperial college of Pedro IL, he published
                    an edition of Berredo, and added a sketch of the migrations of the Indian
                    tribes. A third volume of poems, which appeared with the title of <hi
                        rend="italic">Ultimos</hi><hi rend="italic">Cantos</hi> in 1850, was
                    practically the poet’s farewell to Rio de Janeiro and the service of the muse,
                    for he spent the next eight years engaged under Government patronage in
                    obtaining a personal acquaintance with the scientific institutions of Europe,
                    was appointed on his return to Brazil a member of an expedition for the
                    exploration of the province of Ceara, was forced in 1862 by the state of his
                    health to try the effects of another visit to Europe, and died in September 1864
                    on board the vessel that was bearing him once again to his native shores. While
                    in Germany he published at Leipsic a complete collection of his lyrical poems,
                    which has since gone through several editions; the four first cantos of an epic
                    poem called <hi rend="italic">Os Tymbiros</hi> (1857); and a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Diccionario da lingua Tupy</hi> (1858). To the publications of the Rio de
                    Janeiro Geographical and Historical Institute he contributed a number of papers,
                    among which the one on <hi rend="italic">Brazil and Oceania</hi> has received
                    special notice. A complete edition of the works of Dias has made its appearance
                    at Rio de Janeiro. See Francisco Sutero in the <hi rend="italic">Rivistan
