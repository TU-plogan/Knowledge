                <p><label type="entry">DOG-FISH</label>, a name applied to several species of the
                    smaller sharks, and given in common with such names as hound and beagle, owing
                    to the habit these fishes have of pursuing or hunting their prey in packs. The
                    Small-spotted Dog-fish or Rough Hound <hi rend="italic">(Scyllium</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">canicula)</hi> and the Large-spotted or Nurse Hound <hi
                        rend="italic">(Scyllium catulus)</hi> are also known as ground-sharks. They
                    keep near the sea bottom, feeding chiefly on the smaller fishes and Crustacea;
                    and causing great annoyance to the fishermen by the readiness with which they
                    take bait. They differ from the majority of sharks, and resemble the rays in
                    being ovoviviparous. Their young are brought forth inclosed in semi-transparent
                    horny cases, known on the British coasts as <hi rend="italic">mermaids'
                        purses,</hi> and these have tendril-like prolongations from each of the four
                    corners, by means of which they are moored to sea-weed or some other fixed
                    object near the shore, until the young dog-fish is ready to make its exit. The
                    larger of these species attains a length of 4 to 5 feet, the smaller rarely more
                    than 30 inches. The Picked Dog fish <hi rend="italic">{Acanthias</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">mdgaris)</hi> is pre-eminently <hi rend="italic">the</hi>
                    dog-fish. It is the smallest and most abundant of the British sharks, and occurs
                    in the temperate seas of both northern and southern hemispheres. It rarely
                    attains a length of two feet, the female, as in most sharks, being larger than
                    the male. The body is round and tapering, the snout projects, and the mouth is
                    placed far under. There are two dorsal fins, each of which is armed on its
                    anterior edge with a sharp and slightly curved spine, hence its name “picked.”
                    In order to strike with these spines the fish first bends itself into a bow, and
                    by a quick motion causes them to spring asunder in opposite directions, seldom
                    failing thus to strike the object aimed at. The dog-fish is exceedingly
                    prolific, the female, according to Couch, producing young almost daily for 9 or
                    10 months in the year. These are not contained in egg cases, as in the
                    ground-sharks, but are produced alive. It is gregarious, and is abundant at all
                    seasons everywhere on the British coasts. In 1858 an enormous scull of dog-fish,
                    many square miles in extent, appeared in the north of Scotland, when, says
                    Couch, “they were to be found floating in myriads on the surface of every
                    harbour.” They are the special enemies of the fisherman, injuring his nets,
                    removing the hooks from his lines, and spoiling his fish for the market by
                    biting pieces out of them as they hang on his lines. Still greater injury is
                    caused to the fisheries in the wholesale destruction of small fishes by this
                    predacious species. They are, however, eaten, both fresh and salted, by
                    fishermen, especially on the west coast of England.</p>
