                    theologian, was bom in the parish of St Austell, in Cornwall, March 3, 1765. His

                    not afford to send him to school long enough even to learn to read and write. At
                    the age of seven he lost his mother, a woman of superior mind and religious
                    character; and he was then sent to work with the tinners. At ten he was
                    apprenticed to a shoemaker, and at twenty he settled in the town of St Austell,
                    first as manager for a shoemaker; and about three years later he began business
                    on his own account. He had already gained a reputation in his narrow circle as a
                    keen debater and a jovial companion. He was first aroused to serious thought by
                    the preaching of Adam Clarke; and the impression thus produced was deepened by
                    the death of his elder brother. He now joined the Methodists, was soon employed
                    as a class leader and local preacher, and continued to preach till a few months
                    before his death. His opportunities of gaining knowledge were very scanty, but
                    he strenuously set himself to make the most of them. It is stated that an
                    accidental introduction to Locke’s great essay determined the ultimate direction
                    of his studies. In 1798 the first part of Paine’s <hi rend="italic">Age of
                        Reason</hi> was put into his hands; and in the following year he made his
                    first appearance as an author by publishing his <hi rend="italic">Remarks</hi>
                    on that work. The book was favourably received, and was republished in 1820.
                    Drew had begun to meditate a greater attempt before he wrote his <hi
                        rend="italic">Remarks on Paine;</hi> and the fruits of his laborious
                    investigation were given to the world in the <hi rend="italic">Essay on the
                        Immateriality and Immortality of the Soul,</hi> in 180'2. This work made him
                    widely known, and for some time it held a high place in the judgment of the
                    religious world as a powerful and conclusive argument on its subject. A fifth
                    edition appeared in 1831. Drew continued to work at his trade till 1805, when he
                    entered into an engagement which enabled him to devote himself entirely to
                    literature. In 1809 he published his <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Identity and
                        General Resurrection of the Human Body,</hi> perhaps the most original of
                    his works, which reached a second edition in 1822. In 1819 Drew removed to
                    Liverpool, on being appointed editor of the <hi rend="italic">Imperial
                        Magazine,</hi> then newly established, and in 1821 to London, the business
                    being then transferred to the capital. Here he filled the post of editor till
                    his death, and had also the supervision of all works issued from the Caxton
                    press. He was an unsuccessful competitor for a prize offered in 1811 for an
                    essay on the existence and attributes of God. The work which he then wrote, and
                    which in his own judgment was his best, was published in 1820, under the title
                    of <hi rend="italic">An Attempt to demonstrate from Reason and Revelation the
                        Necessary Existence, Essential Perfections, and Superintending Providence of
                        an Eternal Being, who is the Creator, the Supporter, and the Governor of all
                        Things</hi> (2 vols. 8vo). This procured him the degree of M. A. from the
                    university of Aberdeen. Among Drew’s lesser writings are a <hi rend="italic"
                        >Life of Dr Thomas Coke</hi> (1817), a <hi rend="italic">History of
                        Cornwall</hi> (1824), and a work on the divinity of Christ (1813). He died
                    at Helston, in Cornwall, March 29, 1833. A memoir of his life by his eldest son
                    appeared in 1834.</p>
