                            Count</hi></label> (1798-1852), a celebrated leader of society in Paris
                    and London, who added to the attractions of dandyism those of high intellectual
                    and artistic gifts, was born at Paris in 1798. He was the son of General
                    D’Orsay, from whom he inherited the exceptionally handsome person which
                    contributed so much to his social success. Through his mother he was grandson by
                    a morganatic marriage of the king of Wurtemberg. In his youth he entered the
                    French army, and served as a <hi rend="italic">garde du corps of</hi> Louis
                    XVIII. In 1822, while stationed at Valence on the Rhone, he formed that
                    acquaintance with the earl of Blessington and his family which affected the
                    whole course of his future life. The acquaintance quickly ripened into intimacy,
                    and at the invitation of the earl he accompanied the party on their tour through
                    Italy. In the spring of 1823 he met Lord Byron at Genoa, and the published
                    correspondence of the poet at this period contains numerous referenβes to the
                    count’s gifts and accomplishments, and to his peculiar relationship to the
                    Blessington family. A diary which D’Orsay had kept during a visit to London in
                    1821-2 was submitted to Byron’s inspection, and was much praised by him for the
                    knowledge of men and manners and the keen faculty of observation it displayed.
                    On the 4th December 1827, Count D’Orsay married Lady Harriet Gardiner, a girl of
                    fifteen, the daughter of Lord Blessington by his first wife. The union, if it
                    rendered his connection, with the Blessington family less ostensibly equivocal
                    than before.</p>

                <p>was in other respects an unhappy one, and a separation took place soon after the
                    death of Lord Blessington, which occurred in 1829. When the widowed countess
                    returned to England she was accompanied by Count D’Orsay, and the two lived
                    under the same roof, first at Seamore Place and then at Kensington Gore. Their
                    house soon became a resort of the fashionable literary and artistic society of
                    London, which found an equal attraction in host and in hostess. The count’s
                    charming manner, brilliant wit, and artistic faculty were accompanied by
                    benevolent moral qualities, which endeared him to all his associates. His skill
                    as a painter and sculptor was shown in numerous portraits and statuettes
                    representing his friends, which were marked by great vigour and truthfulness, if
                    wanting the finish that can only be reached by persistent discipline. Count
                    D’Orsay had been from his youth a zealous Bonapartist, and one of the most
                    frequent guests at Gore House was Prince Louis Napoleon. It was to Paris,
                    therefore, that he naturally resorted in 1849, after the breaking up of the
                    establishment at Gore House in consequence of his bankruptcy. The countess of
                    Blessington, who had accompanied him, died a few weeks after their arrival, and
                    he endeavoured to provide support for himself by adopting the profession of a
                    portrait painter. He was deep in the counsels of the prince president, but the
                    relation between them was less cordial after the <hi rend="italic">coup
                        dfétat,</hi> of which the count had by anticipation expressed his strong
                    disapproval. His appointment to the post of director of fine arts was announced
                    only a few days before his death, which occurred on the 4th August 1852.</p>
