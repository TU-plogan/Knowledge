                    (1748-1817), admiral, was born at Leatherhead, in Surrey, on the 28th February
                    1748. He entered the navy in 1759, and obtained his commission as lieutenant in
                    June 1770, when he was appointed to the “Princess Royal,” the flagship of
                    Admiral Byron, in which he sailed to the West Indies. While serving on board
                    this vessel he took part in the engagement with the French fleet under Count
                    D’Estaing. In July 1779 he became commander, and was appointed to the “Rover”
                    sloop; in June of the following year he atttained the rank of post-captain. Soon
                    afterwards he returned to England in charge of a convoy. The outbreak of the war
                    with France gave him hie first opportunity of obtaining marked distinction.
                    Appointed first to the “Orion” and then to the “Queen” in the Channel Fleet,
                    under the command of Lord Howe, he took part in the three days’ naval engagement
                    with the Brest fleet, which terminated in a glorious victory on the 1st June
                    1794. For his conduct on this occasion he received a gold medal and the thanks
                    of Parliament. He next proceeded to the West Indies, where he was stationed for
                    some time at St Domingo. In 1798 he commanded the “Leviathan” in the
                    Mediterranean, and had charge of the naval detachment which, in conjunction with
                    a military force, captured Minorca. Early in 1799 he was raised to the rank of
                    rear-admiral, and sent to the West Indies to succeed Lord Hugh Seymour. During
                    the voyage out he captured a valuable Spanish convoy of eleven merchantmen. In
                    March 1801 he was the naval commander of the combined force which reduced the
                    islands of St Bartholomew and St Martin, a <pb break="no"

                    order of the Bath and a pension of =£1000 a year. Promoted to be vice-admiral of
                    the blue, he was appointed in 1804 to the Jamaica station. Two years later,
                    while cruising off Cadiz with Lord Collingwood, he was detached with his
                    squadron to pursue a French fleet that had been sent to the relief of St
                    Domingo. He came up with the enemy on the 6th February 1806, and, after two
                    hours’ fighting, inflicted a signal defeat upon them, capturing three of their
                    five vessels and stranding the other two. For this, the most distinguished
                    service of his life, he received the thanks of the Jamaica Assembly, with a
                    sword of the value of a thousand guineas, the thanks of the English Parliament,
                    and the freedom of the city of London. In 1807 he was again sent to the
                    Mediterranean to watch the movements of the Turks. In command of the “Royal
                    George” he forced the passage of the Dardanelles, but sustained considerable
                    loss in effecting his return, the Turks having strengthened their position. He
                    held the command of the Newfoundland fleet for four years from 1810, and at the
                    close of that period he was made a baronet. In 1815 he was appointed to the
                    chief command at Plymouth, which he held until his death on the 14th April 1817.
