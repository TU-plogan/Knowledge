                <p><label type="entry">DRAGON</label> (δpακωr, sharp-sighted), the name given by the
                    ancients to a fabulous monster represented by them as a huge winged lizard or
                    serpent. They regarded it as the enemy of mankind, and its overthrow is made to
                    figure among the greatest exploits of the gods and heroes of heathen mythology.
                    A dragon watched the garden of the Hesperides, and its destruction formed one of
                    the seven labours of Hercules. Its existence does not seem to have been called
                    in question by the older naturalists, figures of the dragon appearing in the
                    works of Gesner and Aldrovandi, and even specimens of the monster—evidently
                    formed artificially of portions of various animals—having been exhibited. The
                    only creatures ever known to have existed, at all comparable to this imaginary
                    monster, are the Pterodactyls, remains of which are found in the Liassic and
                    Oolitic formations. These were huge reptiles, provided with true wings somewhat
                    resembling those of bats. The name “dragon” is now applied to a highly
                    interesting, but very harmless, group of small flying lizards forming the genus
                        <hi rend="italic">Draco,</hi> belonging to the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Agamidae,</hi> a family of Saurian Reptiles. They inhabit India and the
                    islands of the Malay Archipelago, and 18 species of them are known. They are
                    small creatures, measuring about 10 inches long, including the tail, which in
                    some cases is more than half of the entire length. The head is small, and the
                    throat is provided with three pouches which arc spread out when they lie on the
                    trunks of trees. They are, however, chiefly remarkable for the wing-like
                    cutaneous processes with which their sides are provided, and which are extended
                    and supported by greatly elongated ribs. These form a sort of parachute by which
                    the animals are enabled to glide from branch to branch of the trees on which
                    they reside, but, being altogether independent of the fore limbs, they cannot be
                    regarded as true wings, nor do they enable the lizard to fly, but merely to make
                    extensive leaps. When not in use they are folded by the side after the manner of
                    a fan, and the dragon can then walk or run with considerable agility. They also
                    use their wing-like expansions in clasping the branches of trees, where they are
                    fond of lying basking in the sun, and feeding on whatever insect may come in
