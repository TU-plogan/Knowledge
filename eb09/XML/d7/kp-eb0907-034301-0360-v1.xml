                        Cornelius</hi></label>, a Roman general notorious for his profligacy, was
                    born about 70 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> His vicious character made itself
                    apparent even in his early years. Before he attained his majority he is said to
                    have been more than once guilty of capital crimes, from the punishment of which
                    he was only delivered through the advocacy of Cicero. In the year 50 he forced
                    his wife Fabia to leave him, and married Tullia, the daughter of Cicero, who
                    strongly opposed the union. Dolabella’s motive in establishing this connection
                    was to prevent Cicero from giving evidence in favour of Appius Claudius, whom he
                    had accused of having violated the sovereign rights of the people. In the
                    following year, his numerous creditors having become clamorous, he was forced to
                    quit Rome, and betook himself to the camp of Caesar, to the great regret of his
                    father-in-law. During Caesar’s absence in Spain, Dolabella commanded the fleet
                    in the Adriatic, but he did not gain any distinction. He took part in the battle
                    of Pharsalus (48), after which he returned to Rome, in the expectation, delusive
                    as it proved, that Caesar would give him a substantial reward for his services,
                    and so enable him to pay his debts. To gain immunity from the urgent demands of
                    his creditors, he procured his election to the tribuneship, which he had no
                    sooner done than he introduced a bill <hi rend="italic">(rogatio)</hi> proposing
                    that all debts should be cancelled. This was strongly resisted by his
                    colleagues, and two parties were formed, between whom more than one bloody
                    encounter took place in the streets of the city. On Caesar’s return from
                    Alexandria he saw the expediency of removing Dolabella from Rome, and
                    accordingly took him as one of his generals in the expedition to Africa and
                    Spain. Dolabella was ambitious of the consulship, and obtained a promise of it
                    from Caesar for the year 44. The latter, however, influenced partly by the
                    strong opposition of Antony, assumed the office himself, and deferred the
                    fulfilment of his promise to Dolabella until he should set out on his expedition
                    against the Parthians. The assassination of Caesar occurring before this
                    arrangement could be carried out, Dolabella at once seized the insignia of the
                    consulship, and, by making friends with Brutus and the other assassins, was
                    confirmed in the office he had usurped. To ingratiate himself still further with
                    the republican party, he caused an altar erected in honour of Caesar to be
                    thrown down, and many of those who had sought to offer sacrifices on it to be
                    crucified or thrown from the Tarpeian rock. He did not hesitate at once to
                    change sides, however, when Antony made it his interest to do so by offering him
                    the command of the expedition against the Parthians and the province of Syria.
                    An unduly protracted and circuitous march was signalized by rapacious extortion,
                    which became still more rapacious when at length Dolabella reached Syria. His
                    crowning iniquity was the murder of Trebonius at Smyrna, which, according to
                    Cicero’s account, was preceded by two day’s torture for the purpose of
                    discovering the locality and amount of the treasure contained in the town. On
                    hearing of this gross abuse of power, the senate outlawed Dolabella, and
                    declared him a public enemy. Cassius was appointed to supersede him, proceeded
                    to Asia Minor, and had taken Laodicea, when Dolabella in despair caused himself
                    to be killed by one of his own soldiers, 43 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi></p>
