                    known as <hi rend="italic">Anda-el-Misk,</hi> a town of Persia, in the province
                    of Khuzistan, 36 miles north-west of Shuster, on the right bank of the
                    Shat-el-Diz, or Abzal, a tributary of the Karun, and there crossed by a fine
                    bridge of twenty arches, the lower part of which is of ancient workmanship. It
                    is the principal market of the province, and lies in a fertile district,
                    productive of oranges, lemons, and indigo. The whole vicinity is full of the
                    remains of ancient canals and buildings, which afford conclusive proof of former
                    importance; and Mr Layard identified the spot with the castle of Lethe, or
                    Oblivion, in which Shapur imprisoned the Armenian monarch Arsaces II. The
                    popular identification of the ruins to the east with Jundi Shapur he regarded as
                    a mistake. Population about 15,000.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">DMITRIEFF,Ivan Ivanovitch</hi> (1760-1837), aRussian
                    statesman and poet, was born at his father’s estate in the government of
                    Simbirsk. In consequence of the revolt of Pugacheff, the family had to flee to
                    St Petersburg, and there Ivan was entered at the school of the Semenoff Guards,
                    and afterwards obtained a post in the military service. On the accession of Paul
                    to the imperial throne he quitted the army with the title of colonel; and his
                    appointment as procurator for the senate was soon after renounced for the
                    position of privy councillor. During the four years from 1810 to 1814 he served
                    as minister of justice under the emperor Alexander; but at the close of this
                    period he retired into private life, and though he lived more than twenty years,
                    he never again took office, but occupied himself with his literary labours and
                    the collection of books and works of art. In the matter of language he sided
                    with Karamsin, and did good service by his own pen against the Old-Slavonic
                    party. His poems include songs, odes, satires, tales, epistles, &amp;c., as well
                    as the fables—partly original and partly translated from Fontaine, Florian, and
                    Arnault — on which his fame chiefly rests. Several of his lyrics have become
                    thoroughly popular from the readiness with which they can be sung; and a short
                    dramatico-epic poem on Yermak, the Cossack conqueror of Siberia, is well known.
                    His writings occupy three volumes in the first five editions; in the 6th (St
                    Petersburg, 1823) there are only two. His memoirs, to which he devoted the last
                    years of his life, were published at Moscow in 1866.</p>
