                <p><label type="entry">DINORNIS</label> (S¢tvóç, terrible, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >opvι&lt;s,</hi> bird), a genus of gigantic Struthious birds, believed to be
                    extinct, which in post-Pliocene times must have formed a principal feature in
                    the fauna of New Zealand. Their remains are found in greatest abundance in the
                    provinces of Otago and Canterbury, often strewn in great profusion over the
                    surface of the ground, but more usually met with buried in alluvial deposits,
                    and in swamps; and they indicate that many of the species attained a huge
                    size—thus the tibia of <hi rend="italic">Dinornis giganteus</hi> measures about
                    a yard in length, and the bird itself must have stood 10 or 11 feet high.
                    Another species, <hi rend="italic">Dinornis elephantopus,</hi> although less in
                    height, possessed, according to Professor Owen, the most massive skeleton in the
                    entire order of birds, its toe bones almost rivalling those of the elephant.
                    Wing bones are believed to have been entirely wanting in those species which now
                    constitute the genus Dinornis, as also the fourth toe, which is present along
                    with rudimentary wing bones in the species which have been placed in the new
                    genus Palapteryx. Among living birds Dinornis agrees most closely with the
                    Apteryx, the diminutive living representative in New Zealand of this gigantic
                    race of bipeds, while somewhat resembling the emeu and cassowary in the
                    formation of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n261/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0261-0244"/> the feathers. Judging from their general
                    structure, and from the habits of their nearest living allies, these great
                    wingless birds may be supposed to have inhabited the plains and hillsides rather
                    than the forests of New Zealand, and to have been omnivorous, feeding
                    indiscriminately on seeds and roots, lizards and insects. Crop-stones are often
                    found in little heaps beside their skeletons, and as these are generally such
                    stones as occur in the neighbourhood, it has been inferred that the Dinornis was
                    comparatively stationary in its habits. New Zealand has been so thoroughly
                    explored in recent years as to render it highly improbable that the moa, as the
                    Dinornis is called by the Maoris, will yet be found alive, but there seems
                    sufficient reason for believing that its final extinction may have taken place
                    since the arrival of the Maori race in New Zealand. Tlιe Maoris have only been
                    settled there for about five centuries, yet they have traditions regarding moa
                    hunting, its bones are found in ancient cooking ovens, and many specimens have
                    been obtained in which portions of the skin with feathers attached are still
                    preserved. An egg has also been recently found containing the bones of the
                    chick, and another measuring 10 inches long and 7 inches broad was taken from a
                    grave, where it rested in the hands of a human skeleton. There is evidence of
                    the coexistence in New Zealand of about 20 species of moas during post-Pliocene
                    times, and this, as A. R. Wallace remarks, points to the conclusion that New
                    Zealand was at one time a much more extensive land than it now is; while the
                    fact, that recently remains of the Dinornis have been found in a postPliocene
                    deposit in Queensland strengthens the supposition that when the moa flourished
                    Australia and New Zealand formed portions of one continent.</p>
