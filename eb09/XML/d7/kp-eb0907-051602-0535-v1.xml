                    herbivorous Cetacea, forming, along which the Sea-Cows <hi rend="italic"

                    sub-order Sirenia. In this genus the head is small, and is abruptly truncated in
                    front, the snout being remarkably obtuse and furnished with bristles. The
                    intermaxillary bones are enormously developed, and from these proceed two large
                    incisor teeth or tusks, which are well developed in the male, but which in the
                    female are arrested in their growth, and remain concealed beneath the surface.
                    There are never more than five molar teeth on each side of either jaw, or twenty
                    in all, and these are flat on the grinding surface. The flippers are unprovided
                    with nails, and the tail is broad, and differs from that of the manatee in being
                    crescent-shaped instead of rounded. The bones are very hard and firm, and take a
                    polish equal to that of ivory. The dugongs frequent the shallow waters of the
                    tropical seas, extending from the east coast of Africa north of the mouth of the
                    Zambesi river, along the shores of the Indian, Malayan, and Australian seas,
                    where they may be seen basking on the surface of the water, or browsing on
                    submarine pastures of <hi rend="italic">Algae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    preeminently fit them. They are gregarious, feeding in large numbers in
                    localities where they are not often disturbed. The female produces a single
                    young one at a birth, and is remarkable for the great affection it shows for its
                    offspring, so that when the young dugong is caught there is no difficulty in
                    capturing the mother with it. There are two species—the Indian Dugong <hi
                        rend="italic">(Halicore</hi><hi rend="italic">indicus)</hi> and the
                    Australian Dugong <hi rend="italic">(Halicore australis).</hi> The former is
                    very abundant along the shores of the Indian Ocean, and is captured in large
                    numbers by the Malayans, who esteem its flesh as a great delicacy; while the
                    lean portions, especially of young specimens, are regarded by Europeans even as
                    excellent eating. It is generally taken by spearing, the main object of the
                    hunter being to raise the tail out of the water, when the animal becomes
                    perfectly powerless. It seldom attains a length of more than 8 or 10 feet. The
                    Australian Dugong is a larger species, attaining sometimes a length of 15 feet.
                    It occurs along the Australian coast from Moreton Bay to Cape York, and is
                    highly valued by the natives, who hunt for it with spears, and gorge themselves
                    with its flesh, when they are fortunate enough to secure a carcase. In recent
                    years the oil obtained from the blubber of this species has been largely used in
                    Australia as a substitute for cod-liver oil. It does not contain iodine, but is
                    said to possess all the therapeutic qualities of cod-liver oil without its
                    nauseous taste. A full grown dugong yields from 10 to 12 gallons of oil, and
                    this, according to Bennet, “forms in cold weather a thick masβ, and requires to
                    be melted before a fire previously to being used.” According to the same
                    authority, the flesh of the Australian dugong is easy of digestion, the muscular
                    fibre when fresh resembling beef, and when salted having the flavour of
                    excellent bacon. In the earliest Australian dugong fishery, natives were
                    employed to harpoon these cetaceans; they soon, however, became too wary to
                    allow themselves to be approached near enough for this purpose, and the harpoon
                    was abandoned for the net. The latter is spread at night, and in its meshes
                    dugongs are caught in considerable numbers. The skin is nearly half an inch
                    thick, and can be made into gelatine or glue.</p>
