                <p><label type="entry">DORIA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Andrea</hi></label> (1466-1560),
                    the famous Genoese admiral, was born at Oneglia in 1466. He belonged to a noble
                    family, several of whose members, both before and after his time, distinguished
                    themselves in the history of Genoa. Having lost both his parents in his youth,
                    he embraced the military profession, and served in the papal guards and under
                    various princes of Italy. It was not until he was fifty years of age that he
                    entered into the service of Francis I. of France, who gave him the command of
                    his fleet in the Mediterranean. In this position he preserved that spirit of
                    independence which is so natural to a sailor and a republican. When the French
                    attempted to render Savona, long the object of jealousy to Genoa, its rival in
                    trade, Doria remonstrated strongly against the measure; this irritated Francis
                    to such a degree that early in 1528 he ordered his admiral Barbesieux to sail
                    for Genoa, then in the hands of the French troops, to arrest Doria, and to seize
                    his galleys. Doria, however, retired with all his galleys to a place of safety,
                    and closing with the offers of the emperor Charles V., returned his commission
                    to Francis, and hoisted the imperial colours. To deliver his country, now weary
                    alike of the French and the imperial yoke, from the dominion of foreigners, was
                    Doria’s highest ambition; and the favourable moment had presented itself. Genoa
                    was afflicted with the pestilence, the French garrison was ill paid and greatly
                    reduced, and the inhabitants were sufficiently disposed to second his views.
                    Before the close of the same year (1528) he sailed to the harbour with thirteen
                    galleys, landed five hundred men, and made himself master of the gates and the
                    palace with very little resistance. The French governor with his feeble garrison
                    retired to the citadel, but was soon forced to capitulate; upon which the people
                    speedily levelled the citadel with the ground. It was now in Doria’s power to
                    have declared himself the sovereign of his country; but, with a magnanimity of
                    which there are few examples, he assembled the people in the court before the
                    palace, disclaimed all pre-eminence, and recommended to them to settle what form
                    of government they chose to establish. The people, animated by his spirit,
                    forgot their factions, and fixed, with his approval, that republican form of
                    government which, with little variation, subsisted until 1815. His disinterested
                    patriotism won for him the appointment of censor for life and the title “Father
                    and Liberator of his Country.” Doria afterwards engaged in an expedition against
                    the Turks, from whom he took Coro∩ and Patras. He also co-operated with Charles
                    V. in the reduction of Tunis and Goulette. In 1547 two successive attempts were
                    made against his life by Fieschi and a Genoese emigrant of the name of Giulio
                    Cibo. He resigned his command in 1556, and died at Genoa in November 1560, being
                    then ninety-four years of age.</p>
