                    (1755-1818), Polish general, was born at Pierszowice in the palatinate of
                    Cracow, August 29, 1755. He was of noble family, and his father was an officer
                    in the Saxon army. Brought up in Saxony, he entered and for some years served in
                    the army; but when, in 1791, the Polish Diet recalled all Poles serving abroad,
                    he returned to his native land. Placed then under the orders of Poniatowski, he
                    took part in the campaign of 1792 against the Russians. In 1794 he distinguished
                    himself in command of the right wing under Kosciusko assisted in the defence of
                    Warsaw, and reunited the scattered Polish forces after its fall. He was
                    compelled, however, to capitulate and to surrender himself prisoner of war at
                    Radoszyce, November 18. Suwaroff offered him a post in the Russian army, but
                    this he declined, and for two years he lived in retirement. In 1796 the rank of
                    lieutenant-general in the Prussian army was offered to him by the king; but this
                    he likewise declined. He then went to Paris. The formation of a Polish legion
                    was at this time in contemplation by the French authorities; and in January 1797
                    Dombrowski was formally authorized by the Government of the Cisalpine Republic
                    to organize it. This task he executed at Milan. In command of his legion he
                    played an important part in the war in Italy, entered Rome in May 1798, and
                    distinguished himself greatly at the battle of Trebbia (June 19, 1799). On this
                    occasion he narrowly escaped death, being struck by a ball the force of which
                    was broken by a volume of Schiller which he carried with him. He next served
                    under Saint-Cyr and Masséna; but being severely wounded he was for some time
                    incapacitated for action. After Marengo he was intrusted by Napoleon with the
                    organization of two new Polish legions; and at the head of the new levies he
                    captured, in January 1801, the fortified post of Casa Bianca, near Peschiera.
                    After the peace of Amiens he passed, as general of division, into the service of
                    the Italian republic. Summoned by Napoleon after the battle of Jena to promote a
                    rising in Poland, he returned there, took command of the Polish army, and
                    distinguished himself at the siege of Dantzic (1807). He fought and was wounded
                    at Friedland, and took an active part against the Austrians in the campaign of
                    1809. In the Russian campaign of 1812 he commanded a division of the great
                    French army, and was wounded at the passage of the Beresina. He fought under
                    General Marmont at the battle of Leipsic (1813), and in the following year
                    returned to Poland. He was one of the generals entrusted by the emperor
                    Alexander with the reorganization of the Polish army, and was named in 1815
                    general of cavalry and senator palatine of the new kingdom of Poland. He
                    retired, however, in the following year to his estates in Posen, and employed
                    himself in preparing for publication his <hi rend="italic">History of the Polish
                        Legions in Italy,</hi> which was published some years after his death.
                    General Dombrowski died at his seat of Wina-Gora in Posen, in June or July
                    1818.</p>
