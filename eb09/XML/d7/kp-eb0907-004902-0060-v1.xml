                    (1738-1813), a French poet, was born on the 22d of June 1738, at Aigues-Perse in
                    Auvergne. He was an illegitimate child, and was connected by his mother with the
                    family of the Chancellor' de l’Hôpital. With very slender means of support he
                    was educated at the college of Lisieux in Paris, and made such progress in his
                    studies as augured well for his future distinction. When his education was
                    completed, he was forced to accept of a very humble situation as elementary
                    teacher in the college of Beauvais; but this was soon exchanged for the more
                    honourable station of professor of humanity at Amiens. After returning to Paris,
                    where he obtained a professorship at the Collège de la Marche, he speedily
                    acquired a considerable poetical fame, which was greatly increased by the
                    publication (1769) of his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Georgies</hi> of
                    Virgil, which he had begun at Amiens. Voltaire was greatly struck with the
                    enterprise and the success of Delille; and without any personal acquaintance
                    with the poet he, of his own accord, recommended him and his work to the good
                    graces of the Academy. He was at once elected a member, but was not admitted
                    until 1774 owing to the opposition of Richelieu, who alleged that he was too
                    young. He now aimed at a higher distinction than even a finished translation of
                    the most finished poem in the world could confer upon him; and in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Jardins,</hi> which he published in 1782, he made good his
                    pretensions as an original poet. Before he had gone far in the composition of
                    his next poem, which was not, indeed, published till after many of his other
                    works, he made a journey to Constantinople in the train of the ambassador Μ. de
                    Choiseul Gouffier. On his return to Paris he lectured, in his capacity of
                    professor, on the Latin poets, and was attended by a numerous audience, who were
                    delighted, not only with his critical observations, but with his beautiful
                    recitation. Delille continued to advance in fame and fortune, though without
                    hazarding any more publications, till the period of the Revolution, when he was
                    reduced to poverty, and sheltered himself in retreat from the disasters which
                    surrounded him. He quitted Paris, and retired to St Dié, the native place of
                    Madame Delille; and here he completed, in deep solitude, his translation of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Aeneid,</hi> which he had begun many years before. A
                    residence in France, however, soon became very undesirable, and he emigrated
                    first to Basle and then to Glairesse in Switzerland, a charming village on the
                    Lake of Bienne, opposite Rousseau’s island of St Pierre. Much delighted with
                    this enchanting country, and with the reception which he met from its
                    inhabitants, he occupied himself constantly in the composition of poetry, and
                    here finished his <hi rend="italic">Homme des Champs,</hi> and his poem on the
                        <hi rend="italic">Trois Règnes de la</hi><pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0061-0050"/><hi rend="italic">Nature.</hi> His next place
                    of refuge was in Germany, where he composed his <hi rend="italic">La
                        Pitié</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and finally, he passed two years in
                    London, chiefly employed in translating <hi rend="italic">Paradise Lost.</hi> In
                    1801, finding that he might return safely to Paris, he did so, carrying with him
                    his immense <hi rend="italic">Poetical Encyclopaedia.</hi> He resumed his
                    professorship and his chair at the Academy, but lived in retirement. His later
                    poems were very numerous, but were not fitted to increase his reputation, which
                    rests mainly on his translation of the <hi rend="italic">Georgies</hi> and his
                        <hi rend="italic">Jardins.</hi> In his later years he became blind. He died
                    on the 1st May 1813.</p>
                <p>Delille left behind him little prose. His preface to the translation of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Georgies</hi> is an able essay, and contains many excellent
                    hints on the art and difficulties of translation. He wrote the article “La
                    Bruyère” in the <hi rend="italic">Biographie Universelle.</hi> The following is
                    the list of his poetical works :— <hi rend="italic">Les</hi><hi rend="italic"
