                            of</hi></label> (1792-1840), born at Lambton Castle, Durham, on the 12th
                    April 1792, was the eldest son of William Henry Lambton, M.P. for the city of
                    Durham. It is noteworthy that the family to which he belonged had held the
                    Lambton estate in uninterrupted male succession from the 12th century. Educated
                    at Eton, he held for a short time a commission in a regiment of hussars. In
                    1813, soon after attaining his majority, he was returned to Parliament as
                    representative of his native county. He was an advanced Liberal from the
                    beginning to the end of hie political career, and distinguished himself by his
                    uncompromising opposition to the reactionary measures of the Tory Government His
                    political position was strengthened by his marriage in 1816 to the eldest
                    daughter of Earl Grey. In 1819 he championed the rights of the people by his
                    denunciation, in the House of Commons and at numerous public meetings, of the
                    coercive measures proposed by the Government against the Chartists. In April
                    1821 he proposed in the House a scheme of parliamentary reform which was in some
                    points, notably in regard to the redistribution of seats, more thoroughgoing
                    than that which was carried eleven years later. The delicate state of his health
                    compelled him in 1826 to proceed to Naples, where he resided for about a year.
                    He was a prominent supporter of the Canning administration of 1827, and of that
                    of Lord Goderich by which it was succeeded. When the latter fell to pieces owing
                    to its inherent weakness in January 1828, Lambton’s services were acknowledged
                    by his elevation to the peerage as Baron Durham. On the accession of Lord Grey
                    to power in 1830 Lord Durham obtained the office of lord privy seal. He was one
                    of a Cabinet committee of four who were intrusted with the preparation of the
                    Reform Bill, the others being Sir James Graham, Lord John Russell, and Lord
                    Duncannon. It was understood at the time that his influence was exerted to make
                    the measure as liberal as possible, and in particular that he wished to
                    introduce the ballot as one of its provisions. In the debates on the bill in the
                    Lords he did not take the leading part that might naturally have been expected
                    from the only peer who had been on the Cabinet committee for its preparation.
                    This was owing partly to his own indifferent health and partly to grief at the
                    death of his eldest son, the Master Lambton of one of Lawrence’s most admired
                    portraits. Continued ill-health led him to resign office in March 1833, when he
                    was raised to the dignity of Viscount Lambton and earl of Durham. In the summer
                    of the same year, however, he was able to undertake a special embassy to the
                    court of St Petersburg, the chief object of which was to secure lenient
                    treatment for the insurgent Poles. In this he was unsuccessful. When the party
                    that had carried reform began to be divided, Lord Durham was generally regarded
                    as a likely leader of the more advanced section, and a strongly radical speech
                    which he delivered at the celebrated Grey banquet at Edinburgh in 1834 helped to
                    strengthen his claims to the position. It took the form of a reply to a previous
                    speech of Lord Brougham, whose enmity Lord Durham thus provoked. In 1837 he
                    accepted the post of ambassador at St Petersburg, which he occupied for about a
                    year. Meanwhile a very serious insurrection had broken out in Canada, and early
                    in 1838 the Government found it necessary to suspend the colonial constitution
                    and send out a new governor with special powers. Lord Durham was selected to
                    undertake the difficult task, for which his extensive experience and his
                    well-known advanced liberalism were supposed specially to qualify him. Somewhat
                    hasty and irascible in his temperament, he unfortunately adopted measures which
                    were beyond the powers conferred upon him by the special Act of Parliament under
                    which he had been appointed. These measures were disapproved of by a vote of the
                    House of Lords on the motion of Lord Brougham, who imported the bitterness of
                    his earlier quarrel with Lord Durham into the debate, and the Government were
                    compelled to disallow the ordinances in which they were embodied. Lord Durham
                    was so deeply incensed at this that he took the extraordinary step of returning
                    home without waiting for his recall, and the Government marked its disapproval
                    of his conduct by directing that he should not receive the customary salute on
                    landing in England. He defended his plan of administration in an able and
                    elaborate report addressed to the queen, and his policy was practically
                    justified by being adopted by his successor. He had returned to England in
                    shattered health, and he died at Cowes, in the Isle of Wight, on the 28th July
                    1840.</p>
