                    convex coast-line of 35 miles, formed by the Clyde on the south for 15, and Loch
                    Long on the west for 20 miles. Along its eastern side for a distance of 24 miles
                    stretches Loch Lomond, the “queen of Scottish lakes,” studded with small
                    islands, which number 30 in all, and most of which, with about two-thirds of the
                    shore, are in Dumbartonshire. There are other fresh-water lakes in the county,
                    but they are of a minor description. The Gare Loch is an arm of the sea about
                    six miles long by one broad, and forms with Loch Long the peninsula of
                    Roseneath, nearly detaching it from the mainland. Besides the Clyde, the only
                    river of any note which can be said to belong to this county is the Leven, the
                    outlet of Loch Lomond, which, flowing for six miles through a fine valley, joins
                    the Clyde at Dumbarton Castle. The mountainous districts are marked by
                    numberless cascades and lesser streams, falling for the most part into Loch
                    Lomond, of which the chief are the Falloch, Inveruglas, Douglas, Finlas, Fruin,
                    &amp;c. The Kelvin, which skirts the eastern border, drains the detached portion
                    of the county. About two-thirds of Dumbartonshire are hilly and mountainous. The
                    most elevated regions are in the west and north-west, between Loch Long and Loch
                    Lomond, and to the north of Loch Lomond. Ben Voirlich, in the extreme north,
                    attains an elevation of 3092 feet, and Finnart, on Loch Long, is 2500 feet high.
                    While this mountainous character prevails in the north of the county, in the
                    eastern detached district and along the Clyde and the Leven it is
                    lowland—marked, however, by the rising of abrupt eminences such as the hills of
                    Kilpatrick and Cardross, and the rocks of Dumbarton and Dumbuck. In scenery it
                    is unsurpassed in Scotland, not only for what it embraces but for the
                    magnificent and extensive views which it commands. The climate varies with the
                    character of the county, but is on the whole salubrious, though much more humid
                    than in many parts of Scotland. The prevailing winds are from the west and
                    south-west, but easterly winds are frequent in the spring months. Frosts are
                    seldom severe, and, except on the mountains, snow never lies long. In the
                    southern districts of the county Old Red Sandstone stretches from Roseneath to
                    Loch Lomond; limestone is found in the higher grounds of Kilpatrick, Dumbarton,
                    and Row; the hills of Dumbuck and Kilpatrick and Dumbarton Rock are composed of
                    trap; while mica slate, quartz, and talc principally constitute its northern
                    formations. Clay-slate is likewise found, and has been wrought with success at
                    Luss, Camstradden, and Roseneath. Coal measures also exist, and there are pits
                    for working coal in several districts. Ironstone is found in considerable
                    quantities in connection with limestone in the parishes of Kirkintilloch and
                    Cumbernauld.</p>
                <p>The arable lands of Dumbartonshire, which extend chiefly along the Clyde and the
                    Leven, and are composed of rich black loam, gravelly soil, and clay, are divided
                    into farms ranging from 30 to 300 acres, and in some cases to 700 or 800 acres.
                    From the proximity to Glasgow and other large towns, the farmers have the double
                    advantage of good manure and a ready market for all kinds both of stock and
                    produce; and, under the stimulus of this, great progress has been made. Special
                    attention has been given to the construction of farm buildings, the erection of
                    fences, and the use of proper draining, as well as to the rearing of cattle and
                    the management of dairy stock, principally of the Ayrshire breed. Black-faced
                    sheep and black cattle are pastured on the hilly lands, and Cheviot sheep and
                    Ayrshire stock on the low grounds. In 1876 Dumbartonshire had 1717 horses,
                    13,153 cattle, 71,202 sheep, and 911 pigs. Oats and wheat are grown in
                    considerable quantities; large crops of potatoes are raised; turnips, barley,
                    and beans are also grown. In 1876 there were 9862 acres under corn crops, of
                    which 7930 were under oats and 1140 under wheat, while 4443 under green crops.
                    On the banks and islands of Loch Lomond there are some yew trees of large size,
                    and evidently of a very great age. There are few large estates in the county;
                    the largest being Rossdhu (Sir James Colquhoun, Bart.), 67,041 acres,
                    Strathleven (Mrs Ewing), 9180, Roseneath (duke of Argyll), 6 799, and
                    Cumbernauld (Hon. Cornwallis Fleming), 3520. The whole number of landowners
                    having one acre and upwards is 706, possessing 152,968 acres, of the annual
                    value of £251,134.</p>
                <p>The banks of the Leven, whose waters as well as being constant are singularly
                    soft and pure, have long been celebrated for their bleaching establishments,
                    dye-works, and print-works. Bleaching was carried on in the Vale of Leven
                    upwards of 150 years ago. The printing of cotton began at Levenfield in 1768,
                    and has for some time been the chief manufacturing industry in Dumbartonshire.
                    There are carried on with great success at Upper and Lower Levenbank Works,
                    located within half a mile of Loch Lomond, the dyeing and printing of Turkey red
                    cloth and yarn; at Dalmoonach, the different processes in calico-printing; and
                    at Ferry-field, Croftingea, and Dillichip the various departments of the general
                    business are conducted on a large scale. At Milton, in West Kilpatrick, the
                    first factory for machine weaving was erected; and here existed, a century ago,
                    a bleaching and calico printing establishment. At Duntocher, in the same parish,
                    cotton-spinning has been carried on from the beginning of the century, and so
                    extensively as to take rank as the second manufacturing industry in the county.
                    In the town of Dumbarton there are extensive ship-building yards, engine-works,
                    foundries, tanneries, and breweries. At Dalmuir extensive works for the repair
                    of the dredging plant belonging to the Clyde Trust were erected by the trustees
                    in 1867, costing £25,000. A large patent slip for taking on the dredgers used on
                    the Clyde forms part of these works, at which three steam forgehammers are in
                    constant operation. In 1850 a line of railway, already completed from Bowling to
                    Dumbarton, was extended up the Vale of Leven to Balloch. In 1858 the Glasgow
                    railway to Helensburgh was opened, running through Bowling, Dumbarton, and
                    Cardross, and supplying, with the steam communication on the Clyde and the
                    lochs, abundant facilities for every kind of traffic to all parts of the county.
                    The Forth and Clyde Canal, begun in 1768 and opened for traffic in 1775, passes
                    through Dumbartonshire for more than 16 miles, and is carried over the valley of
                    the Kelvin by an aqueduct. At Bowling there is a harbour with quays, forming a
                    tidal basin of 8∣ acres.</p>
                <p>The county is somewhat rich in antiquities, connected both with the period of the
                    Roman occupation and with that of the aboriginal inhabitants of Scotland. The
                    wall of Antoninus runs along the north of the eastern part and through the
                    south-east corner of the main district to Kilpatrick. Remains of Roman
                    workmanship have been found at Duntocher and in the parish of Cumbernauld, as
                    well as at the castle. The Caledonians, Picts, &lt;fcc., are commemorated by
                    rude forts and tumuli here and there; and there are several remains of old
                    baronial castles. Rob Roy’s district lies to the north; the clans had encounters
                    in Glenfruin; and the county is associated with the heroic Wallace and Bruce,
                    the latter having built a residence at Cardross, in which he died. In modern
                    times, the first steam navigation company in Britain was formed at Dumbarton in
                    1815; Henry Bell, from whose designs the first steamer built <pb break="no"

                    and who indeed was the first to put into operation the idea of employing steam
                    for navigation purposes, lived at Helensburgh, where he died in 1830. A monument
                    to him was erected near Bowling. The celebrated ship-building firm of Napier
                    &amp; Sons had its origin in a smith’s foundry business at Dumbarton.</p>
                <p>Several important watering-places, including Helensburgh, Kilcreggan, Roseneath,
                    &amp;c., are situated in Dumbartonshire. The other principal towns and villages
                    are Kirkintilloch, Alexandria, Duntocher, Bonhill, Renton, Dalmuir, Kilpatrick,
                    Cardross. The leading gentlemen’s seats are Rossdhu (Sir James Colquhoun,
                    Bart.), Roseneath, (duke of Argyle), Garscube House (Sir George Campbell),
                    Tillichewan Castle (J. Campbell), Bonhill Castle, and Shandon (now a hydropathic
                    establishment), built by the late Robert Napier.</p>
                <p>The county sends one member to Parliament. Population in 1801, 20,710; in 1841,
                    44,296; in 1871, 58,857.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Dumbarton,</hi> a royal parliamentary and municipal burgh
                    and seaport-town of Scotland, capital of Dumbartonshire, is situated at the
                    confluence of the rivers Clyde and Leven, 14 miles north-west from Glasgow. It
                    is a very ancient place, and is said to have been once the capital of a kingdom
                    of the Britons in the vale of the Clyde. Alcluyd, “the rock upon the Clyde,” was
                    the name of this ancient capital of the Strathclydenses; but whether it was
                    situated on the site of the present town, or confined within the precincts of
                    the castle, cannot be exactly ascertained. The site had previously been used as
                    a naval station by the Romans, who called it Theodosia. At a subsequent period,
                    Dumbarton was the capital of the earldom of Lennox, but was given up by Earl
                    Maldwyn to Alexander IL, by whom it was erected into a royal burgh in the year
                    1221, and declared to be free of all imposts and burgh taxes. It afterwards
                    received other charters from succeeding monarchs, and finally it obtained a
                    confirmation of the whole from James VI. Among other privileges conferred was
                    that of levying customs and dues on all vessels on the Clyde from the Kelvin to
                    the head of Loch Long; and ships within these bounds had to pay duties at
                    Dumbarton. “Offers dues” on foreign vessels coming into the Clyde were also
                    levied. In 1700 these rights were transferred to Glasgow by a contract, but were
                    subsequently vested in a special trust created by successive Acts of Parliament.
                    The town is principally built upon the eastern bank of the Leven, which almost
                    encircles it, and is chiefly composed of one main street, lying in a
                    semi-circular form round the head or west end of the peninsula and parallel to
                    the river. A good stone bridge of five arches, 300 feet long, connects the town
                    with Bridgend, a suburb on the western side of the Leven. The waters of the
                    Leven form the harbour. For seventy years the staple trade of Dumbarton was the
                    manufacture of crown glass, commenced in 1777 and discontinued after the
                    abolition of the glass duty. As many as 300 hands were employed in the business.
                    But for many years its principal trade has been ship-building, and particularly
                    the construction of iron steamers. By situation the most “natural” port on the
                    Clyde, Dumbarton has the distinction of originating in Britain the formation of
                    steam navigation companies. In 1815 a joint-stock company was formed in
                    Dumbarton to run a steamer from that town to Glasgow, and their steamer, the
                    “Duke of Wellington,” was built by James M‘Lachlan in Dumbarton. The next
                    steamer was built by William Denny in 1820, from which date the ship-building of
                    the town may be said to have started. But it was not till 1844, on the
                    application of iron to the purposes of ship-building, that the trade assumed the
                    important proportions to which it was raised by the firm of Denny and by others.
                    The Dennystoun Forge Company, which is amongst the largest and most unique in
                    Great Britain, both as respects the building itself and the machinery employed,
                    was opened in 1855. Extensive harbour improvements were entered upon in 1852,
                    and successfully carried out. In 1874 the total tonnage of iron vessels launched
                    in Dumbarton amounted to 32,000, in 1875 to 37,000, in 1876 to 17,500. Some of
                    the vessels built in Dumbarton are among the most magnificent employed in the
                    British trade. The General Police Act has been in operation in Dumbarton since
                    1855. In 1857 the sanction of Parliament was obtained to a bill for extending
                    the municipal boundaries so as to include West Bridgend. The embankment of the
                    Broad Meadow, a project which had been entertained for 250 years, was
                    accomplished in 1859, securing for the town a considerable tract of agricultural
                    land and 20 acres of recreation ground. Since 1860 the burgh has been supplied
                    with water drawn from the Long Craigs. A fine cemetery, a mile from the town,
                    was formed in 1854; and the old Dumbarton parish churchyard has been closed by
                    authority since 1856. The disadvantage Dumbarton long laboured under of having
                    access to the river steamers merely by ferry boats is now obviated by a pier
                    recently constructed from the foot of Dumbarton Rock, at a cost of from £8000 to
                    £9000.</p>
                <p>The situation of Dumbarton Castle is eminently picturesque. The buildings
                    composing the fort are perched on the summit of a rocky mount, shooting up to
                    the height of 206 feet sheer out of the alluvial plain on the east side of the
                    mouth of the river Leven. To the east of the castle there are rocky eminences on
                    the verge of the Clyde, of a similar form, though less isolated. The Rock of
                    Dumbarton measures a mile in circumference at the base. It diminishes in breadth
                    near the top, which is cloven into two summits of different heights. The rock is
                    basalt, and has a tendency to columnar formation. Some parts of it have a
                    magnetic quality. The fortress, naturally strong, possesses several batteries,
                    which command a very extensive range. According to a provision in the Treaty of
                    Union, the defences are kept in constant repair, and a garrison is maintained in
                    the castle.</p>
                <p>The affairs of the burgh are managed by a provost, 2 bailies, and 16 councillors.
                    The county and burgh buildings are good. Dumbarton joins with Port-Glasgow,
                    Renfrew, Rutherglen, and Kilmarnock in returning a member to Parliament. In 1871
                    the population amounted to 11,404. <hi rend="smallcaps">(d.</hi> Μ.)</p>
