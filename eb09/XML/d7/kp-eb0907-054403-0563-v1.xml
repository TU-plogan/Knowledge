                        Ashburton</hi></label> (1731-1783), an eminent English lawyer, the second
                    son of John Dunning of Ashburton, Devonshire, an attorney, was bom at Ashburton,
                    October 18,1731, and was educated at the free grammar-school of his native
                    place, where he distinguished himself in classics and mathematics. On leaving
                    school he was taken into his father’s office, where he remained until the age of
                    nineteen, when he was sent to the Temple. Called to the bar in 1756, he came
                    very slowly into practice. He went the Western Circuit for several years without
                    receiving a single brief. In 1762 he was employed to draw up <hi rend="italic">A
                        Defence of the United Company of Merchants of England trading to the East
                        Indies, and their Servants, particularly those at Bengal, against the
                        Complaints of the Dutch East India Company to his Majesty on that
                        subject;</hi> and the masterly style which characterized the document
                    procured him at once reputation and emolument. In 1763 he distinguished himself
                    as counsel on the side of Wilkes, whose cause he conducted throughout. His
                    powerful argument against the validity of general warrants (18th June 1763)
                    established his reputation, and his professional business from that period
                    gradually increased to such an extent that in 1776 he is said to have been in
                    the receipt of nearly £10,000 per annum. In 1766 he was chosen recorder of
                    Bristol, and in December 1767 he was appointed solicitorgeneral. The latter
                    appointment he held till May 1770, when he retired, along with his friend Lord
                    Shelburne. In 1771 he was presented with the freedom of the city of London. From
                    this period he was considered as a regular member of the Opposition, and
                    distinguished himself by many able speeches in Parliament. He was first chosen
                    member for Caine in 1768, and continued to represent that burgh until he was
                    promoted to the peerage. In 1780 he brought forward a motion that the “influence
                    of the crown had increased, was increasing, and ought to be diminished,” which
                    he carried by a majority of eighteen. He strongly opposed the system of sinecure
                    offices and pensions; but his probity was not strong enough to prevent his
                    taking advantage of it for himself. In 1782, when the marquis of Rockingham
                    became prime minister, Dunning was appointed chancellor of the duchy of
                    Lancaster, a rich sinecure; and about the same time he was advanced to the
                    peerage, by the title of Lord Ashburton. Under Lord Shelburne’s administration
                    he accepted a pension of £4000 a year. He died while on a visit to Exmouth,
                    August 18, 1783. Though possessed of an insignificant person, an awkward manner,
                    and a provincial accent, Lord Ashburton was one of the most fluent and
                    persuasive orators of his time. Sir William Jones speaks in the highest terms of
                    his eloquence and wit, and Bentham commended the closeness of his reasoning.</p>
                <p>Besides the answer to the Dutch memorial, Lord Ashburton is supposed to have
                    assisted in writing a pamphlet on the law of libel, and to have been the author
                    of <hi rend="italic">A Letter to the Proprietors of East India Stock, on the
                        subject of Lord Clive's Jaghire, occasioned by his Lordship's Letter on that
