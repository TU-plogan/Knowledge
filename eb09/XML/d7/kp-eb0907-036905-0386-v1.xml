                <p><label type="entry">DORPAT</label>, in German frequently Dörpt, in Russian Derpt
                    or Yurieff, in Esthonian Tartoma, a city of Russia in Europe, in the government
                    of Livonia, situated on both banks of the Embach, 157 miles north-east of Riga,
                    in 58° 23' N. lat. and 26° 23' E. long. The principal part of the town lies to
                    the south of the river, and the more important buildings are clustered round the
                    two eminences known as the Domberg and the Schlossberg, which, in the Middle
                    Ages, were occupied by the citadel, the cathedral, the episcopal palace, the
                    monastery, and the houses of the wealthier inhabitants. Owing to the great
                    conflagration of 1777, the actual town is almost entirely of modern erection;
                    and its fortifications have been transformed into promenades. Besides one Roman
                    Catholic, three Lutheran, and two Russian churches, a hospital, and an
                    orphanage, a veterinary institute founded in 1846, the economical society of
                    Livonia, an Esthonian learned society, and a medicophysical society, it
                    possesses a famous university, with an observatory, an anatomical theatre, a
                    botanical garden, and a library of about 250,000 volumes, which are housed in a
                    restored portion of the cathedral, burned down in 1596, This university, which
                    renders the town the great intellectual centre of Livonia, preserves the
                    Teutonic traditions of its earlier days, and is much more German than Russian in
                    its culture. It was founded by Gustavus Adolphus in 1632; but i¾ 1699 teachers
                    and students removed to Pernau on the advance of the Russians, and on the
                    occupation of the country by Peter the Great again took flight to Sweden. In
                    spite of the stipulation of the treaty of 1710 and the efforts of the Livonian
                    nobles, it was not till 1802 that its restoration was effected under the
                    patronage of Alexander I.; but since that date its history has been one of
                    considerable prosperity. It possesses 42 ordinary professors, a total teaching
                    staff of 73 members, and upwards of 800 students. The astronomical department is
                    especially famous, owing partly to the labours of Otto Struve, and partly to its
                    possession of Frauenhofer’s great refracting telescope, presented by the emperor
                    Alexander I. The manufacturing industry of the town is very slight, but it
                    carries on a good trade, and has six great markets in the year. Population in
                    1873, 20,780.</p>
                <p>The foundation of Dorpat is ascribed to the grand duke Yaroslaff I., and is dated
                    1030. In 1223 the town was seized by the Teutonic Knights, and in the following
                    year Bishop Hermann erected a cathedral on the Domberg. From that date till
                    about 1559, the greatest prosperity was achieved under the patronage of the
                    independent episcopal see, and the population reached as high as 50,000. In
                    1559, the town was captured by the Russians under Peter Ivan Shiuski, but in
                    1582 it was yielded by treaty to Stephen Bathori of Poland. In 1600, it fell
                    into the hands of the Swedes, in 1603 reverted to the Poles, and in 1625 was
                    seized by Gustavus Adolphus. The Russians again obtained possession in 1666, but
                    once more yielded before the Swedes, and did not effect a permanent occupation
                    till 1703. In 1708 the bulk of the population was removed to the interior of
                    Russia; but before long the town began to receive better treatment from the
                    victors, and when in 1777 it suffered so severely from the conflagration already
                    mentioned, it obtained valuable assistance in the work of restoration from
                    Catherine II.</p>
