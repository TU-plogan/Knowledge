                    (1813-1861), an American statesman, was born at Brandon, in the State of
                    Vermont, on the 23d April 1813. His father, a physician, died when he was still
                    an infant, and in his youth he had to struggle with poverty. He was apprenticed
                    to a cabinetmaker, but his health failed, and he quitted the employment after a
                    year and a half. He next studied for three years at the academy of Canandaigua,
                    giving special attention in the latter part of his course to law. In 1833 he
                    went west to seek his fortune, and settled in Jacksons ville, Illinois. Here he
                    supported himself for a few months by acting as an auctioneer’s clerk and
                    keeping a school. Called to the bar in March 1834, he quickly obtained a large
                    and lucrative practice, and so early as the following year was elected
                    attorney-general of the State. In December 1835 he was elected a member of the
                    legislature, in 1837 he was appointed registrar of the land office at
                    Springfield, and in December 1840 he became secretary of state of Illinois. He
                    was a judge of the supreme court of Illinois from 1841 till November 1843, when
                    he resigned the office inorder tc stand a candidate for Congress χn the
                    Democratic interest. In 1837 he had failed to secure his return by a minority of
                    5 in a total vote of 36,000; on this occasion he was successful, being elected
                    by a majority of 400. He took an active share in the Oregon controversy,
                    asserting his unalterable determination not to “yield up one inch” of the
                    Territory to Great Britain, and advocating its occupation by a military force.
                    He was also a leading promoter of the measures which resulted in the annexation
                    of Texas and in the Mexican war. Being chairman of the Territorial committee at
                    first in Congress and then in the Senate, to which he was elected in March 1847,
                    it fell to him to introduce the bills for admitting Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota,
                    California, and Oregon into the Union, and for organizing the Territories of
                    Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Utah, Washington, Kansas, and Nebraska. On the
                    keenly disputed question of the permission of slavery in the Territories,
                    Douglas advocated, if he was not the first to promulgate, what came to be known
                    as the “popular sovereignty doctrine,” by which each territory was to be left to
                    decide the matter for itself in the same manner as a State. The bill for
                    organizing the Territories of Kansas and Nebraska, which Douglas reported in
                    January 1854, caused great popular excitement, as it repealed the Missouri
                    compromise, and declared the people of “any State or Territory” “free to form
                    and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject only to the
                    constitution of the United States.” There was great indignation throughout the
                    free states; and Douglas, as the chief promoter of the measure, was hanged or
                    burned in effigy in many places. In 1852, and again in 1856, he was a candidate
                    for the presidency in the National Democratic Convention, and though on both
                    occasions he was unsuccessful, he received strong support. In 1857 he
                    distinguished himself by his vigorous opposition to the admission of Kansas into
                    the Union under the Lecompton constitution, which he maintained to be
                    fraudulent. In the following year he was engaged in a close and very exciting
                    contest for the senatorship with Abraham Lincoln, who was the Republican
                    candidate. The <pb break="no"

                    of Illinois, and he was the chief promoter of the Illinois Central Railroad. In
                    1860 he was again one of the Democratic candidates for the presidency, and
                    received a large popular vote, but he was very feebly supported in the electoral
                    college. On the outbreak of the civil war he denounced secession as criminal,
                    and was one of the strongest advocates of maintaining the integrity of the Union
                    at all hazards. He delivered frequent addresses in this sense after the
                    adjournment of Congress, and during his last illness he dictated a letter for
                    publication urging all patriotic men to sustain the Union and the constitution.
                    He died at Chicago on the 3d June 1861.</p>
