                <p><label type="entry">DERVISH</label> is a Persian word meaning “the sill of the
                    door,” or those who beg from door to door. The Arabic equivalent is fakir, or
                    fuqueer. The dervishes of the Turkish empire may be said to constitute the
                    regular religious orders, and are distinguished from the ulemas, or secular
                    clergy. In Turkey, Egypt, Persia, Hindustan, and Central Asia, however,
                    dervishes, or fakirs, are to be found in great number who belong to no society,
                    but are simply mendicants or single devotees, many of whom subsist by
                    professional jugglery. Especially is this true of the Byragis, the Dundis, the
                    Bhikshooks, the Wanuprusts, the Sunyasis, the Aghorpunts, the Gosaens, the
                    Jogis, the Oodassis, the Jutis, and the Lingaet Jungums of northern Hindustan,
                    and still more emphatically of the Bonzes, or Buddhist monks. But in the more
                    favourable sense of the word, the dervishes represent Sofism, or the spiritual
                    and mystic side of Islam. Long before the time of Mahomet, Arabic thought was
                    divided, as if by Greek and Indian influences, into the schools of the
                    Meschaïouns (the walkers) and the Ischrachaïouns (the contemplators). When the
                    Koran appeared, these became the Mutekelim (metaphysicians), and the Sofis
                    (mystics). The latter put an esoteric interpretation on both the Koran and the
                    Hadisât, or collected sayings of the Prophet·; they dispense with the jemaat and
                    other formalities of the mosque; they in many cases recognize the fact of
                    spiritual religion outside Islam; and in general they observe the rules of
                    poverty, abstinence from wine, and celibacy. The name fakir, indeed, comes from
                    the saying of the Prophet, “El fakr fakhri,” poverty is my pride. The six
                    Erkiân, or pillars of the Tesavvuf, or spiritual life, are (1) the existence of
                    God, (2) His unity, (3) the angels, (4) the prophets, (5) the day of
                    resurrection, and (6) good and evil through God’s predestination. But it is only
                    the Tarikats, or orders (lit. paths), among the more orthodox or Sunnite
                    Mahometans who attach much importance to positive dogma. The</p>
                <p>Shiite party, especially the Persian dervishes, who trace their descent through
                    various sheikhs and peers from Ali, the fourth caliph, believe that “the paths
                    leading to God are as many as the breaths of his creatures.” These form the
                    great majority of the orders; for it is stated in a work called the <hi
                        rend="italic">Silsileh ul Evlia Ullah</hi> (Genealogy of the Saints of God),
                    last edited in 1783, that, out of 36 well-defined orders, 12 of which were in
                    existence before the beginning of the Ottoman empire, only 3, viz., the
                    Bestamis, the Nakshibendis, and the Bektashis, are descended from the
                    congregation of Abu Bekr, the second caliph, and that all the others are
                    descended from the caliph Ali. As the dervishes do not recognize the legal
                    exposition which the ordinary tribunals give of the letter of the Koran, and
                    acknowledge no authority but that of their spiritual guide, or of Allah himself
                    speaking directly to their souls, the Ottoman sultans have always regarded them
                    with jealousy; and in 1826 Mahmoud entirely suppressed the order of the
                    Bektashis, which had for centuries been closely connected with the Janissaries,
                    or Hoo Keshans (him scatterers), and which is said to have formed part of a
                    Fermason (freemasonry) extending through Palestine, Syria, and Turkey.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p> This jealousy was not
                            without foundation. The great political factions which disturbed
                            Constantinople, tne Reds, the Whites, the Masked, the Intimates, the
                            Interpreters, the Hashashins (from Hashish, whence assassins), were to
                            some extent connected with the dervish orders. The Kalenderis, founded
                            by an Andalusian dervish who was expelled from the Bektashis, furnished
                            several pretenders to the title of Mehdee, the 12th imam, whose second
                            coming is looked for by all the mystics.</p></note> The other orders,
                    however, or most of them, have survived to the present day, and are generally
                    popular,—one of them, the Mevlevis, being joined by persons from the highest and
                    wealthiest ranks. But membership, when it does not proceed beyond the first

                    by the repetition of a few prayers at home and the wearing of the sacred cap for
                    a few minutes each day.</p>
                <p>The regular dervishes live in tekkiehs, khanakahs, or convents, which are endowed
                    with lands or wakf, just as the Muths of Hindustan are endowed with enam lands,
                    incapable of mortgage or alienation. Thus, in 1634, the sultan Amurath IV. gave
                    to the Bektashis of Konieh the whole tribute paid by that city. Over each
                    convent presides a sheikh, or murshid, who represents the pir, or original
                    founder of the order. This corresponds to the mohunt, malik, or guru of
                    Hindustan. Among the Persian Nosairis (who consider Mahomet an impostor, and
                    perform no ablutions), the succession of sheikhs is hereditary—elsewhere by
                    seniority or election, confirmed by the Sheikh ul Islam. In Hindustan the
                    selection takes place in a dusname, or council of mohunts, called among the
                    Sikhs a muta. The murid, or disciple, has to undergo a long initiation (called
                    in Turkey <hi rend="italic">lkrar,</hi> in Egypt <hi rend="italic">Ahdſt</hi>
                    before he obtains the taybend, or woollen belt, with its palenk or cabalistic
                    “stone of contentment ;” the mengusay, or earrings shaped like the horse shoe of
                    Ali; the khirka, or mantle; the tesbeeh, or rosary, containing the ismi jelal,
                    or the 99 beautiful names of God; and finally the tâj, or white cap, with the
                    proper number of terks, or sections, belonging to the order. Similar
                    distinctions are preserved in Hindustan by the barbarous method of marking on
                    the forehead the sandal-wood stripes of Siva, or the white and red trident of
                    Vishnu. In the Mevlevi order the murid goes through 1001 days of menial labour,
                    and is during that time called the karra kolak, or jackal. It is not necessary,
                    however, to give up one’s private property; and many dervishes are permitted to
                    remain in trade on the <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit07newyrich/page/n129/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0907-0129-0114"/> principle stated by the Prophet, that “the
                    seeker of gain is the friend of God.” Some also are permitted to marry, just as
                    among the Sikh fakirs of Nanuk those named Bashara (with the law), or Salik
                    (travellers), are allowed to marry and to move about; those named Beshara
                    (without the law), or Majzub (the abstracted), are condemned to celibacy and
                    seclusion. But their lives are mainly directed to the production in themselves
                    of the ecstatic state in which the soul enters the Alem-i-misal, or world of
                    dreams, and becomes one with God. This part of Sofism strongly resembles
                    Vedantism. Kaif, or quiescence, is often caused by the use of hashish (the
                    Arabic khoshkhosh, sold at Constantinople in pastilles called <hi rend="italic"
                        >esraf),</hi> or by khalwet, retirement, and the erba’cin, or fast for 40
                    days. Then they indulge in excessive and rapid repetitions of particular
                    phrases, as the Esami Ilahi, or seven attributes of God, viz.—La ilaha ill’
                    Allah (no God but Allah), Ya Allah (O God), Ya Hoo (0 Him), Ya Hakk (O just
                    God), Ya Hay (O living God), Ya Kayyoum (O living God), Ya Kahhar (O revenging
                    God). The Zikr consists mainly in a chant, always becoming louder and more
                    violent, of the first attribute; thus—</p>
                <p>This leads to the Devr, or rotation, in which the Rufai, or Howling Dervishes,
                    stand in a circle, shoulder to shoulder, each on his right foot, and swaying the
                    body and the left leg backwards and forwards or from side to side; the Sem’a of
                    the Mevlevis, or Spinning Dervishes, in which a pirouette is performed all round
                    the khaneh on the left heel, the eyes being closed, the arms outstretched; and
                    other more violent dances, accompanied by the music of the nay, or flute, and
                    tambourine, and by the cries of the dancers. In the Halet, or final ecstasy, the
                    dervishes taV hold of red-hot implements, place glowing charcoal in the mouth,
                    and exhibit prodigies of muscular strength, which are in some cases the genuine
                    and interesting effects of excitement, in others mere calculated imposture. At
                    last the Jezbed, or attraction of God, begins to operate. Besides daily readings
                    from the Koran, an infinity of small figurative prayers, or terjumans, is
                    repeated. These are connected with the khirka, the palenk, the postaki, or seat,
                    the seggadeh, or carpet, and with almost every act and motion of the dervish
                    within the monastery. A rabouta, or silent prayer, is also practised. In return
                    for these mystical rites the dervish obtains spiritual powers, of which the most
                    remarkable is that called fascination, kuvveh ìradat, the power of the will,
                    which depends on certain physical conditions, and seems to include prophecy and
                    the phenomena of mesmerism. By vifk, or the science of numbers, a charm,
                    composed of the names of the matloob, or patient, and the arif, or knowing
                    person (each letter of the alphabet has a numerical value), is placed on the
                    knee of the latter, and by diligent blowing and mental concentration he is able
                    to summon before him the spirit of the matloob. Some dervishes cure diseases,
                    sell talismans, called tilsims and nushkas, charm snakes, and some are musicians
                    and dancers. It is in Egypt and Hindustan that the extreme degrees of squalor,
                    of imposture, and also of self-mortification are found. Some spend their lives
                    in absolute nakedness, their bodies smeared with wood ash, their unkempt hair
                    twisted into a turban; some roll head over heels for hundreds of miles; some
                    contemplate the tip of the nose from 84 different postures; some live by the
                    fraudulent sale of drugs or by feats of legerdemain. All Mahometan dervishes
                    hold a powerful belief in the perpetual agency of the evlia, or saints, and the
                    departed salihin (pure ones), the “unseen men or masters of destiny,” who are
                    sent forth from the kutb, or centre of the roof of the</p>
                <p>Kaaba, to control the spiritual affairs of the world. This is closely connécted
                    with the doctrine of tenassuh, or metempsychosis, which, however, is held
                    chiefly in a spiritual sense. The Bektashis believe that every one has a mesal,
                    or'δ'qual (doppel-gänger 1), who watches over him from the unseen region.</p>
