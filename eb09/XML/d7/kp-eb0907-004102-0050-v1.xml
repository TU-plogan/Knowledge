                    July 1797. He is always spoken of as one of the most fortunate and successful of
                    men, as well as one of the ablest, since he never appeared to encounter any

                    appearance in the Salon, his first exhibited picture was a large one, Josabeth
                    saving Joas, 1822. This picture led to his acquaintance with Géricault and

                    of historical painters, such as perhaps never before lived in one locality and
                    at one time.</p>
                <p>From 1822 the record of his life is to be found in the successive works coming
                    from his hand. He visited Italy in 1838 and 1843, when his father-in-law, Horace
                    Vernet, was director of the French Academy. His studio in Paris was in the Rue
                    Mazarine, where he never spent a day without some good result, his hand being
                    sure and his knowledge great. lîis subjects, definitely expressed and popular in
                    their manner of treatment, illustrating certain views of history dear to
                    partisans, yet romantic in their general interest, were painted with a firm,
                    solid, smooth surface, which gave an appearance of the highest finish. This
                    solidity, found also on the canvas of Vernet, Scheffer, Leopold Robert, and
                    Ingres, was the manner of the day. It repudiates the technical charm of texture
                    and variety of handling which the English school inherits as a tradition from
                    the time of Reynolds; but it is more easily understood by the world at large,
                    since a picture so executed depends for its interest rather on the history,
                    scene in nature, or object depicted, than on the executive skill, which may or
                    may not be critically appreciated. We may add, that his point of view of the
                    historical characters which he treated is not always just, whatever self-command
                    we may give him credit for. Cromwell lifting the Coffinlid and looking at the
                    Body of Charles is an incident only to be excused by an improbable tradition;
                    but the King in the Guard-Room, with villainous round-head soldiers blowing
                    tobacco smoke in his patient face, is a libel on the Puritans; and Queen
                    Elizabeth dying on the Ground, like a she-dragon no one dares to touch, is
                    sensational; while the Execution of Lady Jane Grey is represented as taking
                    place in a dungeon. Nothing can be more incorrect than this last as a reading of
                    English history, yet we forget the inaccuracy in admiration of the treatment
                    which reprβ' sents Lady Jane, with bandaged sight, feeling for the block, her
                    maids covering their faces, and none with their eyes visible among the many
                    figures. On the other hand, Strafford led to Execution, when Laud stretches his
                    lawn-covered arms out of the small high window of his cell to give him a
                    blessing as he passes along the corridor, is perfect; and the splendid scene of
                    Richelieu in his gorgeous barge, preceding the boat containing Cinq-Mars and De
                    Thou carried to execution by their guards, is perhaps the most dramatic
                    semi-historical work ever done. The Princes in the Tower must also be mentioned
                    as a very complete creation; and the young female Martyr floating dead on the
                    Tiber is so pathetic that criticism feels hard-hearted and ashamed before it. As
                    a realization of a page of authentic history, again, no picture can surpass the
                    Assassination of the Due de Guise at Blois. The expression of the murdered man
                    stretched out by the side of the bed, the conspirators all massed together
                    towards the door and far from the body, show exact study as well as insight into
                    human nature. This work was exhibited in his meridian time, 1835; and in the
                    same year he exhibited the Head of an Angel, a study from Horace Vernet’s young
                    daughter Louise, the love of whom was the absorbing passion of his life, and
                    from the shock of whose death, in 1845, it is said he never quite recovered. By
                    far the finest productions of his pencil after her death are of the most serious
                    character, a sequence of small elaborate pictures of incidents in the Passion.
                    Two of these, the Virgin and the other Maries, with the apostles Peter and John,
                    within a nearly dark apartment, hearing the crowd as it passes haling Christ to
                    Calvary, and St John conducting the Virgin home again after all is over, are
                    beyond all praise as exhibiting the divine story from a simply human point of
                    view They are pure and elevated, and also dramatic and painful. Delaroche was
                    not troubled by ideals, and had no affectation of them. His sound but hard
                    execution allowed no mystery to intervene between him and his <hi rend="italic"
                        >motif,</hi> which was always intelligible to the million, so that he
                    escaped all the waste of energy that painters who try to be poets on canvas
                    suffer. Thus it is that essentially the same treatment was applied by him to the
                    characters of distant historical times, the founders of the Christian religion,
                    and the real people of his own day, such as Napoleon at Fontainebleau, or at St
                    Helena, or Maria Antoinette leaving the Convention after her sentence.</p>
                <p>In 1837 Delaroche received the commission for the great picture, 27 metres long,
                    in the hemicycle of the lectura theatre of the École des Beaux Arts. This
                    represents the great artists of the modern ages assembled in groups on either
                    hand of a central elevation of white marble steps, on the topmost of which are
                    three thrones filled by the architects and sculptors of the Parthenon. To supply
                    the female element in this vast composition he introduced the genii or muses,
                    who symbolize or reign over the arts, leaning against the balustrade of the
                    steps, beautiful and queenly figures with a certain antique perfection of form,
                    but not informed by any wonderful or profound expression. The portrait figures
                    are nearly all unexceptionable and admirable. This great and successful work is
                    on the wall itself, an inner wall however, and is executed in oil. It was
                    finished in 1841, and considerably injured by a fire which occurred in 1855,
                    which injury he immediately set himself to remedy; but he died before he had
                    well begun, on the 4th November 1856. Robert Fleury finished the repairs, and
                    the picture as yet shows no sign of decay.</p>
                <p>Personally Delaroche exercised even a greater influence than by his works. Though
                    short and not powerfully made, he impressed every one as rather tall than
                    otherwise; his physiognomy was accentuated and firm, and his fine forehead gave
                    him the air of a minister of state, (w. <hi rend="smallcaps">b. sc.)</hi></p>
