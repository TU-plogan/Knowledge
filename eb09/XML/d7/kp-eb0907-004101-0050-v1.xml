                    (1801-1873), a Swiss physicist, distinguished chiefly for his researches on the
                    subject of electricity, was born at Geneva on the 9th October 1801. He belonged
                    to a good family closely connected with that of the Count Cavour, and he
                    inherited his taste for natural science from his father, an eminent physician
                    and chemist. After an unusually brilliant career as a student, he was appointed
                    at the early age of twenty-two to the chair of natural philosophy in the Academy
                    of Geneva. For some years after his appointment he devoted himself specially to
                    the investigation of the specific heat of gases, and to observations for
                    determining the temperature of the earth’s crust. In the latter inquiry he
                    availed himself of an artesian well that had been bored to a depth of 700 feet,
                    and his ©bser-vations were adopted by Poisson as the basis of his calculations.
                    The comparatively new subject of electricity, however, received much of his
                    attention from the first, and it gradually became the chief object of his
                    scientific work. His name is associated with original discoveries in connection
                    with magnetism, electro-dynamics, the connection of magnetism with electricity,
                    the properties of the. voltaic arc, and the passage of electricity through
                    extremely rarefied media. His researches on the last-mentioned subject led him
                    to form a new theory of the aurora borealis, which, though not free from
                    difficulties, is on the whole the most probable explanation of a very obscure
                    phenomenon. The most valuable practical result of his scientific discoveries was
                    the process of electro-gilding carried out by Messrs Elkington &amp; Ruolz from
                    a memoir which he communicated to the Académie des Sciences. By making it known
                    in this way he voluntarily renounced all the profits of his discovery. Between
                    1853 and 1858 De la Rive published a complete treatise on electricity in three
                    octavo volumes, which was regarded as a work of high authority, and was at once
                    translated into English, German, and Italian. Its author’s scientific reputation
                    received the usual recognition in his election to the membership of most of the
                    learned societies of Europe. In 1842 he received the grand prize of 3000 francs
                    from the Académie des Sciences for his discovery of the electro-gilding process;
                    and in 1864 he received the highest honour open to the scientific men of Europe
                    in his nomination as oneof the eight foreign associates of the Academy. De la
                    Rive’s birth and fortune gave him considerable social and political influence.
                    He was distinguished for his hospitality to literary and scientific men, and for
                    his interest in the welfare and independence of his native country. In 1860,
                    when the annexation ox Savoy and Nice had led the Genevese to fear French
                    aggression, De la Rive was sent by his fellow-citizens on a special embassy to
                    England, and succeeded in securing a declaration from the English Government,
                    which was communicated privately to that of France, that any attack upon Geneva
                    would be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">casus belli.</hi> On the occasion of
                    this visit the university of Oxford conferred upon De la Rive the honorary
                    degree of D.C.L. When on his way to pass the winter at Cannes he died suddenly
                    at Marseilles, on the 28th November 1873.</p>
