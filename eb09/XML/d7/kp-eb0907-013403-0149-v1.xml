                        Menahem</hi></label> (1829-1873), an eminent Oriental scholar, was born on
                    the 28th of October 1829, at Neisse, a town in Prussian Silesia. He was of
                    Jewish extraction; and the family had been settled in his native place for
                    several generations. When six years old, Emanuel began to attend the gymnasium
                    of Neisse, and continued a pupil for two years; after which, in compliance with
                    the earnest wish of his uncle, David Deutsch of Mislowitz, the charge of the
                    boy’s education was transferred to him. Rabbi Deutsch was a first-rate scholar,
                    deeply learned in the Talmud, with stern ideas of duty, as we may infer from the
                    fact that he made his nephew rise the whole year round at 5 o’clock, study for
                    the first two hours, and then spend an hour in prayer, before allowing him to
                    taste food or light a fire. The rest of the day, with the exception of half an
                    hour for exercise and recreation, was devoted to hard study. This dull routine,
                    which proved at once the foundation of his accurate scholarship and of his
                    ill-health, continued till Emanuel was thirteen years old, when he returned to
                    Neisse, to solemnize his religious majority (Bar-mitzva). He proceeded once more
                    to the gymnasium, where he enrolled in the highest class. On reaching his
                    sixteenth year he began his studies in Berlin University, paying special
                    attention to theology and the Talmud. Indeed the Talmud was seldom absent from
                    his thoughts; and, after his death, a great accumulation of papers was found,
                    containing parts of it, copied or translated, beginning in a child’s
                    hand-writing, and reaching down to a comparatively late period. Deutsch
                    supported himself by teaching, and, about two years after going to Berlin, wrote
                    some stories and poems on Jewish subjects for magazines. He also mastered the
                    English language and studied English literature. In 1855 Deutsch was offered an
                    appointment as assistant in the library of the British Museum, which he gladly
                    accepted. “For nigh twenty years,” he says, “it was my privilege to dwell in the
                    very midst of that pantheon called the British Museum, the treasures whereof, be
                    they Egyptian, Homeric, palimpsest, or Babylonian cuneiforms, the mutilated
                    glories of the Parthenon, or the Etruscan mysterious grotesqueness, were all at
                    my beck and call, all days, all hours.” He worked intensely, always aiming at a
                    book on the Talmud as his master-piece, and contributed no less than 190 papers
                    to <hi rend="italic">Chambers’s Encyclopaedia,</hi> in addition to essays in
                    Kitto’s and Smith’s Biblical Dictionaries, and articles in periodicals. In
                    October 1867 his article on “The Talmud,” published in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quarterly Review,</hi> at once made him famous. It was translated, within
                    twelve months, into French, German, Russian, Swedish, Dutch, and Danish. He was
                    passionately desirous of travelling in the East; and, having obtained leave of
                    absence for ten weeks, he left England on the 7th of March 1869. The rapidity
                    and fatigue of the journey permanently injured his health; but he thoroughly
                    enjoyed his visit to Palestine, where his intense patriotism and finely-strung
                    poetical nature found much food for reflection. Never, to the end of his life,
                    did he mention his visit to the Wailing Place of the Jews in Jerusalem without
                    profound emotion. He reached England on the 10 th of May, submitted a valuable
                    report of his travels to the trustees of the British Museum, and delivered a
                    number of lectures, chiefly on Phoenicia. His article on “Islam” appeared in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review</hi><hi rend="italic">ioτ</hi> October
                    1869; and, at the same time, overwork, the consciousness of approaching
                    ill-health, and the death of attached friends brought on terrible depression.
                    Broken health continued to drag him down; and, in the autumn of 1872, his old
                    longing for the East returned so powerfully upon him that, after obtaining six
                    months leave, he left for Italy and Egypt. There a cold moist winter told
                    severely on his health. On the 30th of March 1873, he reached Cairo, and was
                    ultimately removed to Alexandria, where, becoming rapidly worse, he died on the
                    12th of May. He was buried next day in the Jewish cemetery in Alexandria, where
                    a granite stone marks his resting-place. Deutsch was one of the hardest workers
                    of the century, and added to his own special studies of Sanskrit, Chaldaic,
                    Aramaic, and Phoenician, a remarkable acquaintance with English literature. His
                        <hi rend="italic">Literary Remains,</hi> edited by Lady Strangford, were
                    published in 1874, consisting of nineteen papers on such subjects as “The
                    Talmud,” “Islam,” “Semitic Culture,” “Egypt, Ancient and Modern,” “Semitic
                    Languages,” “The Targums,” “The Samaritan Pentateuch,” and “Arabic Poetry.”</p>
