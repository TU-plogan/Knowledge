                <p><label type="entry">DON</label>, anciently <hi rend="smallcaps">Tanais,</hi> a
                    river of European Russia, which ranks immediately after the Volga and the
                    Dnieper. It rises in the Ivan lake, a small basin in the government of Tula,
                    which also sends a portion of its waters to the Volga by means of the Shat, a
                    tributary of the Upa; its course has a general southern direction through the
                    governments of Riasan, Tamboff, Orloff, Voronesh, and the Country of the Don
                    Cossacks; its total length, inclusive of its various windings, is 1325 miles;
                    and its drainage area is calculated at 170,000 square miles. The Ivan lake lying
                    586 feet above the level of the sea, the average fall in the river is about 5∣
                    inches to the mile. In the upper division of its course, which may be regarded
                    as extending to th® confluence of the Voronesh, the Don flows for the most part
                    through a low-lying and fertile country, though in the government of Riasan its
                    banks are rocky and steep, and in some places become even precipitous. The
                    strata which it traverses belongs to the Devonian formation. In the middle
                    division, or from the mouth of the Voronesh to the point when it makes its
                    nearest approach to the Volga, it cuts its way to the S.E., for the most part
                    through Cretaceous rocks, which in many places rise on either side in steep and
                    elevated banks, and at intervals encroach on the channel. After passing
                    Kachalinskaya it turns to the S.W., and maintains this direction till it falls
                    into the Sea of Azoff, the first part of this division being still in the
                    Cretaceous formation, but the latter part lying in an Upper Tertiary district. A
                    short distance below the town of Rostoff it breaks up into several channels, of
                    which the largest and most southern retains the name of the river, while the
                    others are known respectively as the Mertvi Donetz, the Mokraya Koloncha, and
                    the Staraya Kuterma. Before it receives the Voronesh, the Don has attained a
                    breadth of from 500 to 700, or even in a few places 1000 feet, while its depth
                    varies from 4 to 20 feet; by the time it has reached its most eastern point, the
                    depth has increased to from 7 to 50 feet, and the ordinary breadth to from 700
                    to 1000 feet, with an occasional maximum of 14,000 feet; in the lowest division
                    the depth is frequently 7 0 feet, and the breadth in many places 1800 feet.
                    Shallow reaches are not uncommon, and there are at least seven considerable
                    shoals in the south-western part of the course. The river can be used for rafts
                    as far up as the confluence of the Sosna; it becomes navigable after the
                    addition of the Voronesh, and has four regular stations for traffic at Vilkoff,
                    Pavloff, Masloff, and Mamon, in the middle part of its course; but partly owing
                    to obstructions of the channel, and partly to the scarcity of ship-timber in the
                    Voronesh government, it does not attain any great importance as a means of
                    communication till it reaches Kachalinskaya. From that point, or rather from
                    Kalatch where the railway from the Volga has its western terminus, the traffic
                    is very extensive, and is carried on, not only by a variety of small river
                    craft, but also by a regular system of steamboats. Of the tributaries of the
                    river, which are between 30 and 40 in number, the Voronesh, the Khoper, the
                    Medvieditza, and the Donetz are navigable,—the Donetz having a course of 678
                    miles, and affording during high water a passage to the government of Kharkoff.
                    The lower section of the Don is subject to two annual floods, of which the
                    first, known as the <hi rend="italic">cold water,</hi> is caused by the melting
                    of the snow in the country of the Don Cossacks, and the second, or the <hi
                        rend="italic">warm water,</hi> is due to the same process taking place in
                    the region drained by the upper parts of the river. About the middle of June
                    (o.s.) the subsidence sets in with great rapidity; in August it is very low
                    water, and navigation almost ceases; but occasionally after the September rains
                    the traffic with small craft is again practicable. During the last hundred years
                    there have been five floods of extraordinary magnitude,—namely, in 1748, 1786,
                    1805, 1820, and 1845. The river is usually closed by ice from November or
                    December to March or April, and at rare intervals the freezing takes place in
                    October. At Aksai it remains open on the average 250 days in the year, at the
                    mouth of the Medvieditza for 239, and at Novo-Cherkassk for 246.</p>
