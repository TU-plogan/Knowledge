                <p><label type="entry">VITELLIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Aulus</hi></label>, the ninth
                    of the twelve Caesars, and Roman emperor during the greater part of 69 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.d.,</hi> was the son of Lucius Vitellius, who had been
                    consul and governor of Syria under Tiberius, and distinguished for his gross and
                    ridiculous flattery under Caius (Caligula) and Claudius, which the senate, who
                    gave him a public funeral, recognized by a statue with the inscription “Pietatis
                    immobilis erga principem.” He was one of the intimate companions of Tiberius at
                    Capreae; he had driven chariots in the circus with Caius, had played dice with
                    Claudius, had induced the young Nero to sing at a public entertainment, and had
                    been a censor once and a consul three times. He had been governor of Africa, and
                    had there, according to Suetonius (<hi rend="italic">Vitellius, 5),</hi>
                    acquitted himself creditably. Under Galba, to the general astonishment, he was
                    chosen to command the army of Lower Germany, and here he made himself popular
                    with his subalterns and with the soldiers by an outrageous prodigality and an
                    excessive good nature, which soon proved quite fatal to order and discipline.
                    Far from being an ambitious or scheming man, he was lazy and self-indulgent,
                    fond of eating and drinking, and he was in fact drifted into empire by the
                    promptings of Caecina and Valens, commanders of two legions on the Rhine.
                    Through these two men a military revolution was speedily accomplished, and early
                    in 69 Vitellius was proclaimed emperor at Cologne, or, to speak more accurately,
                    emperor of the armies of Upper and Lower Germany. In fact, he was never
                    acknowledged as emperor by the entire Roman world, though at Rome the senate
                    accepted him and decreed to him the usual imperial honours. But after all he was
                    only emperor in name. It was noted as a bad omen that he received the title of
                    supreme pontiff on the anniversary of the day of Allia, 390 B.c., on which Rome
                    was all but utterly overthrown by the Gauls. His advance into Italy at the head
                    of a licentious and ruffianly soldiery was as horrible and calamitous as civil
                    war could possibly be; there was fighting and bloodshed within 7 miles of Rome,
                    and amid riot and massacre and gladiatorial shows and extravagant feasting and a
                    waste of seven millions of money (Tacitus, <hi rend="italic">Hist.,</hi> ii. 95)
                    the capital of the empire was a scene of horror and infamy such as had never
                    been witnessed in the most savage revolutions of past days. As soon as it was
                    known that the armies of the East, Dalmatia, and Illyricum had declared for
                    Vespasian, Vitellius, finding himself deserted by many of his adherents, was for
                    resigning the title of emperor; so crestfallen was he, so dull and lethargic,
                    that, to quote Tacitus <hi rend="italic">(Hist.,</hi> iii. 63), “had not others
                    remembered he had been an emperor, he would have forgotten it himself.” On the
                    entrance into Rome of Vespasian’s troops he was dragged out of some miserable
                    hiding-place, and, with his hands tied behind him, insulted unpitied, driven to
                    the fatal Gemonian <pb break="no"

                    of fierce eager blows. “Yet I was once your emperor,” were the last, and, as far
                    as we know, the noblest words of Vitellius. He perished thus miserably in his 57
