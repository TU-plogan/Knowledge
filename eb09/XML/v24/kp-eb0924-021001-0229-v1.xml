                <p><label type="entry">VICENZA</label>, a town of Italy, capital of the province of
                    Vicenza, lies at the northern base of the Monti Berici, on both sides of the
                    Bacchiglione, immediately below its confluence with the Retrone, and 42 miles by
                    rail to the west of Venice. It is surrounded by somewhat dilapidated walls,
                    about 3 miles in circumference, and entered by six gates. Though many of the
                    streets are narrow and irregular, the town has a number of fine public
                    buildings, many of them the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Palladio (</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">q.v.).</hi> Among these are the town-hall, otherwise known as
                    the Basilica, one of the finest works of the Renaissance period, of which
                    Palladio himself said that it might stand comparison with the similar work of
                    antiquity. The prefecture and the Barbarano and Chieregati Palaces are also his
                    work; in the last-named the civic museum is housed. The Olympic theatre is also
                    noteworthy. The cathedral, which is Gothic, dating mainly from the 13th century,
                    consists of a nave with eight chapels on each side; it contains examples of the
                    Montagnas and of Lorenzo da Venezia. Several of the other churches contain
                    noteworthy paintings: thus the Romano-Gothic church of San Lorenzo has
                    Montagnas, S. Corona Montagnas and a G. Bellini, and S. Stephano one of the most
                    important works of Palma Vecchio. The principal square contains two columns,
                    dating from the Venetian period, and a tall Gothic campanile. Of the Palladian
                    villas in the neighbourhood La Rotonda or Villa Palladiana, 1½ miles to the
                    south-east, deserves special mention. Vicenza is the see of a bishop, and
                    contains two gymnasia, a seminary, an academy, a public library, a botanic
                    garden, and various hospitals. Some remains of antiquity, including ruins of a
                    theatre and an aqueduct, have been preserved. The most important manufacture is
                    that of silk, which employs a large proportion of the inhabitants. Great numbers
                    of mulberry trees are grown in the neighbourhood. Woollen and linen cloth,
                    leather, earthenware, paper, and articles in gold and silver are also made in
                    Vicenza, and a considerable trade in these articles, as well as in corn and

                <p>Vicenza is the <hi rend="italic">Vicentia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Vicetia
                        of</hi> the Romans, noticed by Strabo as one of the minor towns of Venetia.
                    It continued to be a municipal town of some importance till the fall of the
                    Western empire, and suffered severely in the invasion of Attila, by whom it was
                    laid waste. It was for some time during the Middle Ages an independent republic,
                    but was subdued by the Venetians in 1405. Towards the end of the 15th century it
                    became the seat of a school of painting, of which the principal representatives
                    were, besides Bartolomeo Montagna, its founder, Giovanni Speranza and Benedetto
                    Montagna. Palladio (1518-80) was a native of Vicenza.</p>
