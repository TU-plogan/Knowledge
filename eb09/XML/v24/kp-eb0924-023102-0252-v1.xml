                    (1790-1867), historian of French literature, was born at Paris on 11th June
                    1790. He was educated at the lycée Louis-le-Grand, and was only twenty when he
                    was appointed to an assistantmastership at the lycée Charlemagne. This
                    appointment was shortly exchanged for a post at the Ecole Normale. He early
                    devoted himself to the composition of the Academic prize essays which have
                    founded the fortune of so many French men of letters, and in 1812 he gained the
                    prize with an <hi rend="italic">éloge</hi> on Montaigne, which was followed by
                    other successful attempts. His second successful essay, <hi rend="italic">On
                        Criticism,</hi> had the honour of being read by the author before the
                    Academy and the allied sovereigns who were then (April 1814) in Paris. Under the
                    restoration he was appointed, first, assistant professor of modern history and
                    then professor of French eloquence at the Sorbonne. Here he began and continued
                    for about ten years a series of literary lectures which had an extraordinary
                    effect on his younger contemporaries. The secret indeed of Villemain’s great
                    popularity and immense influence is only to be understood by exact observation
                    of the time at which he came. He had no very extraordinary gift of style, nor
                    was he a very original thinker. But he had the great advantage of coming just
                    before the Romantic movement, of having a wide and catholic love of literature,
                    and, at the same time, of not being an extremist. All, or almost all, the clever
                    young men of the brilliant generation of 1830 passed under his influence; and,
                    while he enchanted those of Romantic tendency by his constant reference to, and
                    his frank appreciation of, the beauties of English, German, Italian, and Spanish
                    poetry, he had not the least inclination to decry the classics —either the
                    classics proper of Greece and Rome or the so-called classics of France. In 1819
                    he published a book on <hi rend="italic">Cromwell,</hi> remarkable for a
                    Frenchman of his day, and two years later he was elected to the Academy. The
                    time was more favourable than any previous time had been to literary men with
                    political inclinations, and Villemain was appointed by the restoration
                    Government “chef de l’imprimerie et de la librairie,” a post involving a kind of
                    irregular censorship of the press, and afterwards to the office of master of
                    requests. Like others, however, Villemain became more and more Liberal, and
                    before the revolution of July he had been deprived of his office and had been
                    elected deputy for Evreux. This secured his fortune under Louis Philippe’s
                    reign, and, though he did not long sit in the lower chamber, he received a
                    peerage in 1832. He was a very important member of the council of public
                    instruction, and was twice minister of that department, while at the same time
                    with his elevation to the upper chamber he was made secretary of the Academy.
                    This combination made him during the whole of the July monarchy one of the chief
                    dispensers of literary patronage in France; and, though he never drew on himself
                    the personal ill-will which his friend and colleague Cousin attracted, it was
                    almost inevitable that he should displease many for every one that he gratified.
                    Villemain’s literary position had moreover been somewhat left behind by the
                    course of events, and in politics he was something of a doctrinaire. For more
                    than the last twenty years of his life he took no open part in public affairs,
                    though his literary activity continued to be considerable, the books which he
                    published being in part workings-up of his brilliant Sorbonne courses. Although
                    he still retained a great name and an important Academic position, his later
                    years are supposed to have been somewhat saddened by the difference of his
                    employments and consideration, as compared with those of his middle age.
                    Villemain, in fact, was a man who had at one time, chiefly by accident and
                    coincidence, acquired a position to which he was not quite equal. Some
                    reflexions on him in the “Notes et Pensées” to be found in Sainte-Beuve’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Causeries du Lundi,</hi> vol. xi., are, as is too often the
                    case in that collection when it refers to contemporaries, harsh. But it is
                    certain that he had little originality of thought or definiteness of literary
                    theory, that he was rather a clever exponent of ideas which happened to be
                    popular than a convinced reasoner, and that he had an undue admiration of
                    success. His death took place at Paris on 8th May 1867.</p>
                <p>Villemain’s chief work is his <hi rend="italic">Cours de la Littérature
                        Française,</hi> in 6 volumes, printed soon after he ceased lecturing, and
                    reprinted long afterwards in 1864. It is a very discursive book, containing
                    literary judgments on all sorts of subjects, and illustrating very well the
                    fashion in which Villemain satisfied and stimulated a generation which had just
                    become aware that literature was not limited to the productions of the men of
                    the <hi rend="italic">grand siècle.</hi> Almost all his later works, which are
                    numerous, consist of collections of Academic <hi rend="italic">éloges,</hi>
                    lectures, and literary and historical essays. As, however, he began with a
                    substantive historical work so did he end with one, the posthumous <hi
                        rend="italic">History of Gregory VIL,</hi> on which he had been known to be
                    engaged for many years, and the long delay of which had been the cause of not a
                    few sarcasms. Although a book of merit, it will hardly supplant Villemain’s
                    early Academic lectures as his title to remembrance and fame—such fame as is due
                    to a teacher who succeeds in stirring up the literary faculties of men more
                    highly gifted than himself.</p>
