                <p><label type="entry">VESTMENTS</label>, in ecclesiastical law, are the garments
                    worn during the church service by the officiating clergy. In England and
                    Scotland before the Reformation the vestments in use were similar to those still
                    worn by the Roman Catholic clergy,—probably modifications of the dress of Roman
                    citizens in their origin (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Costume)—</hi> and were
                    either sacrificial, as the chasuble, or non-sacrificial, as the surplice. After
                    the Reformation the question of vestments became of comparatively small
                    importance in the Church of Scotland; but in the Church of England it has in
                    recent years been the cause of much controversy and litigation.</p>
                <p>The “ornaments rubric” at the beginning of the Book of Common Prayer, dating from
                    1662, provides “that such ornaments of the church and of the ministers thereof
                    at all times of their ministration shall be retained and be in use as were in
                    this Church of England by the authority of parliament in the second year of the
                    reign of King Edward VI.” The reference in this rubric is to the vestments
                    enjoined by the first prayer book of Edward VI. (1549). The surplice (with the
                    addition of the hood in cathedrals and colleges, and for preaching)· was the
                    priest’s dress for the service other than the communion. In the communion the
                    bishop was to wear, besides a rochet, a surplice or alb. with a cone or
                    vestment</p>
                <p>(also called a chasuble), and to have a pastoral staff borne by himself or his
                    chaplain. The officiating priest was to wear a white alb, plain, with a vestment
                    or cope, the assisting ministers albs with tunicles. The second prayer book of
                    Edward VI. (1552) enjoined the use of the surplice only. The Act of Uniformity
                    of Elizabeth (1 Eliz. c. 2) provided for the use of the 1549 vestments, “until
                    other order shall be therein taken by the authority of the queen’s Majesty,
                    &amp;c.” In 1564 the Advertisements of Elizabeth were issued, under which the
                    legal vestments were fixed to be the cope worn by the principal minister, with
                    gospeller and epistoler agreeably, in the ministration of the communion, but at
                    ordinary services and at prayers (other than those during the ministration of
                    the communion) said at the communion table the surplice only. Deans and
                    prebendaries were to wear hoods. The point which the judicial committee of the
                    privy council has been called upon more than once to decide is whether the
                    Advertisements of Elizabeth— coupled with the Injunctions of 1559 and subsequent
                    visitations— were such taking of “other order” as to supersede the ornaments
                    rubric. It has been held that they were, and the effect of the decisions has
                    been to reduce the legal vestments to the surplice and hood for all ordinary
                    purposes, with the addition of the cope for the administration of the communion
                    on high feast days in cathedral and collegiate churches. The cope was also
                    allowed by the canons of 1603-4. A bishop wears in addition a rochet. The
                    chasuble, alb, and tunicle had, as has been said, post-Reformation authority,
                    but the girdle, amice, stole, maniple, dalmatic, and biretta were never legally
                    recognized since that time. The stole, however, is frequently worn, by deacons
                    generally arranged as a scarf over the left shoulder. Much information on the
                    subject will be found in the first <hi rend="italic">Report</hi> of the Royal
                    Commission on Ritual, issued in 1867.</p>
