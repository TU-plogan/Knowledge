                    age of Leo X., was born at Cremona shortly before the year 1490. He received the
                    name of Marcantonio in baptism, but changed this to Marco Girolamo when he
                    entered the order of the Canonici Regolari Lateranensi. During his early manhood
                    he acquired considerable fame by the composition of two didactic poems in the
                    Latin tongue, on the <hi rend="italic">Game of Chess</hi> and on the <hi
                        rend="italic">Silkworm.</hi> This reputation induced him to seek the papal
                    court in Rome, which was rapidly becoming the headquarters of polite learning,
                    the place where students might expect advancement through their literary
                    talents. Vida reached Rome in the last years of the pontificate of Julius II.
                    Leo X., on succeeding to the papal chair (1513), treated him with marked favour,
                    bestowed on him the priory of St Sylvester at Frascati, and bade him compose a
                    heroic Latin poem on the life of Christ. Such was the origin of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Christiad,</hi> Vida’s most celebrated, if not his best,
                    performance. It did not, however, see the light in Leo’s lifetime. Between the
                    years 1520 and 1527 Vida produced the second of his masterpieces in Latin
                    hexameters, a didactic poem on the <hi rend="italic">Art of Poetry.</hi> Clement
                    VII. raised him to the rank of apostolic protonotary, and in 1532 conferred on
                    him the bishopric of Alba. It is probable that he took up his residence in this
                    town soon after the death of Clement; and here he spent the greater portion of
                    his remaining years. Vida attended the council of Trent, where he enjoyed the
                    society of Cardinals Cervini, Pole, and Del Monte, together with his friend the
                    poet Flaminio. A record of their conversations may be studied in Vida’s Latin
                    dialogue <hi rend="italic">De Republica.</hi> Among his other writings should be
                    mentioned three eloquent orations in defence of Cremona against Pavia, composed
                    upon the occasion of some dispute as to precedency between those two cities.
                    Vida died at Alba on 27th September 1566.</p>
                <p>Vida’s fame rests almost wholly on his Latin poems. These are more remarkable for
                    their purity and grace of style than for qualities of imagination or powerful
                    thinking. His contemporaries were of opinion that Vida approached more nearly to
                    the ancients in majesty and gravity of diction than his rivals. Indeed, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Ρoetica</hi> can still be read with both pleasure and
                    instruction. Though we miss the poetic glow of Poliziano’s and Pontano’s Latin
                    compositions, and the exquisite workmanship of Flaminio’s lyrics, there is in
                    Vida so facile a command of the Latin language and metre that we might fancy
                    ourselves listening to a writer of the Augustan age. The following lines will
                    give a fair notion of his powers</p>

                    <l> Unde genus nostrum coeli se tollit ad astra, </l>
                    <l> Hanc saltem auferri tandem prohibete Latinis: </l>

                    <l> Tanta Italos inter crevit discordia reges; </l>

                    <l> Nec patriam pudet externis aperire tyrannis. </l>

                <p>This pious prayer was not granted in the age which followed the council of
                    Trent.</p>

                        an enlarged edition appeared in 1731. For an account of his works, see
