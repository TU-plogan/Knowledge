                    name in Finland, is situated at the head of the Bay of Viborg in the Gulf of
                    Finland, at the mouth of the Saima Canal and on the railway which connects St
                    Petersburg with Helsingfors. The Saima Canal (37 miles long), a fine engineering
                    work, connects with the sea Lake Saima—the principal lake of Finland, 249 feet
                    above sea-level—and a series of others, including Puruvesi, Orivesi, Höytiänen,
                    and Kallavesi, all of which are navigated by steamers, as far north as Idensalmi
                    in 63° 30' N. lat. Viborg is thus the seaport of Karelia and eastern Savolaks,
                    with the towns of Vilmanstrand (1289 inhabitants in 1880), St Michel (1432),
                    Nyslott (1424), Kuopio (6834), and Idensalmi, with their numerous sawmills and
                    iron-works. Viborg stands most picturesquely on the glaciated and dome-shaped
                    granite hills surrounding the bay, which is protected at its entrance by the
                    naval station of Björkö and at its head by several forts. The castle of Viborg,
                    built in 1293 by Marshal Torkel Knutson, was the first centre for the spread of
                    Christianity in Karelia, and for establishing the power of Sweden; it is now
                    used as a prison. Its lofty and elegant tower has fallen into decay. The
                    court-house (1839), the town-house, the gymnasium (1641; with an excellent
                    library), and the museum are among the principal buildings of the city. There
                    are also a school of navigation and several primary schools, both public and
                    private, a literary and an agricultural society, and several benevolent
                    institutions. The population, 14,668 in 1880 and 15,800 in 1884, consists of
                    three elements,—Finnish, Swedish, and Russian (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Finland).</hi> There is a strong Russian garrison. Several industrial
                    establishments, including a foundry for the construction of steam-engines, an
                    iron-work, and several candle-works, match-factories, and saw-mills, have risen
                    of late at Viborg and in its neighbourhood; but the place owes its chief
                    importance to its export trade, in which timber is the chief item. The coasting
                    trade is also considerable.</p>
                <p>The environs are most picturesque and are visited by many tourists in the summer.
                    The park of Monrepos (Old Viborg), in a bay dotted with dome-shaped islands, is
                    specially attractive. The scenery of the Saima Canal and of the Finnish lakes
                    with the grand <hi rend="italic">as</hi> of Pungaharju; the Imatra rapids, by
                    which the Vuoksen discharges the water of Lake Saima into Lake Ladoga, with the
                    castle of Kexholm at its mouth; Serdobol and Valamo monastery on Lake Ladoga—all
                    visited from Viborg—attract many tourists from St Petersburg and from other
                    parts of Finland.</p>
