                <p><label type="entry">VITUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>, according to the
                    Roman Breviary, while still a very young boy, had been baptized without the
                    knowledge of his father, who, on learning this, spared no effort to bring about
                    his return to paganism. After other severe measures had been tried in vain he
                    was delivered to Valerian to be scourged, but even this had no effect, and he
                    was handed back to his father. Admonished by an angel, Vitus, accompanied by
                    Modestus and Crescentia, by whom he had been brought up, now took refuge abroad,
                    where his fame for sanctity became so great that he was summoned by Diocletian
                    to heal his child, who was grievously vexed with a devil. Successful in this he
                    was urged by the ungrateful emperor to worship the pagan deities, and on his
                    refusal was cast into prison. Along with Modestus and Crescentia he was
                    sentenced to be plunged into a cauldron of molten lead, resin, and pitch, but
                    here their experience was that of the three Hebrew children. Next they were cast
                    before the lion, but the wild beast fawned upon them and licked their feet.
                    Finally they were torn limb from limb. The three are commemorated on June 15.
                    The more extended legend of St Vitus relates that, on one occasion when he had
                    been shut up in a dungeon, his father looking through a chink in the door beheld
                    him dancing with seven beautiful angels; so dazzled was he by the sight that he
                    became blind, and recovered only through the intercession of his son. St Vitus
                    is accordingly the patron saint of dancers and actors, and is invoked against
                    the disease known as <hi rend="smallcaps">St Vitus’s Dance</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >(q.v.).</hi> He is the patron of Saxony, Bohemia, and Sicily, and
                    throughout Germany ranks as one of the fourteen “Nothhelfer” of the church.</p>
