                <p><label type="entry">VULTURE</label>, the name of certain birds whose best-known
                    characteristic is that of feeding upon carcases, and these birds, owing to this
                    obscene habit, are in many hot countries regarded with favour as useful
                    scavengers. The genus <hi rend="italic">Vultur,</hi> as instituted by Linnaeus,
                    is now restricted by ornithologists to a single species, <hi rend="italic">V.
                        monachus,</hi> of which more presently, the other species included therein
                    by him, or thereto referred by succeeding systematists, being elsewhere
                    relegated <hi rend="italic">(cf.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Lämmergeyer);</hi> but
                    the most important taxonomic change that has been introduced is that by Prof.
                    Huxley <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1867, pp. 462-464), who
                    pointed out the complete structural difference between the Vultures of the New
                    World and those of the Old, regarding the former as constituting a distinct

                    signification of some considerable distinctions, and to the present writer it
                    would appear more reasonable to recognize the existence of a Family <hi
                        rend="italic">Vulturidae,</hi> confined to the true Vultures of the Ancient
                    Continent, equal in rank to the <hi rend="italic">Falconidae,</hi> while fully
                    admitting the claim made on behalf of the New-World forms for the same
                    standing.</p>
                <p>The American Vulture may be said to include four genera :—(1) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sarcorhamphus,</hi> the gigantic Condor, the male distinguished by a large
                    fleshy comb and wattles; (2) <hi rend="italic">Gypagus,</hi> the King-Vulture,
                    with its gaudily-coloured head and nasal caruncle; (3) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Catharista,</hi> containing the so-called Turkey-Buzzard of
                    English-speaking Americans with its allies; and (4) <hi rend="italic"
                        >Pseudogryphus,</hi> the great Californian Vulture—of very limited range on
                    the western slopes of North America, and threatened with speedy extinction
                    through the use of poison. Though all these birds are structurally so different
                    from the true Vultures of the Old World, in habits the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vulturidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sarcorhamphidae</hi> are much alike,
                    and of several of the latter—</p>
                <p>particularly of the Condor and the Turkey-Buzzard—we possess rather elaborate
                    accounts by excellent observers, as Darwin, Alexander Wilson, and Mr Gosse—whose
                    works are readily accessible.</p>
                <p>The true Vultures of the Old World, <hi rend="italic">Vulturidae</hi> in the
                    restricted sense, are generally divided into five or six genera, of which <hi
                        rend="italic">Neophron</hi> has been not unjustifiably separated as forming
                    a distinct Subfamily, <hi rend="italic">Neophroninae,—</hi> its members, of
                    comparatively small size, differing both in structure and habit considerably
                    from the rest One of them is the so-called Egyptian Vulture or Pharaoh’s Hen,
                        <hi rend="italic">N. percnopterus,</hi> a bird whose delicacy of build and
                    appearance contrast forcibly with its choice of the most filthy kind of food. It
                    is a well-known species in some parts of India,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the eastern part of the Indian
                            peninsula it is replaced by a smaller race or (according to some
                            authorities) species, <hi rend="italic">N. gingianus,</hi> which has a
                            yellow instead of a black bill.</p></note> and thence westward to
                    Africa, where it has an extensive range. It also occurs on the northern shores
                    of the Mediterranean, and on three occasions has strayed to such a distance from
                    its usual haunts as to have twice suffered capture in England, and once even in
                    Norway. Of the genera composing the other Subfamily, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vulturinae,</hi> space is wanting to say much. <hi rend="italic">Gyps</hi>
                    numbers seven or eight local species and races, on more than one of which the
                    English name Griffon has been fastened. The best known is <hi rend="italic">G.
                        fulυus,</hi> which by some authors is accounted “British,” from an example
                    having been taken in Ireland, though under circumstances which suggest its
                    appearance so far from its nearest home in Spain to be due to man’s
                    intervention. The species, however, has a wider distribution on the European
                    continent (especially towards the north-east) than the Egyptian Vulture, and in
                    Africa nearly reaches the Equator, extending also in Asia to the Himalaya; but
                    both in the Ethiopian and Indian Regions its range inosculates with that of
                    several allied forms or species. <hi rend="italic">Pseudogyps</hi> with two
                    forms—one Indian, the other African—differs from <hi rend="italic">Gyps</hi> by
                    having 12 instead of 14 rectrices. Of the genera <hi rend="italic">Otogyps</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Lophogyps</hi> nothing here need be said; and then we have
                        <hi rend="italic">Vultur,</hi> with, as mentioned before, its sole
                    representative, <hi rend="italic">V. monachus,</hi> commonly known as the
                    Cinereous Vulture, a bird which is found from the Straits of Gibraltar to the
                    sea-coast of China.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The
                            geographical range of the various species of Vultures has been
                            exhaustively treated by Mr Sharpe (<hi rend="italic">Journ. Linn.
                                Society,</hi> Zoology, xiii. pp. 1-26, pls. i.-ix.).</p></note>
                    Almost all these birds inhabit rocky cliffs, on the ledges of which they build
                    their nests.</p>
                <p>The question whether Vultures in their search for food are guided by sight of the
                    object or by its scent has long excited much interest, and the advocates of
                    either opinion have warmly contended in its behalf. Without denying to them the
                    olfactory faculty, it seems to be now generally admitted, notwithstanding the
                    assertions to the contrary of Waterton and a few more, that the sense of sight
                    is in almost every case sufficient to account for the observed facts. It is
                    known that, directly a camel or other beast of burden drops dead, as the caravan
                    to which it belonged is making its way across the desert, Vultures of one sort
                    or another appear, often in considerable numbers, though none had before been
                    observed by the ordinary traveller, and speedily devour the carcase over which
                    they are gathered together. The mode in which communication is effected between
                    the birds, which are soaring at an immense height, seems at first inexplicable,
                    but Canon Tristram has suggested (<hi rend="italic">Ibis,</hi> 1859, p. 280) the
                    following simple solution of the supposed mystery :—</p>
                <p>“The Griffon who first descries his quarry descends from his elevation at once.
                    Another, sweeping the horizon at a still greater distance, observes his
                    neighbour’s movements and follows his course. A third, still further removed,
                    follows the flight of the second; he is traced by another; and so a perpetual
                    succession is kept up so long as a morsel of flesh remains over which to
                    consort. I can conceive no other mode of accounting for the number of Vultures
                    which in the course of a few hours will gather over a carcase, when previously
                    the horizon might have been scanned in vain for more than one, or at the most
                    two, in sight.”</p>
                <p>The Canon goes on to suppose that in this way may be explained the enormous
                    congregation of Vultures in the Crimea during the siege of Sevastopol, where
                    they had before been scarce :—“the habit of watching the movements of their
                    neighbours” may “have collected the whole race from the Caucasus and Asia Minor
                    ”—he might have added the Balkans—“to enjoy so unwonted an abundance.” Doubt may
                    be entertained whether the last supposition be correct, but none as to the
                    accuracy of the first. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. n.)</hi></p>
