                    (1782-1834), the first Protestant missionary to China, was born of Scottish
                    parents at Morpeth, Northumberland, on 5th January 1782. After receiving an
                    elementary education in Newcastle, he was apprenticed to a lastmaker, but his
                    spare hours were devoted to studies connected with theology, and in 1803 he was
                    received into the Independent academy at Hoxton. In the following year he
                    offered his services to the London Missionary Society, by which, after he had
                    attended the mission college of Gosport and studied Chinese under a native
                    teacher, he was sent to Canton in 1807. He was appointed translator to the East

                    official dutiqp connected with this post, laboured with intense application at a

                    Testament, both of which were published in 1814. In 1817 he published <hi

                    translation of the entire Bible was completed in the following year. His next
                    enterprise was the establishment of an Anglo-Chinese college at Malacca for “the
                    reciprocal cultivation of Chinese and European literature,” which was opened in
                    1820. In 1821 his <hi rend="italic">Chinese Dictionary</hi> was published by the
