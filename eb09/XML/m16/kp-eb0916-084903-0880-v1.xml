                <p><label type="entry">MORTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">James Douglas</hi></label>,
                    fourth earl of (1530-1581), regent of Scotland, second son of Sir George Douglas
                    of Pittendriech, was born at Dalkeith in 1530. Having married Elizabeth,
                    daughter of the third earl of Morton, he through her succeeded in 1553 to the
                    title and estates of his father-in-law. After the return of Queen Mary in 1561
                    he was chosen a privy councillor, and in 1563 he became lord high chancellor.
                    Though his sympathies were Protestant, he took no part in the combination of
                    Protestant barons in 1565, but he headed the armed force of 150 men who took
                    possession of Holyrood Palace to effect the assassination of Rizzio, and it was
                    to his house that the leading conspirators adjourned while a messenger was sent
                    to obtain Mary’s signature to the “bond of security.” The queen, before
                    complying with the request, escaped to Dunbar, and on her return to Edinburgh
                    with an escort of 2000 men Morton and the other leaders fled to England. After
                    her marriage with Bothwell, Morton returned, and with 600 men appeared before
                    Borthwick Castle, where the queen, in dread of a rising, had taken refuge. He
                    was present at the remarkable conference at Carberry Hill, and he also took an
                    active part in obtaining the consent of the queen at Lochleven to an abdication.
                    Thereupon he was reappointed lord high chancellor, and also succeeded Bothwell
                    as lord high admiral. On the death of the earl of Mar he became regent (October
                    1572). Through his persistence in recovering the crown jewels from the countess
                    of Argyll, widow of the earl of Moray, Morton awakened the bitter animosity of
                    Argyll and Athole, who persuaded the young king James VI. to assume the
                    government. Morton deemed it prudent to resign, and for a time retired to
                    Lochleven, but shortly afterwards, with the assistance of his nephew, the earl
                    of Mar, he obtained possession of Stirling Castle, where the king was residing,
                    and thus for a time recovered his old influence. Suddenly, however, he was
                    accused by James Stewart, earl of Arran, of having taken part in the murder of
                    Darnley, the father of the king, and being tried by a jury of sixteen peers,
                    most of whom were his enemies, was condemned to death and beheaded on 2d June
                    1581.</p>
