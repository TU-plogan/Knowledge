                    Thessalonica, and was born about the year 825. His nationality is unknown, but
                    most probably he was a Graecized Slav; the family of which he was a member
                    appears to have been one of considerable social distinction, and he himself had
                    already attained high official rank in the government of Macedonia before he
                    determined to abandon his secular career and embrace the monastic life. His
                    younger brother Constantine (better known as Cyril, the name he adopted at Rome
                    shortly before his death) had also distinguished himself as a secular
                    “philosopher” in Constantinople before he withdrew to the cloister and to

                    population, especially by means of translations of the Scripture lessons and the
                    liturgical books used in Christian worship. About the year 863, at the
                    invitation of Rastislav, king of “Great Moravia,” who desired the
                    Christianization of his subjects, but at the same time that they should be
                    independent of the Germans, the two brothers went to his capital (its site is
                    unknown), and, besides establishing a seminary for the education of priests,
                    successfully occupied themselves in preaching in the vernacular and in diffusing
                    their religious literature. After four years they seem to have received and
                    accepted an invitation to Rome from Pope Nicholas I., who had just been engaged
                    in his still extant correspondence with the newly converted Bulgarian king; his
                    death occurred before their arrival, but they were kindly received by his
                    successor Hadrian II. Constantine died in Rome, but Methodius, after satisfying
                    the pope of his orthodoxy and obedience, went back to his labours in “Moravia”
                    as archbishop of Pannonia. His province appears to have been, roughly speaking,
                    co-extensive with the basins of the Raab, Drave, and Save, and thus to have
                    included parts of what had previously belonged to the provinces of Salzburg and
                    Passau. In 871 complaints on this account were made at Rome, nominally on behalf
                    of the archbishop of Salzburg, but really in the interests of the German king
                    and his Germanizing ally Swatopluk, Rastislav’s successor; they were not,
                    however, immediately successful. In 879, however, Methodius was again summoned
                    to Rome by Pope John VIII., after having declined to give up the practice of
                    celebrating mass in the Slavonic tongue; but, owing to the peculiar delicacy of
                    the relations of Rome with Constantinople, and with the young church of
                    Bulgaria, the pope, contrary to all expectation, ultimately decided in favour of
                    a Slavonic liturgy, and sent Methodius (880) back to his diocese with a
                    suffragan bishop, and with a letter of recommendation to Swatopluk. This
                    suffragan, a German named Wiching, unfortunately proved quite the reverse of
                    helpful to his metropolitan, and through his agency, especially after the death
                    of John VIII. in 882, the closing years of the life of Methodius were embittered
                    by continual ecclesiastical disputes, in the course of which he is said to have
                    laid Swatopluk and his supporters under the ban, and the realm under interdict.
                    The date of the death of Methodius is variously given; the most trustworthy
                    tradition says that it took place on April 6, 885. He was buried at Welehrad
                    (probably Stuhlweissenberg). The Greek Church commemorates St Cyril on February
                    14 and St Methodius on May 11; in the Roman Church both are commemorated on
                    March 9.</p>

                    The subject of the present notice is most probably not to be identified with the
                    Methodius, a painter and monk, who, according to a well-known legend, converted
                    Boris of Bulgaria by means of a picture of Christ’s second coming.</p>
