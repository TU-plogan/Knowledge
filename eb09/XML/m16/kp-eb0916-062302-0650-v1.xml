                    (1810-1855), the eighth baronet, was born in London, 23d May 1810, and succeeded
                    to the extensive family estates in Devon and Cornwall in 1823. On the passing of
                    the Reform Act of 1832 he was returned to parliament, though only twenty-two
                    years old, for the eastern division of the county of Cornwall, to support the
                    ministry of Lord Grey. For some time he took little part in the debates of the
                    House of Commons; but in April 1835 he founded, in conjunction with Mr. Roebuck,
                    the <hi rend="italic">London Review,</hi> as an organ of the politicians known
                    to the world as “Philosophic Radicals.” After the publication of two volumes he
                    purchased the <hi rend="italic">Westminster Review,</hi> and for some time the
                    united magazines were edited by him and J. S. Mill. From 1837 to 1841 Sir
                    William Molesworth sat for the borough of Leeds, and during those years acquired
                    considerable influence in the House of Commons by his speeches and by his tact
                    in presiding over the select committee on Transportation. From 1841 to 1845 he
                    remained in private life, occupying his leisure time in editing the works in
                    Latin and English of Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury, a recreation which cost him no
                    less than £6000. In the latter year he was returned for the borough of
                    Southwark, and retained that seat until his death. On his return to parliament
                    he devoted special attention to the condition of the colonies, and delivered
                    many speeches in favour of a reduction in colonial expenditure and on their
                    better administration. His arguments on these questions changed the opinions of
                    the members of the House of Commons; and the criticisms of the daily press,
                    aided by the printing of his speeches, led to the gradual acceptance of his
                    views by the electors at large. It was not, however, until many years afterwards
                    that he was allowed full opportunity for working out the difficult problems
                    connected with the government of Great Britain. Office was conferred upon him in
                    December 1852 by Lord Aberdeen, but it was the minor post of directing the
                    public improvements and crown lands of his own country, and the chief work by
                    which his name was brought into prominence at this time was the construction of
                    the new Westminster Bridge. At last, in July 1855, he was called to preside over
                    the Colonial Office, but unfortunately its duties were no sooner entrusted to
                    his care than he was cut off by death (22d October 1855), to the universal
                    regret of his countrymen, for he had lived down the animosities of his youth,
                    and had attracted to himself the sympathies of all thoughtful men. The influence
                    which his views had acquired, and still retain, may be judged from the fact that
                    in 1878 the delegates of the Transvaal Government put forward, as the chief
                    argument for the withdrawal of the English from the Transvaal, the substance of
                    his speech on the abandonment of the Orange River Territory in 1854.</p>
