                    Weasels, which constitute the remainder of the group, by the facial part of the
                    skull being narrower and more approaching in form that of the Martens, by the
                    premolar teeth (especially the first of the upper jaw) being larger, by the toes
                    being partially webbed, and by the absence of hair in the intervals between the
                    naked pads of the soles of the feet. The two best-known species, so much alike
                    in size, form, colour, and habits that although they are widely separated
                    geographically some zoologists question their specific distinction, are <hi
                        rend="italic">P. lutreola,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Nörz</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">Sumpf otter</hi> (Marsh-Otter) of eastern Europe, and <hi
                        rend="italic">P. vison,</hi> the Mink of North America. The former inhabits
                    Finland, Poland, and the greater part of Russia, though not found east of the
                    Ural mountains. Formerly it extended westward into central Germany, but it is
                    now very rare, if not extinct, in that country. The latter is found in places
                    which suit its habits throughout the whole of North America. Another form, <hi
                        rend="italic">P. sibiricus,</hi> from eastern Asia, of which much less is
                    known, appears to connect the true Minks with the Polecats.</p>
                <p>The name may have originated in the Swedish <hi rend="italic">maenk</hi> applied
                    to the European animal. Captain John Smith, in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                        Virginia</hi> (1626), at p. 27, speaks of “Martins, Powlecats, Weeseis, and
                    Minkes,” showing that the animal must at that time have been distinguished by a
                    vernacular appellation from its congeners. By later authors, as Lawson (1709)
                    and Pennant (1784), it is often written “Minx.” For the following description,
                    chiefly taken from the American form (though almost equally applicable to that
                    of Europe) we are mainly indebted to Elliott Coues’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fur-bearing Animals of North America,</hi> 1877.</p>
                <p>In size it much resembles the English Polecat, —the length of the head aud body
                    being usually from 15 to 18 inches, that of the tail to the end of the hair
                    about 9 inches. The female is considerably smaller than the male. The tail is
                    bushy, but tapering at the end. The ears are small, low, rounded, and scarcely
                    project beyond the adjacent fur. The pelage consists of a dense, soft, matted
                    under fur, mixed with long, stiff, lustrous hairs on all parts of the body and
                    tail. The gloss is greatest on the upper parts; on the tail the bristly hairs
                    predominate. Northern specimens have the finest and most glistening pelage; in
                    those from southern regions there is less difference between the under and over
                    fur, and the whole pelage is coarser and harsher. In colour, different specimens
                    present a considerable range of variation, but the animal is ordinarily of a
                    rich dark brown, scarcely or not paler below than on the general upper parts;
                    but the back is usually the darkest, and the tail is nearly black. The under
                    jaw, from the chin about as far back as the angle of the mouth, is generally
                    white. In the European Mink the upper lip is also white, but, as this
                    occasionally occurs in American specimens, it fails as an absolutely
                    distinguishing character. Besides the white on the chin, there are often other
                    irregular white patches on the under parts of the body. In very rare instances
                    the tail is tipped with white. The fur, like that of most of the auimals of the
                    group to which it belongs, is an important article of commerce.</p>
                <p>The principal characteristic of the Mink in comparison with its congeners is its
                    amphibious mode of life. It is to the water what the other Weasels are to the
                    land, or Martens to the trees, being as essentially aquatic in its habits as the
                    Otter, Beaver, or Musk-rat, and spending perhaps more of its time in the water
                    than it does on land. It swims with most of the body submerged, and dives with
                    perfect ease, remaining long without coming to the surface to breathe. It makes
                    its nest in burrows in the banks of streams, breeding once a year about the
                    month of April, and producing five or six young at a birth. Its food consists of
                    frogs, fish, freshwater molluscs and crustaceans, as well as mice, rats,
                    musk-rats, rabbits, and small birds. In common with the other animals of the
                    genus, it has a very peculiar and disagreeable effluvium, which, according to
                    Coues, is more powerful, penetrating, and lasting than that of any animal of the
                    country except the Skunk. It also possesses the courage, ferocity, and tenacity
                    of life of its allies. When taken young, however, it can be readily tamed, and
                    lately Minks have been extensively bred in captivity in America both for the
                    sake of their fur and for the purpose of using them in like manner as Ferrets in
                    England, to clear buildings of rats. (W. H. F.)</p>
