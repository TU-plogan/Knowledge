                <p><label type="entry">MOORE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr John</hi></label> (1730-1802),
                    born at Stirling in 1730, was one of the most prominent writers of travels and
                    novels in the latter part of the 18th century. His novel <hi rend="italic"
                        >Zeluco</hi> (published in 1789) produced a powerful impression at the time,
                    and indirectly, through the poetry of Byron, has left an abiding mark on
                    literature. The novel would in these days be called a psychological novel; it is
                    a close analysis of the motives of a headstrong, passionate, thoroughly selfish
                    and unprincipled profligate. It is full of incident, and the analysis is never
                    prolonged into tedious reflexions, nor suffered to intercept the progress of the
                    story, while the main plot is diversified with many interesting episodes. The
                    character took a great hold of Byron’s imagination, and probably influenced his
                    life in some of its many moods, as well as his poetry. It is not too much to say
                    that the common opinion that Byron intended <hi rend="italic">Childe Harold</hi>
                    as a reflexion of himself cannot be cleared of its large mixture of falsehood
                    without a study of Moore’s <hi rend="italic">Zeluco.</hi> Byron said that he
                    intended the Childe to be “a poetical Zeluco,” and the most striking features of
                    the portrait were undoubtedly taken from that character. At the same time it is
                    obvious to everybody acquainted with Moore’s novel and Byron’s life that the
                    moody and impressionable poet often adopted the character of Zeluco, fancied
                    himself and felt himself to be a Zeluco, although he was at heart a very
                    different man. Moore’s other works have a less marked individuality, but his
                    sketches of society and manners in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, and
                    England furnish valuable materials for the social historian. Like his countrymen
                    Burnett and Boswell, he wàs a sagacious, penetrating, and in the main
                    unprejudiced observer, with something of a natural historian’s interest in the
                    human species; and he had exceptional opportunities of observation.</p>

                <p>He was a doctor by profession, and the son of a Stirlingshire clergyman. After
                    taking his medical degree at Glasgow, he served with the army in Flanders, then
                    was attached to the household of the English ambassador at Paris, then practised
                    for five years in Glasgow, next travelled on the Continent for five years with a
                    young nobleman, settled for some years as a physician in London, accompanied
                    Lord Lauderdale to Paris in 1792 and witnessed some of the principal scenes of
                    the Revolution. All classes thus came under his observation, while his
                    profession preserved him in an unusual degree from flippant bias. His works
                    attest great shrewdness and sagacity of judgment, and show no small skill in
                    literary presentation. He died at London in 1802.</p>
