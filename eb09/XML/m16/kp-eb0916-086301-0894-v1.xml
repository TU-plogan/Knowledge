                        (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1694-1755), well known as a church historian, but
                    also distinguished in his day as a master of eloquence, was born at Lübeck on
                    the 9th of October. There is some uncertainty as to the year, but the
                    probability is in favour of 1693 or 1694. He received a somewhat irregular
                    education at the gymnasium of his native place, and afterwards entered the
                    university of Kiel, where he took his master’s degree in 1718. His first
                    appearance in the field of literature was in a polemical tract against Toland,
                        <hi rend="italic">Vindicix antiques</hi><hi rend="italic">Christianorum
                        disciplinae</hi> (1720), which was soon followed by a volume of <hi
                        rend="italic">Observationes</hi><hi rend="italic">sacrx</hi> (1721). These
                    works, along with the reputation he had acquired as a lecturer on philosophy,
                    and also as a fervent and eloquent preacher while acting as assistant to
                    Albrecht zum Felde, his teacher and future father-in-law, secured for him a call
                    to a theological chair at Helmstadt, in 1723. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Institutionum</hi><hi rend="italic">Historix Eccle-siasticx</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic">IV.</hi> appeared in 1726 (2
                    vols., 12mo), and in the same year he was appointed by the duke of Brunswick
                    abbot of Marienthal, to which dignity and emolument the abbacy of Michaelstein
                    was added in the following year. Mosheim was much consulted by the authorities
                    when the new university of Göttingen was being formed; especially had he to do
                    with the framing of the statutes of the theological faculty, and with the
                    provisions for making the theologians independent of the ecclesiastical courts.
                    But having signed in 1726 a promise to remain in Helmstadt he was unable to
                    accept the call to the Georgia Augusta which was urgently pressed upon him,
                    until the year 1747, when the duke of Brunswick at last released him from his
                    obligation. To enhance the dignity he already possessed as a learned and
                    brilliant theological professor at Göttingen, a new office was specially created
                    for him, that of chancellor, which, however, proved somewhat burdensome,
                    exciting the jealousy of the nobles whom he governed. He died at Göttingen on
                    9th September</p>
                <p>1755, shortly after the completion of a new and greatly improved edition of his
                        <hi rend="italic">Church History.</hi></p>
                <p>I or Mosheim’s place as an ecclesiastical historian, see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Church History,</hi> vol. v. p. 765. In this department of literature, in
                    addition to the <hi rend="italic">Institutiones</hi> must be specially mentioned
                    his <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic">Christianorum</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">ante</hi><hi rend="italic">Constantinum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Magnum</hi><hi rend="italic">Commentarii</hi> (1753), and Gibbon’s just
                    criticism: “Less profound than Petavius, less independent than Le Clerc, less
                    ingenious than Beausobre, the historian Mosheim is full, rational, correct, and
                    moderate.” His exegetical writings, characterized by learning and good sense,
                    include <hi rend="italic">Cogitationes</hi><hi rend="italic">in N. T. loo.
                        select.</hi> (1726), and expositions of 1 Cor. (1741) and the two Epistles
                    to Timothy (1755). In his sermons <hi rend="italic">(Heilige</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Reden)</hi> considerable eloquence is shown, and a mastery of
                    style which justifies the position he held as president of the German Society.
                    There are two English versions of the <hi rend="italic">Institutes,</hi> that of
                    Maclaine, published in 1764, and that of Murdock (1832), which is much more
                    correct. The latter was revised and re-edited by Reid in 1848. An English
                    translation of the <hi rend="italic">De Rebus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Christianorum,</hi> begun in 1813 by Vidal, was completed and edited by
                    Murdock in 1851.</p>
