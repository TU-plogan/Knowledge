                <p><label type="entry">MONTGOMERY</label>, a district in the lieutenant-governorship
                    of the Punjab, lying between 29° 58' and 31° 33' N. lat., and between 72° 29'
                    and 74° 10' E. long., is bounded on the N.E. by Lahore, on the S.E. by the river
                    Sutlej, on the S.W. by Mûltân, and on the N.W. by Jhang. The area is 5573 square
                    miles. Montgomery district, formerly known as Gugaira, occupies a wide extent of
                    the Bâri Doâb, or wedge of land between the Sutlej and the Râvi, besides
                    stretching across the latter river into the adjoining Rechna Doâb. In the former
                    tract a fringe of cultivated lowland skirts the bank of either river, but the
                    whole interior upland consists of a desert plateau partially overgrown with
                    brushwood and coarse grass, and in places with impenetrable jungle. On the
                    farther side of the Râvi, again, the country at once assumes the same desert
                    aspect.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 returned the population at 359,437 (males 200,016, females
                    159,421), viz., Hindus, 69,805; Mohammedans, 277,291; Sikhs, 12,286; and
                    “others,” 55. The Jâts, or pastoral tribe, form the most distinctive class in
                    the district. They bear the name of “Great Râvi,” in contradistinction to the
                    purely agricultural classes, who are contemptuously styled <hi
                        rend="superscript"> 4</hi> ‘ Little Râvi.” They possess a fine physique,
                    with handsome features, claim a Rajput ancestry, and despise all who handle the
                    plough. In former days they exercised practical sovereignty over the
                    agricultural tribes. Only two towns in the district contain over 5000
                    inhabitants, viz., Pak Pattan (6086) and Kamalia (5695). The town of Montgomery,
                    the headquarters station, had a population of only 2416 in 1868.</p>
                <p>Out of a total assessed area of 3,569,746 acres, only 538,240 arc returned as
                    under cultivation. In 1872-73 the <hi rend="italic">rdbi</hi> (or spring
                    harvest) acreage was as follows:—wheat (the chief crop), 162,989 acres; barley,
                    30,134; gram, 21,416; mustard, 2077; and tobacco, 1303 acres. In the same year
                    the <hi rend="italic">kharif{or</hi> autumn harvest) acreage was:— <hi
                        rend="italic">-jodr,</hi> 20,509 acres; rice, 18,727; cotton, 16,916; <hi
                        rend="italic">til,</hi> 12,457; <hi rend="italic">kangni,</hi> 9493; and
                    sugar-cane, 498 acres. Irrigation is practised from rivers, canals, and wells;
                    the total area irrigated by public works is 66,495 acres, and by private works,
                    158,709. The desert uplands afford after the rains a scanty pasturage for the
                    scattered herds of the Great Râvi Jâts, and yield an impure carbonate of soda
                        <hi rend="italic">(sajji)</hi> from the alkaline plants with which they
                    abound. The commercial staples include wheat, rice, gram, millets, cotton, wool,
                        <hi rend="italic">ghi,</hi> hides, and <hi rend="italic">sajji.</hi> Large
                    numbers of camels are bred for exportation. The imports comprise sugar, salt,
                    oil, English piece goods, metals, indigo, and fruits. The manufactures consist
                    of country cloth, coarse striped silk, and lacquered wood-work. The Lahore and
                    Mûltân railway intersects the district, which is also traversed in every
                    direction by good unmetalled highways. The revenue of the district in 1871-72
                    amounted to £47,954, of which £42,355 was derived from the land-tax. Education
                    in 1871-72 was afforded by 59 aided and unaided schools, with a total of 1417
                    pupils. The average annual rainfall for the seven years ending 1872-73 was 9'6
                    inches.</p>
                <p>From time immemorial the Rechna Doâb has formed the home of a wild race of
                    pastoral Jâts, who have constantly maintained a sturdy independence against the
                    successive rulers of northern India. The historians of Alexander’s invasion
                    mention a tribe called the Cathaeans, who probably had their capital at Sangala
                    in the Jhang district, and the Malli with their metropolis at Mûltân, as in
                    possession of this part of the country. The sites of Kot Kamalia and Harappa in
                    Montgomery contain large mounds of antique bricks and other ruins, while many
                    other remains of ancient cities <pb break="no"

                    bank, or dot the now barren stretches of the central waste, clearly marking the
                    former existence of a considerable population. The pastoral tribes of this
                    barren expanse do not appear to have paid more than a nominal allegiance to the
                    Moslem rulers, and even in later days, when Ranjit Sinh extended the Sikh
                    supremacy as far as Mùltân, the country yielded little or no revenue, and the
                    population for the most part remained in a chronic state of rebellion. British
                    influence was first exercised in the district in 1847, when an officer was
                    deputed to effect a summary settlement of the land revenue. Direct British rule
                    was effected on the annexation of the Punjab in 1849. The only incident since
                    then was a general rising of the wild clans during the mutiny of 1857, several
                    actions being fought before the clans were defeated and dispersed and order
                    restored.</p>
