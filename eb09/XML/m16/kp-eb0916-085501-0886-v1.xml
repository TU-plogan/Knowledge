                    (1794-1870), one of the most refined and accomplished pianists of the present
                    century, was born at Prague, 30th May 1794, and first studied music at the
                    Conservatorium in that city under the direction of Dionys Weber. At the age of
                    fourteen he made his first appearance before the public in a pianoforte concerto
                    of his own composition with marked success. Soon after this he removed to
                    Vienna, where he studied counterpoint under Albrechtsberger and composition
                    under Salieri. In 1814 he prepared, with Beethoven’s consent, the pianoforte
                    arrangement of <hi rend="italic">Fidelio,</hi> afterwards published by Messrs
                    Artaria. In the following year he published his celebrated <hi rend="italic"
                        >Variationen</hi><hi rend="italic">uber den Alexandermarsch,</hi> a concert
                    piece of great difficulty, which he played with so great effect that he was at
                    once recognized as the most brilliant performer of the day. He then started on a
                    tour, during the course of which he visited most of the great capitals of
                    Europe, making his first appearance in London in 1822, and there securing the
                    friendship of Muzio Clementi and John Cramer, the fathers of the English school
                    of pianoforte playing. For a concert given by the latter he wrote his famous <hi

                        >Händel,</hi> a duet for two pianofortes, which afterwards became a lasting
                    favourite with the public. His reception in England was sufficiently encouraging
                    to justify his return in 1823, when he again met with a hearty welcome. During a
                    visit to Berlin in 1824 he first became acquainted with Mendelssohn, then a boy
                    of fifteen; and a friendship sprang up between them which was severed only by
                    Mendelssohn’s early death.</p>
                <p>In 1826 Moscheles relinquished his wandering habits, and settled permanently in
                    London, surrounding himself with a <hi rend="italic">clientèle</hi> fully
                    capable of appreciating his talents as an artist and his social worth as a firm
                    and loyal friend. His position was henceforth a more than ordinarily enviable
                    one. He was recognized from end to end of Europe as a <hi rend="italic"
                        >virtuoso</hi> of the highest rank; and his popularity both as a performer
                    and as a teacher was based on grounds which effectually secured it from the
                    caprice of changing fashion or ephemeral patronage. He was undoubtedly for some
                    considerable time the greatest executant of his age; but, using his brilliant
                    touch as a means and not as an end, he consistently devoted himself to the
                    further development of the true classical school, interpreting the works of the
                    great masters with conscientious fidelity, and in his extempore performances,
                    which were of quite exceptional excellence, exhibiting a fertility of invention
                    which never failed to please the most fastidious taste.</p>
                <p>In 1837 Moscheles conducted Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony at the Philharmonic
                    Society’s concerts with extraordinary success; and on this and other occasions
                    contributed not a little, by his skilful use of the baton, to the prosperity of
                    the time-honoured association. During the course of his long residence in London
                    he laboured incessantly in the cause of art, playing at innumerable concerts,
                    both public and private, and instructing a long line of pupils, who flocked to
                    him, in unbroken succession, until the year 1848, when, at Mendelssohn’s earnest
                    solicitation, he removed to Leipsic, to carry on a similar work at the
                    Conservatorium then recently founded in that city. In this new sphere he worked
                    with unabated zeal for more than twenty years, dying 10th March 1870.</p>
                <p>Moscheles’s most important compositions are his Pianoforte Concertos, Sonatas,
                    and Studies; his <hi rend="italic">Hommage à</hi><hi rend="italic">Händel</hi>;
                    and his three celebrated <hi rend="italic">Allegri di Bravura.</hi></p>
