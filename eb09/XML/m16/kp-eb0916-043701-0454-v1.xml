                    endowed with mind) was the Roman goddess who presided over all handicrafts,
                    inventions, arts, and sciences. She was probably an Etruscan deity, but her
                    character was modified on Roman soil through her identification with the Greek
                    Pallas Athena (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Athena). No</hi> legend of her birth is
                    recorded; the Roman deities were abstractions, not distinct persons with an
                    individual history. Her chief worship in Rome was in the temple built by Tarquin
                    on the Capitol, where she was worshipped side by side with Jupiter and Juno.
                    This foundation may be assigned to Etruscan influence. She had also an old
                    temple on the Aventine, which was a regular meeting-place for dramatic poets and
                    actors. The dedication day of the temple and birthday of the goddess was March
                    19, and this day was the great festival of Minerva, called <hi rend="italic"
                        >quinquatrus</hi> because it fell on the fifth day after the Ides. The
                    number five was sacred to the goddess. All the schools had holidays at this
                    time, and the pupils on reassembling brought a fee <hi rend="italic"
                        >(minerval')</hi> to the teachers. In every house also the <hi rend="italic"
                        >quinquatrus</hi> was a holiday, for Minerva was patron of the women’s
                    weaving and spinning and the workmen’s craft. At a later time the festival was
                    extended over five days, and games were celebrated. This feature is evidently
                    due to the Graecizing conception of Minerva as the goddess of war. To this same
                    Graecizing tendency we must attribute the <hi rend="italic">lectisternium</hi>
                    to Minerva and Neptune conjointly after the battle of the Trasimene Lake. The
                    23d had always been the day of the <hi rend="italic">tubilustrium,</hi> or
                    purification of the trumpets, so that the ceremony came to be on the last day of
                    Minerva’s festival. Trumpets were used in many religious ceremonies; and it is
                    very doubtful whether the <hi rend="italic">tubilustrium</hi> was really
                    connected with Minerva. There was another temple of Minerva on the Caelian Hill,
                    and a festival called the lesser <hi rend="italic">quinquatrus</hi> was
                    celebrated there on June 13-15, chiefly by the flute-players.</p>
                <p>Minerva of the Caelian temple was called Capta; June 19 was the foundation day of
                    this temple and the birthday of the goddess. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >palladium,</hi> an archaic image of Pallas, was brought from Troy to
                    Lavinium, and thence to Rome by the family of the Nautii; it was preserved in
                    the temple of Vesta as a pledge of the safety of the city. There are some traces
                    of an identification of Minerva with the Italian goddess Nerio, wife of Mars; it
                    is probable that March 19 was originally a feast of Mars.</p>
