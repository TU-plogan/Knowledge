                    compass and 165 feet in height, rises at a distance of nearly a mile from the
                    shore in the bay of St Michel, near the mouth of the Couësnon, at the vertex of
                    the angle formed by the coasts of Brittany and Normandy. The quicksands by which
                    it is surrounded, and which stretch far to seaward, are exposed at low water,
                    and highly dangerous to those who venture on them without a guide. Recently
                    efforts at reclamation have been made, and amongst other works a causeway has
                    been constructed connecting Mont St Michel with the nearest point of the
                    mainland (near Moidrey); an unfortunate consequence of these operations has been
                    that some portions of the ramparts of the island have been sapped by the altered
                    tidal currents. The fortress-abbey, to which the rock owes its fame, stands upon
                    the more precipitous side towards the north and west; the sloping portion
                    towards the east and south is occupied by dwellinghouses. The strong
                    machicolated and turreted wall by which the whole is surrounded is pierced only
                    by a single gateway. The northward wall of the abbey (La Merveille), dating from
                    the 13th century, is of remarkable boldness; it is 246 feet in length and 108
                    feet in height, is supported by twenty buttresses, and is pierced by a variety
                    of openings. The single street of the island, leading from the one gateway up to
                    the donjon of the fortress, is lined with houses, most of them used as
                    lodging-houses by visitors and pilgrims; it contains an old parish church, and
                    the house of Du Guesclin is also pointed out. The abbey consists principally of
                    two parallel buildings of three stories each, that on the east containing
                    hospitium, refectory, and dormitory, and that on the west the cellar, knights’
                    hall, and cloister. The knights’ hall is a superb piece of Gothic architecture,
                    measuring 85 feet by 59, with three rows of richly-ornamented pillars. The
                    cloister is one of the purest and most graceful works of the 13th century
                    (1228). The church has a number of imperfect turrets, and is surmounted by a
                    square tower of the 17 th century, with a statue of St Michael, which was
                    crowned in 1877. The nave, which dates from the 11th century, is Norman; but the
                    choir, which collapsed in 1421, has been rebuilt in the flamboyant style.

                <p>Mont St Michel was a sacred place even in the time of the Druids. It became a
                    seat of Christian worship in the 8th century, when a monastery was founded upon
                    it (with the usual miraculous accompaniments) by St Aubert, bishop of Avranches.
                    It soon became a favourite resort of pilgrims, not only from all parts of
                    France, but also from Great Britain and Ireland, and even from Italy. It was
                    plundered by the Normans; but Rollo, on his conversion, made restitution. At the
                    time of the Conquest it supplied William of Normandy with six ships, and
                    received a considerable share of the English spoils. About this time the monks
                    began to give themselves to learning and to collect a large library, and in the
                    12th century the establishment reached its highest prosperity. It was burnt by
                    the troops of Philip Augustus, who afterwards furnished large sums for its
                    restoration (La Merveille). St Louis (Louis IX. ) made a pilgrimage to Mont St
                    Michel, and was afterwards very liberal to it. During the hundred years’ war it
                    offered a memorable resistance to the English; and here, on 1st August 1469,
                    Louis XI. instituted the order of St Michel, and held a brilliant chapter. A
                    similar celebration was held by Francis I. During the religious wars the
                    Huguenots made repeated unsuccessful attempts to seize the fortress; it opened
                    its gates to Henry IV. after his abjuration. About 1615 the Benedictine monks of
                    Mont St Michel were replaced by monks of the Congregation of St Maur; after the
                    Revolution the abbey was used as a prison for political offenders. It is now an
                    historical monument; it contains an orphanage, and is undergoing repairs.</p>
