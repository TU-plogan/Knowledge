                    (1771-1854), poet and journalist, was justly described by Lord Byron, in a
                    footnote to <hi rend="italic">English Bards and Scotch Reviewers,</hi> as “a man
                    of considerable genius,” though it was going far beyond the mark to speak of his
                        <hi rend="italic">Wanderer of Switzerland</hi> (his first notable poem,
                    published in 1806) as being worth a thousand “Lyrical Ballads.” Montgomery was
                    born 4th November 1771, at Irvine in Ayrshire, Scotland. Part of his boyhood was
                    spent in Ireland, but he received his education in Yorkshire, at the Moravian
                    school of Fulneck, named after the original home of the Moravians, to which sect
                    his father belonged. He drifted at an early age into journalism, and edited the
                        <hi rend="italic">Sheffield Iris</hi> for more than thirty years. When he
                    began his career the position of a Dissenting journalist was a difficult one,
                    and he twice suffered imprisonment (in 1795 and 1796) on charges that now seem
                    absurdly forced and unfair. His <hi rend="italic">Wanderer</hi> was mercilessly
                    ridiculed by the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review,</hi> but in spite of this
                    Montgomery published many poems, which had a wide popularity :— <hi
                        rend="italic">The West Indies,</hi> 1810; <hi rend="italic">The World Before
                        the Flood,</hi> 1812; <hi rend="italic">Greenland,</hi> 1819; <hi
                        rend="italic">Songs of Zion,</hi> 1822; <hi rend="italic">The Pelican
                        Island,</hi> 1827. On account of the religious character of his poetry, he
                    is sometimes confounded with Robert Montgomery, very much to the injustice of
                    his reputation. The inspiring force of James Montgomery’s poetry was the
                    humanitarian sentiment which has been such a power in the political changes of
                    this century, and the pulse of this sentiment is nowhere felt beating more
                    strongly than in his verse. His poetry has thus an historical interest
                    altogether apart from its intrinsic value as poetry. But this value is far from
                    contemptible or commonplace. Strictly speaking, Montgomery was more of a
                    rhetorician than a poet, but his imagination was bold, ardent, and fertile, and
                    more than one of his greater contemporaries owed occasional debts to his
                    vigorous invention and even to his casual felicities of diction, while some
                    passages from his poems keep a place in the literature that is universally read
                    and quoted. At the close of his career as a journalist, when all parties agreed
                    in paying him respect, he claimed for his poetry that it was at least not
                    imitative, and the claim was just as regarded conception and choice of subjects;
                    but as regards diction and imagery the influence of Campbell is very apparent in
                    his earlier poems, and the influence of Shelley is supreme in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Pelican Island,</hi> his last and best work as a poet. His <hi
                        rend="italic">Lectures on Poetry and General Literature,</hi> published in
                    1833, show considerable breadth of sympathy and power of expression. <hi
                        rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> of him were published in seven volumes in 1856-8.
                    They furnish valuable materials for the history of English provincial politics
                    in the 19 th century. He died at Sheffield 30th April 1854.</p>
