                        >Valladolid,</hi> a city of Mexico, capital of the state of Michoacan de
                    Ocampo, is situated 125 miles west by north of Mexico, at a height of 6400 feet
                    above the sea, in 19° 42' N. lat. and 101° W. long. The site is a rocky hill on
                    the Guayangareo valley, and the western horizon is bounded by the great Quinceo
                    mountain (11,000 feet). Since the middle of the century a considerable extension
                    of the city has taken place, especially towards the north: its streets, which
                    run for the most part at right angles to each other, had increased from thirty
                    in 1856 to ninety-nine in 1873. The principal square is the Plaza de los
                    Martires (formerly de Armas), where Matamoros was shot by the Spaniards in 1814;
                    its one side is occupied by the cathedral (1745), a large building with two
                    towers about 200 feet high. The churches of the Carmelites (del Carmen) and San
                    José are of some note, and of the nine convents, now for the most part in ruins,
                    several were wealthy and extensive. That of the Capuchins is now used as a
                    hospital, the old seminary has been turned into a state-house, and the tobacco
                    factory, one of the most ancient buildings in the city, serves as municipal
                    offices. An important institution, supported by the state, is the college of San
                    Nicolas de Hidalgo, originally founded by Juan de San Miguel in the 16th century
                    and rebuilt in 1868. The Ocampo theatre dates from 1869-1870. Water is brought
                    from a distance of about 3 miles by a fine aqueduct, constructed in 1788 by D.
                    Antonio de San Miguel, but the quality is often deteriorated by the presence of
                    vegetable matter. Morelia lies too far from any great natural route to have much
                    commerce in the present <pb break="no"
