                <p><label type="entry">GOUGH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard</hi></label> (1735-1809),
                    an English antiquary, was the son of a wealthy East India director, and was bom
                    in London, October 1, 1735. He received his early education privately, and his
                    literary talents developed with such precocity that, at the age of twelve and a
                    half years, he had completed the translation of a history of the Bible from the
                    French, which his mother printed for private circulation; at the age of fifteen
                    he wrote a translation of Fleury’s work on the customs of the Israelites; and at
                    sixteen he had published an elaborate work entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Atlas</hi><hi rend="italic">Renovatus,</hi><hi rend="italic">or Geography
                        modernized.</hi> In 1752 he entered Benet College, Cambridge, where his
                    taste for antiquarian research received additional impulse, and where he
                    commenced his work on British topography, which was published in 1768. After
                    leaving Cambridge in 1756, he began a series of antiquarian excursions in
                    various parts of Great Britain, the fruit of which was seen in the volumes which
                    he subsequently published. In 1773 he began to prepare an edition in English of
                    Camden’s <hi rend="italic">Britannia,</hi> but <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit11newyrich/page/n12/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0012-0003"/> the work did not appear till 1789. Meantime
                    he published, in 1786, the first volume of his splendid work, the <hi
                        rend="italic">Sepulchral Monuments of Great Britain, applied to illustrate
                        the history of families, manners, habits, and arts at the different periods
