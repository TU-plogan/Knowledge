                        Earl</hi></label> (1690-1763), English statesman, son of George, Lord
                    Carteret, was born 22d April 1690, and in his fifth year succeeded to his
                    father’s title. He was'educated at Westminster school and at Christ Church,
                    Oxford, and even early in life had acquired a knowledge of the classics, of
                    philosophy, of general literature, and of modern languages, which rendered him
                    perhaps superior to all his contemporaries in the extent of his intellectual
                    accomplishments. Soon after taking his seat in the House of Lords in 1711, he
                    began to distinguish himself by his eloquent advocacy of the Protestant
                    succession, and his zeal was rewarded when George I. came to the throne, by the
                    appointment in 1715 of bailiff of the island of Jersey, and in 1716 of
                    lord-lieutenant of Devon; and his mother was also created countess of Granville.
                    In 1719 he was senton an embassy to Sweden; and in 1720 he was named
                    ambassador-extraordinary to the congress of Cambray. In May of the following
                    year he was appointed secretary of state under Walpole’s administration; but
                    Walpole’s jealousy of his influence with the king led to his resignation on the
                    3d April 1724, and on the same day he was appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland,
                    an office which he held till 1730, when differences with the ministry led to his
                    resignation. After his return he became the leader of the opposition, the duties
                    of which office he discharged with great versatility of resource and with
                    frequent effectiveness, but with a negligent rashness which rendered him almost
                    as dangerous to his friends as to his opponents. In 1742 he was at last
                    successful in overthrowing Sir Robert Walpole’s Government, and was immediately
                    thereafter appointed secretary of state. He now obtained a complete ascendency
                    over the mind of George II., whose German policy he carried out irrespective of
                    the opinions of his colleagues; but his imperiousness soon gained him both their
                    enmity and the hatred of the people, and enabled his opponents, for whom he
                    cherished unmitigated contempt, to effect his political annihilation. Pitt,
                    afterwards earl of Chatham, spoke of him as “an execrable, a sole minister, who
                    had renounced the British nation, and seemed to have <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0911-0062-0053"/> drunk of the potion described in poetic
                    fiction, which made men forget their country.” In 1744 he found it necessary,
                    from the resignation of his colleagues and his inability to find proper
                    successors, to tender his resignation; and, according to Horace Walpole, he
                    “retired from St James’s laughing.” Shortly before this he had, by the death of
                    his mother, become Earl Granville. His administration was popularly
                    distinguished by the epithet “drunken ”—a title which had reference to his
                    character both as a politician and as a private individual. Notwithstanding his
                    want of political success, contemporary opinion is unanimous in affirming that
                    he was not only the most brilliant debater but the ablest statesman of his time.
                    Chatham declared that he owed all that he was to his friendship and instruction,
                    and Swift, Smollett, Chesterfield, and Horace Walpole have borne equally
                    laudatory testimony to his abilities. He was besides regarded as an authority in
                    questions of scholarship by the most eminent classicists of his time, and
                    Bentley was greatly indebted to his assistance in preparing his edition of
                    Homer. His fatal defects appear to have been his careless arrogance and his
                    deficiency in definite political principle and purpose. After the resignation of
                    the Pelham ministry he was again appointed secretary of state, but almost
                    immediately resigned, holding office, according to a political squib, for only
                    forty-eight hours, three quarters, seven minutes, and eleven seconds. In 1749 he
                    was created knight of the garter and appointed president of the council; but,
                    though he retained his influence with the king, the part he thenceforth played
                    in English politics was indirect and subordinate. He died January 2, 1763.</p>
