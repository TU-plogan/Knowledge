                    (1810-1839), a French poet, whose few compositions in prose and verse, published
                    posthumously, show him to have possessed a true and rare genius, was descended
                    from a noble but poor family, and was born at the chateau of Le Cayla in
                    Languedoc, 4th August 1810. He was educated with a view to the church at a
                    religious seminary at Toulouse, and then at the Collège Stanislas, Paris, after
                    which he procured entrance to the society at La Chesnaye in Brittany, founded by
                    Lamennais, bishop of Rennes. Here his most intimate companions were persons
                    whose tastes were literary rather than ecclesiastical; and his dreamy and
                    meditative temperament found its solace and happiness more in intercourse with
                    nature than in theological study or the exercises of piety. It was therefore
                    only after great hesitation, and without being satisfied as to his religious
                    vocation, that under the influence of Lamennais he joined the new religious
                    order in August 1833; and when, in September of the same year, Lamennais, who
                    had come under the displeasure of Rome, severed connexion with the society,
                    Guérin’s doubts as to his vocation returned in full force, and on the 7th
                    October he renounced his novitiate. Early in the following year he went to
                    Paris, where he obtained an engagement on the periodical press, but finding it
                    impossible to submit to the mental drudgery of continuous literary work he
                    became a teacher at the Collège Stanislas. In November 1838 he married a Creole
                    lady of some fortune; but a few months afterwards he was attacked by a malady
                    which proved to be consumption, and which terminated by death his short period
                    of leisure and happiness, 19th July 1839. In the <hi rend="italic">Revue des
                        Deux Mondes</hi> for May 15, 1840, there appeared a notice of Guérin by
                    George Sand, to which she added two fragments of his writings—one a composition
                    in prose entitled the <hi rend="italic">Centaur,</hi> and the other a short
                    poem. His <hi rend="italic">Reliquiae,</hi> including the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Centaur,</hi> his journal, a number of his letters, and several poems
                    edited by G. S. Trébutien, and accompanied with a biographical and critical
                    notice by Sainte-Beuve, appeared in 1860 in two volumes; and a translation of it
                    was published at New York in 1867. Though Guérin was essentially a poet, his
                    prose is more striking and original than his poetry. Its peculiar and unique
                    charm arises from his strong and absorbing passion for nature, a passion whose
                    intensity reached almost to adoration and worship, but in which the pagan was
                    more prominent than the moral element. According to Sainte-Beuve, “no French
                    poet or painter has rendered so well the feeling for nature—the feeling not so
                    much for details as for the <hi rend="italic">ensemble</hi> and the divine
                    universality, the feeling for the origin of things and the sovereign principle
                    of life.”</p>

                        rend="smallcaps">Guérin</hi> (1805-1848), the sister of Maurice, cannot be
                    omitted from any notice of him, if only on account of the ties of love that
                    united them; but her <hi rend="italic">Journals,</hi> published in 1861, English
                    translation 1865, and her <hi rend="italic">Lettres,</hi> published in 1864,
                    English traυsla tion 1865, indicated the possession of gifts of as rare an order
                    as those of her brother, though of a somewhat different kind. In her case
                    mysticism assumed a form more strictly religious, and she continued to mourn her
                    brother’s loss of his early Catholic faith. Five years older than he, she
                    cherished a love for him which was blended with a somewhat motherly anxiety. In
                    him she centred her chief earthly hopes, and after his death her only remaining
                    earthly purpose was to rescue his name from oblivion by the collection and
                    publication of the scattered fragments of his writings. She died, however, on
                    the 31st May 1848, before her task was completed.</p>
