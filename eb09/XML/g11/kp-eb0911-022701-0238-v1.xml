                    specimens procured at Sarayacu in Ecuador, Caxamarca in the Peruvian Andes, and
                    Antioquia in New Grenada <hi rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1878, pp.
                    139, 140; 1879, p. 532), its range has been shown to be much greater than had
                    been supposed. The singularity of its structure, its curious habits, and its
                    peculiar economical value have naturally attracted no little attention, and it
                    has formed the subject of investigation by a considerable number of zoologists
                    both British and foreign. First referring it to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Caprimulgus,</hi> its original describer soon saw that it was no true
                    Goatsucker. It was subsequently separated as forming a Subfamily, and has at
                    last been regarded as the type of a distinct Family, <hi rend="italic"

                    which, though not put forth till 1870 <hi rend="italic">(Zook Record,</hi> vi.
                    p. 67), seems now to be generally deemed correct. Its systematic position,
                    however, can scarcely be considered settled, for though on the whole its
                    predominat ing alliance may be with the <hi rend="italic">Cajnjmulgidoe,</hi>
                    nearly as much affinity may be traced to the <hi rend="italic">Strigidoe,</hi>
                    while it possesses some characters in which it differs from both <hi
                        rend="italic">(Proc. Zool. Society,</hi> 1873, pp. 526-535). About as big as
                    a Crow, its plumage exhibits the blended tints of chocolate-colour and grey,
                    barred and pencilled with dark brown or black, and spotted in places with white,
                    that prevail in the two families just named. The beak is hard, strong, and
                    deeply notched, the nostrils are prominent, and the gape is furnished with
                    twelve long hairs on each side. The legs and toe3 are comparatively feeble, but
                    the wings are large. In habits the Guacharo is wholly nocturnal, slumbering by
                    day in deep and dark caverns which it frequents in vast numbers. Towards evening
                    it arouses itself, and, with croaking and clattering which has been likened to
                    that of castanets, it approaches the exit of its retreat, whence at nightfall it
                    issues in search of its food, which, so far as is known, consists entirely of
                    oily nuts or fruits, belonging especially to the genera <hi rend="italic"
                        >Achras, Aiphanas,</hi><hi rend="italic">Loeurus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Psichotma,</hi> some of them sought, it would seem, at a very great
                    distance, for M. Funck <hi rend="italic">(BuU. Acad. Sc. Bruxelles,</hi> xi. pt.
                    2, pp. 371 — 377) states that in the stomach of one he obtained at Caripé he
                    found the seed of a tree which he believed did not grow nearer than 80 leagues.
                    The bard, indigestible seeds swallowed by the Guacharo are found in quantities
                    on the floor and the ledges of the caverns it frequents, where many of them for
                    a time vegetate, the plants thus growing being etiolated from want of light,
                    and, according to travellers, forming a singular feature of the gloomy scene
                    which these places present. The Guacharo is said to build a bowl-like nest of
                    clay, in which it lays from two to four white eggs, with a smooth but lustreless
                    surface, resembling those of some Owls. The young soon after they are hatched
                    become a perfect mas3 of fat, and while yet in the nest are sought by the
                    Indians, who at Caripé, and perhaps elsewhere, make a special business of taking
                    them and extracting the oil they contain. This is done about midsummer, when by
                    the aid of torches and long poles many thousands of the young birds are
                    slaughtered, while their parents in alarm and rage hover over the destroyers’
                    heads, uttering harsh and deafening cries. The grease is melted over fires
                    kindled at the cavern’s mouth, run into earthen pots, and preserved for use in
                    cooking as well as for the lighting of lamps. It is said to be pure and limpid,
                    free from any disagreeable taste or smell, and capable of being kept for a year
                    without turning rancid. In Trinidad the young are esteemed a great delicacy for
                    the table by many, though some persons object to their peculiar scent, which,
                    says Léotaud <hi rend="italic">(Ois.</hi><hi rend="italic">de la</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Trinidad,</hi> p. 68) resembles that of a Cockroach <hi

                    birds also, according to Mr E. C. Taylor <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1864, p.
                    90) have a strong Crow-like odour. But one species of the genus <hi
