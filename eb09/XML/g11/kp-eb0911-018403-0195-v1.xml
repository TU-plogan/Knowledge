                <p><label type="entry">GRENOBLE</label>, a fortified city of France, formerly the
                    chief town of Dauphiné and now of the department of the Isère, lies 58 miles E.
                    of Lyons, in 45° 11' 57" N. lat. and 5° 43' 29" E. long. Few of the cities of
                    France have a finer situation. The Isère unites with the Drac a few miles
                    further down, and the broad and fertile valley through which the rivers flow is
                    encompassed by a fine panorama of hills and mountains. From the botanic gardens,
                    for example, the eastward view comprises the Savoy Alps with the summit of Mount
                    Blanc, and the westward the mountains of St Nizier, while more to the north the
                    hills rise directly above the town, and are crowned by the fort of the Bastille.
                    The beauty of the Isère itself is enhanced by fine bridges <pb break="no"

                    modern portions, the town of Grenoble is characterized by the tortuous and
                    crowded streets usual in places that have long been confined within strong
                    fortifications. The cathedral of Notre Dame, a vast brick building of various
                    periods from the 10th to the 17th century, the foundation of which is
                    traditionally ascribed to Charles the Great; the church of St Laurence, with a
                    remarkable crypt of the 11th century, long believed to be an old temple of
                    Aesculapius: and the church of St André, founded by the dauphin Guigues André
                    about 1220, and frequently visited for the sake of the tomb of Bayard removed
                    thither in 1822, are the most noteworthy of the ecclesiastical edifices. The
                    palais de justice is a striking erection of the 15th and 16th centuries
                    occupying the site of the old castle of the dauphins, and in front is a statue
                    of Bayard dating from 1823. The old town-hall hae nothing remarkable about it;
                    but the new prefecture, built at a cost of 1,404,000 francs about 1867, is a
                    handsome structure. Besides its university or academy, with the three faculties
                    of law, science, and literature,</p>
                <p>Grenoble possesses a lyceum, an episcopal seminary, a school of artillery of the
                    first class, two normal schools, and a great variety of special educational
                    institutions. The library, which since 1868 has been located along with the
                    museum in a building which cost more than 1,500,000 francs, is a noble
                    collection of upwards of 178,875 volumes, on which the town has expended
                    2,000,000 francs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    societies of Grenoble it is enough to mention the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Academie</hi><hi rend="italic">delphinale</hi> (1772), the statistical
                    society, the society of the friends of the arts, the society of agriculture, and
                    the zoological society of the Alps, which maintains zoological gardens. At the
                    head of the benevolent institutions is the general hospital, originally founded
                    by Aimon Chissay in 1424, and now comprising civil and military departments, an
                    orphanage, and an asylum for the aged and infirm. It was in Grenoble that the
                    first mutual benefit society was founded in 1803, and the number of such
                    associations in the town was upwards of 40 about 1870. In 1836 M. Berriat Saint
                    Prix established a society for the extinction of mendicity, and in 1851 M.
                    Frédéric originated an <hi rend="italic">association</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >alimentaire</hi> for the purpose of providing the poorer classes with good
                    food at the cheapest possible rate. The staple industry of Grenoble is the
                    making of gloves; 115 establishments, employing 2000 workmen and 20,000
                    needlewomen in the town and neighbourhood, turn out annually 850,000 dozen
                    pairs. Liqueurs, leather, straw hats, paper, lime, and cement hold a principal
                    place among the miscellaneous products. The population of Grenoble was 26,852 in
                    1851, 35,280 in 1872, and 43,054 in 1876.</p>
                <p>Grenoble occupies the site of Cularo, a village of the Allobroges which first
                    became of importance when it was fortified by Diocletian and Maximian. Its
                    present name is a corruption of Gratianopolis, a title assumed in honour of
                    Gratian, who had strengthened the walls. From the Burgundians who gained
                    possession in 467 the little town passed under the Franks, and on the
                    dismemberment of the empire of Charles the Great it was included in the limits
                    of Cisjuran Burgundy. After the 10th century its bishops grew into power, but
                    they were finally supplanted in the 13th century by the counts of Λlbon,
                    afterwards known as the Dauphins. Though it was ceded in 1349 to France along
                    with Dauphiné, the city continued to enjoy special privileges. In 1563 it was
                    sacked by the Baron des Adrets, but in 1572 the energy of its governor De Gorde
                    saved it from sh≡ ’ ing in tħe massacre of St Bartholomew. Lesdiguières (Roi des
                    Montagnes) took the town by siege in 1590 in name of Henry IV., and he
                    afterwards made his governorship memorable by his fortifications, quays, and
                    other serviceable enterprises. In the close of the 18th century the name of
                    Grenoble appears in the van of the revolutionary movement; the attempt of the
                    Government to substitute a new judicial régime for that of the too independent
                    provincial parliament roused the people to arms and the ‘ ‘ day of the tilee”
                    (7th June 1788) is memorable for the defeat of the royal forces. Grenoble was
                    the first town to open its gates to Napoleon on his return from Elba in 1815,
                    but a few months afterwards it was obliged to surrender to the Austrians. Owing
                    to its situation Grenoble is subject to inundations; in 1219 it was almost swept
                    away, and from that date to 1856 no fewer than 15 similar disasters are
                    enumerated. The great flood of 1778 is known as the “Déluge de la Saint Crépin.”
                    In 1859 the water was 3 feet deep throughout the town. Among the celebrated
                    natives of Grenoble are Vaucanson, Mably, Condillac, Beyle (Stendhal), Barnave,
                    and Casimir Perier.</p>
