                        August</hi></label> (1803-1851), a missionary to China, was born at Pyritz
                    in Pomerania, 8th July 1803. At an early age he cherished a strong desire to
                    become a foreign missionary, but the poverty of his parents made it impossible
                    for them to aid him in attaining his wishes, and he became apprentice to a
                    saddler in Stettin. In 1821, however, he made known his inclination to the king
                    of Prussia, through whom he obtained admission to the Pädagogium at Halle, and
                    afterwards to the mission institute of Jänike in Berlin. In 1826, under the
                    auspices of the Netherlands Missionary Society, he went to Batavia, where by
                    intercourse with the Chinese residents he perfected himself in the Chinese
                    language. He, however, severed his connexion with the Netherlands Society in
                    1828, and went to Singapore; and in August of the same year he removed to
                    Bangkok, the capital of Siam, where he occupied himself with translating the
                    Bible into Siamese. In 1829 he married an English lady, who aided him in the
                    preparation of a dictionary of Cochin China, but she died in August 1831 before
                    its completion. Shortly after her death he sailed to Macao in China, where, and
                    subsequently at Hong Kong, he worked at a translation of the Bible into Chinese,
                    published a Chinese monthly magazine, and wrote in Chinese various books on
                    subjects of useful knowledge. He also at different times undertook voyages on
                    the coast of China, and in 1834 he published at London an account of them under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">Journal of Three Voyages along the Coast of China
                        in</hi> 1831, 1832, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> 1833. He was appointed in

                    rendered valuable service by his knowledge of the country and people. On account
                    of the continued refusal of the Chinese authorities to permit foreigners to
                    penetrate into the interior, Giitzlaff in 1844 founded an institute for the
                    training of native missionaries, which was so successful that during the first
                    four years as many as forty-eight Chinese were sent out from it to carry on
                    missionary labours among their fellow-countrymen. He died at Hong Kong, August
                    9, 1851.</p>
