                    later ecclesiastical tradition <hi rend="smallcaps">Thaumaturgus</hi> (the
                    miracle-worker), was born of noble and wealthy heathen parents at Neocaesarea,
                    towards the beginning of the 3d century of the Christian era. His original name
                    was Theodorus. Destined by his parents for the bar, he studied civil law at
                    Athens, Alexandria, and Berytus, it is said; he afterwards (about 231)
                    accompanied his sister to Caesarea in Palestine, where he became the pupil and
                    finally the convert of Origen. In returning to Cappadocia some five years after
                    his conversion, it had been his original intention to live a retired ascetic
                    life (Euseb., <hi rend="italic">H. E.,</hi> vj. 30); but this wish he was not
                    permitted to gratify. Urged by Origen, and at last almost compelled by Phaedimus
                    of Amasia, his metropolitan, neither of whom was willing to see so much
                    learning, piety, and masculine energy practically lost to the church, he, after
                    many attempts to evade the dignity, was consecrated bishop of his native town
                    (about 240). His episcopate, which lasted some thirty years, was characterized
                    by great zeal, and by so mueh success that, according to the (doubtless somewhat
                    rhetorical) statement of Gregory of Nyssa, whereas at the outset of his labours
                    there were only seventeen Christians in the city, there were at his death only
                    seventeen persons in all who had not embraced Christianity. This result he
                    achieved in spite of the Decian persecution (250), during which he had felt it
                    to be his duty to absent himself from his diocese, and notwithstanding the
                    demoralizing effects of an irruption of barbarians who laid waste the diocese in
                    260. Gregory, although he has not always escaped the charge of Sabellianism, now
                    holds an undisputed place among the fathers of the church; and although the turn
                    of his mind was practical rather than speculative, he is known to have taken an
                    energetic part in most of the doctrinal controversies of his time. He was active
                    at the synods of Antioch which investigated and condemned the heresies of Paul;
                    and the rapid spread in Pontus of a Trinitarianism approaching the Nicene type
                    is attributed in large measure to the weight of his influence. Gregory is
                    believed to have died in the reign of Aurelian, about the year 270, though some
                    accounts place his death six years earlier. His festival (semiduplex) is
                    observed by the Church of Rome on the 17th of November. For the facts of his
                    biography our earliest and best authority is the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> or
                    rather <hi rend="italic">Panegyric</hi> by Gregory of Nyssa; but there are also
                    incidental notices of him in the writings of Basil the Great. Both these writers
                    represent him as having wrought miracles of a very startling description; but
                    nothing related by them comes near the astounding narratives given in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Martyrologies,</hi> or even in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Breviarium</hi><hi rend="italic">Bomanum,</hi> in connexion with his
                    name.</p>
                <p>The principal works of Gregory Thaumaturgus are the <hi rend="italic"

                    that great master; a <hi rend="italic">Metap&gt;hrasis in Ecclesiasten,</hi>
                    characterized by Jerome as “short but useful”; and an <hi rend="italic">Epistola
                        Canonica,</hi> which treats of the discipline to be undergone by those
                    Christians who under pressure of persecution had relapsed into paganism, but
                    desired to be restored to the privileges of the church. An <hi rend="italic"
                        >Expositio Fidei,</hi> usually attributed to Gregory, and traditionally
                    alleged to have been received by him immediately in vision from the apostle John
                    himself, is of doubtful authenticity. There have been several editions of the
                    works of this father; of these may be mentioned that of Gerard Voss, in Greek
                    and Latin (Mainz, 1604); the Paris edition of 1622; and that contained in the
                    third volume of Galland’s <hi rend="italic">Bibliotheca Patrum</hi> (Paris,
                    1788). They are also to be found in a Latin translation in Migne’s <hi

                        Origenem</hi> was published by Bengel in 1722. The life of Gregory has been
                    written by Pallavicini (Rome, 1644) and by Boye (Jena, 1703).</p>
