                    if ever to bear among those who, from their vocation, are most conversant with
                    it, though, according to Willughby and Ray his translator, it was°in their time
                    so called “by those of Northumberland and Durham.” Around the coasts of Britain
                    it is variously known as the Frowl, Kiddaw or Skiddaw, Langy <hi rend="italic"
                        >(ef.</hi> Icelandic, <hi rend="italic">Langula),</hi> Lavy, Marrock, Murre,
                    Scout (cf. <hi rend="smallcaps">Coot,</hi> vol. vi. p. 341), Scuttock, Strany,
                    Tinker or Tinkershire, and Willock. The number of local names testifies to the
                    abundance of this bird, at least of old time, in different places, but it should
                    be observed that in certain districts some of them are the common property of
                    this species and the Razor-bill. In former days the Guillemot yearly frequented
                    the cliffs on many parts of the British coasts in countless multitudes, and this
                    is still the case in the northern parts of the United Kingdom; but more to the
                    southward nearly all its smaller settlements have been rendered utterly desolate
                    by the wanton and cruel destruction of their tenants during the breeding season,
                    and even the inhabitants of those which were more crowded had become so thinned
                    that, but for the intervention of the Sea Birds Preservation Act (32 and 33
                    Vict. cap. 17), which provided under penalty for the safety of this and certain
                    other species at the time of year when they were most exposed to danger, they
                    would unquestionably by this time have been exterminated so far as England is
                    concerned. The slaughter, which, before the passing of that Act, took place
                    annually on the cliffs of the Isle of Wight, near Flamborough Head, and at such
                    other stations frequented by this species and its allies the Razor-bill and
                    Puffin, and the Kittiwake-Gull, as could be easily reached by excursionists from
                    London and the large manufacturing towns, was in the highest degree brutal. No
                    use whatever could be made of the bodies of the victims, which indeed those who
                    indulged in their massacre were rarely at the trouble to pick out of the water;
                    the birds shot were all engaged in breeding; and most of them had young, which
                    of course starved to death through the destruction of their parents, intercepted
                    in the performance of the most sacred duty of nature, and butchered to gratify
                    the murderous lust of those who sheltered themselves under the name of
                    “sportsmen.”</p>
                <p>Part of the Guillemot’s history is still little understood. We know that it
                    arrives at its wonted breeding stations on its accustomed day in spring, that it
                    remains there till, towards the end of summer, its young are hatched and able,
                    as they soon are, to encounter the perils of a seafaring life, when away go all,
                    parents and progeny. After that time it commonly happens that a few examples are
                    occasionally met with in bays and shallow waters. Tempestuous weather will drive
                    ashore a large number in a state of utter destitution—many of them indeed are
                    not unfrequently washed up dead—but what becomes of the bulk of the birds, not
                    merely the comparatively few thousands that are natives of Britain, but the tens
                    and hundreds of thousands, not to say millions, that are in summer denizens of
                    more northern latitudes, no one can yet say. This mystery is not peculiar to the
                    Guillemot, but is shared by all the <hi rend="italic">Alcidae</hi> that inhabit
                    the Atlantic Ocean. Examples stray every season across the Bay of Biscay, are
                    found off the coasts of Spain and Portugal, enter the Mediterranean and <pb

                    south, may even touch the Madeiras, Canaries, or Azores; but these bear no
                    proportion whatever to the mighty hosts of whom they are literally the “scouts,”
                    and whose position and movements they no more reveal than do the vedettes of a
                    well-appointed army. The common Guillemot of both sides of the Atlantic is
                    replaced further northward by a species with a stouter bill, the <hi
                        rend="italic">U. arra</hi> or <hi rend="italic">U. bruennichi</hi> of
                    ornithologists, and on the west coast of North America by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >U. californica.</hi> The habits of all these are essentially the same, and
                    the structural resemblance between all of them and the Auks is so great that of
                    late several systematists have relegated them to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alea,</hi> confining the genus <hi rend="italic">Uria</hi> to the
                    Guillemots of another group, of which the type is the <hi rend="italic">U.
                        grylla,</hi> the Black Guillemot of British authors, the Dovekey or
                    Greenland Dove of sailors, the Tysty of Shetlanders. This bird assumes in summer
                    an entirely black plumage with the exception of a white patch on each wing,
                    while in winter it is beautifully marbled with white and black. Allied to it as
                    species or geographical races are the <hi rend="italic">U. maηdti,</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">U. columba,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">U. carbo.</hi> All
                    these differ from the larger Guillemots by laying two or three eggs, which are
                    generally placed in some secure niche, while the members of the other group lay
                    but a single egg, which is invariably exposed on a bare ledge. <hi
