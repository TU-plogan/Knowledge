                    Church, was bom about 257 <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> He belonged to the
                    royal race of the Arsacides, being the son of a certain Prince Anak, who
                    assassinated Chosroes of Armenia, and thus brought ruin on himself and his
                    family. His mother’s name was Okohe, and the Armenian biographers tell how the
                    first Christian influence he received was at the time of his conception, which
                    took place near the monument raised to the memory of the holy apostle Thaddeus.
                    Educated by a Christian nobleman, Euthalius, in Caesarea in Cappadocia, Gregory
                    sought, when he came to man’s estate, to introduce the Christian doctrine into
                    his native land. At that time Tiridates I., a son of Chosroes, sat on the
                    throne, and, influenced partly it may be by the fact that Gregory was the son of
                    his father’s enemy, he subjected him to much cruel usage, and imprisoned him for
                    fourteen years. It would he useless to relate the various forms of torture which
                    the orthodox accounts represent the saint to have endured without permanent
                    hurt; almost any one of his twelve trials would have been certain death to an
                    ordinary mortal. But vengeance and madness fell on the king, and at length
                    Gregory was called forth from his pit to restore his royal persecutor to reason
                    by virtue of his saintly intercession. The cause of Christianity was now
                    secured; king and princes and people vied with each other in obedience to
                    Gregory’s instruction, and convents, churches, and schools were established.
                    Gregory in 302 received consecration as patriarch of Armenia from Leontius of
                    Caesarea, and in 318 he appointed his son Aristax to be his successor. About 331
                    he withdrew to a cave in the mountain Sebuh in the province of Daranalia in
                    Upper Armenia, and there he died a few years afterwards unattended and
                    unobserved. When it was discovered that he was dead his corpse was removed to
                    the village of Thordanum or Thortan. The remains of the saint were scattered far
                    and near in the reign of Zeno. His head is said to be now in Italy, his right
                    hand at Etchmiadzin, and his left at Sis. It is almost impossible to get at
                    Gregory’s real personality through the tangled growth of ecclesiastical legend;
                    but he would appear to have possessed some of that consideration for expediency
                    which is so frequently of service to the reformer. While he did his best to
                    undermine their system, he left the pagan priests in enjoyment of their
                    accustomed revenues.</p>
                <p>A number of homffies, possibly spurious, several prayers, and about thirty of the
                    canons of the Armenian Church are ascribed te Gregory. The homilies appeared for
                    the first time in a work called <hi rend="italic">Hαsehαehαpαdαm</hi> at
                    Constantinople in 1737; a century afterwards a Greek translation was published
                    at Venice by the Mekhiterists; and they have since been edited in German by J.
                    Μ. Schmid (Ratisbon, 1872). The original authorities for Gregory’s life are
                    Agathangelos, whose <hi rend="italic">History of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Tiridates</hi> was published by the Mekhitarists in 1835; Moses of Chorene,
