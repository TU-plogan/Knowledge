                        rend="italic">(gryphus, γpνψ),</hi> in the natural history of the ancients,
                    the name of an imaginary rapacious creature of the eagle speciee, represented
                    with four legs, wings, and a beak,—the fore part resembling an eagle, and the
                    hinder a lion. In addition, some writers describe the tail as a serpent. This
                    animal, which was supposed to watch over gold mines and hidden treasures, and to
                    be the enemy of the horse, was consecrated to the Sun; and the ancient painters
                    represented the chariot of the Sun as drawn by griffins. According to Spanheim,
                    those of Jupiter and Nemesis were similarly provided. The griffin of Scripture
                    is probably that species of the eagle called in Latin <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ossifraga,</hi> or osprey. The griffin is related to inhabit Asiatic
                    Scythia, where the lands abound in gold and precious stones; and when strangers
                    approach to gather these the creatures leap upon them and tear them in pieces,
                    thus showing their use in chastising human avarice and greed. The one-eyed
                    Arimaspi wage constant war with them, according to Herodotus (iii. 16). The
                    celebrated Sir John de Mandeville, in his <hi rend="italic">Travels,</hi>
                    described a griffin as eight times larger than a lion. The griffin is frequently
                    seen on early seals and medals, and is still borne as a favourite device on
                    seals and as a charge in heraldry. Papworth, in his laborious <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ordinary of British Armorials,</hi> ascribes this creature to several
                    .hundred family coats, as a single charge, and in connexion with other heraldic
                    devices the griffin was constantly borne in English and especially in Welsh
                    armoury. Berry in his <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Heraldica</hi> declares
                    that the combination of the eagle and lion signified strength and swiftness
                    conjoined; if this be so, the reason of its almost universal adoption as an
                    emblem by a military and chivalric people is not far to seek. The seals of
                    Baldwin de Redvers, second earl of Devon (1137-1155), and his son William de
                    Vernun, sixth earl, exhibit two most curious examples of the griffin, and being
                    anterior to the consolidation of heraldic rules and a succession of heraldic
                    devices from father to son, are yet proofs that particular devices or emblems
                    were in use with powerful lords of the 12th and 13th centuries, and retained by
                    the members of the family as carefully and as conventionally as the true
                    heraldic bearings of the following century were. Guillim blazons this monster as
                        <hi rend="italic">rampant,</hi> alleging that any very fierce animal may be
                    so blazoned as well as the lion; but Sylvester, Morgan, Burke, Berry, and other
                    writers upon heraldic subjects, use the term <hi rend="italic">segreant, i.e.,
                        se greant,</hi> pluming or arranging himself by lifting himself up and
                    flapping his wings, as all birds do occasionally, instead of rampant. Palliot,
                    one of the most interesting of all writers on arms, in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Vraye</hi><hi rend="italic">et Parfaite</hi><hi rend="italic">Science des
                        Armoires,</hi> describes this creature as generally rampant, and points out
                    its connexion with the Minotaur, Centaurs, and Chimaera, “fronte Leo, postremo
                    Draco, medioque Chimaera.” The same writer, in reference to the possibility of
                    such productions of nature, describes a curious monster of similar character,
                    called a <hi rend="italic">hipρocervus,</hi> presented in 1534 by Frederick,
                    duke of Mantua, to Francis the Great, the fore part being that of a horse, the
                    hind part that of a stag, which could be saddled and bridled, but always threw
                    his rider and trampled on him. Much might be written on the subject of
                    hybridsand fabulous monsters such as these, but the various aspects of natural
                    history and archaeology which they illustrate have never been yet worked out.
                    The griffin was also an architectural ornament among the Greeks, and was copied
                    from them, with other architectural embellishments, by the Romans, A fine
                    example of the Assyrian griffin occurs on the sculptured slabs from Kouyunjik,
                    now in the British Museum. The <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of Early Drawings
                        and Illuminations,</hi> by W. de Gray Birch and H. Jenner, gives a
                    collection of references to the finest examples of these creatures among the
                    manuscripts from the Saxon age to the close of the 15th century.</p>
