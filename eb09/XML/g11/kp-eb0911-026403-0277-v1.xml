                    positively known of the wild stock to which we owe our tame birds, nor can the
                    period of its réintroduction (for there is apparently no evidence of its
                    domestication being continuous from the time of the Romans) be assigned more
                    than roughly to that of the African discoveries of the Portuguese. It does not
                    seem to have been commonly known till the middle of the 16th century, when Caius
                    sent a description and figure, with the name of <hi rend="italic">Gallus
                        Μ.auntanus,</hi> to Gesner, who published both in his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Paralipomena</hi> in 1555, and in the same year Belon also gave a notice
                    and woodcut under the name of <hi rend="italic">Poulie</hi><hi rend="italic">de

                    former authors properly referred their bird to the ancient <hi rend="italic"
                        >Meleagris,</hi> the latter confounded the <hi rend="italic">Afeleagris</hi>
                    and the Turkey.</p>
                <p>The ordinary Guinea Fowl of our poultry-yards is the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Numida</hi><hi rend="italic">meleagris</hi> of ornithologists, and is too
                    common a bird to need description. The chief or only changes which domestication
                    seems to have induced in its appearance are a tendency to albinism generally
                    shown in the plumage of its lower parts, and frequently, though not always, the
                    conversion of the colour of its legs and feet from dark greyish-brown to bright
                    orange. That the home of this species is West Africa from the Gambia<note

                    certain, but its range in the interior is quite unknown. It appears to have been
                    imported early into the Cape Verd Islands, where, as also in some of the Greater
                    Antilles and in Ascension, it has run wild. Representing the species in South
                    Africa we have the <hi rend="italic">N. coronata,</hi> which is very numerous
                    from the Cape Colony to Ovampoland, and the <hi rend="italic">N. cornuta</hi> of
                    Drs Finsch and Hartlaub, which replaces it in the west as far as the Zambesi.
                    Madagascar also has its peculiar species, distinguishable by its red crown, the
                        <hi rend="italic">N. mitrata</hi> of Pallas, a name which has often been
                    misapplied to the last. This bird has been introduced to Rodriguez, where it is
                    now found wild. Abyssinia is inhabited by another species, the <hi rend="italic"

                            birds, but herein the writer ventures to think he has been misled. As
                            before observed, it may possibly have been the true μeλeαγpi's of the
                            Greeks.</p></note><hi rend="italic">f</hi> which differs from all the
                    foregoing by the absence of any red colouring about the head. Very different
                    from all of them, and the finest species known, is the <hi rend="italic">N.
                        vulturina</hi> of Zanzibar, conspicuous by the bright blue in its plumage,
                    the hackles that adorn the lower part of its neck, and its long tail. By some
                    writers it is thought to form a separate genus, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Acryllium.</hi> All these Guinea Fowls are characterized by having the
                    crown bare of feathers and elevated into a bony “helmet,” but there is another
                    group (to which the name <hi rend="italic">Guttera</hi> has been given) in which
                    a thick tuft of feathers ornaments the top of the head. This contains four or
                    five species, all inhabiting some part or other of Africa, the best known being
                    the <hi rend="italic">N. cristata</hi> from Sierra Leone and other places on the
                    western coast. This bird, apparently mentioned by Marcgrave more than 200 years
                    ago, but first described by Pallas, is remarkable for the structure—unique, if
                    not possessed by its representative forms—of its <hi rend="italic">furcula,</hi>
                    where the head, instead of being the thin plate found in all other <hi
                        rend="italic">Gallinoe,</hi> is a hollow cup opening upwards, into which the
                    trachea dips, and then emerges on its way to the lungs. Allied to the genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Numida,</hi> but readily distinguished therefrom among other
                    characters by the possession of spurs, are two very rare forms, <hi
                        rend="italic">Agelastes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Phasidus,</hi> both from
                    Western Africa. Of their habits nothing is known. All these birds are
                    beautifully figured in Mr Elliot’s <hi rend="italic">Monograph of the</hi><hi
