                    the district of Gurgâon comprises the southernmost corner of the Punjab
                    province, and stretches away from the level plain towards the hills of
                    Râjputânâ. Two low rocky ranges enter its borders from the south and run
                    northward in a bare and unshaded mass toward the plain country. East of the
                    western ridge the valley is wide and open, and essentially extends to the banks
                    of the Jumna. To the west lies the subdivision of Rewâri, consisting of a sandy
                    plain dotted with isolated hills. Numerous torrents carry off the drainage from
                    the upland ranges, and the most important among them empty themselves at last
                    into the Najafgarh y∕ri∕. This swampy lake lies to the east of the civil station
                    of Gurgâon, and stretches long arms into the neighbouring districts of Delhi and
                    Rohtak. Salt is manufactured from lime in wells at several villages. The mineral
                    products are iron ore, copper ore, plumbago, and ochre. Wolves, leopards, deer,
                    jackals, hares, and foxes are found in the district. In 1803 Gurgâon district
                    passed into the hands of the British after Lord Lake’s conquests, and under
                    their influence improvements made steady and rapid progress. On the outbreak of
                    the mutiny at Delhi in May 1857, the nawâb of Farrukhnagar, the principal
                    feudatory of the district, rose in rebellion. The Meos and many Rajput families
                    followed his example. A faithful native officer preserved the public buildings
                    and records at Rewâri from destruction; but with this exception, British
                    authority became extinguished for a time throughout all Gurgâon. After the fall
                    of the rebel capital, a force marched into the district and either captured or
                    dispersed the leaders of rebellion. The territory of the nawâb was confiscated
                    on account of his participation in the mutiny. Civil administration was resumed
                    under orders from the Punjab Government, to which province the district was
                    formally annexed on the final pacification of the country.</p>
                <p>The census of 1868 was taken over an area of 2015 square miles, and it disclosed
                    a population of 696,646 persons—males, 370,251; females, 326,395. The Hindus
                    number 480,307; Mahometans, 216,147; Sikhs, 130; and “others,” 62. In 1875-76
                    there were four municipal towns, with populations as follows :—Rewâri, 25,237;
                    Ferozepore (Firozpur), 10,580; Palwal, 13,542; Farrukhnagar, 10,611. Gurgâon,
                    the administrative headquarters, had in 1868 a population of 3539. Out of a
                    total area of 1,267,335 acres, as many as 967,440 were returned in 1875-76 as
                    under cultivation. The principal products are wheat, barley, <hi rend="italic"
                        >joAr,</hi><hi rend="italic">bâfra,</hi> gram, oil-seeds, pulses, cotton,
                    and tobacco. Owing to the deficiency of artificial irrigation, Gurgâon must
                    always be exposed to drought. Seven periods of dearth have occurred since the
                    disastrous year of 1783. In 1833 and 1837 many villages, according to report,
                    lost their whole population through death and emigration. The traffic of Gurgâon
                    district centres entirely upon the town of Rewâri, which ranks as one of the
                    chief trading emporiums in the Punjab. Its merchants transact a large part of
                    the commerce between the states of Râjputânâ and the northern provinces of
                    British India. Salt from the Sambhar Lake, together with iron, forms the
                    principal import; sugar and English piece-goods form the chief items of the
                    return trade. In 1871-72 the imports of Rewâri were valued at £208,892, and the
                    exports at £99,028. The means of communication are not of the highest order. One
                    good metalled road traverses the district, from Delhi to Muttra, but the lines
                    of greatest mercantile importance are unmetalled. The Râjputânâ State Railway
                    now passes through the district, with stations at Gurgâon, Jhârsa, Jataoli,
                    Kalipur, and Rewâri. The total revenue in 1875-76 was £111,885. In the same year
                    13 civil and revenue judges had jurisdiction, and the police force numbered 605
                    men, supplemented by a body of village watchmen. The number of schools was 66,
                    with a joint roll of 3560 pupils. The summer heat of Gurgâon reaches a great
                    intensity; no record of temperature, however, exists. The average annual
                    rainfall for the eight years ending 1873-4 was 23‘52 inches. The district
                    contained 4 charitable dispensaries, affording relief (1875) to 18,034
                    persons.</p>
