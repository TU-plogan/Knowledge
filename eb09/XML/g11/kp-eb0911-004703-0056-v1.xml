                        >Grammontines</hi></label> (Ordo Grandi-montensis), a small religious order
                    confined almost entirely to France. Its origin, which can be traced to about the
                    close of the 11th century, is involved in some obscurity. The founder, St
                    Stephen of Tigerno or Thiers, was born at Chateau Thiers, in Auvergne, in 1046,
                    was educated for the church partly at Benevento and partly at Rome, and,
                    returning home about 1073, in obedience to the solicitations of an inner voice
                    which had been making itself heard for years, embraced a life of solitary
                    asceticism. The scene of his retreat was the lonely glen of Muret, about a
                    league eastward from Limoges; as his reputation for piety extended, his cell
                    became a favourite resort with many likeminded persons, and ultimately a
                    community large enough to excite public attention was formed. The nature of the
                    rule observed by them at that time is not accurately known; a reply which,
                    according to tradition, Stephen gave to the papal legates when asked to give
                    some account of himself, forbids alike the belief that he identified himself
                    with any of the religious orders then in existence and the assumption that he
                    had already received permission to establish a new one. Shortly after his death,
                    which occurred on the 8th of February 1124, the lands at Muret were claimed by
                    the neighbouring Augustinian friars of Ambazac,—a circumstance which in 1154
                    compelled the followers of Stephen to remove their abode, under the leadership
                    of their second “corrector,” some miles further eastward, to Grammont or
                    Grandmont, whence the order subsequently took its name. So far as can be
                    ascertained, the rule by which the community was governed was not reduced to
                    writing until the time of Stephen of Lisiac, its fourth corrector. This rule,
                    which was confirmed by Urban III. in 1186, was characterized by considerable
                    severity, especially in the matters of silence, fasting, and flagellation; its
                    rigour, however, was mitigated by Innocent IV. in 1247, and again by Clement V.
                    in 1309. Under Stephen of Lisiac the order greatly flourished in Aquitania,
                    Anjou, and Normandy, where the number of its establishments in 1170 is said to
                    have exceeded sixty. The first Grandimontane house within the dominions of the
                    king of France was that founded at Vincennes near Paris by Louis VII. in 1164;
                    it soon acquired a position of considerable importance. Stephen of Thiers was,
                    at the request of Henry II. of England, canonized by Clement III. in 1189; and
                    the bestowal of this honour seems to have marked a culminating point in the
                    history of the order which he had originated. The Grandimontanes (sometimes also
                    like the followers of Francisco de Paola called Les bonshommes), ow ing to an
                    almost endless series of internal disputes at once symptomatic and productive of
                    disunion and disorganization, failed to achieve any considerable place in
                    history, and were finally pensioned off and disbanded in 1769. To them belonged,
                    until 1463, the priory of Creswell in Herefordshire, and also until 1441 that of
                    Alber-bury or Abberbury in Shropshire.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi> of the order were published at Troyes in 1662;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Regula,</hi> sometimes attributed, though erroneously,
                    to Stephen of Thiers, was first printed in the 17th century. À collection of
                    maxims or instructions, professedly by the same author, has also been largely
                    circulated in France since 1704. See Helyot, <hi rend="italic">Histoire des
