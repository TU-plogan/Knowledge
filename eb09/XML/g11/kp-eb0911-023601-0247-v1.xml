                <p><label type="entry">GUARANTEE, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Guaranty</hi></label>, in
                    English law, is a promise to be answerable for the debt of another should he
                    fail to make payment, or generally to be answerable for the performance of any
                    duty by another person. The debt or duty must be owing by another, who is
                    primarily bound, and the guarantor is only liable in the event of his failure of
                    performance. Guarantees are required to be in writing by the Statute of Frauds
                    (29 Car. II. c. 3), which enacts (§ 4) that “no action shall be brought whereby
                    to charge the defendant upon any special promise to answer for the debt,
                    default, or miscarriage of another, unless the agreement upon which such action
                    shall be brought shall be in writing, signed by the parties to be charged by the
                    contract, or some other person thereunto by him lawfully authorized.” The test
                    of the applicability of this section is whether the original debtor continues
                    liable. If his liability is gone, and the person promising to pay the debt
                    becomes immediately and primarily liable, then the promise need not be in
                    writing. Thus where a debtor had been taken in execution for a debt, and a third
                    person promised to pay the debt if the debtor were discharged from custody, it
                    was held that writing wa3 not necessary, inasmuch as the discharge operated as a
                    satisfaction of the original debt, and the person making the promise alone
                    remained liable. The default for which liability may be assumed by another
                    person includes any case of breach of duty, and is not confined to cases of
                    non-performance of contracts. A promise to guarantee comes under the general
                    rule which requires enforceable agreements to be founded on consideration, <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> a corresponding promise or performance on the other
                    side (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Contract).</hi> It was formerly held that the
                    consideration must appear in the memorandum of writing, not necessarily in
                    express term3, but at any rate as a matter of fair and reasonable inference.
                    Thus a promise to pay for goods to be supplied to another was held to disclose a
                    consideration, viz., the future supply of goods. But when the promise was to pay
                    for goods already supplied, no consideration was disclosed. By the Mercantile
                    Law Amendment Act (19 and 20 Vict. c. 97), passed in consequence of
                    representations made by merchants in Scotland and the North of England, who
                    found the difference between Scotch and English law as to written contracts a
                    source of great inconvenience, this section of the Statute of Frauds was
                    repealed. The Mercantile Law Amendment Act also declares that a guarantee given
                    to or for a firm shall cease on any change taking place in the persons
                    constituting the firm, unless a continuance of the promise is expressly
                    stipulated or of necessity to be inferred. The corresponding Act for Scotland
                    (19 and 20 Vict. c. 60) requires all guarantees, securities, or cautionary
                    obligations, and all representations as to the character of any person made with
                    the view of obtaining credit, money, &amp;c., for such person to be in writing
                    in order to be binding, and establishes the same rule as the English Act with
                    reference to guarantees to or for a firm.</p>
