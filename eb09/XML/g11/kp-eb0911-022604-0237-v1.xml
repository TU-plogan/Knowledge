                    (1493-1541), a learned theologian of the Reformation, was born in 1493 at
                    Vehringen, in I1i3 fourteenth year was sent to school at Pforzheim, and
                    subsequently studied at the university of Vienna, where he graduated as master
                    of arts, and for some time acted as tutor. He next became rector of a school at
                    Ofen (Buda), but as an avowed sympathizer with Reuchlin and Erasmus he was not
                    permitted by the Dominicans to retain this post long. After an interval spent at
                    Wittenberg with his old school friend Melanchthon, he became professor of Greek
                    in the university of Heidelberg in 1525; with the duties of this post he from
                    1526 combined those also of the Latin chair. In 1529 the friendship of
                    Oecolampadius obtained for him a call to Basel as successor of Erasmus; the
                    completely disorganized state of the university at that time gave him abundant
                    leisure not only for private study but also for a tour to England, where he
                    charged himself with the task of obtaining the opinions of the Reformed
                    theologians upon the subject of the king’s divorce. On his return to Basel in
                    1531, the year of the death both of Zwingli and of Oecolampadius, he began as
                    theological professor to give exegetical lectures on the New Testament; and in
                    1534 he was summoned by Duke Ulrich of Würtemberg to assist in the reformation
                    there, and especially in the reorganization of the university of Tübingen. In
                    1536 he took an active part in the framing of the first Helvetic confession, and
                    also in the conferences held with the purpose of inducing the Swiss to accept
                    the concord of Wittenberg, which had also been drawn up in that year. He was the
                    sole representative of the Swiss churches at the conference of Worms in 1540.
                    His death took place suddenly at Basel on August 1, 1541. In Greek philology
                    Grynaeus was one of the first scholars of his day. In theology he was more of a
                    theoretical than of a practical turn; but his profound erudition and singularly
                    penetrating judgment gave him great influence among the more active spirits of
                    the time. In literature his chief contributions were translations into Latin of
                    Plutarch, Aristotle, and Chrysostom. See Streu-ber’s <hi rend="italic"
