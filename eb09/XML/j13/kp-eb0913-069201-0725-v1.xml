                    islands of the East Indian archipelago,’forming part administratively of the
                    Dutch residency of Ternate. The equator cuts across the southern peninsula, the
                    most northerly point of the island lying in 2° 13' N. lat., and the southern
                    extremity in 0° 52' S. A large proportion of Jilolo is practically <hi

                    accumulated since Wallace complained in 1856 of the smallness of our knowledge
                    in regard to it. The area is stated at 6410 square miles; the extreme
                    irregularity of the outline, however, renders the estimate a peculiarly
                    precarious one. Jilolo may be said to consist of four peninsulas so arranged as
                    to enclose three great bays (Kaou, Bitjoli, Weda), all opening towards the
                    east,—the northern peninsula being connected with the others by an isthmus only
                    5 miles wide. On the western side of the isthmus lies another bay, that of
                    Dodinga, in the mouth of which are situated the two islands Ternate and Tidore,
                    whose political celebrity so far exceeds that of their larger neighbour Jilolo.
                    To the north-east of the northern peninsula we have the considerable island of
                    Morotai, and to the west of the southern peninsula the far more important island
                    of Batchian. The northern peninsula is full of mountain chains, which give clear
                    evidence of former volcanic activity; and at least one of the summits, Tolo or
                    Gunong Api (3000 feet), was not quite extinct in the 16th century according to
                    Valentijn’s report. At present the crater, as described by Bernstein, is 200
                    feet deep, and contains a small lake. Gunong Tabello is higher than Tolo, and
                    Gunong Mamuya has a similar altitude. In the south of the peninsula lies a lake,
                    Talaga Lamo (the Tela-galina of Bernstein’s account), about 4 or 5 miles long.
                    The principal village is Galela, situated on a bay of the same name on the east
                    coast, in a well-cultivated plain which extends southward and inland. The three
                    remaining peninsulas, which have been less explored, seem to be hardly so
                    mountainous. The whole island is clothed with a prolific vegetation, some of the
                    more important features of which will be found described in Teysmann’s paper in
                    the Report of the Botanic Garden at Buitenzorg. Rice is grown by the natives,
                    but the sago tree is of far greater importance to them.</p>
                <p>The people of Jilolo are for the most part pagans, living in a very backward
                    state of civilization. Attempts to Christianize them have been made with but
                    small success by the missionaries of the Utrecht Society, who have their chief
                    stations at Swakenora and Dokolamo, near Lake Talaga Lamo (see <hi rend="italic"
                        >Berigten</hi><hi rend="italic">der</hi><hi rend="italic">Utrechlsehe
                        Zendingsvereeniging,</hi> 1869). Μ. Achille Raffray gives the following
                    description of the Halmaherians in <hi rend="italic">Tour du Monde,</hi> 1879,
                    where photographs of a number of the natives will be found. “They are as unlike
                    the Malays as we are, excelling them in tallness of stature and elegance of
                    shape, and being perfectly distinguished by their oval face, with a fairly high
                    and open brow, their aquiline nose, and their horizontally placed eyes. Their
                    beards are sometimes thick; their limbs are muscular; the colour of their skins
                    is cinnamon brown. Spears of iron-wood, abundantly barbed, and small bows and
                    bamboo arrows free from <pb break="no"

                    According to Teysmann they have temples <hi rend="italic">{sabuas)</hi> in which
                    they suspend images of serpents and other monsters as well as the trophies
                    procured by war. They believe in a better life hereafter, but have no idea of a
                    hell or a devil, their evil spirits only tormenting them in the present
                    state.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese and Spaniards were better acquainted with Jilolo than with many
                    other parts of the archipelago; they called it sometimes Batu China and
                    sometimes Moro. It was circumnavigated by one of their vessels in 1525, and the
                    general outline of the coasts is correctly given in their maps at a time when
                    separate portions of Celebes, such as Macassar and Menado, are represented as
                    distinct islands. The current name of the island (Jilolo) was really that of a
                    native state, the sultan of which had the chief rank among the princes of the
                    Moluccas before he was supplanted by the sultan of Ternate about 1380. His
                    capital, Jilolo, lay on the west coast on the first bay to the north of that of
                    Dodinga. In 1876 Danu Hassan, a descendant of the sultans of Jilolo, raised an
                    insurrection in the island for the purpose of throwing off the authority of the
                    sultans of Tidore and Ternate; and his efforts would probably have been
                    successful but for the intervention of the Dutch.</p>
