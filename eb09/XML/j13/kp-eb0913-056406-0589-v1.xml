                    (1804-1874), a remarkable instance of a certain kind of critic, was born at St
                    Étienne, the great manufacturing town of the department of the Loire, on
                    December 24, 1804, and died at his house near <pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0913-0590-0565"/> Paris in June 1874. His father was a lawyer,
                    and he was well educated, first at St Étienne, and then at the famous Collège
                    Louis-le-Grand at Paris. He betook himself to journalism very early, and worked
                    on different papers, the <hi rend="italic">Figaro,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Quotidienne,</hi> &amp;c., until in 1836 he fixed himself as dramatic
                    critic of the <hi rend="italic">Debats.</hi> Long before this, however, he had
                    made a considerable <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> literary reputation, for which
                    indeed his strange novel <hi rend="italic">L’Ane Mort et</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >la Femme</hi><hi rend="italic">Guillotinée</hi> (1829) would have sufficed.
                        <hi rend="italic">La Confession,</hi> which followed, was less remarkable in
                    substance but even more so in style; and <hi rend="italic">Barnave,</hi> in
                    1831, sustained the literary reputation of the author, though the violent
                    attacks it contained on the Orleans family did not, when they were taken with
                    his subsequent conduct, increase his reputation for consistency. From the day,
                    however, when Janin became the theatrical critic of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Debats,</hi> though he continued to write books indefatigably, he was to
                    most Frenchmen a dramatic critic and nothing more. His system was odd enough. He
                    called himself “prince of critics,” a self-presented testimonial in which the
                    mixture of irony and vanity (in all senses of the word) which marked all his
                    work may be detected. He was outrageously inconsistent, and judged things from
                    no general point of view whatsoever, though at least latterly his judgment was
                    usually good-natured. But few journalists have ever been misters of a more
                    attractive fashion of saying the first thing that came into their heads, and if
                    he had called himself a prince of journalists he would not have been far wrong.
                    After many years of <hi rend="italic">feuilleton</hi> writing he collected some
                    of his articles in the work called <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la littérature
                        dramatique,</hi> which, as may be gathered from what has been said, by no
                    means deserves the title. In 1865 he made his first attempt upon the Academy,
                    but was not successful till five years later. Meanwhile he had not been content
                    with his <hi rend="italic">feuilletons,</hi> written persistently about all
                    manner of things. No one was more in request with the Paris publishers for
                    prefaces, letterpress to illustrated books, and all the other hackwork which
                    usually engages in France men of letters of a somewhat higher class than those
                    who generally devote themselves to it in England. He travelled (picking up in
                    one of his journeys a curious windfall, a country house at Lucca, which fell to
                    him in a lottery), and wrote accounts of his travels; he wrote numerous tales
                    and novels, for the titles of which we have no space here, and composed many
                    other works, of which by far the best is the oddly entitled <hi rend="italic"
                        >Fin Tun Monde</hi><hi rend="italic">et du Neveu</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                        Rameau,</hi> in which, under the guise of a sequel to Diderot’s masterpiece,
                    he showed to considerable advantage his great familiarity with the late 18th
                    century. He married in 1841; his wife had money, and he was always in easy
                    circumstances. In the early part of his career he had many quarrels, notably one
                    with Felix Pyat, but latterly, partly owing to his critical authority and partly
                    to his good temper and hospitality, he was a very popular man with his craft,
                    and at his death his library was said to contain the greatest number of gift and
                    dedication copies of contemporary works that had ever been brought to the
                    hammer. Even in the few years since his death, however, his reputation has
                    rapidly faded, and except with those who know how to look at literature in the
                    largest and most tolerant way, it is not likely to revive. His <hi rend="italic"
                        >Âne</hi><hi rend="italic">Mort</hi> is really a most remarkable book.
                    Written half in parody, half in deliberate pursuance of the romantic ideas, it
                    anticipated by fifty years in point of time and far excelled in point of
                    literary value the recent performances of the naturalist school. Those who wish
                    to know what Janin might have been should read this, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Barnave,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Fin Tun Monde.</hi> But for the
                    most part his work is mere improvisation, and has no elements of vitality in it
                    except a light and vivid style.</p>
