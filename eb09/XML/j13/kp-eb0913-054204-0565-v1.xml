                    distinguished Orientalist and Biblical critic of the Roman Catholic Church, was
                    born at Tasswitz, Moravia, on June 18, 1750. After completing his school
                    education at Znaim he studied philosophy at Olmütz, andin 1772 began his
                    theological studies at the Praemonstratensian convent of Bruck in the
                    neighbourhood of Znaim. Having been ordained to the priesthood in 1775, he for a
                    short time held a cure of souls at Mislitz, but was soon recalled to Bruck to
                    become professor of Oriental languages and Biblical hermeneutics there. On the
                    suppression of the convent by Joseph II. in 1784, Jahn was removed to a chair at
                    Olmütz corresponding to that which he had previously held, and in 1789 he was
                    transferred to Vienna as professor of Oriental languages, Biblical archaeology,
                    and dogmatics. In 1792 he published his <hi rend="italic">Einleitung ins

                    certain Cardinal Migazzi laid a complaint against him before the emperor because
                    in his preface he had confessed himself to have in some points departed from the
                    views of his learned predecessors and adopted opinions of his own, while in the
                    work itself he declared Job, Jonah, Tobit, and Judith to be didactic poems. To
                    these charges was added a third, that in his New Testament lectures he had
                    stated the cases of demoniacal possession there mentioned to be cases of natural
                    disease. On the matter being referred to an ecclesiastical commission, it was
                    reported that the views themselves were not necessarily heretical, but that Jahn
                    had shown undue rashness in giving out, as his own, opinions which teachers of
                    theology ought not to mention otherwise than as foreign; in accordance with this
                    it was decided that he ought to modify his expressions in future editions of his
                    work and in his subsequent lecturing. Although he appears honestly to have
                    accepted this judgment, the hostility of those who were opposed to his teaching
                    did not cease until at last (1806) he was compelled to accept a canonry at
                    Vienna, which involved the resignation of his chair. This step had been preceded
                    by the condemnation of his <hi rend="italic">Introductio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >in</hi><hi rend="italic">libros sacros Veteris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Foederis in compendium</hi><hi rend="italic">redacta,</hi> published in
                    1804, and also of his <hi rend="italic">Archaeologia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Biblica in compendium</hi><hi rend="italic">redacta</hi> (1805). The only
                    work of importance, outside the region of mere philology, afterwards published
                    by him, was the <hi rend="italic">Enchiridion</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Hermeneuticae</hi> (1812). He died August 16, 1816. Jahn’s place in the
                    history of the modern science of Biblical criticism is undoubtedly an honourable
                    one, and also of some importance, especially when his ecclesiastical environment
                    is taken into account. If he cannot be said to have been either very original or
                    very profound, he has at least the merit of being laborious, candid, and
                    clear-sighted within his range of vision; one of his books, the <hi
