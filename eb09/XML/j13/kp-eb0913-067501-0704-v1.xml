                    (1522-1571), bishop of Salisbury, was born May 24th 1522, at Berry Narbor, near
                    Ilfracombe, Devonshire. At the age of thirteen he entered Merton College,
                    Oxford, where he had for tutor John Parkhurst, afterwards bishop of Norwich,
                    from whom his mind received a bias towards Protestantism. Becoming tutor in
                    Corpus Christi College in 1539, he in his turn took the opportunity of
                    inculcating Protestant principles on his pupils; and in 1546 he received an
                    allowance from a private fund instituted for the benefit of indigent scholars
                    who publicly professed the doctrines of the Reformed faith. After the accession
                    of Mary in 1553 he was expelled by the fellows from the college on account of
                    his opinions, and in a moment of weakness he was induced to sign his adherence
                    to a form of doctrine essentially Romanistic. He, however, speedily repented of
                    his momentary faithlessness to his convictions, and in order to escape the
                    penalties of martyrdom he fled in 1555 to Frankfort, where he publicly abjured
                    his former recantation. On the death of Mary he returned to England. He was one
                    of the learned Protestant doctors appointed to dispute before Elizabeth at
                    Westminster with a like number of Catholics. In the beginning of 1560 he was
                    created bishop of Salisbury, and in the same year he published, with the
                    sanction of the queen and bishops, his <hi rend="italic">Apologia</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Ecdesiae Anglicanae,</hi> which was in fact an argument
                    against the decision of the pope to exclude the Reformers from the council of
                    Trent, convoked to be held in December of that year. The work, as was to be
                    expected, excited very great attention at the time; it was condemned at the
                    meeting of the council, who appointed two divines to reply to its arguments. It
                    was translated into English by Anna, wife of Sir Nicholas Bacon, and Elizabeth
                    ordered that a copy of it should be chained in every parish church in England.
                    Its chief English opponent was Thomas Harding, who in 1565 published a <hi
                        rend="italic">Confutation of the Apology,</hi> to which Jewel replied in
                    1567 by the <hi rend="italic">Defence of the Apology.</hi> The general argument
                    of Jewel is that unity or predominance of opinion is not a test of truth, and,
                    although he denied that Rome had the support of the fathers, he rested his
                    general case on the fact that the foundation on which the Church of England was
                    built was not that of the fathers but of the apostles and Jesus Christ. His
                    views were strongly anti-sacramentarian, as he held that the Lord’s Supper had
                    nothing more than a commemorative use. Jewel died suddenly at Monkton Farleigh,
                    a small village in his diocese, September 22, 1571.</p>

                    are mostly controversial, were collected by Dr R. W. Jelf, and published in 8
                    vols, at Oxford, 1848.</p>
