                    (1744-1793), the Abbé Fauchet, a French constitutional bishop, and a noted actor
                    in the Revolution, was born at Dornes, in the department of Nièvre, September
                    22, 1774. He devoted himself to the service of the church, passed through the
                    usual course of studies, and was rapidly promoted. Before he was thirty years of
                    age he made his mark as an orator in a panegyric of St Louis, delivered before
                    the French Academy. For some time he was engaged as tutor to the children of the
                    marquis of Choiseul, a brother of the famous minister of Louis XVI.; and he was
                    afterwards nominated grand-vicar of the archbishop of Bourges, preacher to the
                    king, and abbé of Montfort-Lacarre in Brittany. The influence of the new
                    philosophy was clearly seen in his discourses, and the political tone of his
                    sermon, <hi rend="italic">Discours sur les moeurs rurales,</hi> at the festival
                    of La Rosiere at Surènes, especially exposed him to censure. As he was proof
                    against remonstrance, he was deprived of his office as preacher to the king.
                    This occurred in 1788; and when in the following year the Revolution broke out,
                    Abbé Fauchet was ready to fight with the foremost in the great cause. His
                    speeches fired the primary assemblies and the sections of Paris, and on the
                    memorable 14th of July he was one of those who led the people to the attack on
                    the Bastille, displaying, it is said, not only courage under fire, but skill
                    worthy of an accomplished officer. He was elected a member of the commune of
                    Paris, figured in the clubs, blessed the tricolor flag for the National Guard,
                    and by all means helped forward with a passionate zeal the revolutionary
                    movement. He contributed to the reorganization of the church by his <hi

                        rend="italic">nationale;</hi> and in May 1791 he was appointed
                    constitutional bishop of Calvados. During the same period he had delivered three
                    discourses on liberty, a discourse on the harmony of religion and liberty, tbe
                    funeral oration of the Abbé de l’Épée, and an <hi rend="italic">Éloge
                        civique</hi> of Franklin. The last of these was spoken in the rotunda of the
                    corn-market in the course of the festivities of the federation in July 1790. In
                    these pieces the swift progress of the Revolution was reflected in a growing
                    intensity of sympathy and enthusiasm on the part of the orator; and hostility to
                    the church carried him well nigh to a denial of the faith of which he was a
                    minister. In the winter of 1790-91 Fauchet organized, in the precincts of the
                    Palais Royal, his “Cercle Social,” with regenerative intent, to be carried out
                    chiefly by means of fluent oratory. He presided in the meetings under the
                    self-assumed title of “Procureur général de la Vérité.” Condorcet was one of his
                    coadjutors, and “ten thousand persons of respectability” flocked to hear them,—a
                    noisy and phantasmal affair, which came to a speedy end. In 1791 Fauchet was
                    elected deputy to the legislative assembly, and afterwards to the convention. He
                    wrote in favour of an agrarian law, voted against payment of priests who refused
                    the oath to the constitution, and was one of the first to submit to the decree
                    for suppression of ecclesiastical costume. The excesses of the Jacobins,
                    however, alarmed him, and he began to incline towards the Girondists. On the
                    trial of the king he spoke earnestly and courageously against the proposal to
                    put him to death, and voted for the appeal to the people, imprisonment, and
                    banishment. The execution of the king drove him still nearer to the party of the
                    Girondists, and thus made him an object of the wrath of the Mountain. His name
                    was one of those included in the proscription list, but he continued to act as
                    secretary of the assembly till May 31, 1793, when the decree of accusation
                    against the Girondists was passed. On the 18th July he was accused, not only as
                    a Girondist, but also, and without ground, as an accomplice of Charlotte Corday,
                    the murderer of Marat. He was sent to the Conciergerie, was condemned with the
                    Girondist deputies by the revolutionary tribunal on October 30, and with them
                    executed on the 31st.</p>
