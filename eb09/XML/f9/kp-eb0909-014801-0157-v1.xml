                <p><label type="entry">FIESOLE</label>, a small episcopal city of Italy, occupying
                    the site of the ancient Faesulae, on the crown of a hill that rises above the
                    Arno, about three miles to the west of Florence. In size it is little more than
                    a village, but its historical interest is of considerable scope. The principal
                    building is the cathedral, which was commenced by Bishop Giacomo Bavaro in 1028,
                    and dedicated to San Pietro Romolo, a martyr under Nero. It is a small basilica,
                    consisting of a nave with narrow aisles, a transept, a raised choir, and a crypt
                    noticeable for the uncommon character of its capitals. Among its adornments are
                    an altarpiece and a bust of Bishop Salutati by Mino di Fiesole. The church of St
                    Maria Primerana, with a terra-cotta tabernacle by L. della Robbia, San
                    Allesandro, with its twelve cipollino columns, the Franciscan convent, the
                    episcopal palace, and the town-hall or palazzo del pretorio, dating from the
                    13th century, are all worthy of notice. The convent probably occupies the site
                    of the old <hi rend="italic">arx</hi> or citadel; behind the cathedral there are
                    extensive remains of a large Roman theatre, discovered in 1809 and laid bare in
                    1872-3; and a few dilapidated portions of the ancient Etruscan fortification
                    still stand on the northern brow of the hill. Between the little city and
                    Floιence the church of San Domenico di Fiesole marks the site of the monastery
                    famous as the residence of Fra Angelico (see next article); not far from the
                    church is the villa where Walter Savage Landor dwelt many years amid the scenes
                    of Boccaccio’s <hi rend="italic">Decameron;</hi> and further up the hill is the

                    The present inhabitants of Fiesole are largely employed in straw plaiting. They
                    number, according to the census of 1871, 3467 in the city, and 13,180 in the
                    commune.</p>
                <p>Faesulae has a great mythical history, according to which it is the oldest city
                    in the world. Its real origin is unknown, but it was evidently an Etruscan site
                    long before the Roman conquest. It became of some note in the Gallic and Punic
                    wars, and was afterwards selected by Sulla for the settlement of a body of his
                    veterans. Twenty years later these colonists rendered themselves formidable by
                    the support which they gave to Catiline, and the town was chosen as his
                    headquarters in the struggle against Metellus and Antony. The story of Catiline
                    and his exploits has been developed into an elaborate legend by Malespini and
                    other Fiesolan historians. Catellino, as he is called, wages war against
                    Fiorino, king of Rome; the king is slain, but the Faesulan party is ultimately
                    defeated by Julius Caesar, and anew city, Fiorenza Magna (Florence), is founded
                    by the conqueror, and named in honour of Fiorino. At a later date Faesulae,
                    continues the story, was rebuilt by Attila, and Florence destroyed. From
                    Procopius we know that the little city, while occupied by Witiges and his Goths,
                    did stand a long siege by the forces of Belisarius. According to the common
                    account it was ‘ ‘ destroyed” by the Florentines in the 11th or 12th century;
                    but the statement is open to question, and the destraction at any rate cannot
                    have been very complete. Among the more eminent natives of Fiesole are Francesco
                    Ferrucci, the great captain, and Francesco Ferracci, the first sculptor in
                    porphyry.</p>
