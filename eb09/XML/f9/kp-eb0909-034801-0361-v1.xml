                <p><label type="entry">FLOWERS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Artificial</hi></label>. There
                    are few branches of ornamental work used in the decoration of ladies’ apparel
                    which have more increased in importance than that of artificial flower making,
                    in which, both in France and in England, large numbers of workpeople are
                    engaged. Not only has the trade itself greatly extended within the last few
                    years, but the improvement in the manufacture is very marked, and the bouquets
                    and wreaths used in the trimming of dresses may be almost said to rival nature,
                    so truly and delicately are the individual flowers manipulated. Artificial
                    flower making is almost entirely done by hand, giving occupation principally to
                    young women and children, the majority of whom work at home or in small shops.
                    The numbers employed at the time of the census of 1871 were returned as 4886, of
                    whom 1740 were under twenty years of age. In France the numbers are much larger,
                    for ten years ago it was estimated that there were at least 2000 shops where
                    artificial flowers were made, and it is probable that now these have been
                    increased to 3000. It is not entirely a woman’s work, however, for men are
                    employed, particularly in Paris, in cutting out the material for the flowers by
                    a stamp machine, in which 16 or 20 folds are operated upon at once, the folds
                    being coloured green, blue, crimson, according to the flower which is to be
                    imitated. Each piece is taken up separately by a girl armed with a pair of
                    pincers, who, with one dexterous movement, moulds it, as it were, roughly into
                    the shape of the flower, and then passes it on to another who gives a more
                    precise form to the petal. A third girl attaches each petal to a very fine wire,
                    thread having been previously twisted round this wire to form the stalk; while
                    the remaining operations consist in goffering the petals and leaves to give them
                    a curl, and finally gumming or waxing them over, or dusting them with fine
                    powdered glass or potato flour to represent the bloom. The rapidity and accuracy
                    with which these various processes are completed are very remarkable. A new
                    style of artificial flower has lately come into vogue, in France more
                    especially, made by the “enamel process,” in which a young girl sits by a jet of
                    flame, holding in her hand a stick of prepared glass. A momentary application to
                    the flame makes the end of the stick red hot, and while it is still in a pasty
                    state, the operator pulls out a short length, and immediately rolls it up into
                    the form of the petal or leaf, and passes it on to the painter for the proper
                    colouring. The remaining processes are similar to those of the ordinary
                    artificial flowers. These enamel flowers, though wondrously true and pretty, are
                    more suited for room decoration than for dress. While apparently a light and
                    pleasant work, artificial flower making is not one of the healthiest of our
                    trades, partly for the reason that it is so often carried on in small household
                    shops, where ventilation is of the scantiest. It has, however, been much
                    improved in this respect,’since it has come under the supervision of the Factory
                    Acts. There is always a certain amount of dust and colouring matter flying about
                    the room, which is more or less injurious, though the use of Scheele’s green and
                    sulphate of copper (verdigris blue) is almost discontinued, and with it a train
                    of symptoms that usually accompany arsenical poisoning. Weak eyes are a common
                    source of complaint, especially the form called asthenopia, which is
                    particularly induced when white flowers are made by gas light. In the
                    manufacture of the flowers, the net cost is about three-fifths of the whole for
                    material, and the remaining two-fifths for the labour. In France the earnings of
                    the men who cut the folds are from 4 to 5 francs per day, of the workwomen from
                    2⅜ to 3J, according to ability. In England a skilful flower worker will earn
                    from 20s. to 25s. per week, though there is a drawback in its being a season
                    trade, which is very brisk about the spring and fall of the year, and as
                    inactive during the other times. Besides the very large number of artificial
                    flowers made in England, the following table shows how great is the importation,
                    principally from France :—</p>
