                    (1646-1719), the first astronomerroyal of England, was born at Denby near Derby,
                    August 14, 1646. He was educated at the free school of that town, where his
                    father carried on business as a maltster. Ho began the study of mathematics and
                    astronomy while still very young, and showed considerable ingenuity in the
                    construction of mathematical instruments. At the age of fourteen he caught cold
                    while bathing, and he suffered during the rest of his life from a rheumatic
                    affection of the joints. In 1665 he went to Ireland to consult Greatrakes, a
                    notorious quack of the period, who claimed to be able to cure such diseases by
                    manipulation; but he returned to Derby uncured. He continued his astronomical
                    studies here till 1669. About the year 1667 he wrote an able paper on the
                    equation of time, afterwards appended by Wallis to his edition of Horrocks’s
                    w’orks. In 1669 be communicated a paper to the Royal Society under the assumed
                    name J. Mathesin a sole fundes, an anagram on his own name Johannes
                    Flamsteedius; but Oldenburg, the secretary, addressed a reply to him, showing
                    that he was discovered, and from that time Flamsteed corresponded with many men
                    of science. Sir Jonas Moore, whose acquaintance ho made in 1670 when visiting
                    London, furnished him with several instruments, amongst others with Townly’s
                    micrometer. In 1673 Flamsteed composed his treatise on <hi rend="italic">The
                        true and apparent Places of the Planets when at their greatest and least

                    at Cambridge. He does not appear to have ever studied at Cambridge, though his
                    name was entered at J esus College in 1670, and he resided there for some months
                    in 1674. In this year he published his <hi rend="italic">Ephemeris,</hi> and
                    drew up a table of the tides. Sir J. Moore at this time proposed to establish
                    Flamsteed in a private observatory at Chelsea; but Charles II., whose attention
                    had been directed to the necessity of improved astronomical tables by a proposal
                    for finding the longitude at sea, determined to establish an observatory, and
                    Flamsteed was appointed “astronomical observator.” His observations were made at
                    the queen’s house in Greenwich Park, till July 1676, when the observatory was
                    ready. Of his work as astronomer-royal an account will be found under <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Astronomy</hi> (vol. ii. p. 756). Baily dates the
                    commencement of modem astronomy from the year 1676, when Flamsteed began his
                    observations.</p>
                <p>Flamsteed was ill-paid and overworked in his new office. A salary of £100 a year
                    was paid him, and he was left to provide his own instruments. Until 1684 he had
                    to teach two boys from Christ’s Hospital, as one of the duties of his post; and
                    he taught other boys, to defray the expenses he incurred for instruments. In
                    1684 his father died, and he was presented by Lord Keeper North to a small
                    living. His means being thus somewhat improved, he resolved to incur the expense
                    of a mural arc, on the assurance of Government that he Would be reimbursed,—a
                    promise which, however, was never fulfilled.</p>
                <p>Attention has been drawn since the year 1832 to certain private affairs of
                    Flamsteed’s. In that year Francis Baily discovered a large collection of
                    Flamsteed’s letters in private hands, and other letters afterwards at Greenwich.
                    The Admiralty unfortunately decided to print these at the public expense. For
                    some time it was supposed that the fair fame of Newton and Halley had been
                    darkened by the publication of these documents. But Sir David Brewster
                    discovered among Newton’s papers a series of letters and papers completely
                    exculpating Newton and Halley from charges affecting their honour, and placing
                    Flamsteed’s character in an unfavourable aspect. It must be remembered, however,
                    that the case made out by Brewster against Flamsteed, and the case made out by
                    Baily against Newton and Halley, both rest on <hi rend="italic">ex parte</hi>
                    statements. The conclusion to which a careful investigation of both sides of the
                    story appears to point is that both Newton and Flamsteed showed exceeding
                    ill-temper, and that the charges affecting the honour of either (and of Halley
                    as Newton’s friend) had their origin entirely in the ill-feeling thus excited.
                    It is unfortunate that the matter should ever have been opened. Let it be
                    remembered only that, while on the one hand Flamsteed furnished Newton with
                    every lunar observation made before 1685, when the first edition of the <hi
                        rend="italic">Principia</hi> appeared, Newton on the other hand based on
                    these observations the noblest theory the world of science has known.</p>
                <p>From 1715 to 1719, the year of his death, Flamsteed superintended the publication
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Coelestis,</hi> but the
                    publication was not completed till 1723. His valuable <hi rend="italic"
                        >Atlas</hi><hi rend="italic">Coelestis</hi> was not published till 1753. The
                    well-known British catalogue of 2884 stars appears in the third volume of the
                        <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Coelestis.</hi> Though of
                    feeble constitution, Flamsteed attained the age of seventy-three, his death
                    occurring on the last day of the year 1719. He was succeeded in the office of
                    astronomer-royal by Halley.</p>
