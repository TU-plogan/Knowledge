                <p><label type="entry">FORBES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Duncan</hi></label> (1685-1747),
                    of Culloden, was born at Bunchrew or at Culloden near Inverness on the 10th of
                    November, 1685. After he had completed his studies at the universities of
                    Edinburgh and Leyden, he was admitted advocate at the Scottish bar in 1709. His
                    own talents and the influence of the Argyll family secured his rapid
                    advancement, which was still further helped by his loyalty to the Hanoverian
                    cause at the period of the rebellion in 1715. In 1722 Forbes was returned member
                    for Inverness, and in 1725 he succeeded Dundas of Arniston as lord advocate. He
                    inherited the patrimonial estates on the death of his brother in 1734, and in
                    1737 he attained to the highest legal honours in Scotland, being made lord
                    president of the Court of Session. As lord advocate, he had laboured to improve
                    the legislation and revenue of the country, to extend trade and encourage
                    manufactures, and no less to render the Government popular and respected in
                    Scotland. In the proceedings which followed the memorable Porteous mob, for
                    example, when the Government brought in a bill for disgracing the lord provost
                    of Edinburgh, for fining the corporation, and for abolishing the town-guard and
                    city-gate, Forbes both spoke and voted against the measure as an unwarranted
                    outrage on the national feeling. As lord president also he carried out some
                    useful legal reforms; and his term of office was characterized by quick and
                    impartial administration of the law. The rebellion of 1745 found him at his
                    post, and it tried all his patriotism. For some years before, he had repeatedly
                    and earnestly urged upon the Government the expediency of embodying Highland
                    regiments, putting them under the command of colonels whose loyalty could be
                    relied upon, but officering them with the native chieftains and cadets of old
                    families in the north. “If Government,” said he, “pre-engages the Highlanders in
                    the manner I propose, they will not only serve well against the enemy abroad,
                    but will be hostages for the good behaviour of their relations at home; and I am
                    persuaded that it will be absolutely impossible to raise a rebellion in the
                    Highlands.” Such a plan was afterwards successfully pursued by Chatham; but,
                    though Walpole is said to have approved of the scheme, it was not adopted by the
                    council. On the first rumour of the Jacobite rising Forbes hastened to
                    Inverness, and through his personal influence with the chiefs of Macdonald and
                    Macleod, those two powerful western clans were prevented from taking the field
                    for Charles Edward; the town itself also he kept loyal and well protected at the
                    commencement of the struggle, and many of the neighbouring proprietors were won
                    over by his persuasions. His correspondence with Lord Lovat, published in the
                    Culloden papers, affords a fine illustration of his character, in which the
                    firmness of loyal principle and duty is found blended with neighbourly kindness
                    and consideration. But at this critical juncture of affairs, the apathy of the
                    Government interfered considerably with the success of his negotiations.
                    Advances of arms and money arrived too late, and though Forbes employed all his
                    own means and what money he could borrow on his personal security, his resources
                    were quite inadequate to the emergency. It is doubtful whether these advances
                    were ever fully repaid. Part was doled out to him, after repeated solicitations
                    that his credit might be maintained in the country; but it is evident he had
                    fallen into disgrace in consequence of his humane exertions to mitigate the
                    impolitic severities inflicted upon his countrymen after their disastrous defeat
                    at Culloden. The ingratitude of the Government, and the many distressing
                    circumstances connected with the insurrection, sunk deep into the mind of
                    Forbes. He never fairly rallied from the depression thus caused, and after a
                    period of declining health he died on the 10th of December 1747, in the
                    sixty-third year of his age.</p>
                <p>Forbes was a patriot without ostentation or pretence, a true Scotsman with no
                    narrow prejudice, an accomplished and even erudite scholar without pedantry, a
                    man of genuine piety without <pb break="no"

                    felt his influence through her reviving arts and. institutions; and the example
                    of such a character in that coarse and venal age, and among a people distracted
                    by faction, political strife, and national antipathies, while it was invaluable
                    to his contemporaries in a man of high position, is entitled to the lasting
                    gratitude and veneration of his countrymen. In his intervals of leisure he
                    cultivated with some success the study ot philosophy, theology, and biblical
                    criticism. He is said to have been a diligent reader of the Hebrew Bible. His
                    published writings, some of them of importance, include— <hi rend="italic">A
                        Letter to a Bishop, concerning some Important Discoveries in Philosophy and

                    (1735); and <hi rend="italic">Reflections on Incredulity</hi> (2d ed. 1750). His
                    correspondence was collected and published in 1815, and a memoir of him (from
                    the family papers) was written by Mr Hill Burton, and published along with a <hi
