                            Luigi</hi></label> (about 1523- 1547), count of Lavagna, Genoese
                    conspirator, was descended from a great historical family which counted among
                    its members Popes Innocent IV. and Adrian V. He was born about 1523, and by the
                    death of his father he became at the age of twenty-three the head of his race
                    and the possessor of considerable estates. He had allied himself by marriage
                    with the ancient family of Cibo,—his wife Eleanora, then about twenty years of
                    age, being a woman of high spirit, great beauty, and remarkable attainments. To
                    the advantages of youth and wealth Fiesco added those of a fine figure, a
                    handsome countenance, and fascinating manners. He was ambitious of power and
                    high place, and inherited from his ancestors a strong passion of jealousy and
                    hatred against the Doria family, the head of which, Andrea Doria, was then doge
                    of the republic, while his Dephew, the young Gianettino Doria, was commander of
                    the galleys. With personal and family hostility was combined<pb break="no"

                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0157-0148"/> the political enmity between the imperial and
                    French (aristocratic and popular) parties,—the Dorias belonging to the former
                    and being warmly supported by the nobles, while the Fieschi were of the latter
                    and leaned upon the popular class. Bent on the overthrow of the doge and his
                    family, Giovanni Luigi made an attempt to secure the support of Francis I. in
                    his enterprise, but in this he did not at first succeed. The negotiations were
                    afterwards renewed through William du Bellay, then French ambassador in Italy,
                    and an understanding was come to that the object of the proposed revolution
                    should be to subject the republic to the king of France. The sanction of the
                    pope, Paul IIΓ. was obtained, and the alliance of the duke of Parma and
                    Placentia secured. Associated with Giovanni Luigi in the conspiracy were his
                    brothers Geronimo and Ottobuoni, and his trusted friends Vincenzo Calcagno, De
                    Varese, and Raffaello Sacco. Troops were levied in the duchy of Parma, and
                    report of these suspicious preparations was sent to Andrea Doria to put him on
                    his guard. But his regard for the young count forbade him to entertain
                    suspicion, and no precautions were taken. When all was ready, Fiesco invited the
                    Dorias to a banquet at his palace on the first day of January 1547, purposing to
                    assassinate them on their arrival. But the doge declined the invitation, his
                    nephew Gianettino had to leave Genoa for some weeks, and the scheme thus
                    foundered. The next night, however, taking advantage of the unsettled state of
                    the city at the period of re-election of the doge, Fiesco led out his band
                    (having first by display of affectionate attention to Doria thrown him off his
                    guard), seized the arsenal, and attacked the galleys. While passing along a
                    plank from the quay to one of the galleys the leader fell into the sea and was
                    drowned, the darkness and the confusion preventing his cries for help being
                    heard. The other conspirators proceeded with their task, and Gianettino was
                    slain. The doge succeeded in making his escape, and after the dispersion of the
                    troops and the flight of the leaders, he returned to Genoa, and was welcomed
                    with extraordinary honours. Eleanora, wife of Fiesco, escaped to Massa, married
                    again, survived her second husband many years, and died at Florence in 1594. The
                    story of this conspiracy has frequently been told both by historians and by
                    poets. Amongst the prose narratives that of Mascardi (Antwerp, 1629) is
                    commended for accuracy of detail, but is wanting in impartiality. Amongst the
                    poems the most noteworthy is the tragedy of Schiller.</p>
