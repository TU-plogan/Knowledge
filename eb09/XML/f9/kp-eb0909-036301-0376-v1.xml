                <p><label type="entry">FONTAINEBLEAU</label>, a town of France, at the head of an
                    arrondissement, in the department of Seine-et-Marne, about 37 miles S.E. from
                    Paris on the railway to Lyons, in 48° 24' 23" N. lat. and 2° 42' 1" E. long. It
                    stands in the midst of the forest of Fontainebleau, is well built, and has
                    broad, clean, handsome streets. Among the more important buildings and
                    institutions are the hotel de ville, the barracks, the court-house, two
                    hospitals, a college, and a public library. The Pompadour mansion, and a portion
                    of that which belonged to the cardinal of Ferrara, are still preserved; and a
                    statue of General Damesme adorns the principal square. Wood-turning and the
                    manufacture of porcelain and earthenware are the chief industries; and wine,
                    grapes, garden produce, and paving stones are articles of export. The population
                    in 1871 was 11,545. In the immediate vicinity of the town is the celebrated
                    palace of Fontainebleau—one of the largest, and in the interior one of the most
                    sumptuous, of the royal residences of France. The origin of the name and of the
                    building are equally unknown; but the old manor-house was used by Louis VII. in
                    the latter part of the 12th century, and continued a favourite residence of
                    Philip Augustus and St Louis. The existing edifice was begun by Francis I., who
                    laid out immense sums of money in its erection, employing Primaticcio, a famous
                    Italian architect, to draw the plans, and commissioning Leonardo da Vinci,
                    Andrea del Sarto, and Benvenuto Cellini to expend the resources of their arts in
                    making it a truly royal residence. Henry IV. doubled the area of the buildings
                    and gardens, adding among other portions the great Diana gallery, the Court of
                    the Princes, and the Galerie des Cerfs. A canal which he constructed was
                    afterwards filled up by Louis XIV. With Louis XV. the palace fell into
                    disfavour, and for a time it was used as a military school. Napoleon I. restored
                    it with great splendour, at a cost of 6 million francs, and often resided in it;
                    but after the return of the Bourbons it was again allowed to fall into
                    disrepair. Louis XVIII. and Louis Philippe both did somewhat to its restoration.
                    The congeries of buildings is very extensive, the roofing, it is said, covering
                    no less than 14 acres. There are five great courts, distinguished as the Court
                    of the White Horse, the Court of the Fountain, the Oval or Donjon Court, the
                    Court of Princes, and the Court of the Kitchens or of Henry IV. The first is
                    also called the Court of Adieux in memory of the parting scene between Napoleon
                    and his Old Guard in 1814, at the foot of the Horse Shoe staircase. The chapel
                    of the Holy Trinity was built under Francis I., and the chapel of St Saturnin
                    dates from the same period, and occupies the site of an older building which was
                    consecrated by Thomas à Becket. It is impossible to do more than mention a few
                    of the historical events which have taken place at Fontainebleau. Philip the
                    Fair, Henry III., and Louis XIII. were all boru in the palace, and the first of
                    these kings died there. James V. of Scotland was there received by his intended
                    bride; and Charles V. of Germany was entertained there in 1539. Christina of
                    Sweden lived there for years, and the gallery is still shown where she caused
                    her secretary Monaldeschi to be murdered, or, as she regarded it, executed. In
                    1685 Fontainebleau saw the signing of the revocation of the edict of Nantes, and
                    in the following year the death of Condé. In the 18th century it had two
                    illustrious guests in Peter the Great of Russia and Christian VII. of Denmark;
                    and in the early part of the 19th it was twice the residence of Pius VII.,—in
                    1804, when he came to consecrate the emperor, and in 1812-1814, when he was that
                    emperor’s prisoner. It was within its walls that the sentence of divorce was
                    passed against Josephine. The forest of Fontainebleau is one of the most
                    beautiful wooded tracks in France, and for generations it has been the chosen
                    haunt of French landscape painters. The most celebrated spots are the Vallée de
                    la Solle, the Gorge au Loup, the Gorge d’Apremont, and the Fort 1’Empereur. The
                    whole area extends to 81,740 acres, and it is traversed by 12,000 miles of road
                    and pathway.</p>
