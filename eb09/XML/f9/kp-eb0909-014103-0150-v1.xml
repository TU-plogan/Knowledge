                <p><label type="entry">FIELD, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nathan</hi></label>, a dramatist
                    and actor of the time of Elizabeth, was probably born about but not later than
                    1587. He was the son of the rector of Cripplegate, the Rev. John Field, and
                    early became one of the children of Queen Elizabeth’s chapel, and in 1600 he
                    played one of the principal parts in Ben Jonson’s <hi rend="italic">Cynthia's
                        Bevels,</hi> which was acted by children. Next year he played in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Poetaster,</hi> in 1607 in <hi rend="italic">Bussy
                        d,'Ambois,</hi> and in 1608 in <hi rend="italic">Epicene,</hi> on which
                    occasion his is the only name among the “children” of 1600 which still remains.
                    In 1612, when he must have been very young, he brought out his first play, the
                    original comedy of <hi rend="italic">A Woman is α Weathercock,</hi> in which the
                    inconstancy of woman is made a theme fertile in humour. In 1613 he was engaged
                    with Daborne in writing a play which has not been handed down to us; and soon
                    afterwards we find these two authors, in conjunction with Massinger, praying
                    Henslowe for a small sum of money to free them from imprisonment. In 1618 Field
                    printed <hi rend="italic">Amends far Ladies,</hi> in which he reversed the
                    judgment of his first comedy, and, in the persons of a virtuous maid, wife, and
                    widow, vindicated womankind against himself. It has been supposed that Field had
                    some hand in editing the first folio Shakespeare in 1623; he certainly assisted
                    Massinger in that year in composing his tragedy of <hi rend="italic">The Fatal
                        Dowry,</hi> and the play bears evident traces of his co-operation. In 1639
                    he reprinted the <hi rend="italic">Amends for Ladies,</hi> and in 1641 he was
                    dead. There exists a portrait of Field in Dulwich College. He was the poetic
                    “son” of George Chapman, and the associate of many dramatic poets of that age.
                    His elder brother Theophilus, also a writer of verse, entered the church, and
                    rose to be bishop of Llandaff and afterwards of Hereford. The two unassisted
                    plays of Nathan Field are comedies of contemporary London life, and are mainly
                    written in very smooth and flowing blank verse. They contain one or two lyrics,
                    which, in conjunction which certain passages in <hi rend="italic">The Fatal
                        Dowry,</hi> prove Field to have surpassed Massinger in lyrical power. <hi
                        rend="italic">Amends for Ladies</hi> is greatly superior to its companion
                    play in animation, plausibility, and humour; but the passages between Scudmore
                    and Bellafront in <hi rend="italic">A Woman is a Weathercock</hi> perhaps
                    display the serious style of Field at its best. His song “Rise, lady mistress,
                    rise,” in <hi rend="italic">Amends for Ladies,</hi> is a charming aubade. It is
                    to be regretted that we possess so little of the work of this bright and
                    sensible writer. His plays have never been collected.</p>
