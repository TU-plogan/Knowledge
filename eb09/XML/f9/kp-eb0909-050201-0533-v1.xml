                    prelate, statesman, and diplomatist, bishop successively of Exeter, Bath and
                    Wells, Durham, and Winchester, and founder of Corpus Christi College, Oxford,
                    was born about the close of the reign of Henry VI. He was a native of Roρesley,
                    near Grantham, in Lincolnshire, and his parents are said to have been in humble
                    circumstances. His education, however, was not neglected, for he was sent to
                    school either at Boston or at Winchester, and thence transferred to Magdalen
                    College, Oxford. His studies, in which he gained much distinction, were
                    interrupted by an outbreak of the plague, and he went to continue them at
                    Pembroke Hall, Cambridge. He next went to Paris, and there pursued the study of
                    theology and the canon law, At Paris he became acquainted with Morton, bishop of
                    Ely, then an exile, and by him he was introduced to Henry, earl of Richmond, who
                    was preparing his invasion of England. He at once gained Henry’s confidence, and
                    managed for him the delicate business of getting assistance in men and money
                    from the king of France. After the victory of Bosworth and accession of the earl
                    as Henry VII., Fox, now a doctor of divinity, was made a nrivy councillor, and
                    became one of the most trusted advisers of the king. Honours fell thick upon
                    him. In rapid succession he was made a prebendary of Sarum, bishop of Exeter,
                    keeper of the privy seal, principal secretary of state, and master of St Cross,
                    Winchester (1487). From this time he was almost constantly employed by the king
                    in political affairs both at home and abroad. He was several times sent
                    ambassador to Scotland, and several times to France. In 1491 he was translated
                    to the see of Bath and Wells, and three years later to that of Durham. In 1497
                    he personally defended his castle of Norham when besieged by the Scots, until it
                    was relieved by the earl of Surrey. The same year he negotiated a truce for
                    seven years between England and Scotland. He also tcok part in the treaty for
                    the marriage between James IV. of Scotland and Margaret, daughter of Henry VII.
                    In 1500 he was chosen chancellor of the university of Cambridge, and held the
                    office for two years. The same year he was translated to the see of Winchester,
                    which he held till his death, a period of twenty-eight years. He was master of
                    Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, from 1507 to 1519. During the reign of Henry VII. his
                    influence was supreme in the state, no important affair being undertaken without
                    consulting him. The king named Fox one of his executors, and especially
                    recommended him to his son and successor Henry VIII. But his credit soon
                    declined under the new king, partly owing to the character of Henry, and partly
                    to the rivalry of the earl of Surrey. Amongst the chaplains of Bishop Fox at
                    this time was Thomas Wolsey; and in order to counteract the influence of Surrey,
                    Fox introduced Wolsey to the king. In a little while the new comer took
                    precedence of both the rivals. Fox, however, did not suddenly lose the royal
                    favour. In March 1510 he was sent ambassador to France with Surrey and the
                    bishop of Durham, and signed the treaty of alliance with Louis XII. In 1513 he
                    attended Henry VIII. in his expedition to France, and was present at the taking
                    of Terouenne. The same year he took part in negotiating a treaty with the
                    emperor Maximilian. Fox was one of the executors of Margaret, countess of
                    Richmond, and in this capacity had a share in completing the settlement of St
                    John’s College, Cambridge. Continually mortified by the supremacy of his former
                    protégé, Wolsey, and by the insults he had to endure from him, he at length
                    (1515) withdrew from the court and retired to his diocese. The rest of his life
                    was devoted to the discharge of his ecclesiastical duties and to works of
                    charity and munificence. During this period he rendered great service to the
                    cause of liberal education by his foundation of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.
                    His first intention was to make it a monkish seminary, and for this he obtained
                    a licence. But on the advice of Oldham, bishop of Exeter/ he changed his plan,
                    and made it simply a school for the increase of learning. Bishop Oldham
                    contributed largely to the cost of the buildings. Fox was founder also of free
                    schools at Taunton and at Grantham. He became blind some years before his death,
                    and was pressed by Wolsey to resign his see to him, but this he stoutly refused
                    to do. He died, in a good old age, September 14, 1528.</p>
