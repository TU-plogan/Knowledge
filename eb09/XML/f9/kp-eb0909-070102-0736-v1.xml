                    called by the Latinized form of his name <hi rend="italic">Francus,</hi> an
                    important German writer of the Reformation period, was born about 1500 at
                    Donauworth, and regularly styled himself Franck of Word. Of his early years
                    nothing is known except by inference. It appears that he studied at Heidelberg,
                    and about 1524 was ordained a Roman Catholic priest. In 1528 he married Ottilia
                    Behaim at Nuremberg; and the same year he produced his German translation of
                    Althamer’s <hi rend="italic">Diallage, or Reconciliation of the Contradictions
                        of the Scriptures,</hi> and wrote a treatise against the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Horrible Vice of Drunkenness.</hi> Two years later appeared, with an
                    introduction by Luther, his translation of a <hi rend="italic">Chronicle and
                        Description of Turkey, written by a Transylvanian who had been Twenty-two
                        Years in Turkish Captivity.</hi> In 1531 he was in Strasburg, and published
                    his <hi rend="italic">Chronika,</hi><hi rend="italic">Zeitbuch, und</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Geschichtbibel,</hi> one of the first German works in which an
                    attempt was made to give a survey of universal history. From Strasburg he
                    removed to Esslingen; and there during 1532 and 1533 he attempted to support
                    himself by soap-boiling, but found it on the whole an unprofitable occupation.
                    In hope of a better market for his wares he went to Ulm, where in 1534 he
                    received the freedom of the city. For some time he remained peacefully printing
                    his books, but on the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Parodoxa</hi> his
                    privileges were withdrawn, and he was ordered to depart. A promise to submit his
                    writings to censure procured a temporary reprieve of the sentence, but in 1539
                    he was finally banished, and from that time he appears never to have settled
                    long in one place. He was engaged as a printer and publisher at Basel when he
                    died, in 1543 or 1545. Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote also a
                    collection of proverbs <hi rend="italic">(Spruch-Wörter)</hi> in 1532, which
                    appeared in fuller form in 1591, a <hi rend="italic">Germanice</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Chronicon,</hi> 1538, and the <hi rend="italic">Guldin Arch
                        or</hi><hi rend="italic">Arca Aurea,</hi> 1538, a collection of Scripture
                    doctrines with proof passages, not only from the Bible itself, but also from
                    pagan writers. Franck’s position as α thinker was a peculiar one. Though
                    associated at first with the Reformers, he soon showed that he was out of
                    sympathy with their dogmatic tendencies, and at length was branded by Luther as
                    a “devil’s mouth.” He was naturally inclined to subjectivity and mysticism, and
                    may to a certain extent be regarded as a forerunner of modern German idealism.
                    His religion was practically pantheistic, and tended to foster a spirit of
                    tolerance that found good in everything. Amid the bitter controveries of
                    contending sects it was rare to find a professed theologian maintaining that the
                    true church consisted of “all pious and good-hearted men in all the world, even
                    among the heathen.” As an historian, while still credulous enough to believe in
                    the Trojan myths of the Middle Ages, he displayed a remarkably modern spirit in
                    the attention he gave to social conditions. The first part of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Chronicon,</hi> &amp;c., contains the history of antiquity,
                    the second includes the period from Christ to Charles V., and the third gives
                    account of the popes, councils, heretics, ceremonies, &lt;fcc. His German style
                    is plain, vigorous, and idiomatic, and ranks him high among the founders of
                    German prose.</p>
