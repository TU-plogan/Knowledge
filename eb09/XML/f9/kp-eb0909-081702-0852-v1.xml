                    an American engineer and mechanician, was born in 1765 at Little Britain in
                    Pennsylvania. At the age of seventeen he adopted the profession of a portrait
                    and landscape painter, but he also, even then, devoted a considerable portion of
                    his time to mechanical pursuits. In his twenty-second year he visited England,
                    with the view of improving himself in art by the instructions of his countryman
                    West. There he made the acquaintance of the duke of Bridgewater, Earl Stanhope,
                    and Watt; and partly by their influence he was led to devote his attention more
                    exclusively to mechanical engineering. In 1793 he had conceived the design of
                    propelling vessels by steam, but did not at that time find a suitable
                    opportunity for putting his views into practice. His time was also much
                    engrossed in devising a method of superseding the locks on canals by a plane of
                    double incline for which he obtained a patent from the British Government in
                    1794. In the same year he obtained patents for flax-spinning and rope-twisting
                    machines, and various other mechanical inventions, bearing chiefly upon the
                    construction of canals, on which latter subject he published a treatise. In 1797
                    he removed to Paris, and remained for seven years in the house of Joel Barlow,
                    the American minister at the court of France, prosecuting his scientific
                    studies. During that period he projected the first panorama ever <hi

                    on submarine explosives. These experiments were further continued in America,
                    'but although Congress voted him 5000 dollars for prosecuting them, his plans
                    were finally declared impracticable. It was also at Paris that he first
                    succeeded, after repeated trials, in propelling a boat through the water by the
                    aid of steam. In 1806 he returned to America and repeated the experiment on a
                    larger scale and with more decided success. In 1809 he took out his first
                    patent, but his rights were disputed, and after protracted legislation a
                    compromise was effected. In 1814 Fulton constructed the firstj United States’war
                    steamer, and he was engaged upon an improvement of his submarine torpedo when he
                    died, February 24, 1815.</p>
