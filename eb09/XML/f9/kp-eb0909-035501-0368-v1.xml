                    (1669-1752), a French writer on military tactics, was born at Avignon, 13th
                    February 1669. His military ardour was first awakened by reading Caesar’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> and became so strong that he twice made his
                    escape from parental control, the second time being successful in obtaining the
                    fulfilment of his wishes. When he joined the army he was only sixteen years of
                    age, but the zeal with which he studied the scientific department of his
                    profession soon brought him into notice, and in 1702 he became aide-de-camp to
                    the duke of Vendome, who was then in command of the French forces in Italy. For
                    his services with the duke’s brother in Lombardy in 1705 Folard received the
                    cross of St Louis, and in the same year he distinguished himself at the battle
                    of Cassano, where he was severely wounded. In 1706 he defended Modena against
                    Prince Eugene. He was dangerously wounded at the battle of Malplaquet, and a few
                    months afterwards was taken prisoner by the Austrians. In 1711 he was appointed
                    governor of Bourbourg, and he afterwards entered the service of Charles XII. of
                    Sweden, and accompanied him in the invasion of Norway; but after the death of
                    Charles he returned to France, and served as colonel in the Spanish campaign of
                    the duke of Berwick. On the conclusion of peace he applied himself with renewed
                    diligence to the study of military tactics, and expounded his views in the
                    following works :— <hi rend="italic">Nouvelles Découvertes sur</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">la Guerre,</hi> 1724; <hi rend="italic">Commentaires

                        et Devoirs d'un Officier de Cavalrie,</hi> 1733. The system of column
                    formation advocated by Folard, and many of his other opinions, have met with
                    nothing but ridicule from tacticians; but Frederick the Great, while condemning
                    his general system of tactics, nevertheless published an abridgment of his
                    works, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Esprit du Chevalier Folard,</hi>
                    1761, in the preface to which he expressed a high opinion of the sagacity of
                    Folard’s criticism of certain French generals, strongly recommended many of his
                    tactical rules and methods of defence, and admitted that even in his most
                    visionary plans hints were to be found very valuable and suggestive. Folard died
                    at Avignon in 1752.</p>
