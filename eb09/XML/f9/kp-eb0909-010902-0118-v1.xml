                        rend="italic">furo)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> an albino
                    variety of weasel, regarded by some as the descendant of a wild species
                    originally brought from Africa, and now only known in the domesticated state,
                    and by others, as a variety of the polecat <hi rend="italic">(Mustela</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">putorius),</hi> which it closely resembles in size, form, and
                    habits, and with which it is said to interbreed freely. It differs, however,
                    from the polecat in the colour of its fur, which is usually yellowish-white, and
                    of its eyes which are pinky-red. A more important difference, as bearing on the
                    question of its specific distinctness, lies in the fact that while the polecat
                    thrives in the severe climate of northern Europe, the ferret is peculiarly
                    intolerant of cold, and only survives the English winter by means of the
                    artificial warmth to which, under domestication, it is accustomed. The ferret
                    attains a length of about fourteen inches, exclusive of the tail, which measures
                    about five inches. Although exhibiting considerable tameness, it seems incapable
                    of attachment, and when not properly fed or when otherwise irritated is apt to
                    give painful evidence of its native ferocity. Tempted by the opportunity of the
                    mother’s absence it has been known to attack the child in the cradle, and having
                    once tasted blood it seems to lose all its acquired shyness, and will then
                    boldly attack any one interfering with the gratification of its bloodthirsty
                    propensity. It is chiefly employed in destroying rats and other vermin, and in
                    driving rabbits from their burrows into nets spread for their reception. For the
                    latter purpose it is usually muzzled, to prevent it devouring its prey and
                    thereafter going to sleep at the bottom of a burrow until roused by hunger to
                    renewed exertion. The ferret is remarkably prolific, the female bringing forth
                    two broods annually, each numbering from six to nine young. It is said to devour
                    its young occasionally immediately after birth, and in this case it produces
                    another brood soon after. The ferret was well known to the Romans, Strabo
                    stating that it was brought from Africa into Spain, and Pliny that it was
                    employed in his time in rabbit hunting, under the name <hi rend="italic"
