                <p>Though not a few birds have in proportion to the size of their body very long
                    legs and a very long neck, yet the way in which both are employed by the
                    Flamingo seems to be absolutely singular. In taking its food this bird reverses
                    the ordinary position of its head so as to hold the crown downwards and to look
                    backwards. The peculiar formation of the bill, which to the ordinary observer,
                    looks as if broken, is of course correlated with this habit of feeding, as well
                    as the fact that the <hi rend="italic">maxilla</hi> is (contrary to what obtains
                    in most birds) not only highly movable, but is much smaller than the <hi

                        >lamellae,</hi> as in most of the Duck-tribe, and the food is thereby sifted
                    out of the mud as the Flamingo wades with its long neck stretching to. the
                    bottom of the shallow waters it frequents. Still more extraordinary is one of
                    the uses made of its long legs. The hen stands upon them<note anchored="true"

                            Flamingo “sits astride with dangling legs.”</p></note> while performing
                    that duty which in other birds is rightly called “sitting.” This fact was
                    noticed so long ago as 1683 by Dampier, and his statement has been confirmed by
                    the evidence collected by many other travellers. It does not appear, however,
                    that the act has been personally witnessed by any author subsequent to him, and
                    therefore his quai nt and obviously truthful account of the way in which
                    Flamingoes build their nests and hatch their young, as observed by him in the
                    Cape Verd Islands, may here be quoted :—“They build their Nests in shallow
                    Ponds, where there is much Mud, which they scrape together, making little
                    Hillocks, like small Islands, appearing out of the Water a foot and half high
                    from the bottom. They make the foundation of these Hillocks broad, bringing them
                    up tapering to the top, where they leave a small hollow pit to lay their Eggs
                    in; and when they either lay their Eggs, or hatch them, they stand all the
                    while, not on the Hillock, but close by it with their Legs on the ground and in
                    the water, resting themselves against the Hillock, and covering the hollow Nest
                    upon it with their Rumps: For their Legs are very long; and building thus, as
                    they do, upon the ground, they could neither draw their Legs conveniently into
                    their Nests, nor sit down upon them otherwise than by resting their whole bodies
                    there, to the prejudice of their eggs or their young, were it not for this
                    admirable contrivance, which they have by natural instinct. They never lay more
                    than two Eggs, and seldom fewer. The young ones cannot fly till they are almost
                    full grown, but will run prodigiously fast; yet we have taken many of
                    them.”—Dampier, <hi rend="italic">New Voyage round the World,</hi> ed. 2,
                    corrected, vol. i. p. 71, London, 1697.</p>
                <p>It is of course only under very favourable circumstances that such nests as these
                    can be built. When time or place is wanting the hens seem to drop their eggs at
                    random, as Mr J. W. Clark was told they usually do at this day in the South of
                    France <hi rend="italic">(Ibis,</hi> 1870, p. 441), where a nest has not been
                    seen for some years. Flamingoes are eminently gregarious. Their favourite
                    resorts are salt-lakes—indeed these may be said to be a prime necessity; and
                    when, as often happens, they are diminished by drought, the birds have to take
                    long flights in quest of new haunts. Thus some of the wanderers occasionally get
                    separated from the main body, and appear in various unwonted spots. On the wing
                    the Flamingo is described as presenting a singular appearance, its neck and legs
                    being <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n298/mode/1up"

                    When feeding or at rest, a flock of these birds, owing to their red plumage, has
                    often been likened to a body of British soldiers. The young appear to be a long
                    time in arriving at the full beauty of their plumage, and as the sexes are said
                    to differ greatly in size, some of the difficulties which the determination of
                    species in this genus presents may be excused. No fewer than four species of <hi
                        rend="italic">Phoenicopterus</hi> have been described as inhabiting the Old
                    World. There is the large bird known to the ancients, Temminck’s <hi
                        rend="italic">P. antiquorum,</hi> which certainly ranges from the Cape Verd
                    Islands to the Caspian and to India, if not further. The <hi rend="italic">P.
                        erythraeus</hi> of Jules Verreaux has been described as differing in its
                    brighter plumage, and is supposed to be a native of Southern and Western Africa,
                    but it is also said to have strayed to Europe. Then two smaller species <hi
                        rend="italic">(P. minor,</hi> Geoffroy, and <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">rubidus,</hi> Feilden)—the one from Africa the other from
                    India, have also been described, but whether their existence can be
                    substantiated remains to be seen. Four species have likewise been indicated as
                    belonging to the New World. There is first a large and very brilliantly-coloured
                    bird to which the Linusean name <hi rend="italic">P.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >ruber</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Linnaeus

                            species, <hi rend="italic">P. ruber.</hi> Here he was decidedly wrong,
                            since those of the Old World and of the New are entirely distinct; but
                            the reason for assigning this trivial name to one of the latter has yet
                            to be explained by ornithologists.</p></note><hi

                    p. 498) refers the <hi rend="italic">P. glyphorhynchus</hi> of G. R. Gray,
                    founded on a specimen from the Galapagos. Then there is the <hi rend="italic">P.

                    writers) which in colouring more resembles the European species, and is found in
                    various parts of South America. Lastly comes the <hi rend="italic">P.
                        andinus</hi> of Philippi, which is easily distinguished from all others
                    through the want of a back-toe, and was regarded by Bonaparte as meriting
                    generic separation under the name of <hi rend="italic">Phaenicoparrus.</hi> This
                    appears to have its home on the salt-lakes of the elevated desert of
                    Atacama.</p>
                <p>The fossil remains of a Flamingo have been recognized from Lower and Middle
                    Tertiary beds in France, and the species, which appears to have been very close
                    to that commonly called <hi rend="italic">P. antiquorum,</hi> has received the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">P. croizeti</hi> from Professor Gervais. But a more
                    interesting discovery is that by Professor A. Milne-Edwards of no fewer than
                    five species of an extinct form of <hi rend="italic">Phaenicopteridae,</hi>
                    named by him <hi rend="italic">Paloelodus</hi><hi rend="italic">(Ois. Foss, de

                    Miocene epoch. The same distinguished zoologist also refers to this family
                    remains designated by him <hi rend="italic">Agnopterus,</hi> and those of the
                        “<hi rend="italic">Elornis”</hi> (properly <hi rend="italic">Helomis)
