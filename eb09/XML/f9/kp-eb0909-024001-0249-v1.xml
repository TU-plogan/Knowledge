                    at Florence, September 28, 1493. The family name was taken from the town of
                    Firenzuola, situated at the foot of the Apennines, its original home. The
                    grandfather of Agnolo had obtained the citizenship of Florence and transmitted
                    it to his family. Agnolo was destined for the profession of the law, and pursued
                    his studies first at Siena and afterwards at Perugia. There he <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit09newyrich/page/n250/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0909-0250-0241"/> became the associate of the notorious Pietro
                    Aretino, whose foul life he was not ashamed to make the model of his own. They
                    met again at Rome, where Firenzuola practised for a time the profession of an
                    advocate, but with little success. It is asserted by all his biographers that
                    while still a young man ho assumed the monastic dress at Vallambrosa, and that
                    he afterwards held successively two abbacies. Tiraboschi alone ventures to doubt
                    this account, partly on the ground of Firenzuola’s licentiousness, and partly on
                    the ground of absence of evidence; but his arguments are not held to be
                    conclusive. Firenzuola left Rome after the death of Pope Clement VII., and after
                    spending some time at Florence, settled at Prato as abbot of Sau Salvatore. His
                    writings, of which a collected edition was published in 1548, are partly in
                    prose and partly in verse, and belong to the lighter classes of literature.
                    Among the prose works are— <hi rend="italic">Discorsi degli</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Animali,</hi> imitations of Oriental and Aesopian fables, of

                    satirical and burlesque. All his works are esteemed as models of literary
                    excellence, and are cited as authorities in the vocabulary of the Accademia
                    della Crusca. The date of Firenzuola’s death is only approximately ascertained.
                    He had been dead several years when the first edition of his writings appeared
                    (1548). His works have been very frequently republished, separately and in
                    collected editions. ∖ convenient reprint of the whole was issued at Florence in
                    2 vols, in 1848.</p>
