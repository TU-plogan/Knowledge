                <p><label type="entry">FELONY</label>. In English law crimes are divided into
                    felonies and misdemeanours. The difference between them does not depend on their
                    gravity as offences, nor on the amount of punishment attached to them,—it is
                    purely historical. Felonies are those crimes which at common law brought with
                    them after conviction forfeiture of goods. Since the Felony Act, noticed below,
                    this is no longer an existing ground of distinction. Legal writers have sought
                    to throw light on the nature of felony by examining the etymology of the word.
                    One derivation suggested is from the Greek ≠i)λos, an impostor. Others connect
                    it with the Latin verb <hi rend="italic">fallo.</hi> Coke says it is <hi
                        rend="italic">crimen</hi><hi rend="italic">animo felleo perpetratum</hi> (a
                    crime committed with malicious or evil intent). Spelman connects it with the
                    word <hi rend="italic">fee,</hi> signifying fief or feud; and felony in this way
                    would be equivalent to <hi rend="italic">pretium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >feudi,</hi> an act for which a man lost or gave up his fee (see Stephen’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Blackstone,</hi> vol. iv. p. 7). And it appears that acts
                    involving forfeiture were styled felonies in feudal law, although they had
                    nothing of a criminal character about them. A breach of duty on the part of the
                    vassal, neglect of service, delay in seeking investiture, and the like were
                    felonies. Injuries by the lord against the vassal were also felonies. In course
                    of time felonies came to mean capital crimes, although there were a few felonies
                    not punishable by death, and a few capital crimes which were not regarded as
                    felonies. It became a principle of law that when a crime was declared by statute
                    to be a felony, the punishment of death with forfeiture of land and goods
                    necessarily attached (Blackstone’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,</hi> iv. 94).
                    Blackstone accordingly makes felony include all capital crimes below treason.
                    “Every person convicted of any felony for which no punishment is specially
                    provided by the law in force for the time being is liable upon conviction
                    thereof to be sentenced to penal servitude for any period not exceeding seven
                    years, or to be imprisoned with or without hard labour and solitary confinement
                    for any term not exceeding two years, and if a male to be once, twice, or thrice
                    publicly or privately whipped in addition to such imprisonment” (Stephen’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Digest of the Criminal Law,</hi> art. 18). The only practical
                    distinction between felony and misdemeanour is that for the former arrests may
                    be made by private persons acting without judicial authority. The Felony Act,
                    1870, abolished forfeitures for felony.</p>
