                    CARLθ(1812-1866),anItalian physician, statesman, and historian, was born at
                    Russi in Ravenna, 22d October 1812. After completing a brilliant university
                    course at Bologna, he practised as a physician at Ravenna and at Russi. By his
                    successful treatment of various diseases, and his communications to the
                    Bolognese <hi rend="italic">Bollettino</hi><hi rend="italic">delle</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">scienze mediche</hi> and other scientific journals, he soon
                    acquired a considerable reputation, but in 1843 his political opinions brought
                    him under the suspicion of the police, and caused his expulsion from the Papal
                    States. He then resided successively at Marseilles, Paris, Florence, and Turin,
                    taking advantage of the facilities afforded him in each place to perfect his
                    medical skill; but by the amnesty granted by Pius IX. on the 16th July 1846 he
                    was permitted to return to the States, and he received soon afterwards the
                    professorship of clinical surgery at Osimo. In 1845 he published a pamphlet on
                    the cultivation of rice in Italy. In 1847 he was induced to take advantage of an
                    opportunity which then presented itself of entering political life, and became
                    under secretary of state, holding office, however, for little more than a month,
                    since, along with his colleagues, he disapproved of the policy of the pope in
                    siding with Austria against the Italian states. Elected in 1848 member of the
                    reformed parliament for Faenza, he was named director general of health and
                    prisons, but refusing to adhere to the proclamation of a republic, he resigned
                    the office in February 1849, and passed into Tuscany. When the French army
                    entered Rome in the following July he resumed his office, but the triumvirate of

                    again into exile, he took up his residence at Turin, where he published a
                    satirical paper <hi rend="italic">La Frusta,</hi> contributed to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Risorgimento,</hi> and wrote the first part of his chief

                        >stato</hi><hi rend="italic">Romano dal anno</hi> 1815 <hi rend="italic"

                    the Sardinian Government member of the upper council of health; and in 1851 he
                    was appointed minister of public instruction, an office which he held till May
                    1852. As a member of the Sardinian parliament, and as proprietor and editor of a
                    political journal, <hi rend="italic">Il Piemonte,</hi> Farini was one of the
                    most influential supporters of the policy of Cavour, and in 1859 he was sent by
                    the latter on a political mission to Parma and Modena. On the flight of the duke
                    of Modena in June 1859, Farini was entrusted with the provisional government of
                    the town, in which capacity he negotiated the annexation of the duchy to
                    Piedmont. The same year saw the publication of the second volume of his <hi
                        rend="italic">Storia.</hi> In June 1860 he was named by Cavour minister of
                    the interior, but resigned the office on the death of Cavour in June of the
                    following year. On the 8th December 1862 he succeeded Rattazzi as president of
                    the cabinet, in which office he endeavoured to carry out the policy inaugurated
                    by Cavour. Over-exertion, however, brought on softening of the brain, which
                    compelled him to resign his office 24th March 1863, and ultimately resulted in
                    his death at Quarto, near Genoa, 1st August 1866. His remains, originally buried
                    at Turin, were in 1878 removed to his native town of Russi, and monuments to his
                    memory have been erected both there and at Ravenna.</p>
                <p>Several letters addressed by Farini to Mr Gladstone and Lord John Russell, on the
                    affairs of Italy, were reprinted in the appendix to a Jβ∞oire <hi rend="italic"
                        >sur les Affaires</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Italie,</hi> 1859, and a
                    collection of his political correspondence was published at Paris in 1860, under
                    the title <hi rend="italic">Lettres sur les Affaires</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >d'Italie.</hi> His historical work was translated into English, the first
                    part by Mr Gladstone, and the second by a lady under his superintendence. A
                    French translation of the work appeared in 1862. See Ettori Parri, <hi
