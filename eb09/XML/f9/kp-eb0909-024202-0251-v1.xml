                <p><label type="entry">FISHER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, bishop of
                    Rochester, was bom at Beverley in Yorkshire, but the year of his birth is
                    uncertain, some placing it in 1459, others in 1461, and others in 1465. He was
                    educated in the collegiate church of Beverley, and in 1484 he removed to Michael
                    House in Cambridge, of which college he was elected master in the year 1495.
                    Having applied himself to the study of divinity, he took orders; and becoming
                    eminent as a divine, attracted the notice of Margaret, countess of Richmond,
                    mother of Henry VII., who appointed him her chaplain and confessor. In 1501 he
                    took the degree of doctor in divinity, and the same year was elected chancellor
                    of the university. In the year following the first appointment of the
                    newly-established Margaret professorship in divinity was conferred upon him; and
                    in 1504 he was consecrated bishop of Rochester. Fisher has been erroneously
                    credited with the composition of the <hi rend="italic">Assertio Septem
                        Sacramentorum,</hi> in which Henry VIII. attacked the heretic Luther, and
                    for which the pope conferred upon his Majesty the title of “Defender of the
                    Faith.” Sir Thomas More and Fisher, however, published their respective
                    rejoinders to the Reformer’s reply to the king. Hitherto he had retained the
                    friendship and esteem of the king; but from 1527 till his death he was
                    acknowledged as, next to Sir Thomas More, the most influential man of the
                    anti-royal or papal party in England. He published a pamphlet against the
                    divorce of Catherine of Aragon, which was widely disseminated on the Continent,
                    and also secretly circulated in England. In 1533 the parliament found him guilty
                    of misprision of treason, for concealing certain prophetic speeches of Elizabeth
                    Barton, a fanatical impostor known as the Holy Maid of Kent, relative to the
                    king’s death, and condemned him, with five others, to suffer loss of goods and
                    imprisonment during his majesty’s pleasure. He was subsequently released upon
                    payment of a fine of £300. Fisher excused his silence on the ground that the nun
                    had told him that she had communicated her prophecies to Henry in person, but he
                    nevertheless refused to express regret for having been unwittingly connected
                    with treasonable designs. As to the great question of the day, Fisher offered to
                    swear to the succession in the line of Anne Boleyn’s issue, but he refused to
                    acknowledge either the validity of her marriage or the king’s supremacy. For
                    this refusal he was attainted by the parliament of 1534, and committed to the
                    Tower. At this juncture Pope Paul III. sent him a cardinal’s hat. This kindness,
                    however, only hastened the bishop’s ruin. He was beheaded at Tower Hill on the
                    22d of June 1535. It is impossible to withhold from Fisher, notwithstanding his
                    inflexible enmity to the Reformation, the character of a learned, pious, and
                    honest man. His works attest his learning; his inflexible zeal for his faith,
                    and the readiness with which he died for his creed, plainly prove his honesty as
                    well as his piety. His execution was a sad tragedy, defensible only on the plea
                    of political necessity. For the latest apology for Bishop Fisher, see the Rev.

                <p>Fisher was the author of a considerable number of controversial tracts, most of
                    which were collected and printed in one volume folio, Eublished at Wurtzburg in
                    1595. A Life of Fisher, by Rev. John ∣ewis, A.M., was published in 1855, in two
                    volumes.</p>
