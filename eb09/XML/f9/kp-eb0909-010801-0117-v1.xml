                <p><label type="entry">FERRARI GAUDENZIO</label> (1484-1549), a celebrated painter
                    of the Milanese, or more strictly the Piedmontese, school, was born at
                    Valduggia, Piedmont, and learned the elements of painting at VercelH from
                    Girolamo Giovannone. He next studied in Milan, in the school of Scotto, and some
                    say of Luni; towards 1504 he proceeded to Florence, and afterwards to Rome. His
                    pictorial style may be considered as derived mainly from the old Milanese
                    school, with a considerable tinge of the influence of Da Vinci, and later on of
                    Raphael; in his personal manner there was something of the demonstrative and
                    fantastic. The gentler qualities diminished, and the stronger intensified, as he
                    progressed. Ferrari was again in Rome towards the close of Raphael’s life, and
                    is believed to have aided him in the works of Torre Borgia. By 1524 he was at
                    Varallo in Piedmont, and here, iu the chapel of the Sacro Monte, the sanctuary
                    of the Piedmontese pilgrims, he executed his most memorable work. This is a
                    fresco of the Crucifixion, with a multitude of figures, no less than twenty-six
                    of them being modelled in actual relief, and coloured; on the vaulted ceiling
                    are eighteen lamenting angels, powerful in expression. Other leading examples
                    are the following. In the Royal Gallery, Turin, a Pietà, an able early work. In
                    the Brera Gallery, Milan, St Katharine miraculously preserved from the Torture
                    of the Wheel, a very characteristic example, hard and forcible in colour,
                    thronged in composition, turbulent in emotion; also several frescoes, chiefly
                    from the church of Santa Maria della Pace, three of them being from the history
                    of Joachim and Anna. In the cathedral of Vercelli, the choir, the Virgin with
                    Angels and Saints under an Orange-Tree. In the refectory of San Paolo, the Last
                    Supper. In the Louvre, St Paul Meditating. In Varallo, convent of the Minorites
                    (1507), a Presentation in the Temple, and Christ among the Doctors; and (after
                    1510) the History of Christ, in twenty-one subjects; also an ancona in six
                    compartments, named the Ancona di San Gaudenzio. In Santa Maria di Loreto, near
                    Varallo (after 1527), an Adoration. In the church of San Cristoforo, the
                    transept (in 1532-35), a series of paintings in which Ferrari’s scholar Lanini
                    assisted him; by Ferrari himself are the Birth of the Virgin, the Annunciation,
                    the Visitation, the Adoration of the Shepherds and Kings, the Crucifixion, the
                    Assumption of the Virgin, all full of life and decided character, though
                    somewhat mannered. In the church of Saronno, near Milan, the cupola (1535), a
                    Glory of Angels, in which the beauty of the school of Da Vinci alternates with
                    bravura of foreshortenings in the mode of Correggio. In Milan, Santa Maria delle
                    Grazie (1542), the Scourging of Christ, an Ecce Homo, and a Crucifixion. The
                    Scourging, or else a Last Supper, in the Passione of Milan, is regarded as
                    Ferrari’s latest work. He was a very prolific painter, distinguished by strong
                    expression, animation and fulness of composition, and abundant invention; he was
                    skilful in painting horses, and his decisive rather hard colour is marked by a
                    partiality for shot tints in drapery. In general character, his work appertains
                    more to the 15th than the 16th century. His subjects were always of the sacred
                    order. Ferrari’s death took place in Milan. Besides Lanini, already mentioned,
                    Andrea Solario, Giambattista della Cerva, and Férino Stella were three of his
                    principal scholars. He is represented to us as a good man, attached to his
                    country and his art, jovial and sometimes facetious, but an enemy of scandal.
                    The reputation which he enjoyed soon after his death was very great, but it has
                    not fully stood the test of time. Lomazzo went so far as to place him seventh
                    among the seven prime painters of Italy.</p>
