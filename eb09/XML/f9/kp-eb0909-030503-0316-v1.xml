                        <hi rend="smallcaps">de la March, Seigneur de</hi> (1491-1537), marshal of
                    France, historian, was born of an ancient family at Sedan in 1491. A fondness
                    for military exercises displayed itself in his earliest years, and at the age of
                    ten he was sent to the court of Louis XII., and placed in charge of the count of
                    Angoulême, afterwards King Francis L In his twentieth year he married a niece of
                    the Cardinal d’Amboise, but after three months he quitted his home to join the
                    French army in the Milanese. With a handful of troops he threw himself into
                    Verona, then besieged by the Venetians; but the siege was protracted, and being
                    impatient for more active service, he rejoined the army. He then took part in
                    the relief of Mirandola, besieged by the troops of Pope Julius II., and in other
                    actions of the campaign. In 1512, the French being driven from Italy, Fleuranges
                    was sent into Flanders to levy a body of 10,000 men, in command of which, under
                    his father, he returned to Italy in 1513, seized Alexandria, and vigorously
                    assailed Novara. But the French were defeated, and Fleuranges narrowly escaped
                    with his life, having received more than forty wounds. He was rescued by his
                    father and sent to Vercellae, and thence to Lyons. Returning to Italy with
                    Francis I. in 1515, he distinguished himself in various affairs, and especially
                    at Marignano, where lie had a horse shot under him, and contributed so
                    powerfully to the victory of the French that the king knighted him with his own
                    hand. He next took Cremona, and was there called home by the news of his
                    father’s illness. In 1519 he was sent into Germany on the difficult errand of
                    inducing the electors to give their votes in favour of Francis I.; but in this
                    he failed. The war in Italy being rekindled, Fleuranges accompanied the king
                    thither, fought at Pavia (1525), and was taken prisoner with his royal master.
                    The emperor sent him into confinement in Flanders, where he remained for some
                    years. During this imprisonment he was created marshal of France. He employed
                    his enforced leisure in writing his <hi rend="italic">Histoire</hi><hi

                    interesting details of the time, writing only of what he had seen, and in a very
                    simple but vivid style. The book was first published in 1735, by Abbé Lambert,
                    who added historical and critical notes; and it has been reprinted in several
                    collections. The last occasion on which Fleuranges was engaged in active service
                    was at the defence of Peronne, besieged by the count of Nassau in 1536. In the
                    following year he heard of his father’s death, and set out from Amboise for ]ιis
                    estate of La Marek; but he was seized with illness at Longjumeau, and died there
                    in December 1537.</p>
