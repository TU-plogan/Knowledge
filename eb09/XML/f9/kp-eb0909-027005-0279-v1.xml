                    (1763-1798), one of the leaders of the Society of United Irishmen, was a younger
                    son of the first duke of Leinster, and was born at Carton Castle, near Dublin,
                    October 15, 1763. At ten years of age he lost his father, and, his mother
                    marrying again, the family soon after settled in France. Lord Edward was
                    carefully educated by his stepfather, Mr Ogilvie, chiefly with a view to the
                    profession of a soldier. Returning to England in 1779 he entered the English
                    army, and in 1781 he sailed with his regiment for America, where he soon
                    obtained the appointment of aide-de-camp on the staff of Lord Rawdon. He served

                    resource, and humane feeling. He was severely wounded at the battle of Eutaw
                    Springs. After the surrender of York Town he joined the staff of General O’Hara
                    at St Lucia, and the same year (1783) returned to Ireland. He was soon returned
                    as member for Athy to the Irish parliament; but the high hopes which he had
                    cherished of serving his country faded away at the spectacle of political
                    corruption and suppression of all genuine representation by the penal laws
                    against Roman Catholics. In 1787 he set out for a visit to the south of Europe,
                    went afterwards to America, and in 1790 returned to England, and soon resumed
                    his seat in the Irish parliament. The French Revolution had broken out, aud Lord
                    Edward was one of those ardent spirits that welcomed with enthusiasm the promise
                    of its first days. In 1792 he was attracted to Paris, and made the acquaintance
                    of the most famous leaders of the Revolution. Having publicly renounced his
                    title of nobility and avowed his sympathy with the republicans, he was
                    dismissed, with other officers, from the English army. It was during this visit
                    to Paris that he was introduced to the lady then known as “Pamela,” the daughter
                    of Madame de Genlis, by the duke of Orleans ( “Égalité ”). In December 1792 they
                    were married at Tournay, and returned to Ireland in January 1793. After a period
                    of singular happiness spent in a country home, his sympathies with the struggles
                    of his countrymen led him out to the troubled arena of politics. He joined in
                    1796 the society of United Irishmen, was sent to France to negotiate a treaty
                    with the Directory for a French invasion of Ireland, and urged on with the
                    utmost zeal the preparations for an Irish insurrection. But the scheme was
                    betrayed, several of the leaders were arrested, and Fitzgerald concealed himself
                    in a house at Dublin, still continuing to direct the movement. A price was set
                    on his head, the place of his retreat was discovered, and after a severe
                    struggle he was captured by police officers (May 19, 1798) and committed to
                    prison. There he died on the 4th of June, of the wounds which he had received; a
                    bill of attainder was immediately passed against him, and his estates were
                    confiscated; but the attainder was at a later time reversed. His widow married
                    Mr Pitcairn, American consul at Hamburg; but the union was an unhappy one, and
                    ended in a separation by mutual consent. Lady Fitzgerald henceforward lived in
                    retirement at Montauban till 1830, when she removed to Paris, Louis Philippe,
                    the associate of her childhood, having become king of the French. He, however,
                    refused to see her, and she died poor in 1831. An interesting narrative of <hi
