                <p><label type="entry">I</label></p>
                <p>I is one of those symbols which the Greeks employed differently from the
                    Phoenicians. Tn Phoenician it denoted the palatal semi-vowel <hi rend="italic"
                        >y,</hi> called in Hebrew <hi rend="italic">yodh.</hi> The Greeks disliked
                    this sound, and it vanished at an early time out of their language. Consequently
                    they needed no symbol to represent it, and could use the Phoenician symbol to
                    denote that for which the Phoenician alphabet gave them no help, namely, the
                    vowel <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The symbol, however, had not at that time its
                    present simple form, as may be seen by reference to the table at the end of the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Alphabet.</hi> It was made up of several lines, and
                    so it appears in the oldest Greek inscriptions, <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> in
                    those of Thera, about the 40th Olympiad, in which it is not unlike the later
                    form of sigma (⅜). In the old Corinthian alphabet it sometimes has this form;
                    sometimes the angles to the left are rounded, so that it resembles an <hi
                        rend="italic">e.</hi> Generally, however, we find it in Greek simplified
                    into the single straight line with which we are familiar. It has no other form
                    in the Latin alphabet. In the last century before Christ, the Romans sometimes
                    lengthened the symbol to denote the long vowel, so that it reached above the top
                    of the line, while the short vowel was expressed by a line of the usual length.
                    This took the place of the older method by which the symbol was doubled to
                    denote the long vowel; as <hi rend="italic">aa, ee, ii.</hi> But it never became
                    universal, nor was the lengthened symbol always put to the same use; for about
                    the same time we find it used to denote the <hi rend="italic">y</hi> sound in
                    words like <hi rend="italic">Maia, cuius,</hi> where the Romans rightly thought
                    it expedient to have a distinct mark for the semi-vowel. But this also was not
                    permanent.</p>
                <p>The value of the symbol is generally constant in all European languages, ancient
                    or modern, with the exception of English. It is the vowel sound produced by
                    raising the front of the tongue towards the palate, as high as it can be raised
                    without touching. The lips are not rounded; by rounding them, when the tongue is
                    in this position, we should produce the sound of the French <hi rend="italic"
                        >u</hi> or the German <hi rend="italic">Ü.</hi> The vowel may, however, be
                    either open or close, and in either of these cases it may be short or long.
                    Therefore we have four variations, of which, however, probably not more than two
                    are found in any spoken language :—(1) the short open <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    heard in English “sin”; (2) the long open <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which is not
                    one of our spoken sounds, but can be produced in singing; (3) the short close
                        <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which again is not English, but is the Italian
                    short <hi rend="italic">i</hi>; (4) the long close <hi rend="italic">i,</hi>
                    which is the Italian long <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and is also common in
                    English; but we denote the sound, not by i, but by <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> as
                    in “seen.” It is generally supposed that the sound of <hi rend="italic">ee</hi>
                    stands to that of <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in English as a long vowel to the
                    corresponding short; but this is not so; there is a difference in quality as
                    well; <hi rend="italic">ee</hi> denotes (as has been just explained) a close
                    vowel, whereas <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is open. It is true that in ordinary
                    English the open vowel <hi rend="italic">i</hi> only occurs short, and the close
                    vowel long, therefore the confusion is natural. A Scotchman, however, finds no
                    difficulty in pronouncing “seen” short.</p>
                <p>It is practically necessary in English to denote the simple long <hi
                        rend="italic">i</hi> sound by <hi rend="italic">ee,</hi> because the English
                    language has habitually altered the simple sound into a diphthong, and has
                    retained for that diphthong the original spelling <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> Thus
                    in words like “pride,” “mine,” “fire,” &amp;c., the vowel had once in England
                    the same sound as it has on the Continent; but now it is sounded as the
                    diphthong <hi rend="italic">ai,</hi> though the spelling has not been changed.
                    It appears from Mr Alexander J. Ellis’s investigations into the history of
                    English pronunciation that <hi rend="italic">i</hi> had become a diphthong in
                    the 16th century; but the exact date of the change must remain uncertain. There
                    can be little doubt that its nature has been correctly explained by the same
                    philologist. It consists in pronouncing the long vowel without sufficiently
                    raising the tongue at the beginning of the sound; hence the sound is at first
                    too open, and is modified into the proper <hi rend="italic">i</hi> sound before
                    it is terminated. Changes of this sort are natural in long vowels, because there
                    is time to vary the original sound, either as a refinement, or, more probably,
                    through mere inattention and laziness.</p>
