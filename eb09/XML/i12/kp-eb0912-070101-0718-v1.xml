                <p><label type="entry">IGUANODON</label>, a genus of extinct Dinosaurian reptiles,
                    the remains of which have been found in greatest abundance in theWealden, a
                    delta formation of the south-east of England. They also occur, though more
                    sparingly, in the Lower Greensand, where lately (1879) Professor Prestwich
                    announced the discovery in the “Kimmeridge Clay” of what are as yet the earliest
                    known remains of these reptiles. Although no complete skeleton of the iguanodon
                    has been found, such bones of it as have been obtained prove it to have been one
                    of the largest terrestrial animals known. Thus its femur in one instance
                    measured from 4 to 5 feet in length, with a circumference of 22 inches at its
                    narrowest part. These and other measurements led Dr Manteli—the original
                    discoverer of <hi rend="italic">Iguanodon</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> and
                    others to conclude that it probably attained a length of from 50 to 60 feet. Its
                    front limbs appear to have been small, while the hind pair attained enormous
                    development, and from the structure of the latter, which may be regarded as
                    intermediate between those of existing reptiles and of birds, the iguanodon is
                    supposed to have either habitually or occasionally walked on its hind legs like
                    a bird. This supposition is rendered all the more probable by the discovery in
                    the same strata of gigantic three-toed footsteps in pairs such as might have
                    been formed by the iguanodon had it walked in this bipedal manner. The teeth of
                    these animals formed one of their most marked characteristics,— bearing a
                    striking resemblance to the teeth of existing iguanas in their blade-like form
                    and serrated edges, but differing from these as well as from those of all other
                    known reptiles in internal structure. Like existing iguanas they were probably
                    herbivorous, using their teeth for cutting and tearing their tough vegetable
                    food; unlike these, however, they appear to have used their teeth also for the
                    purpose of mastication. This is shown by the deeply worn condition in many cases
                    of the crowns of their teeth, which, from being sharp and incisor-like,
                    gradually assumed a molar-like form. As the old teeth were thus reduced by “tear
                    and wear,” they were gradually replaced by a fresh dental crop. The front
                    portion of the jaws was destitute of teeth, the upper part being beak-like,
                    while the lower was hollowed out like the same region in the parrot.</p>

                <p>Professor Owen regards this as an arrangement to facilitate the protrusion of
                    what was probably a long prehensile tongue—an organ which the iguanodon may be
                    supposed to have employed in stripping the foliage from the trees. There is no
                    fossil evidence to show that it possessed either scutes, scales, or any other
                    form of dermal armour.</p>
