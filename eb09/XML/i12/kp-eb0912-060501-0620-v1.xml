                    the Ural, but has since disappeared from the greater part of this area, being
                    now almost wholly confined to the Alps which separate Valais from Piedmont, and
                    to the lofty peaks of Savoy, where its continued existence is mainly due to the
                    action of protective game laws. The ibex is a handsome animal, measuring about
                        <hi rend="italic">4⅛</hi> feet in length and 2∣ feet high; its skin is
                    covered in summer with a short fur of an ashy grey colour, and in winter with
                    much longer yellowish-brown hair concealing a dense fur beneath. A short beard
                    is present in the male in winter, but, as it disappears altogether in spring,
                    Darwin regards this appendage as rudimentary. The horns, especially in the male,
                    form a striking feature: rising from the crest of the skull, they bend gradually
                    backwards, attaining a length in old specimens of about 2 feet; they are thick
                    and flat, and have the anterior face ridged with knotty transverse bands. In the
                    female the horns never exceed half a foot in length, and are much less rugose
                    than in the male. The front legs are somewhat shorter than those behind, which
                    enables the ibex to ascend the mountain slopes with more facility than it can
                    descend, while its hoofs, according to Tschudi, are “as hard as steel, rough
                    underneath, and when walking over a flat surface capable of being spread out.”
                    These, together with its powerful sinews, enable it to take prodigious leaps, to
                    balance itself on the smallest foothold, and to scale almost perpendicular
                    rocks. The ibex lives habitually at a greater height than the chamois or any
                    other of the Alpine mammals, its vertical limit being the line of perpetual
                    snow. There it rests in sunny nooks during the day, descending at night to the
                    highest woods to graze, and retiring at sunrise to its snowy fastnesses. This
                    return journey forms the ibex hunter’s opportunity. To get within gunshot the
                    huntsman has usually to approach from above; accordingly he ascends to the limit
                    of perpetual snow, and there passes the night among the daily haunts of the
                    ibex, lying in wait from early dawn for its return. The ibexes are gregarious,
                    feeding in herds of ten to fifteen individuals; the old males, however,
                    generally live apart from, and usually at greater elevations than, the females
                    and young. They are said to give out a sharp whistling sound not unlike that of
                    the chamois, but when greatly irritated or frightened they make a peculiar
                    snorting noise. The period of gestation in the female is ninety days, after
                    which she produces—usually at the end of June—a single young one, which is able
                    at once to follow its mother. These when caught young and fed on goat’s milk
                    can, it is said, be readily tamed; and in the 16th century young tamed ibexes
                    were, according to Tschudi, frequently driven to the mountains along with the
                    goats, in whose company they would afterwards voluntarily return. Even wild
                    specimens have thus been known to stray among the herds of goats, although,
                    strange to say, they at all times shun the society of the chamois. The ibex was
                    formerly hunted largely for its flesh and skin; but, although the latter, owing
                    to its scarcity, now commands a high price, the difficulty arising from the
                    operation of the game laws, and above all the difficulty and danger inseparable
                    from the sport, have reduced the number of hunters to a few hardy mountaineers,
                    who find in the pursuit of the ibex the keenest enjoyment of life. For weeks the
                    sportsman will follow a track across fields of ice, along narrow ledges, over
                    precipices, and across chasms, nearly frozen to death at night, and often with
                    little more than a crust of bread for sustenance, yet considering himself more
                    than repaid by the sight at last of his prey grazing within range of his rifle.
                    Its flesh is said to resemble mutton, but has a flavour of game.</p>
