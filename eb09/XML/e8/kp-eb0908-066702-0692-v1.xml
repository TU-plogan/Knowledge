                    emasculated person. From remote antiquity among the Orientals, as also at a
                    later period in Greece, eunuchs were employed to take charge of the women, or
                    generally as <hi rend="italic">chamberlains,—</hi> whence the name, oi <hi

                    those who have charge of the bedchamber. Their position in the harems of princes
                    affording them the ready means of access to the royal person, it is not
                    surprising that they were frequently enabled to exercise an important influence
                    over princes, and even to raise themselves to stations of great trust and power.
                    Hence the term eunuch in Egypt came to be applied to any <hi rend="italic"
                        >court</hi> officer, whether a castratus or not. The vulgar notion that
                    eunuchs are necessarily deficient in courage and in intellectual vigour is amply
                    refuted by history. We are told, for example, by Herodotus that in Persia they
                    were especially prized for their fidelity; and they were frequently promoted to
                    the highest offices. Narses, the famous general under Justinian, was a eunuch,
                    as was also Hermias, governor of Atarnea in Mysia, to whose manes the great
                    Aristotle offered sacrifices, besides celebrating the praises of his patron and
                    friend in a poem (still extant), addressed to <hi rend="italic">Virtue</hi> (see
                    Lucian’s dialogue entitled <hi rend="italic">Eunuchus).</hi> To multiply
                    instances were superfluous. The capacity of this class of persons for public
                    affairs is strikingly illustrated by tho histories of Persia, India, and China;
                    and we need only allude to the power exercised by the euuuchs under the later
                    Roman emperors. The hideous trade of castrating boys to be sold as eunuchs for
                    Moslem harems has continued to modern times, the principal district whence they
                    are taken being the inland of north-eastern Africa. As the larger proportion of
                    children die after the operation (generally total removal), such as recover
                    fetch at least three or four times the ordinary price of slaves. Even more vile,
                    as being practised among a civilized European nation, has been the Italian
                    practice of castrating boys to prevent the natural development of the voice, in
                    order to train them as adult soprano singers, such as might till lately be heard
                    in the Sixtine Chapel. Though such mutilation is a crime punishable with
                    severity, the supply of “soprani” never failed so long as their musical powers
                    were in demand in high quarters. Driven long ago from the Italian stage by
                    public opinion, they remained the musical glory and moral shame of the papal
                    choir till the accession of the present pope (Leo XIII.), one of whose first
                    acts was to get rid of them. Mention must here also be made of the class of
                    voluntary eunuchs, who have emasculated themselves, or caused the operation to
                    be performed on them, for the avoidance of sexual sin or temptation. This
                    unnatural development of asceticism appears in early Christian ages, its
                    votaries acting on the texts Mat. xix. 12, V. 28-30. Origen’s case is the most
                    celebrated example, and by the 3d century there had arisen a sect of eunuchs, of
                    whom Augustine says <hi rend="italic">{De</hi><hi rend="italic">Heeres.,</hi> c.
                    37), “Valesii et seipsos castrant et hospites suos, hoc modo existimantes Deo se
                    dèbere servire” (see Neander, <hi rend="italic">History of</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Chr.</hi><hi rend="italic">Church,</hi> vol ii. p. 462; Bingham, <hi
                        rend="italic">Antiq. Chr. Church,</hi> book iv, chap. 3). Such practices
                    have been always opposed by the general body of the Christian churches, but have
                    not even now ceased. It recently came into notice how large and prosperous a
                    secret sect of the kind exists in Russia, whose practice of castration is
                    expressed in the name of Skopzi, by which they are commonly described. (For
