                    A,nomoean Arians, who are sometimes accordingly called Eunomians, was born at
                    Dacora in Cappadocia early in the 4th century. Under the advice of the Arian
                    bishop Secundus of Antioch, he was sent to Alexandria to study theology under
                    Aetius, whose secretary he became. He afterwards came under the influence of
                    Eudoxius of Antioch, where he was ordained deacon. On the recommendation of
                    Eudoxius he was appointed bishop of Cyzicus in 360. Tn this position he gave
                    unrestrained utterance to his extreme Arian views, with the result that the
                    inhabitants of Cyzicus lodged a complaint against him, and Eudoxius was
                    compelled, by command of the emperor Constantine, to depose him from the
                    bishopric within a year of his elevation to it. During the reigns of Julian the
                    Apostate and Jovian, he resided in Constantinople in closeintercourse with
                    Aetius,consolidating an heretical party and consecrating schismatical bishops.
                    He next resided at Chalcedon, from which he was banished to Mauritania by the
                    emperor Valens for harbouring the rebel Procopius. He was recalled, however,
                    before he reached his destination. In 3S3 the emperor Theodosius, who had
                    demanded a declaration of faith from all party leaders, punished Eunomius for
                    continuing to teach his distinctive doctrines, by banishing him to Halmyris in
                    Mcesia. He afterwards resided at Chalcedon and at Caesarea in Cappadocia, from
                    which he was expelled by the inhabitants for writing against their bishop
                    Basilius. His last days were spent at Dacora his birthplace, where he died about
                    394. The writings of Eunomius were held in high reputation by his party, and
                    their influence was so much dreaded by the orthodox, that more than one imperial
                    edict was issued for their destruction <hi rend="italic">{Cod. Theod.,</hi> xvi.
                    34). Consequently his commentary on the epistle to the Romans, mentioned by the
                    historian Socrates, and his epistles, mentioned by Philostorgi us and Photius,
                    are no longer extant. His first apologetical work (’Απολογητικός), written
                    probably about 360 or 365, has been entirely recovered from the celebrated
                    refutation of it by Basilius, and may be found in Fabricius’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bibl. Gr.,</hi> viii., pp. 262-305. A second apology, written before 379
                    (υπ∈p απολογίας απολογία), exists only in the quotations given from it in a
                    refutation by Gregory of Nyssa. The exposition of faith (*Eκd∈σ∙ις τi}ς
                    πiστ∈ως), called forth by the above-mentioned demand of Theodosius, is still
                    extant, and has been edited by Valesius in his notes to Socrates, and by
                    Rettberg in his <hi rend="italic">Marcelliana.</hi> The doctrine of Eunomius, as
                    displayed in these works, was developed by au exclusively logical application of
                    the fundamental idea of the unity of God to the orthodox Trinitarian view.
                    Denying alike the homoousian and the homoiousian theory, he was dialectically
                    probably the ablest and most consistent defender of Anomoeanism, or the doctrine
                    according to which the Son is essentially or substantially different from the
                    Father. According to Socrates (v. 24), Eunomius carried his doctrine to a
                    practical issue by altering the baptismal formula. Instead of baptizing in the
                    name of the Trinity, he baptized in the name of the Creator and into the death
                    of Christ. This alteration was regarded by the orthodox as so serious that
                    Eunomians on returning to the church were re-baptized, though the Arians were
                    not. The Eαnomian heresy was formally condemned by the oecumenical council of
                    Constantinople. The sect maintained a separate existence for some time, but
                    gradually fell away owing to internal divisions. It may be noted that Whiston’s
                        <hi rend="italic">Eunomιaηismus</hi><hi rend="italic">Redivivus</hi>
                    contains an English translation of the first apology of Eunomius.</p>
