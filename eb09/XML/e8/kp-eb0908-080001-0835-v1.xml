                        ADMINISTRATORS</label>, in the law of England, are those on whom the
                    personal property of a deceased person devolves, according as he has or has not
                    left a will. If a man dies and leaves a will, the person or persons named
                    therein to carry out his intentions are his executors, and their title to the
                    personality vests at the moment of the testator’s death. If there is no will,
                    the right of administering the personal estate of the deceased is granted,
                    according to certain rules, by the court of probate to persons who are called
                    administrators. When the will contains no nomination of executors,
                    administration is said to be granted “with the will annexed.” The title of the
                    administrator vests at the date of the letters of administration. As to the
                    appointment of executors and administrators before the establishment of the
                    Court of Probate, see articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Will</hi> and <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Intestacy.</hi> The executors or administrators when
                    appointed become the legal personal representatives of the deceased. As to
                    powers and duties administrators stand in the same position as executors.</p>
                <p>It is the duty of an executor—(1) to bury the deceased in a manner suitable to
                    the estate he leaves behind him; extravagant expenses will not be allowed, but
                    the payment of legitimate funeral expenses “takes precedence of any debt or duty
                    whatsoever;” (2) to obtain probate of the will (or letters of administration)
                    within six months after the death. (3) He must make an inventory of the personal
                    estate of the deceased, whether in possession or outstanding, and this inventory
                    he is to deliver to the court on oath. He is to collect all the goods so
                    inventoried and to commence actions which may be necessary to recover those
                    which are outstanding. The executor is responsible to creditors for the whole of
                    such estate, whether in possession or in action. (4) He must pay the debts of
                    the deceased according to their several degrees of priority. An executor can,
                    however, pay any debt due to himself by retaining it out c·f the fund before the
                    other creditors are paid, except in the case of an <hi rend="italic">executor de
                        son tort.</hi> And a creditor only gains a preference for himself over
                    others of the same class by taking action and obtaining judgment for his debt.
                    If the <pb break="no" facs="ia:encyclopediabrit08newyrich/page/n836/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0908-0836-0801"/> estate is exhausted by due and proper
                    payments before all the debts are cleared off, the unsatisfied creditors cannot
                    recover. (5) After the debts come the <hi rend="italic">legacies,</hi> which
                    must be paid as far as the estate will extend. An executor cannot exercise a
                    preference in the payment of his own legacy. (6) The residue of the estate must
                    be paid to the person named in the will as residuary legatee. If there is no
                    will or no residuary legatee named, the residue falls to be distributed among
                    the next of kin, under the statute of distributions (see <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >Intestacy).</hi> It was held at one time that in default of a residuary
                    legatee the residue fell to the executor himself, but now nothing less than the
                    expressed intention of the testator can give it to him.</p>
                <p>An executor <hi rend="italic">de son tort</hi> (of his own wrong) is one who
                    intermeddles with the estate of a deceased without authority. He thereby makes
                    himself liable to all the trouble of an executorship without any of its
                    profits.</p>
                <p>If an executor is under age or abroad when he is appointed, temporary
                    administration <hi rend="italic">durante</hi><hi rend="italic">minore
                        aetate,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">durante absentia,</hi> may be granted to
                    another.</p>
                <p>An executor of an executor becomes the executor of the first testator. If,
                    however, an executor dies intestate before completing the administration of the
                    estate, an administrator <hi rend="italic">de bonis non</hi> must be appointed.
                    This is also the case where an administrator dies before the administration is
                    complete. <hi rend="smallcaps">(e. r.)</hi></p>
