                        >Manoel)</hi> I. (1469-1521), king of Portugal, surnamed the Happy, was the
                    son ot Duke Ferdinand of Viseu and cousin of John II. of Portugal, and was born
                    May 3, 1469. The care of his early education was confided to a Sicilian named
                    Cataldo, under whom he made rapid progress, especially in the classical
                    languages. He succeeded to the throne on the death of John IL, 27th October
                    1495. In 1497 he married Donna Isabella, daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella of
                    Castile. She died in 1498, and two yearn after her death he married her sister
                    Donna Maria. As soon as he mounted the throne Emanuel devoted himself with great
                    ardour to the maritime enterprises begun by his predecessor. He dispatched Vasco
                    da Gama to sail round the Cape of Good Hope in order to discover a new passage
                    to India, and on his return ho sent Pedro Alvarez de Cabral to complete his
                    discoveries. Cabral discovered Brazil aud the Moluccas, and established
                    commercial relations with the Indian and African coasts. Through these
                    expeditions and others under Albuquerque, the influence of Portugal was rendered
                    predominant on the coasts of South Africa and the Indian archipelago, and an
                    inexhaustible field for commerce and colonization was opened up to the
                    Portuguese. Emanuel also entered into commercial relations with Persia,
                    Ethiopia, and China. His whole foreign policy, with the exception of an attempt
                    to conquer Morocco, was a brilliant success; and at the close of his reign
                    Portugal had attained a degree of prosperity, both external and internal, until
                    then unexampled in her history. He was also no less anxious for the individual
                    welfare of his subjects than for the outward prosperity of his kingdom. He made
                    personal visits to all his provinces to inquire into the administration of
                    justice, and he is the author of a code of laws which bears his name. At certain
                    stated hours he was accessible to any of his subjects without distinction who
                    desired redress of grievances, or had any request of importance to make, and so
                    great was his courtesy and patience in listening to their statements that when
                    necessary he sacrificed to them hours that he usually devoted to enjoyment or
                    repose. His persecutions of the Jews, cruel as they were, can scarcely be blamed
                    when we remember the bigotry of his time and country; and it says much for his
                    impartial administration of justice that he caused the ringleaders of a popular
                    insurrection against that people to be executed with the usual marks of
                    opprobrium. He died at Lisbon, December 13, 1521.</p>
