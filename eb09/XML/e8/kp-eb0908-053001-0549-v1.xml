                <p><label type="entry">ERSKINE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, of
                    Linlathen (1788-1870), a writer on theology and religion, son of David Erskine,
                    writer to the signet in Edinburgh, and of Anne Graham, of the Grahams of Airth,
                    was born 13th October 1788. He was a descendant of the earl of Mar, regent of
                    Scotland in the reign of James VI., a grandson of John Erskine of Carnock, and a
                    nephew of the Rev. Dr John Erskine, both noticed above. After being educated at
                    the High School of Edinburgh and at Durham, he attended the literary and law
                    classes at the university of Edinburgh; and becoming in 1810 a member of the
                    Edinburgh faculty of advocates, he for some time enjoyed the intimate
                    acquaintance of Cockburn, Jeffrey, Scott, and the other distinguished men whose
                    talents then lent an unusual lustre to the Scotch bar. On the death of his elder
                    brother in 1816 he succeeded to the family estate of Linlathen, near Dundee, and
                    retired from the bar— occupying the chief portion of his subsequent life in the
                    management of his estate, in the intercourse of a few select friends, and in the
                    discussion—either by conversation, by letters, or by literary publications—of
                    those religious topics which he considered to have a vital relation to man’s
                    highest welfare. The writings of Erskine are perhaps deficient in robustness of
                    thought, but they are clothed in a graceful style, and possess a certain
                    originality and interest, due chiefly to his strong earnestness, unaffected
                    sincerity, and fine moral insight. His theological views have a considerable
                    similarity to those of Frederick Denison Maurice, who acknowledges having been
                    indebted to him for his first true conception of the meaning of Christ’s
                    sacrifice. Erskine had little interest in the “historical criticism” of
                    Christianity, and regarded as the only proper criterion of its truth its
                    conformity or nonconformity with man’s spiritual nature, and its adaptability or
                    non-adaptability to man’s universal and deepest spiritual needs. He considered
                    the incarnation of Christ as the necessary manifestation to man of an eternal
                    sonship in the divine nature, apart from which those filial qualities which God
                    demands from man could <pb break="no"

                    or spiritual condition which virtually implied salvation, because it implied the
                    existence of a principle of spiritual life possessed of an immortal power. This
                    faith, he believed, could be properly awakened only by the manifestation,
                    through Christ, of love as the law of life, and as identical with an eternal
                    righteousness which it was God’s purpose to bestow on every individual soul.
                    During the last 33 years of his life Mr Erskine did not engage in any literary
                    efforts. He spent the summer generally at Linlathen, and the winter either at
                    Edinburgh, Paris, Geneva, or Lausanne. On the Continent he enjoyed the society
                    of, among others, Mdme. Vernet, the duchess de Broglie, the younger Mdme. de
                    Staël, and M. Vinet of Lausanne, and among his most intimate friends in this
                    country were Edward Irving, Frederick Maurice, Dean Stanley, Bishop Ewing, Dr
                    John Brown, and Thomas Carlyle. He exercised considerable influence over the
                    whole circle of his acquaintance by his unassuming earnestness in advocating his
                    religious views, and by the rare qualities of his personal character. He died at
                    Edinburgh 20th March 1870.</p>
                <p>His principal works are <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Internal Evidence for

                    William Hanna, D.D., with reminiscences by Dean Stanley and Principal Shairp,
                    appeared in 1877.</p>
