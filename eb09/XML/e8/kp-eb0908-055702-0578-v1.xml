                        d’</hi></label> (1729-1794), a French admiral, was born at the chateau of
                    Ruvel, Auvergne, in 1729. He entered the army as a colonel of infantry, and in
                    1757 he accompanied Count de Lally to the East Indies, with the rank of
                    brigadier-general. In 1759 he was made prisoner at the siege of Madras, but was
                    released on parole. Before the ratification of his exchange he obtained command
                    of some vessels, and conducted various naval attacks against the English; and
                    having, on his return to France in 1760, fallen accidentally into their hands,
                    he was, on the ground of having broken his parole, thrown into prison at
                    Portsmouth, but as the charge could not be properly substantiated he was soon
                    afterwards released. In 1763 he was named lieutenant-general in the navy, and in
                    1777 vice-admiral; and in 1778 he obtained the command of a fleet intended to
                    assist the United States against Great Britain. In concert with the American
                    generals, he planned an attack on Newport, preparatory to which he compelled the
                    British to destroy some war vessels that were in the harbour; but before the
                    concerted attack could take place, he put to sea against the English fleet,
                    under Lord Howe, when owing to a violent storm, which arose suddenly and
                    compelled the two fleets to separate before engaging in battle, many of his
                    vessels were so shattered that he found it necessary to put into Boston for
                    repairs. He then sailed to the West Indies where he captured St Vincent and
                    Grenada, and compelled the English fleet to take refuge in the harbour of St
                    Christopher. Despairing of the English leaving their place of refuge he set sail
                    to attack Savannah, but all his attempts, as well as those of the Americans,
                    against the town were repulsed with heavy loss, and he was finally compelled to
                    retire. He returned to France in 1780. He was in command of the combined fleet
                    before Cadiz when the peace was signed in 1783; but from that time his chief
                    attention was devoted to politics. In 1787 he was elected to the assembly of the
                    notables; in 1789 he was appointed commandant of the national guard; and in 1792
                    he was chosen admiral by the national assembly. Though in favour of national
                    reform he continued to cherish a strong feeling of loyalty to the royal family,
                    and on the trial of Marie Antoinette in 1793 bore testimony in her favour. On
                    this account, aud because of certain friendly letters which had passed between
                    him and the queen, he was himself brought to trial, and was executed April 28,
                    1794.</p>
