                    (1807-1870), general of the Confederate States army, and one of the greatest of
                    modern commanders, was born at Stratford, in Westmoreland county, Virginia, on
                    January 19,1807. His father, General Harry Lee, better known in the War of
                    Independence as “Light-Horse Harry Lee,” and afterwards governor of Virginia,
                    was the son of a cousin of the subject of last article. Robert Lee entered the
                    military academy at West Point in 1825, and graduated in 1829, when he received
                    a commission in the corps of engineers. When the Mexican war broke out Lee, who
                    was then captain, served in the army under General Scott. He distinguished
                    himself greatly throughout the campaign, and was brevetted as <pb break="no"

                    Chapultepec, where he was wounded. In 1852 he was appointed superintendent of
                    the academy at West Point, and in 1855 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel of the
                    second regiment of cavalry, with which he served in Texas. In March 1861 he was
                    made colonel of the first regiment of cavalry, but in the following month,
                    learning that his native State had withdrawn from the Union, he resigned as an
                    officer of the United States army, and was forthwith put in command of the
                    Virginian forces. When Virginia joined the Confederacy he was the third of five
                    generals appointed by the Southern Congress. No adequate opportunity of gaining
                    distinction was afforded him, however, until the beginning of June 1862, when he
                    received command of the army of northern Virginia, and commenced the series of
                    operations the result of which before the month had closed was to compel M <hi
                        rend="superscript"> i</hi> Clellan to abandon the siege of Richmond.
                    Following up this advantage and Jackson’s victory at Cedar Run on August 9, Lee
                    advanced in person to lead the army that was being formed on the south bank of
                    the Rapidan; after crossing that river he inflicted upon Pope at Manassas the
                    disastrous defeat by which the Federal army was compelled to retire within the
                    fortified lines of Washington. Lee now decided on the invasion of Maryland, and
                    advanced to Frederick city, but, being compelled to divide his forces, he
                    sustained a check in the passes of South Mountain (September 16, 17) which
                    compelled him to recross the Potomac. After a few weeks’ breathing time he found
                    himself again face to face with the Federal army near Fredericksburg early in
                    November; on December 13 the enemy, having crossed the Rappahannock on the
                    previous day, assailed his position in strength, but was defeated with great
                    loss. In the following spring the hostile armies still faced one another on the
                    Rappahannock, but the brilliant strategy of Lee, as exhibited in the battles at
                    Chaneellorsville (May 2-4), against vastly superior forces, resulted in the
                    retreat of the enemy, while Lee was left free to resume his old policy of
                    throwing the Federal forces on the defensive by an advance into Pennsylvania. He
                    encountered the enemy near Gettysburg on July 1, and decided advantages were
                    gained, but the struggle was renewed on the two following days with disastrous
                    consequences to him; he retreated, however, in good order, and reached Virginia
                    on the 12th, when the campaign of the year practically closed. That of 1864
                    began on May 4, when Grant crossed the Rapidan; the passage itself was
                    unresisted, but his subsequent progress was hotly contested in a series of
                    well-fought battles which did not prevent the Federal general from reaching the
                    south side of the Appomattox. The siege of Petersburg began in June, and lasted
                    until April 2, 1865. A week afterwards Lee surrendered with his whole army, thus
                    virtually terminating the war. In the same year he was elected president of
                    Washington and Lee university at Lexington, Virginia, which office he retained
                    until his death on October 12, 1870.</p>
                <p>The events of Lee’s military career briefly indicated in this notice belong to
                    the history of the United States, and will call for further notice in that
                    connexion. To do justice to his extraordinary ability as a general, displayed
                    under circumstances of extreme difficulty, when his movements were continually
                    hampered by political necessities, as well by the lack of material resources,
                    would require an elaborate military biography; it was never more nobly displayed
                    than in the last hopeless stages of the fatal struggle. The personal history of
                    Lee is lost in the history of the great crisis of America’s national life;
                    political friends and foes alike acknowledged the disinterestedness and purity
                    of his motives, his self-denying sense of duty, and the unrepining loyalty with
                    which he accepted the ruin of his party.</p>
