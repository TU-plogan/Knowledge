                    is situated on the Mayenne, 186 miles by railway west from Paris. On the right

                    its irregularly built houses whose slate roofs and pointed gables peep from the
                    groves of trees which clothe the hill. On the left bank the regularly built new
                    town extends far into the plain. The river, here 80 yards broad, is crossed by
                    the handsome railway viaduct, a beautiful stone bridge called “Pont Neuf,” and
                    the Mayenne bridge of three pointed arches, built in the 16th century. There is
                    communication by steamer as far as to Angers. Laval may justly claim to be one
                    of the loveliest of French towns. Its most curious and interesting monument is
                    the sombre-looking old castle of the counts, now transformed into a prison. The
                    new castle, dating from the Renaissance, is now the court house. Laval possesses
                    several churches of different periods: in that of the Trinity, which serves as
                    the cathedral, the transept is of the 12th century while the choir is of the
                    16th; the chapel of the Carmelites is an imitation of the Sainte Chapelle at
                    Paris; Notre Dame des Cordeliers, which dates from the end of the 14th century
                    or beginning of the 15th, has some fine marble altars. Half a mile below the
                    Mayenne bridge is the beautiful 12th century church of Avenières, with an
                    ornamental spire of 1534 and a handsome modern pulpit. The finest remaining
                    relic of the ancient fortifications is the Beucheresse gate near the cathedral.
                    There is a scientific museum, and a library containing 25,000 volumes. The town
                    is embellished by fine promenades, at the entrance of one of which, facing the
                    mairie, stands the statue of the celebrated surgeon Ambrose Paré. On the Place
                    de Cheverus is a statue to the cardinal of that name, archbishop of Bordeaux.
                    The principal industry of the town is the linen manufacture, introduced from
                    Flanders in the 14th century. A large cloth hall (Halle·aux-toiles), built in
                    last century is used now for industrial, artistic, and agricultural exhibitions.
                    At present tickings are chiefly made. This industry occupies ten thousand
                    workmen, who are not gathered together in great factories, but scattered all
                    over the town. Cotton spinning is also carried on, and there are tanneries,
                    flour-mills, foundries, paper-works, and dyeworks. Here also the marbles of the
                    neighbourhood are sawn, the greater part being converted into lime. Laval is the
                    seat of a bishop, and has a lyceum. Population 27,000.</p>
                <p>The history of Laval goes back only to the beginning of the 11th century, but
                    from an early date in the feudal period the barons of Laval were distinguished
                    by their valour and power, and by their alliances. One of them followed William
                    the Conqueror into England. After having assumed the cross they allied
                    themselves with the Montmorencys and Montforts, and their barony passed on later
                    to the Colignys and the La Trémoilles. Laval was taken by Talbot in 1428. It
                    changed hands several times during the wars of the League and the war of La
                    Vendée in 1793.</p>
