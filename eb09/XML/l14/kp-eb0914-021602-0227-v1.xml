                <p><label type="entry">LAING, <hi rend="smallcaps">David</hi></label> (1793-1878), a
                    distinguished Scottish antiquary, especially eminent for his bibliographical
                    knowledge, was the son of William Laing, a bookseller in Edinburgh, and was born
                    in that city in 1793. He was brought up to his father’s business, and continued
                    fθr many years in partnership with him. Shortly after the death of the latter,
                    however, a vacancy having occurred in the librarianship of the Signet Library,
                    Laing was elected to that office in 1837, and continued to hold it till the time
                    of his death. In addition to, it is believed, an almost unexampled knowledge of
                    the titles and value of books, Laing possessed an intimate acquaintance with the
                    early literary history of Scotland. His knowledge of Scottish art was also very
                    extensive; and the ecclesiastical history of his native country, particularly
                    during the 16th and 17th centuries, had long been the subject of his profound
                    investigation. It is perhaps to be regretted that with all this knowledge he
                    never produced any large independent work, but confined himself to the editing
                    of the works of others. Of these, the chief are— <hi rend="italic">Dunbar's

                    of Antiquaries of Scotland, and during that period he contributed upwards of a
                    hundred separate papers to their <hi rend="italic">Proceedings.</hi> He was also
                    for more than forty years secretary to the Bannatyne Club, many of the
                    publications of which were carefully edited by him, and few of them we believe
                    failed to benefit by his assistance. A complete list of his productions would
                    occupy many pages. His literary activity ended only with his life. He was struck
                    with paralysis when attending to his duties in the Signet Library, and it is
                    touchingly recorded of him that, on awakening out of the fit, he looked about
                    him and asked if a proof of Wyntoun had been sent up from the printers. He died
                    a few days afterwards, on October 18, 1878, at the age of eighty-six years.
                    Perhaps few men who ever lived possessed so much recondite knowledge on subjects
                    connected with Scottish history and literature, and no one could be more ready
                    to communicate whatever he knew to those who were engaged in investigations
                    similar to his own. In 1864 the university of Edinburgh conferred on him the
                    degree of LL.D. In the course of his long life Laing had collected an immense
                    library, a large portion of the books being illustrative of the literature or
                    history of Scotland, and many of them being of extraordinary rarity. It was
                    dispersed by auction in London soon after his death, and the enormous prices
                    obtained for many of the books were such as had hardly ever been known even in
                    the most celebrated of previous book sales. A valuable collection of MSS.,
                    chiefly relating to Scotland, was bequeathed by him to the library of Edinburgh
                    university.</p>
