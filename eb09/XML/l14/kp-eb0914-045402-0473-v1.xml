                <p><label type="entry">LEON</label>, one of the forty-nine provinces of Spain, is
                    bounded on the N. by Oviedo, on the E. by Palencia, on the S. by Valladolid and
                    Zamora, and on the W. by Orense and Lugo, and has an area of 6166 square miles,
                    with a population (in 1877) of 350,210. Its boundaries on the north and west,
                    formed respectively by the central ridge and southerly offshoots of the great
                    Cantabrian chain, are strongly marked; towards the south-east it merges
                    imperceptibly into the Castilian plateau, the line of demarcation being for the
                    most part merely conventional. It belongs partly to the Mino and partly to the
                    Duero river system, these being separated by the montaiias de Leon, which extend
                    in a continuous wall (with passes at Manzanal and Poncebadon) from north to
                    south-west. To the Mino flow the Sil, Boeza, Burbia, Cua, Valcarce; the
                    principal tributaries of the Duero are the Esla (with its affluents the Tuerto,
                    Orbigo, Beruesga, Torio, Cuereno, and Ceo) and the Valderaduey. To the
                    north-west of the montanas de Leon is the district known as the Vierzo, a richly
                    wooded pastoral and highland district, which in its lower valleys produces
                    grain, fruit, and wine in abundance. The Tierra del Campo in the west of the
                    province is fairly productive, but in need of irrigation. The hills of Leon were
                    wrought for gold in the time of the Romans; iron is still obtained to some
                    extent; and coal and antimony also occur. The commerce and industries of the
                    province are unimportant. Besides Leon, the capital, the only towns of any note
                    are Astorga and Ponferrada, respectively the Asturica Augusta and the
                    Interamnium Flavium of the Romans. There is railway communication with Madrid;
                    but the line from Leon to Gijon at present terminates, on the south side of the
                    pass, at Busdongo, while that to Coruîïa does not extend further than
                    Branuelas.</p>
                <p>The province was anciently inhabited by the Vettones and Callaici; after the
                    Roman conquest it formed part of Hispania Tarraconensis. Among the Christian
                    kingdoms which arose in Spain as the Saracenic irruption of the 8th century
                    receded, Leon was one of the oldest, after that of Asturias, the title of king
                    of Leon having been first assumed by Ordono in 913. Ferdinand I. (the Great) of
                    Castile united the crowns of Castile and Leon in the 11th century; the two were
                    again separated in the 12th, until a final union took place (1230) in the person
                    of St Ferdinand. The limits of the kingdom varied with the alternations of
                    success and defeat in war, but roughly speaking it may be said to have embraced
                    what are now the provinces of Leon, Palencia, Valladolid, Zamora, and Salamanca.
                    The province of Leon prior to 1833 included Leon, Zamora, and Salamanca.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Leon,</hi> the capital of the above province, is pleasantly
                    situated upon a rising ground in the angle formed by the Torio and Bernesga,
                    which here unite to form the Leon, a tributary of the Esla; its distance
                    north-west from Madrid is 258 miles. The town, which is surrounded by old and
                    dilapidated walls, everywhere presents an aspect of ruin and decay. Many of the
                    buildings are fine. Of these the most important is the cathedral, founded about
                    1195; it is built in the pointed Gothic style, of a warm cream-coloured stone,
                    and is remarkable for its simplicity, lightness, and strength. The collegiate
                    church of San Isidro was founded in 1063, and consecrated in 1149; it is
                    Byzantine in character. The church belonging to the convent of San Marcos,
                    ordered by Ferdinand V. in 1514, was begun by Charles V. in 1537, and
                    consecrated in 1541. Other buildings of less architectural importance are the
                    town house, the episcopal palace, and that of the Guzman family. As might be
                    expected from the ecclesiastical character of Leon, there are a variety of
                    religious and charitable institutions; the industries of the place are linen
                    weaving, glove making, and the knitting of caps and <pb break="no"

                <p>Leon (Arab., <hi rend="italic">Liyun)</hi> owes its name to the Legio Septima
                    Gemina of Galba, which, under the later emperors at least, had its headquarters
                    there. The place is mentioned under this name in the <hi rend="italic">Itin.

                    and in 717 it capitulated to the Saracens. Retaken about 742, it ultimately, in
                    the beginning of the 10th century, became the capital of the kingdom of Leon.
                    About 996 it was taken by Almansur, but on his death, which occurred soon
                    aftenvards, it reverted to the Spaniards. It was the seat of several
                    ecclesiastical councils, one of which was held under Alphonso V., a second in
                    1090, and others in 1106, 1114, 1134, 1228, and 1288.</p>
