                <p><label type="entry">LABUAN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Labuhan</hi></label>, an
                    island of the East Indian Archipelago, which has been a British possession since
                    1846. It lies about 6 miles off the north-west coast of Borneo, opposite the
                    northern end of the great bay of Brunei. Rudely triangular in shape, it measures
                    about 7 miles across the base, and has a length of 11 miles from north to south.
                    The general flatness of the surface is broken by a number of undulating hills,
                    none of which, however, exceed 90 feet in height. At the time of the first
                    settlement most of the ground was occupied by virgin forest, in which camphor
                    trees of noble proportions were conspicuous; but nearly the whole of this has
                    been destroyed either by human effort or by jungle fires. The soil is very poor,
                    except in the valleys of the larger streams. Of the total area, estimated at
                    over 45 square miles, or 29,350 acres, 21,000 acres are supposed to be capable
                    of cultivation; but of this not more than 1500 acres are sown with rice, the
                    only crop attempted on a large scale in the island. The cocoa-nut flourishes to
                    no small profit on the little island of Daat; and the African oil palm promises
                    well. At the time of its occupation a brilliant future was prophesied for
                    Labuan: its harbour was to make it a second Singapore, and its coal beds were to
                    prove an unfailing source of wealth. Such anticipations are far from having been
                    realized. Though the workable coal in the island has been estimated at no less
                    than 400,000,000 tons, the mines have commercially proved an utter failure. The
                    Scottish Oriental Coal Company— the fourth of its kind—came to an untimely end
                    in 1880; from 1868 it had raised 53,741 tons of clean coal, each <pb break="no"

                    more than 25s. or 30s. The want of machinery strong enough to keep the workings
                    dry is assigned as one of the chief reasons of the collapse. The coal, which
                    appears to be of Tertiary formation, is of good quality; the mines are on the
                    north end of the island near the village of Lubok Tamiang. The general trade of
                    Labuan consists mainly of the importation and re-exportation of Bornean produce;
                    and most of the Labuan merchants are from Singapore houses. There are several
                    factories for the preparation of sago flour. The total burden of the vessels
                    entering the port in 1879 was only 10,787 tons, of which 8516 was due to steam
                    ships. The population, which in 1861 was 2373 (1627 males, 701 females), was
                    5731 (3414 males, 2317 females) in 1881. It includes Chinese, Klings, chiefly
                    from Karikal in French India, Malay fishermen, and Kudayans and Tutongs from
                    Borneo. Port Victoria, the principal settlement, has no municipal
                    government.</p>
                <p>The colony is now self-supporting. The Chinese have schools for their own
                    children; and Sir Henry Bulwer established in 1873 a school for the teaching of
                    Malay and English. The temporary diocese of Labuan includes, not only Sarawak in
                    Borneo, but also Singapore (which is 770 miles distant); and the church of St
                    Andrews in that city is the cathedral of the see. Convicts have been sent to
                    Labuan from the Straits settlements since 1866.</p>
