                <p><label type="entry">LAUSANNE</label>, the chief town of the canton of Vaud in
                    Switzerland, lies about 27 miles N.E. of Geneva and 1 mile to the N. of the
                    lake, which used not unfrequently to be called the Lake of Lausanne instead of
                    the Lake of Geneva. It is the junction of the railways to Geneva from Bern and
                    the Rhone valley, and has direct communication with Paris <hi rend="italic"
                        >via</hi> Pontarlier. A railway worked by a cable connects the town proper
                    with the village and port of</p>
                <p>Ouchy on the lake. Built on the lower slopes of Mont Jorat, partly on the crests
                    and declivities of three hills and partly in the intervening valleys, Lausanne
                    presents a fine appearance from the water, and in turn enjoys a wide outlook
                    over the Alps of Savoy on the farther side. Modern improvements have largely
                    modified the original characteristics of the site. The Great Bridge, designed by
                    Pichard (1790-1841) and opened to traffic in Oct. 1844 crosses the Flon, and
                    unites the quarters of St Francis and St</p>
                <p>Lawrence; and a roadway with easy gradients due to the same engineer tunnels
                    beneath the castle and passes round the city. The Place de Riponne, the most
                    spacious of the public squares and the site of the great corn-market and the
                    Arlaud museum, is an artificial level secured by massive substructions above the
                    channel of the Louve. Lausanne is rapidly extending in all directions, and
                    especially towards the south and west. The principal building is the cathedral
                    of Notre Dame, which occupies a terrace on the highest hill. It is a good
                    example of plain and massive Gothic, the ground plan a Latin cross, and the
                    interior remarkably simple. The erection is assigned to 1235-1275, and the
                    dedication was performed by Gregory X. in presence of the emperor Rudolph of
                    Hapsburg. To the north of the cathedral on the highest point in the city stands
                    the castle, a structure of the 15th century. The academy, founded by the Bernese
                    authorities in 1589, has numbered among its teachers Theodore Beza, Conrad
                    Gessner, De Crousaz, Vinet, and Juste Olivier. The Arlaud museum founded in
                    1846, the blind asylum established by a wealthy Englishman, Mr Haldiman, the
                    penitentiary designed by Pichard, the great cantonal hospital, the theatre, and
                    the cantonal library (80,000 volumes) are among the more noteworthy of the
                    remaining institutions. Besides the well-known Society of Naturalists
                    (established 1841) there are in the town a medical and an historical society
                    (1837). Since the days of Gibbon, whose praises of the town have been often
                    repeated, Lausanne has become a favourite place of residence for foreigners, and
                    an international centre of education. The population was 26,520 (22,610
                    Protestants, 3517 Roman Catholics) in 1870, and 30,179 in 1880. At the end of
                    the 18th century it was only 9000.</p>
                <p>Though Lausanne (Latin, <hi rend="italic">Lαusonium; Lausanna</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">Tab. Pent. )</hi> undoubtedly existed at an earlier date, it
                    was when Bishop Marius of Aventicum (c. 593) chose one of its hills as the new
                    seat of his bishopric that its history practically began. The little episcopal
                    city had a rival in an independent German community on the neighbouring hill,
                    but after long struggles the bishop was recognized as official head of the
                    united community, on condition that every year in May he convoked the three
                    estates to the <hi rend="italic">plaid</hi><hi rend="italic">général.</hi> This
                    state of matters lasted till the beginning of the 16th century. In 1536 the
                    Bernese deprived the bishops of their temporal authority, transferred most of
                    the goods of the church to the secular domain, and appointed intendants of their
                    own to guide the action of the local magistracy. In this state of pupilage to
                    Bern the city remained till the Revolution, and in 1798 it was made the chief
                    town of the newly constituted canton of Vaud. In 1875 it was chosen as the seat
                    of the supreme court of the Swiss confederation. Among the eminent men born in
                    Lausanne are Benjamin Constant and the Secretans.</p>
