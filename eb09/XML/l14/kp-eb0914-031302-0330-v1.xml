                    (1684-1768), author of the <hi rend="italic">The Credibility of the Gospel
                        History,</hi> was born at Hawkhurst, Kent, in 1684. After having studied for
                    the Presbyterian ministry in London, and also at Utrecht and Leyden, he in 1709
                    took licence as a preacher; but, failing to gain acceptance in the pulpit, he in
                    1713 entered the family of a lady of rank as tutor and domestic chaplain, and in
                    this position he remained until 1721. In 1724 he was appointed to deliver the
                    Tuesday evening lecture in the Presbyterian chapel, Old Jewry, London, and in
                    1729 he became assistant minister to the Presbyterian congregation in Crutched
                    Friars. He died at Hawkhurst on July 24, 1768.</p>
                <p>An anonymous volume of Memoirs appeared in 1769; and a life by Kippis is prefixed
                    to the edition of the Works of Lardner, published in 11 vols. 8vo in 1788, in 4
                    vols. 4to in 1817, and 10 vols. 8vo in 1827. The full title of his principal
                    work—a work which, though now quite out of date, gives its author a permanent
                    place of some respectability in the history of Christian apologetics—is The
                    Credibility of the Gospel History; or the Principal Facts of the New Testament
                    confirmed by Passages of Ancient Authors, who were contemporary with our Saviour
                    or his Apostles, or lived near their time. Part i., in 2 vols. 8vo, appeared in
                    1727; the publication of part ii., in 12 vols. 8vo, began in 1733 and ended in
                    1755. In 1730 there was a second edition of part i., and the Additions and
                    Alterations were also published separately. A Supplement, otherwise entitled A
                    History of the Apostles and Evangelists, Writers of the New Testament, was added
                    in 3 vols. (1756-57), and reprinted in 1760. Other works by Lardner are A large
                    Collection of Ancient Jewish and Heathen Testimonies to the Truth of the
                    Christian Revelation, with Notes and Observations, 4 vols. 4to, 1764-67; The
                    History of the Heretics of the two first Centuries after Christ, published
                    posthumously in 1780; a considerable number of occasional sermons; and A Letter
                    concerning the question whether the Logos supplied the place of the Human Soul
                    in the Person of Jesus Christ. In this tract, written in 1730 and published in
                    1759, Lardner indicated his preference for the Unitarian view.</p>
