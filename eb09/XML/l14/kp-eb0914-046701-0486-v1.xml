                <p><label type="entry">LEOPOLD II</label>., Holy Roman emperor, was born on the 5th
                    of May 1747. After the death of his father, the emperor Francis I., in 1765, he
                    became grand-duke of Tuscany, a country which he ruled for twenty-five years in
                    a thoroughly enlightened spirit. Earlier than his brother, Joseph II., he saw
                    the necessity of ecclesiastical reform, but he effected with moderation and good
                    sense the changes which he considered advisable. Agriculture, industry, and
                    commerce he encouraged in accordance with the ideas of his age, and Tuscany owed
                    to him a well-conceived criminal code. He had even prepared a scheme for
                    instituting representative government in Tuscany when, in 1790, he sι⅛ceeded
                    Joseph II. in the hereditary lands of the house of Hapsburg and in the empire.
                    Joseph, with all his good intentions, had left his hereditary states in much
                    confusion; and vigour and prudence were essential for the re-establishment of
                    order. The chief difficulty was in the Netherlands, which were disinclined to
                    respond to Leopold’s advances. He despatched an army against them, and it
                    entered Brussels on the 3d of December 1791. The country was then at his mercy;
                    but he acted with great discretion, restoring certain ancient rights which
                    Joseph, in his zeal for improvement, had withdrawn. In Hungary, too, the emperor
                    succeeded in calming popular excitement; and on the 4th of August 1791 the
                    treaty of Sisto va was signed, bringing to an end the unlucky war which Joseph
                    had waged with the Turks. The violence of the French Revolutionists produced a
                    bad effect on the internal policy of Leopold, who supposed that it was
                    necessary, not only to introduce a secret police, but to limit the freedom of
                    the press. The same influences led him to conciliate Prussia, which had been
                    always on its guard against Austria since the establishment of the Confederation
                    of Princes by Frederick the Great. On the 27th of August 1791 the emperor and
                    the king of Prussia met at Pillnitz; and it was agreed that they should act
                    together for the deliverance of Louis XVI. of France. In pursuance of this
                    understanding a defensive and offensive treaty of alliance between Austria and
                    Prussia was concluded on the 7th of February 1792; but the emperor’s schemes
                    were suddenly broken by death. He died on the 1st of March 1792, and was
                    succeeded by his son, the emperor Francis II.</p>
