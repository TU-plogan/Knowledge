                <p><label type="entry">LAMPEDUSA</label>, a small island in the Mediterranean, about
                    90 miles east of Mahadia in Tunis, and 100 miles west of Malta, in 35° 28' N.
                    lat. and 12° 25' E. long. Situated on the edge of the submarine platform which
                    extends along the eastern coast of Tunis, it must be considered as attaching
                    itself physically to the African continent, but politically it belongs to the
                    kingdom of Italy, and forms part of the commune of Licata in Sicily. In its 19
                    miles of coast it presents a great number of bays, of which the largest serves
                    as a harbour, and is capable of admitting vessels of from 300 to 400 tons
                    burden. The highest point of the island is about 330 feet above the sea. There
                    are no springs, and the water obtained from the artificial wells is usually
                    brackish. The soil is mostly calcareous; beds of marl occur here and there on
                    the surface. Vines, fig-trees, carob-trees, and sumach are successfully grown,
                    and the wild olive flourishes luxuriantly. Firewood used to be obtained from the
                    island for Malta. Rabbits swarm in all directions. The population in 1871 was
                    946.</p>
                <p>Lampedusa is the Lopadussa of Strabo. In 1555 Andrew Doria anchored the vessels
                    of Charles V. at Lampedusa, after an engagement with the Turks. Alphonso of
                    Aragon made the island a fief of one of his courtiers, who sold it in 1677 to
                    the prince Ferdinand Tommasi. But no permanent settlement seems to have been
                    effected; the place, according to popular belief, was too terribly haunted by
                    apparitions. Sir Kenelm Digby relates (1628) that his m m told him “there dwelt
                    no persons in Lampedusa, but there is a lamp perpetually burning. The Turks have
                    great reverence to the place, and always leave oil or bread or something behind
                    them through devotion, but they know not for whom, and it hath proved very fatal
                    to carry away anything from thence as well to Christians as to Turks.” Dumont,
                    who personally visited the island, mentions a “little chapel dedicated to the
                    Virgin, in which there is an altar with a turban laid upon it, which is usually
                    called Mohammed’s tomb,” and adds the popular belief that any one attempting to
                    carry off the gifts would be miraculously prevented escaping the island. The
                    earl of Sandwich (1737) found Lampedusa with but a solitary inhabitant; and
                    Captain Smyth states that about 1815 it was leased by an Englishman, Fernandez,
                    who lived alone with his family. Ferdinand II. of Bourbon claimed it as
                    Government property, and from 1843 attempts were made to establish a regular
                    colony at the national expense. About £17,000 per annum was expended on the
                    project, but the result was far from satisfactory. The population, introduced
                    from Sicily, remained stationary during twenty years. Catherine II. at one time
                    proposed to purchase Lampedusa for the purpose of making it a Russian naval
                    station.</p>
                <p>If it could be shown that Shakespeare derived the material of The Tempest from an
                    Italian original, Lampedusa would have very strong claims to be considered the
                    first prototype of the enchanted isle. It is the Lipadosa of Orlando Furioso,
                    the scene of the shipwreck of Roger of Sicily and of his conversion by the
                    hermit. A Sicilian legend which forms the subject of Wieland’s poem Klelia und
                    Sinibald, oder die Bevölkerung von Lamped use, tells how two ladies of Palermo
                    were cast ashore on the island, and found there two hermits who fell so deeply
                    in love with them as to renounce their ascetic life. In Sicilian the “hermit of
                    Lampedusa” corresponds to the English Vicar of Bray, lighting up the chapel near
                    his cell with equal readiness for the Crescent or the Cross.</p>
