                    statesman while earl of Shelburne, was born at Dublin, May 20, 1737. He was a
                    descendant of the lords of Kerry, and his grandfather, who was created earl of
                    Kerry, married a daughter of Sir William Petty. On the death without issue of
                    Sir William Petty’s son, the first earl of Shelburne, the estates passed to his

                    of the world chiefly to the fact, that, as was his <hi rend="superscript">
                        t</hi> '∙ fate through life,” he fell in “with clever but unpopular
                    connexions.” Shortly after leaving the university he served as an officer in
                    Wolfe’s regiment during the Seven Years’ War, and so distinguished himself at
                    Minden and Kloster-Kampen that he was raised to the rank of colonel and
                    appointed aide-de-camp to the king. Being thus brought into near communication
                    with Lord Bute, he was in 1761 employed by that nobleman to negotiate for the
                    support of Charles Fox. For a few months in the same year he sat in the House of
                    Commons as member of Wycombe, until he succeeded his father as earl of Shelburne
                    in the Irish peerage, and Baron Wycombe in the peerage of Great Britain. Though
                    he declined to take office under Bute he undertook negotiations to induce Fox to
                    gain the consent of the Commons to the peace of 1763. Fox affirmed that he had
                    been duped by the terms offered, and, although Shelburne always asserted that he
                    had acted in thorough good faith, Bute spoke of the affair as a “pious fraud.”
                    Shelburne joined the Grenville ministry in 1763 as president of the Board of
                    Trade, but, failing in his efforts to replace Pitt in the cabinet, he in a few
                    months resigned office. Having moreover on account of his support of Pitt on the
                    question of Wilke’s expulsion from the House of Commons incurred the serious
                    displeasure of the king, he retired for a time to his estate. After Pitt’s
                    return to power in 1766 he became secretary of state, but during Pitt’s illness
                    his conciliatory policy towards America was completely thwarted by his
                    colleagues and the king, and iι&gt; 1768 he was dismissed from office. In 1782
                    he consented to take office under the marquis of Rockingham on condition that
                    the king would agree to recognize the United States, and on the death of Lord
                    Rockingham in the same year, he became premier; but the secession of Fox and his
                    supporters led to the famous coalition of Fox with North, which caused his
                    resignation in the following February, his fall being perhaps hastened by his
                    proposed plans for the reform of the public service. He had also in
                    contemplation a bill to promote free commercial intercourse between England and
                    the United States. When Pitt acceded to office in 1784, Shelburne, instead of
                    receiving a place in the cabinet, was created marquis of Lansdowne. Though
                    giving a general support to the policy of Pitt, he from this time ceased to take
                    an active part in public affairs. He died May 7, 1805.</p>
                <p>During his lifetime the marquis of Lansdowne was blamed for insincerity and
                    duplicity, but the accusations came chiefly from those who were dissatisfied
                    with his preference of principles to party, and it is beyond doubt that, if he
                    had had a more unscrupulous regard to his personal ambition, his career as a
                    statesman would have had more outward success. His autobiography indicates that
                    he was cynical in his estimates of character, but no statesman of his time
                    possessed more enlightened political views, while his friendship with those of
                    his contemporaries eminent in science and literature must be allowed
                    considerable weight in qualifying our estimate of the moral defects with which
                    he has been credited. See Fitzmaurice, <hi rend="italic">Life of William, Earl
                        of Shelburne,</hi> 3 vols., London, 1875-76.</p>
