                    their appearance annually, one about the beginning of July and the other early
                    in December. As soon as the minute larval insects make their appearance they
                    fasten in myriads on the young shoots, and, inserting their long proboscides
                    into the bark, draw their nutriment from the sap of the plant. The insects begin
                    at once to exude the resinous secretion over their entire bodies, which forms in
                    effect a cocoon, and, the separate exudations coalescing, a continuous hard
                    resinous layer regularly honeycombed with small cavities is deposited <pb

                    tomb the female insects, which form the great bulk of the whole, never escape.
                    After their impregnation, which takes place on the liberation of the males,
                    about three months from their first appearance, the females develop into a
                    singularly amorphous-like organism consisting in its main features of a large
                    smooth shining crimson-coloured sac—the ovary— with a beak stuck into the bark,
                    and a few papillary processes projected above the resinous surface. The red
                    fluid in the ovary is the substance which forms the lac dye of commerce, and,
                    when the young are allowed to hatch out, the greater part of this colouring
                    matter is lost, and only a dead resinous substance remains on the twig. To
                    obtain the largest amount of both resin and dye-stuff therefore it is necessary
                    to gather the twigs with their living inhabitants in or near June and November.
                    Lac encrusting the twigs as gathered is known in commerce as “stick lac the
                    resin crushed to small fragments and washed free from colouring matter
                    constitutes “seed lac”; when melted, strained through thick canvas, and spread
                    out into thin layers, this is known as “shell lac,” and it is in this last form
                    that the resin is usually brought to European markets. Shell lac, which varies
                    in colour from a dark amber to an almost pure black appearance, may be bleached
                    by dissolving in a boiling lye of caustic potash and passing chlorine through
                    the solution till all the resin is precipitated. Bleached lac takes light
                    delicate shades of colour, and dyed a golden yellow it is much used in the East
                    Indies for working into chain ornaments for the head and for other personal
                    adornments. Lac is a principal ingredient in sealing wax, and forms the basis of
                    some of the most valuable varnishes, besides being useful in various cements,
                    &amp;c. (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Lacquer).</hi> Average stick lac contains
                    about 68 per cent, of resin, 10 of lac dye, and 6 of a waxy substance. The resin
                    of lac is a composite body, whose constituents behave differently in presence of
                    chemical reagents.</p>
                <p>Lac dye, which is separated by washing stick lac in hot or cold water or in a
                    weak alkaline solution, and dried either by exposure over a fire or in the sun,
                    comes into commerce in the form of small square cakes. It is in many respects
                    similar to, although not identical with, cochineal, and will dye less brilliant
                    shades than that colour. It contains about 50 per cent, of colouring matter,
                    with 25 per cent, of resin and 22 per cent, of earthy admixture, &lt;fcc. It is
                    used for dyeing silk and wool, for which purposes it is dissolved in dilute
                    sulphuric acid or somewhat stronger hydrochloric acid; and the substance to be
                    dyed is prepared with a mordant of strong lac spirit, which consists of a
                    solution of stannous chloride. Lac dye has been used from time immemorial in the
                    East, but the knowledge of the substance in the West is comparatively recent. It
                    was first brought to Europe by the East India Company as a substitute for
                    cochineal. The best lac dye comes from Calcutta. Lac lake is an alumina lake
                    containing about 50 per cent, of colouring matter, 40 per cent, of resin, and 9
                    or 10 per cent, of alumina.</p>
