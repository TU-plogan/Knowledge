                        Henri</hi></label> (1802-1861), French orator, was born at Recey-sur Ource,
                    Cote d’Or, 12th March 1802. He was the second of a family of four, the eldest of
                    whom travelled a great deal in his youth, and subsequently occupied the chair of
                    comparative anatomy at Liége, from which he contributed some valuable treatises
                    on entomology. For several years Lacordaire studied at Dijon, showing a marked
                    talent for rhetoric; this naturally led him to the pursuit of law, and in the
                    local debates of the advocates he attained a high celebrity. At Paris he for a
                    time thought of going on the stage, but was induced to finish the course, and,
                    having done so with credit, applied himself for eighteen months with much
                    success to the consideration of briefs. Meanwhile a great change was passing
                    over his convictions. Lamennais had published his <hi rend="italic">Essai
                        sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Indifférence,—</hi> a
                    passionate vindication of belief as against the tolerant contempt of a
                    generation which regarded truth and falsehood in every department of life with
                    equal complaisance, a demonstration of the weakness of individual reason and an
                    assertion of the rightful supremacy of a central religious authority. Lacordaire
                    read and was convinced. His ardent and believing nature was weary of the
                    theological negations of the Encyclopedists. He was impelled towards a deistical
                    explanation of the universe, from which in turn he went on to Catholicism as the
                    only faith calculated to keep society from disintegration. In 1823 he became a
                    theological student at the seminary of Saint Sulpice; four years later <pb

                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0205-0194"/> he was ordained and became almoner of the
                    college of Henry IV. He was called from it to co-operate with Lamennais in the
                    editorship of <hi rend="italic">H Avenir,</hi> a journal established for the
                    purpose of advocating the union of the democratic principle with ultramontanism.
                    To be a Catholic was to be a royalist iu the popular definition; Lacordaire
                    strove to show that Catholicism was not bound up with the idea of dynasty, and
                    definitely allied it with a well-defined liberty, equality, and fraternity. But
                    the new propagandism was denounced from Rome in an encyclical. In the meantime
                    Lacordaire and Montalembert, believing that, under the charter of 1830, they
                    were entitled to liberty of instruction, opened an independent free school and
                    began to teach in it. It was closed in two days, and the teachers fined before
                    the court of peers, These reverses Lacordaire accepted with quiet dignity; but
                    they brought his relationship with Lamennais to a close. He now began the course
                    of Christian <hi rend="italic">conférences</hi> at the Collége Stanislas, which
                    attracted the art and intellect of Paris; thence he went to Notre Dame, and for
                    two years his sermons were the delight of the capital. His presence was
                    dignified, his voice capable of indefinite modulation, and his gestures animated
                    and attractive. He still preached the gospel of the people’s sovereignty in
                    civil life and the pope’s supremacy in religion, but brought to his propagandism
                    the full resources of a mind familiar with philosophy, history, and literature,
                    and indeed led the reaction against Voltairean scepticism. He was asked to edit
                    the <hi rend="italic">Univers,</hi> to take a chair in the university of
                    Louvain, but declined both appointments, and in 1836 set out for Rome, revolving
                    a great scheme for Christianizing France by restoring the old order of St
                    Dominic. At Rome he prepared himself for the life of the new brotherhood,
                    donning the habit of the preaching friar and joining the monastery of Minerva.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Mémoire pour le rétablissement en</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Prance</hi><hi rend="italic">de l’ordre des frères prêcheurs</hi> was then
                    prepared and dedicated to his country; at the same time he collected the
                    materials for the life of his avowed master, St Dominic. But he did not return
                    to France until 1841, when he resumed his preaching at Notre Dame, and was
                    successful in reestablishing the order of which he ever afterwards called
                    himself monk. His funeral orations are the most notable in their kind of any
                    delivered during his time, those devoted to the death of Drouot and O’Connell
                    being especially predominant in the qualities of point and clearness. He next
                    thought that his presence in the Assembly would be of use to his cause; but he
                    remained there only a short while, finding the true field of his influence to be
                    the pulpit. Many popular movements he advocated with the fervour of high
                    conviction. In 1850 he went back to Rome and was made provincial of the order,
                    and for four years laboured to make the Dominicans a religious power. In 1854 he
                    retired to Sorèze to become director of a private lyceum, and remained there in
                    self-chosen obscurity until he died, 22d November 1861.</p>
