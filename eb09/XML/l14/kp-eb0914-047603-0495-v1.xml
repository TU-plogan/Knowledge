                    (1794-1859), one of the most popular of English genre-painters, was born in
                    London on the 19th of October 1794. His parents were American, and when he was
                    five years of age he returned with them to their native country. They settled in
                    Philadelphia, where their son was educated and afterwards apprenticed to a
                    bookseller. He was, however, mainly interested in painting and the drama, and
                    when George Frederick Cooke visited the city he executed a portrait of the
                    actor, from recollection of him on the stage, which was considered a work of
                    such promise that a fund was raised to enable the young artist to study in
                    Europe. He left for London in 1811, bearing introductions which procured for him
                    the friendship of West, Beechey, Allsten, Coleridge, and Washington Irving, and
                    was admitted as a student of the Royal Academy, where he carried off two silver
                    medals. At first, influenced by West and Fuseli, he essayed “high art,” and his
                    earliest important subject depicted Saul and the Witch of Endor; but he soon
                    discovered his true aptitude and became a painter of cabinet-pictures, dealing,
                    not like those of Wilkie, with the contemporary life that surrounded him, but
                    with scenes from the great masters of fiction, from Shakespeare and Cervantes,
                    Addison and Molière, Swift, Sterne, Fielding, and Smollett. Of individual
                    paintings we may specify Sir Roger de Coverley going to Church, 1819; May-day in
                    the Time of Queen Elizabeth, 1821; Sancho Panza and the Duchess, 1824; Uncle
                    Toby and the Widow Wadman, 1831; <hi rend="italic">La Malade Imaginaire,</hi>
                    act iii. sc. 6, 1843; and the Duke’s Chaplain Enraged leaving the Table, from
                        <hi rend="italic">Don Quixote,</hi> 1849. Many of his more important
                    subjects exist in varying replicas. He possessed a sympathetic imagination,
                    which enabled him to enter freely into the spirit of the author whom he
                    illustrated, a delicate perception for female beauty, an unfailing eye for
                    character and its outward manifestation in face and figure, and a genial and
                    sunny sense of humour, guided by an instinctive refinement which prevented it
                    from overstepping the bounds of good taste. In 1821 Leslie was elected Λ.R.A.,
                    and five years later full academician. In 1833 he left for America to become
                    teacher of drawing in the military academy at West Point, but the post proved an
                    irksome one, and in some six months he returned to England, where he practised
                    his profession with unfailing assiduity till his death on the 5th of May
                    1859.</p>
                <p>In addition to his skill as an artist, Leslie was a ready and pleasant writer.
                    His <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of his friend Constable, the landscape painter,
                    appeared in 1845, and his <hi rend="italic">Handbook for Young Painters,</hi> a
                    volume embodying the substance of his lectures as professor of painting to the
                    Royal Academy, in 1845. In 1860 Tom Taylor edited his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Autobiography and Letters,</hi> which contain interesting reminiscences of
                    his distinguished friends and contemporaries.</p>
