                    (1766-1832), geometrician and physicist, was born of humble parentage at Largo,
                    Fifeshire, on April 16, 1766, received his early education there and at Leven,
                    ami in his thirteenth year, encouraged by friends who had even then remarked his
                    aptitude for mathematical and physical science, entered the university of St
                    Andrews. On the completion of his arts course, he nominally studied divinity at
                    Edinburgh until 1787; in 1788-89 he spent rather more than a year as private
                    tutor in a Virginian family, and from 1790 till the close of <pb break="no"
                        facs="ia:encyclopediabrit14newyrich/page/n496/mode/1up"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0914-0496-0477"/> 1792 he held a similar appointment in
                    Staffordshire, employing his spare time in experimental research and in
                    preparing a translation of Buffon’s <hi rend="italic">Natural History of
                        Birds,</hi> which was published in nine 8vo vols, in 1793, and brought him
                    some money. For the next twelve years (passed chiefly in London or at Largo,
                    with an occasional visit to the Continent) he continued his physical studies,
                    which resulted in numerous papers contributed by him to Nicholson’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Philosophical Journal,</hi> and in the publication (1804) of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Experimental Inquiry into the Nature and Propagation of
                        Heat,</hi> a work which gained for its author the Rumford Medal of the Royal
                    Society of London. In 1805 he was elected to succeed Playfair in the chair of
                    mathematics at Edinburgh, not, however, without violent though unsuccessful
                    opposition on the part of a narrowminded clerical party who accused him of
                    heresy in something he had said as to the “unsophisticated notions of mankind”
                    about the relation of cause and effect. During his tenure of this chair he
                    published two volumes of a <hi rend="italic">Course of Mathematics—</hi> the
                    first, entitled <hi rend="italic">Elements of Geometry, Geometrical Analysis,
                        and Plane Trigonometry,</hi> in 1809, and the second, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Geometrical Analysis, and Geometry of Curve Lines,</hi> in 1821; the third
                    volume, on “Descriptive Geometry” and the “Theory of Solids” was never
                    completed. With reference to his invention (in 1810) of a process of artificial
                    congelation, he published in 1813 <hi rend="italic">A Short Account of
                        Experiments and Instruments depending on the relations of Air to Heat and
                        Moisture·,</hi> and in close connexion with the subject of this treatise he
                    also wrote a paper on the aethrioscope, which appeared in 1818 in the <hi
                        rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</hi> In 1819,
                    on the death of Playfair, he was promoted to the more congenial chair of natural
                    philosophy, which he continued to hold until his death, and in 1823 he
                    published, chiefly for the use of his class, the first volume of his
                    never-completed <hi rend="italic">Elements of Natural Philosophy.</hi> Leslie’s
                    main contributions to physics were made by the help of the “differential
                    thermometer,” an instrument whose invention was contested with him by Count
                    Rumford. By adapting to this instrument various ingenious devices he was enabled
                    to employ it in a great variety of investigations, connected especially with
                    photometry, hygroscopy, and the temperature of space. In 1820 he had been
                    elected a corresponding member of the Royal Institute of France, the only
                    distinction of the kind which he valued, and early in 1832 he was, on the
                    recommendation of Lord Chancellor Brougham, created a knight of the Guelphic
                    order. He died at Coates, a small property which he had acquired near Largo, on
                    November 3 of the same year.</p>
