                <p><label type="entry">LIECHTENSTEIN</label>, a sovereign and independent
                    principality, the smallest in Germany, is bounded on the N.E and E. by the
                    Austrian Vorarlberg, on the S. by the Swiss canton of Grisons, and on the W. by
                    the Rhine, while on the north it tapers almost to a point. The state, consisting
                    of the lordships of Vaduz and Schellenberg, is only 15 miles in length, hardly
                    over 5 miles in its average breadth, and comprises an area of 68 square miles.
                    Excepting in the immediate neighbourhood of the Rhine, the surface of the
                    country is mountainous, being traversed from south to north by spurs of the
                    Rhaetian Alps, which at some points attain an altitude of about 7000 feet. The
                    climate is mild, and the soil generally fertile and well watered. The chief
                    products are corn, wine, fiax, fruit, and timber. Agriculture and the tending of
                    cattle form the chief employment of the inhabitants. A branch of the Vorarlberg
                    railway from Feldkirch to Buchs passes through the state. In 1876 the population
                    amounted to 8664, of old German extraction, and Roman Catholics by confession.
                    The capital is Vaduz or Liechtenstein, with 960 inhabitants.</p>
                <p>Until 1866 Liechtenstein formed part of the German confederation, but from that
                    date it has been constitutionally independent, although for the sake of
                    convenience the postal system, customs, and currency are under the general
                    Austrian administration, from which the principality receives annually some
                    £1600 as its share in the customs dues. According to the charter of the 26th
                    September 1862, Liechtenstein is a constitutional monarchy, the sovereign prince
                    sharing the legislative power with a diet of fifteen members (elected
                    sexennially), of whom three are nominated by the prince, and twelve elected by
                    popular suffrage. The chief control of the principality is carried on at V ienna
                    by a court chancellory, which also serves as the judicial court of appeal of
                    first instance, the ultimate court of appeal being at Innsbruck. The immediate
                    direction of the principality in administrative and judicial matters is at
                    Vaduz. The inhabitants are free from military service and direct taxation. The
                    annual revenue amounts to about £6000. Although the sovereignty of the prince is
                    so small, his estates in Austria and elsewhere render him one of the wealthiest
                    landed proprietors in Germany, his income from them amounting to nearly £140,000
                    sterling. The house of Liechtenstein, one of the oldest in Central Europe, was
                    elevated to the princely dignity in the early part of the 17th century. Anthony
                    Florian in 1713 obtained a vote and seat in the imperial diet, and after the
                    union, in 1719, of the lordships of Vaduz and Schellenberg into one principality
                    under the name of Liechtenstein, his privileges were, in 1723, confirmed to his
                    successors. See Jacob von Falke, <hi rend="italic">Geschichte des fürstlichen
