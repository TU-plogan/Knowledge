                <p><label type="entry">COMINES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Philippe de</hi></label>, Lord
                    of Argenton, was born at the castle of Comines, near Menin, in 1443. Descended
                    from an illustrious family of Flanders, he passed his youth at the court of
                    Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, where lie became attached to the Count de
                    Charolais, whom he attended in the war of the <hi rend="italic">Public
                    Good,</hi> and was present at the battle of Montlhćry. When the count had
                    succeeded his father, under the name of Charles the Rash, Comines continued to
                    enjoy his confidence and intimacy, and was in attendance on him when, irritated
                    by the bad faith of Louis XL, the duke detained that artful monarch as prisoner
                    at Péronne. Comines, though then young, showed his prudence and sagacity in
                    endeavouring to calm his headstrong master, who was transported with the most
                    violent resentment against Louis; and by his wise counsels he contributed to the
                    conclusion of the treaty of pacification which for the moment united these
                    princes. He was afterwards employed in various négociations, which he conducted
                    with equal ability and address. But the impetuous temper of the Duke of Burgundy
                    becoming more and more exasperated by his reverses, and a species of frenzy
                    having seized him in consequence of the failure of schemes rashly undertaken and
                    imprudently executed, Louis, profiting by the faults of his rival, set himself
                    to detach from the service of the duke all the men of ability or consideration
                    by whom he had been surrounded, and uîtimatelj <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>
                    succeeded in his design. Comines was one of those who were thus gained over by
                    the artful monarch, and in 1472 he passed from the service of Burgundy to that
                    of France. Various reasons have been assigned for this desertion, respecting
                    which Comines himself observes the most guarded silence in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires;</hi> the most probable is, that he had become disgusted with the
                    service of a prince who habitually yielded to the most ungovernable transports
                    of passion, and who was manifestly rushing headlong to destruction. Mézérai,
                    however, remarks, with some appearance of truth, that, if the reasons of Comines
                    had been honourable, he, who has discoursed so well on all other subjects, would
                    certainly have explained them. But be this as it may, Louis XI. loaded him with
                    favours; for scarcely had he entered the service of that monarch when he
                    received a donation of the principality of Tahnont, and of the lordships of
                    Olone, La Chaume, Curzon, Chûteau-Gontier, Chastel-Berry, Brem, and Brandois.
                    The king also married him to Hélène de Jambes, the heiress of a rich and noble
                    family of Poitou, assisted him to purchase the estate of Argen-tpn, conferred
                    upon him the office of seneschal of Poitou, and confirmed all his g∙¾nts and
                    donations by letters patent under the royal seal. Confines, in fact, became one
                    of the most confidential servants of the king, near whose person he was
                    constantly employed; and although he was neither the friend nor the favourite of
                    Louis, who never had any such, he was better suited to the government of that
                    monarch than any other person of his time, and maintained his influence solely
                    by rendering himself useful. He executed several important commissions with
                    great ability, and preserved undiminished to the last the confidence of his
                    jealous and suspicious master. On the death or Louis, Comines, having plunged
                    into a variety of intrigues against the government of Anne of Beaujeu, was at
                    length expelled from the court by Duke René of Lorraine, and retired to Moulins,
                    the residence of the Constable of Bourbon, to whose party he had attached
                    himself. Nor did his misfortunes end here. The constable, having made his peace
                    with the court, discarded Comines, who soon afterwards became involved in a new
                    conspiracy formed <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749248?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-9248-0152"/> by Count Dunois and the Duke of Orleans; but the
                    plot having been discovered when on the very eve of breaking out, Comines was
                    arrested, and sent prisoner to Loches, where he passed eight months in one of
                    those iron cages which Louis XI. had employed for the confinement of state
                    criminals. “Plusieurs les ont maudites, et moi aussi,” says he, “qui en ai tâté
                    sous le roi d’à présent.” When the Duke of Orleans had been vanquished and taken
                    prisoner at St Aubin, and the authority of the regent had been confirmed by
                    victory, Comines was put on his trial by the parliament, upon a charge of having
                    maintained a treasonable intercourse with the rebels; and being found guilty by
                    his judges, he was sentenced to banishment for ten years to his estates, and the
                    confiscation of the fourth part of his property. It does not appear, however,
                    that this sentence was executed. In 1493, he assisted in the treaty whieh was
                    concluded at Senlis, between the king and the Archduke of Austria asDuke of
                    Burgundy. Charles VIII. carried him into Italy, and, when the expedition to
                    Naples had been resolved upon, sent him to Venice in order to induce that
                    republic to observe a strict neutrality, which was of the utmost consequence to
                    the success of the enterprise. Comines discharged this important duty with his
                    usual ability, and delayed, though he could not prevent, the declaration of the
                    republic in favour of the enemies of France; upon which he returned to Florence,
                    where the king then was. Comines does not seem to have been employed in any
                    public capacity during the last three years of Charles VIII.; but when Louis
                    XII. ascended the throne in 149S, he appeared at court to render homage to the
                    new sovereign. This is the last circumstance in the life of Comines of which any
                    notice has been preserved. He died at Argenton on the 16th of August 1509, at
                    the age of sixty-four, having apparently retained to the last the possessions
                    and rank whieh had been conferred upon him by Louis XI. It was after his return
                    from Italy, and in the retirement to whieh he had betaken himself, that Comines
                    commenced writing his <hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> at the solicitation of
                    Angelo Cattho, Archbishop of Vienne, who, like himself, had been in the service
                    first of the Duke of Burgundy, and afterwards of Louis XI.; and it is to this
                    work that he is alone indebted for the celebrity of his name. Indeed, among
                    modern historians, none has been estimated more highly than Comines, who, to the
                    charm of a natural and flexible style, which receives the direct impress of his
                    thoughts, exhibiting them in all their lights and shadows, and to the interest
                    which belongs to the fresh and animated recital of an eye-witness, unites a
                    profound knowledge of men and affairs, and displays cool observation in happy
                    alliance with sound judgment and accurate discrimination. In estimating the
                    qualities of conduct and the shades of character, Comines is perhaps unrivalled.
                    Taking men as he found them, and regarding them merely as the instruments of
                    Providence, whom he is neither called upon to love nor to hate, he depicts them
                    with a cool, rigorous, yet apparently unstudied severity; and so true do his
                    delineations appear, that he seems to have looked into the very bottom of their
                    souls, and to have discovered the real principles or motives of which their
                    actions were the necessary result or, expression. We look in vain in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> for noble sentiments, chivalrous feelings, or lofty
                    aspirations. He paints men as he knew them, with strict truth and fidelity; but
                    he never rises above the level of his subject, nor sacrifices that calm dignity
                    of tone which he sustains without effort, because it seems to have been natural
                    to his character. He speaks little of himself; and the most important
                    circumstances of his life are omitted, probably because the recital of them
                    might have embarrassed him. The first edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Comines, published at Paris in 1525,
                    contains only the reign of Louis XI. from 1464 to 1483, and is divided into six
                    books; but two more, containing <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi> the history of
                    Charles VIII. till the year 1498, appeared in 1528, Paris, folio. A new edition,
                    however, revised and corrected, was published at Paris in 1552, folio, by the
                    Sieur du Parc, and has often since been reprinted. But of the modern editions,
                    the most complete and valuable is that of Lenglet-Dufresnoy, London, 1747, four
                    volumes 4to.</p>
