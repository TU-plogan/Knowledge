                <p><label type="entry">CONSTABLE</label>, according to some, is a Saxon word,
                    compounded of <hi rend="italic">honing,</hi> king, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >staple,</hi> which signifies stay or support. But as we borrowed the name as
                    well as the office of <hi rend="italic">constable</hi> from the French, Sir
                    William Blackstone is rather inclined to deduce it, with Sir Henry Spelman and
                    Dr Cowel, from that language, in which it is plainly derived from the Latin <hi
                    rend="italic">comes</hi><hi rend="italic">stabuli,</hi> an officer well known in
                    the empire, and so called because, like the great constable of France, as well
                    as the lord high constable of England, he had to regulate all matters of
                    chivalry, tilts, tournaments, and feats of arms, which were performed on
                    horseback.</p>

                    Constable</hi><hi rend="italic">of England</hi> is the seventh great officer of
                    the crown; and he, with the earl marshal of England, were formerly judges in the
                    court of chivalry, called in the time of Henry IV. <hi rend="italic"
                    >curia</hi><hi rend="italic">militaris.</hi> This court is the fountain of the
                    martial law, and was anciently held in the king’s hall. The power of the lord
                    high constable was formerly so great, and so improper a use was made of it,
                    that, as early as the thirteenth of Richard 11. a statute was passed for
                    regulating and abridging it, as well as that of the earl marshal of England; and
                    by this statute no plea could be tried by them or their courts, which was
                    triable by the common law of the realm. The office of constable existed before
                    the Conquest. After that event, the office became heritable, and, by the tenure
                    of the manors of Harlefield, Newman, and Whitenhurst, in Gloucestershire, was
                    held by grand serjeanty in the family of the Bohuns, earls of Hereford and
                    Essex, and afterwards in the line of Stafford, as heirs-general to that race;
                    but in 1521, the office became forfeited to the king, in the person of Edward
                    Stafford, duke of Buckingham, who in that year was attainted of high treason;
                    and in consideration of its extensive power, dignity, and large authority, both
                    in time of war and peace, it has never been granted to any person, otherwise
                    than <hi rend="italic">pro hac vice,</hi> to attend at a coronation or trial by
                    combat. In France the same office was also suppressed about a century
                    afterwards, by an edict of Louis XIII.</p>

                    Constable</hi><hi rend="italic">of Scotland</hi> is an officer of great
                    antiquity and dignity. The first upon record is Hugo de Morvelle, in the reign
                    of David I. He had two great prerogatives; first, the keeping of the king’s
                    sword, which the king, when he swore fealty, delivered to him naked, and hence
                    the badge of the constable is a naked sword; secondly, the absolute and
                    unlimited command of the king’s armies while in the field, in the absence of the
                    king; a command, however, which did not extend to castles and garrisons. He was
                    likewise judge of all crimes committed within two leagues of the king’s house,
                    which precinct was called the <hi rend="italic">Chalmer of Peace</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> though his jurisdiction came latterly to be exercised only
                    as to crimes committed during the sitting of parliament, which some.</p>

                <p>however, extended to all general conventions. This office was conferred heritably
                    upon the noble family of Errol, by King Robert Bruce; and with them it still
                    remains, being expressly reserved by the treaty of union.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Inferior</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Constables.</hi> From
                    the great office of high constable is derived that inferior order, since called
                    the <hi rend="italic">constables of hundreds and franchises.</hi> These were
                    first instituted in the thirteenth year of Edward I. by the statute of
                    Winchester, which, for the conservation of the peace, and view of armour,
                    appointed two constables to be chosen in every hundred and franchise. They are
                    what we now call <hi rend="italic">constabularii</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >capitales,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">high constables;</hi> because, from length
                    of time and increase of people, others of like nature, but inferior authority,
                    have been appointed in every town, called <hi rend="italic">petty
                    constables,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sub-constabularii,</hi> who were first
                    instituted about the reign of Edward III.</p>
                <p>In Scotland constables are the officers of the justices of the peace, intrusted
                    with the execution of their warrants, decrees, and orders. They are appointed by
                    the justices at their quarter-sessions, and in royal burghs by the magistrates.
                    It is the duty of constables, without any special warrant, to apprehend
                    offenders against the peace, vagrants, and such as can give no account of
                    themselves, and to take them to the next justice. It is also their duty to
                    suppress riots, and apprehend the rioters; but after the riot is over a
                    constable is not authorized to seize <hi rend="italic">brevi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">manu</hi> any person concerned in it unless some one has been
                    dangerously wounded in the affray.</p>
