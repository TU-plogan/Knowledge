                <p><label type="entry">COAK, or charred pitcoal</label>, is prepared for the
                    smelting of iron orč, by igniting the coals piled up in long ridges in the open
                    air, and closing in the cinders with earth, when brought to a glowing red heat.
                    For the use of the manufacturers, the method hitherto most in practice has been
                    to burn the small or screened coal in conical ovens, built of firestone or
                    brick, the floor being generally about six feet diameter, and the oven eight
                    feet high, while an aperture of eighteen inches diameter is left at top. The
                    small coal is thrown in to the depth of fifteen inches or more, and then
                    ignited. The oven door is at first kept open, and the hole at the top left
                    uncovered till the mass is red-hot. The door is then closed, and by degrees the
                    hole at the top is covered over by two large flat stones, gradually approaching
                    each other, when the whole is left to cool. When sufficiently cooled, it is
                    drawn out with long iron rakes, and the mass is found to have assumed a rude
                    columnar arrangement, not much unlike starch. The oven is immediately charged
                    again with small coal, which the heat remaining in the floor is found sufficient
                    to ignite, and so the operation goes on. In both the above ways good coaks are
                    made, but the volatile products are lost. To save these, Lord Dundonald proposed
                    to burn the coals in a close furnace, to which he adapted an apparatus for
                    conveying the coal-tar, with the ammoniacal products, into proper recipients.
                    About the same time Baron Von Haak, a German, constructed works in the
                    neighbourhood of Newcastle, for distilling the small coal in large cast-iron
                    cylinders, upon the plan wly∙ch has since been adopted in the gas works; except
                    that the soot from the furnace fires is, at Newcastle, during a certain period
                    of the combustion, before any gray ashes have begun to arise, conveyed into a
                    chamber contrived for the purpose, and collected for lamp-black; an economical
                    practice, which does not appear to have been carried into the gas works. It is
                    probable that, as the practice extends of lighting our towns with carburettcd
                    hydrogen gas, most of the coak used in manufactures will be furnished in this
                    way; but as the coak thus produced will probably contain more sulphur, it is not
                    likely that it will be fit for the smelting of iron-ore; the coak for which
                    must, therefore, continue to be made in the old way.</p>
