                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Micrometer,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">μικοος, small,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">μετξον, a measure,</hi> is the name of an instrument
                    generally applied to telescopes and microscopes, for measuring small angular
                    distances within the field of the former, or the size of small objects within
                    that of the latter.</p>
                <p>Previously to the invention of the telescope, astronomers experienced great
                    difficulty in measuring small angles in the heavens; but we may safely infer
                    from the observations of Hipparchus, that he had succeeded, either by the actual
                    division of his instruments, or by estimation, in determining celestial arcs to
                    <hi rend="italic">one third</hi> of a degree.</p>
                <p>When the telescope was applied by Galileo, and our countryman Harriot, to the
                    examination of the solar spots, it does not appear that they executed their
                    drawings from any other than estimated measures. This indeed seems quite certain
                    in the case of Harriot, whose original sketches we have had an opportunity of
                    inspecting. The elaborate solar observations of Scheiner made in 1611, with a
                    telescope on a polar axis, and published in 1630 in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Posa</hi><hi rend="italic">Ursina,</hi> though minutely laid down, and
                    performed with great care, were certainly made without any instrument for
                    subdividing the field of view.</p>
                <p>As telescopic observations, however, multiplied, astronomers felt the necessity
                    of having something more accurate than their eye for ascertaining minute
                    distances in the heavens; and there can be no doubt that a micrometer was
                    invented by our countryman Mr Gascoigne, previous to 1640, not long after the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Posa</hi><hi rend="italic">Ursina.</hi>
                    According to the description of it which he addressed in a letter to Mr
                    Oughtred, and to the account of one of Gascoigne’s own instruments which Dr
                    Hooke examined, its construction is as follows :—A small cylinder, stretching
                    across the eye-tube of the telescope, is cut into a fine screw throughout one
                    third of its length, the other two thirds being formed into a coarser screw,
                    with threads at twice the distance. This compound screw is confined at both ends
                    to its place, the fine part of it passing through a female screw in one bar, and
                    the coarse part through a female screw in another bar, these two bars being
                    grooved into each other, as in a sliding rule. Hence, if a nicely ground edge is
                    fixed to one bar, and another to the other bar, so that these edges are
                    accurately parallel, a motion of the screw round its axis will separate these
                    two edges, andeach edge will move with a different velocity. The parts of a
                    revolution are measured by an index and divided face, at the coarse end of the
                    screw, while the number of whole revolutions is measured by a graduated bar
                    moved by the coarse screw. The fine screw serves the purpose of keeping the
                    middle part of this variable field (or the opening between the edges) in the
                    axis or line of collimation of the telescope; for while the coarse screw moves
                    the edge which it carries from the other edge considered as fixed, the fine
                    screw moves both the edges, and indeed the whole frame, in an opposite
                    direction, with one half of the velocity, an effect which is produced by fixing
                    its bar to the tube of the telescope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Gascoigne fell in the civil wars, near York, in 1644, before he had given any
                    full account of his invention, and its application to astronomy<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819352?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9352-0011"/>, we are
                    indebted to Mr Richard Townley, into whose hands one of the instruments fell,
                    for the preservation of so valuable a relic. Mr Townley informs us that Mr
                    Gascoigne had made use of his micrometer for some years before the civil wars,
                    and had measured distances on the earth, determined the diameters of the
                    planets, and endeavoured to find the moon’s distance from two observations of
                    her horizontal and meridional diameters. Mr Townley’s instrument was of the size
                    and weight of “an ordinary pocket watch.” It marked 40,000 divisions in a foot,
                    2½ divisions corresponding to a second of space. Mr Townley had it improved by a
                    common watchmaker. Flamsteed was presented with one of the instruments in 1670,
                    by Sir Jonas Moore; but though he left three guineas with Mr Collins to get
                    proper glasses made for it, he could not procure them till autumn 1671, when he
                    began his observations with it at Derby, and continued them with it in 1671,
                    1672, 16/3, and 1674.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    improvement consisted in substituting one screw for two. He mentions also that
                    Gascoigne had, in August 1640, measured with his micrometer the diameters of the
                    sun and moon, and the relative distances of the stars in the Pleiades.</p>
                <p>Dr Hooke made an important improvement in this micrometer, by substituting
                    parallel <hi rend="italic">hairs</hi> for the parallel edges of the brass
                    plates;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hooke’s

                    adopted this construction in his zenith sector, by which he proposed, in his
                    dispute with Hevclius, to measure <hi rend="italic">single seconds.</hi></p>
                <p>It would appear, from the Ephemerides of the Marquis of Malvasia, published in
                    the year 1662, that he had measured the distances of stars, and the diameters of
                    the planets, and projected the lunar spots, by means of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >reticle</hi> of silver wire fixed in the focus of the eye-glass of his
                    telescope. In order to determine the distances of the wires which composed this
                    network, he turned it round till a star moved along one of the wires, and having
                    counted the number of seconds which the star took to pass over the different
                    distances between the wires, he obtained a very accurate scale for all
                    micrometrical purposes.</p>
                <p>About the year 1666, MM. Auzout and Picard, unacquainted with what had been done
                    by Gascoigne, published an account of a micrometer.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. No. 21, p. 373, January
                    1G6G.</p></note> Auzout’s micrometer is said to have divided a foot into 24,000
                    or 30,000 parts. It resembled the Marquis of Malvasia’s, with this difference,
                    that the divisions were measured by a screw, and he sometimes employed fibres of
                    silk in place of silver wires.</p>
                <p>The celebrated Christian Huygens was also an early inventor of micrometrical
                    methods; and the subject was prosecuted with great diligence and success by
                    Cassini, Roemer, Bradley, Savary, Bouguer, Dollond, Maskelyne, Ramsden, Sir W.

                <p>THE WIRES ARE MOVED BY MEANS OF ONE OR MORE SCREWS.</p>
                <p>The micrometer of Gascoigne, when furnished with hairs, as suggested by Dr Hooke,
                    embodies the principle of the best and most recent micrometers. Instruments on
                    this construction have been made by all our eminent opticians; but we have no
                    hesitation in saying, that the micrometer constructed by the late celebrated
                    artist Mr Troughton combines all the ingenuity which has been displayed in this
                    delicate and useful apparatus. This eye-piece, and micrometer attached to it,are
                    shown inPlate CCCLVII. fig. 1, 2, and 3, where fig. 1 is a horizontal section in
                    the direction of the axis of the telescope. The eye-piece AB consists of two
                    plano-convex lenses A, B, of nearly the same focal length, and the two convex
                    sides facing each other. They are placed at a distance less than the focal
                    length of A, so that the wires of the micrometer, which must be distinctly seen,
                    are beyond B. This arrangement gives a <hi rend="italic">flat field,</hi> and
                    prevents any distortion of the object. This eye-piece slides into the tube CD,
                    which screws into the brass ring EF, through two openings, in which the oblong
                    frame MW passes. A brass circle GIT, fixed to the telescope by the screw I, has
                    rack-teeth on its circumference, that receive the teeth of an endless screw W,
                    which, being fixed by the arms XX to the oblong box MN, gives the latter and the
                    eye-piece a motion of rotation round the axis of the telescope; and an index
                    upon this box points out on the graduated circle upon GH, fig. 3, the angular
                    motion of the eye-piece. The micrometer properly so called is shown in fig. 2,
                    where K, L arc two forks, each connected with a screw 0 and P, turned by the
                    milled heads Μ and N. These forks are so fitted as to have no lateral shake. Two
                    pins Q, R, with spiral springs coiled round them, pass loosely through holes in
                    the forks K, L, so that when the forks are pressed by their screws towards Q,and
                    R, the spiral springs resist them, and consequently push them back when the
                    screws are turned in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>Two fine hairs, or wires, or spiders’ lines, S, T, are stretched across the
                    forks, the one being fixed to the inner fork K, and the other to the outer fork
                    L, so as to be perfectly parallel, and not to come in contact when they pass or
                    eclipse one another, in which case they will appear as one line. A wire ST is
                    stretched across the centre of the field, perpendicular to the parallel
                    wires.</p>
                <p>The most difficult part of this instrument in the execution, as well as the most
                    important, is the screw or screws which move the forks. The threads must not
                    only be at the same distance, but have their inclination equal all round. In the
                    screw used tíy Troughton, there are about 103∙6 threads in an inch. On the right
                    hand of the line ST, fig. 2, is seen a scale, which indicates a complete
                    revolution of either screw, the small round hole being the zero. This hole is
                    bisected when the two lines appear as one.</p>
                <p>In using this instrument, we separate the wires by their respective screws, till
                    the object to be measured is exactly <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819365?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9365-0012"/> included
                    between them. The number of revolutions and parts of a revolution necessary to
                    bring the two wires into the position of zero, will then be a measure of the
                    angle required, provided the value of a revolution has been previously
                    ascertained with accuracy.</p>
                <p>The easiest method of ascertaining the value of a revolution of-the screw,
                    according to the late Dr Pearson, who devoted much attention to this subject, is
                    to ascertain how many revolutions and parts of one measure exactly the sun’s
                    vertical diameter in summer, when his altitude is such that the refraction of
                    both limbs is almost the same. The sun’s diameter in seconds being divided by
                    that number, the quotient will be the value of a single revolution, the sun’s
                    diameter having been corrected by the difference between the refraction of his
                    two limbs. The ordinary method of ascertaining the value of a revolution is, to
                    observe accurately the time taken by an equatorial star, or a star of known
                    declination reduced to the equator, to pass over the space between the wires
                    when at a distance, and to convert this time into degrees, at the rate of 15°
                    per hour. The number of degrees, minutes, and seconds, divided by the
                    revolutions and parts of a revolution which are necessary to bring both wires
                    into zero, will give the value of one revolution of the screw. The same thing
                    may be done by measuring a base with great accuracy, and observing the space
                    comprehended between the wires at that distance. The angular magnitude of this
                    space, divided by the number of revolutions of the screws which bring the wires
                    to zero, will be the value of each.</p>
                <p>A most elegant and accurate method has been recently employed, we believe by
                    Professor Gauss of Göttingen, for measuring the value of the revolutions of
                    micrometer screws. He employs for this purpose a standard telescope, with a
                    micrometer the value of whose scale has been accurately determined. Since the
                    wires of a telescope-micrometer adjusted to distinct vision of the stars or
                    planets are accurately in the focus of parallel rays falling on the.
                    object-glass, it follows, that rays issuing from the wires and falling on the
                    inside of the object-glass, will emerge from it perfectly parallel. Now, if we
                    place the object-glass of the standard telescope close or near to that of the
                    first telescope, the parallel rays formed by those issuing from its wires will
                    be refracted to the focus of the standard telescope, and a distinct image of the
                    wires will be there formed. The observer, therefore, when he looks into the
                    standard telescope, will see distinctly the wires of the first telescope, and,
                    by means of his micrometer, he will be able to measure exactly the angular
                    distance of these wires, at whatever distance they happen to be placed. This
                    angular distance divided by the revolutions and parts of a revolution which are
                    necessary to bring the wires of the first telescope to the zero of their scale,
                    will give the value of one revolution of the screw, or of one unit of the scale
                    on the right hand of the long wire ST, fig. 2.</p>
                <p>The most essential parts of a micrometer are the parallel fibres, which require
                    not only to be extremely fine, but of an uniform diameter throughout. Gascoigne,
                    as we have seen, employed the edges of brass plates, Dr Hooke hairs, and
                    subsequent astronomers wires and fibres of silk. Fontana, in 1775, recommended
                    the spider’s line as a substitute for wires, and he is said (we think
                    erroneously) to have obtained them so fine as the 8000th part of a line. Mr
                    Troughton had the merit of introducing the spider’s line, which he found to be
                    so fine, opaque, and elastic, as to answer all the purposes of practical
                    astronomy. This distinguished artist, however, informed the writer of this
                    article, that it was only the stretcher, or the long line which sustains the
                    web, which possesses these useful properties. Sir David Brewster has employed
                    the fibres of spun glass, which are bisected longitudinally with a fine
                    transparent line about the 5∙^ <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> 00th of an inch in
                    diameter. This central line increases with the diameter of the fibre, and
                    diminishes with the refractive power of the glass. In cases of emergency, the
                    fibres of melted sealing-wax may be advantageously employed, or, as recommended
                    by Professor Wallace, the fibres of asbestos. We have found crystals of <hi
                    rend="italic">mesolite</hi> so minute and regular as to be well adapted for the
                    same purpose.</p>
                <p>The art of forming silver wire of extreme minuteness has been perfected by Dr
                    Wollaston. Having placed a small platinum wire in the axis of a cylindrical
                    mould, he poured melted silver into the mould, so that the platinum wire formed
                    the axis of the silver cylinder. The silver was now drawn out in the usual way,
                    till its diameter was about the 300th of an inch, so that if the platinum wire
                    was at first <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of
                    the diameter of the silver cylinder, it will now be reduced to the 3000th part
                    of an inch. The silver wire is now bent into the form of the letter U, and a
                    hook being made at each of its ends, it is suspended by a gold wire in hot
                    nitric acid. The silver is speedily dissolved by the acid, excepting at its
                    ends, and the fine platinum wire which formed its axis remains untouched. In
                    this way Dr Wollaston succeeded in forming wire ∙¾(⅛yth, i⅛⅛0. <hi

                    inch in diameter. When the fibres are prepared, their ends are placed in
                    parallel scratches or grooves drawn on the forks, or, in other cases, on the
                    diaphragm or field bar, and fixed by a layer of bees’ wax or varnish, or, what
                    is more secure, by pinching them with a small screw-nail near their extremities.

                    application of the micrometer, both to celestial and terrestrial purposes. See

                <p>CHAP. II. DESCRIPTION OF WIRE-MICROMETERS IN WHICH THE ANGULAR DISTANCE OF THE
                    WIRES IS VARIED OPTICALLY BY CHANGING THE MAGNIFYING POWER OF THE TELESCOPE.</p>
                <p><hi> MM</hi>. Roemer and De la Hire first conceived the idea of varying the
                    angular magnitude of the meshes of a net of silver wire fixed in the focus of
                    the eye-glass of a telescope, for the purpose of measuring the digits of
                    eclipses. This was done by a second lens moving between the wires and the
                    object-glass. The late Mr Watt informed the writer of this article that he had
                    used a similar principle, but bad never published any account of it.</p>
                <p>The plan of opening and shutting a <hi rend="italic">pair of parallel wires</hi>
                    optically instead of mechanically, and of using it as a general principle in
                    micrometers, was first adopted by Sir David Brewster, and has been applied to a
                    variety of methods of varying the magnifying power of the telescope.</p>
                <p>The general principle will be readily understood from the annexed diagram, where
                    AB, CD are two wires or lines of any kind permanently fixed in the focus of the
                    eye-glass of a telescope. If the sun S'√ is in contact with the lower wire CD,
                    it is obvious, that if we increase the magnifying power of the telescope by any
                    optical means anterior to the wires, we may magnify or expand the sun’s disc S⅛
                    ’, till it becomes Ss, when its north or upper limb will exactly touch the upper
                    wire AB. Now if the sun’s diameter happens to be 31'</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819378?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9378-0013"/>
                <p>when its disc Ss just fills the space between the wires -AB, CD, the distance of
                    the wires must have been 62' when, as at S's', it fills only half that space.
                    Hence the wires have been moved optically, so to speak, and have subtended all
                    angles between 31' and 62'.</p>
                <p>The methods of varying the magnifying power of the telescope used by Sir David
                    Brewster, consist, 1, in varying the distance of the two parts of the achromatic
                    eyepiece; and, 2, by varying the focal length of the principal object-glass by
                    means of another object-glass, either convex or concave, moving between it and
                    its principal focus.</p>
                <p>The first of these methods is shown in fig. 2, where AB is the eye-piece with its
                    four lenses, A, C, D, B, in their natural position. The part AFG, with the two
                    lenses A, C, is fixed to the telescope, and a space is left between the tube AC
                    and the outer tube AFG, to allow the moveable part DB of the eye-piece to get
                    sufficiently near the lens C. The tube DB is moved out and in by a rack and
                    pinion E. A scale is formed on the upper surface <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and
                    subdivided in the usual manner with a lens and vernier, which it is unnecessary
                    to represent in the figure. The value of the divisions of the scale are
                    determined by.direct experiment. A motion of DB through a space of four inches
                    will, generally speaking, double the magnifying, power of the telescope.</p>
                <p>The best method, however, of varying the magnifying power of the telescope is the
                    second, η+ich is shown in fig. 3, where 0 is the object-glass,∕*its principal
                    focus, and</p>
                <p>L the second lens, which is moveable between 0 and <hi rend="italic">f</hi>
                    Parallel rays RR, after being refracted by 0, so that they would converge to <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> are intercepted by L, which converges them to F, the focus
                    of the combined lenses. The effect of the lens L is therefore to diminish the
                    focal length of the object-glass, and consequently the magnifying power of the
                    telescope, which will obviously be a <hi rend="italic">minimum</hi> when the
                    lens L is at <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> when
                    it is at <hi rend="italic">l'.</hi> The angle subtended by a pair of fixed wires
                    will suffer an opposite change to the magnifying power, being a maximum when the
                    lens L is at Z, and a minimum when it is at- <hi rend="italic">l'.</hi> Hence
                    the scale for measuring the variable angle of these wires may always be equal to
                    the <hi rend="italic">focal length</hi> of the object-glass 0; and the inventor
                    of the instrument has shown, both by theory and by experiment, that the scale is
                    one of equal parts, the variations in the angle of the fixed wires being
                    proportional to the variations in the position of the moveable lens.</p>
                <p>When we wish to measure angles that do not suffer a great change, such as the
                    diameters of the sun and moon, a scale less than the focal length of the
                    object-glass will be sufficient. For example, if we take a lens L, which by a
                    motion of ten inches varies the magnifying power from 40 to 35, then, if the
                    angle of the wires is 29' when the lens L is at <hi rend="italic">l',</hi> it
                    will be 33' 9" when the lens is ten inches from <hi rend="italic">l',</hi> or
                    the magnifying power 35. We have, therefore, a scale of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ten</hi> inches to measure a change of angle of <hi rend="italic">4l</hi> 9*,
                    so that every tenth of an inch will correspond to 3"∙3, and every 100th of an
                    inch to ⅜d of a second. Such a micrometer will serve to measure the diameters of
                    the sun and moon at their various distances from the earth.</p>
                <p>If we wish to measure the distances of some double stars, or the diameters of
                    some of the smaller planets, with a telescope whose magnifying power varies from
                    300 to 240, by the motion of a lens over <hi rend="italic">ten inches,</hi>
                    place the parallel wires at a distance of 40", which will be increased to 50" by
                    the motion of the lens. Hence we have a scale of <hi rend="italic">ten
                    inches</hi> to measure <hi rend="italic">ten seconds,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">tenth</hi> of an inch to measure <hi rend="italic">one</hi>
                    second, or the 100th of*hn inch to measure ∙⅛th of a second.</p>
                <p>Several pairs of wires placed at different distances might be fixed upon the same
                    diaphragm, or upon separate diaphragms, which could be brought into the focus
                    when wanted; and the second pair of wires might be placed at such a distance
                    that their least angle was equal to the largest angle of the first pair, and so
                    on with the rest.</p>
                <p>A wire-micrometer thus constructed is certainly free from almost all the sources
                    of error which affect the common moveable wire-micrometer. The errors arising
                    from the imperfection of the screw, the uncertainty of zero, and other causes,
                    are avoided; and the wires are always equidistant from the centre of the field,
                    so as to be equally affected by any optical imperfection in the telescope. The
                    scale indeed may be formed by direct experiment, and the results will be as free
                    from error as the experiments by which the scale was made.</p>
                <p>When this micrometer is applied to a portable telescope, it becomes of great use
                    in naval, military, or geodetical operations, and is employed in measuring
                    distances, either by taking the angle subtended by a body of known dimensions,
                    or by measuring the two angles subtended by a body of unknown dimensions from
                    the two extremities of a known or measured base. For these purposes the
                    telescope is fitted up without a stand, as shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 4.</p>
                <p>The principle of separating a pair of wires optically is singularly applicable to
                    the Gregorian and Cassegrainian telescopes, where no additional lens or mirror
                    is required. As the magnifying power of both these telescopes maybe increased
                    merely by increasing the distance of the eyepiece from the great speculum, and
                    then re-adjusting the small speculum to distinct vision, we can thus vary the
                    angle of a pair of fixed wires by making the eye-piece moveable. This will be
                    easily comprehended from the annexed figure, where SS is the great speculum of a
                    Gregorian reflector, AA the tube, Μ the small speculum, whose focus is G, and
                    centre of curvature H. It is fixed to an arm MQ, moveable to and from SS in the
                    usual way. The image R'r' is that formed by the speculum SS, and r"R* that
                    formed by the small speculum. This last image being in the focus of the
                    eye-glass E, will be seen distinct and magnified. If the eye-glass E is pulled
                    out to E', then, in order that the object may be seen distinctly, the image r*BΛ
                    must be brought into the position r* ’ R'", FF' being equal to EE'; but this can
                    be done only by advancing the small speculum Μ to M',∕and F' being now the
                    conjugate <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819391?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9391-0014"/> foci of Μ. But by this process the magnifying
                    power has been considerably increased, because the part of the whole <hi>
                    MF</hi> magnifying power produced by Μ was equal to whcre-M'F' . <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ιv</hi> V</p>
                <p>as it is now a much larger quantity. The angle subtended by the wires has
                    therefore been diminished in the same proportion as the magnifying power has
                    been increased. The scale, in this case, is not one of equal parts, but after
                    the extreme points of it have been determined experimentally, the rest may be
                    filled up either by calculation or direct experiment.</p>
                <p>Dr Pearson<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Introduction
                    to Practical Astronomy, vol. ii.</p></note> has, with singular inaccuracy,
                    stated that Sir David Brewster’s “patent micrometer is not competent to measure
                    very small angles, even if it had sufficient magnifying power.” If he means the
                    patent micrometer as made by Mr Harris, as a naval and military telescope for
                    measuring distances, or as a coming-up glass, he is quite right, because the
                    power of measuring small angles is not required for these practical purposes.
                    But it is quite evident that the <hi rend="italic">smallest</hi> angles can be
                    measured by the micrometer when fitted up for astronomical purposes. We have
                    only to use a pair of wires placed at a very small distance, or a pair of
                    semi-lenses whose centres are placed at a very small distance, and then vary
                    their angles till it becomes equal to the very small angle which we wish to
                    measure.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III. DESCRIPTION OF DOUBLE-IMAGE MICROMETERS IN WHICH TWO SINGLY REFRACTING
                    LENSES, SEMI-LENSES, OR PRISMS, ARE SEPARATED BY SCREWS.</p>
                <p>Μ. Roemer, the celebrated Danish astronomer, is said to have been the first who
                    suggested the use of a doubleimage micrometer. He did this about 1678, but the
                    idea does not seem to have been carried into effect, or known to bis successors.
                    Nearly seventy years afterwards, viz. in 1743, Mr Servington Savary, of Exeter,
                    communicated to the Royal Society an account of a double-image micrometer; and
                    five years afterwards, in 1748, the celebrated Bouguer proposed the very same
                    construction, which he called a heliometer. This instrument consisted of two’
                    lenses, which could be separated and made to approach each other by a screw or
                    other mechanical means. These lenses gave double images of every object; and
                    when the two images of any object, such as the sun or moon, were separated till
                    they exactly touched one another, the distance of the object-glasses afforded a
                    measure of the solar or lunar diameter, after an experimental value of the
                    divisions of the scale had been obtained.</p>
                <p>As two complete lenses, however, must always have their least distance equal to
                    the diameter of either, this instrument was incapable of measuring the diameters
                    of small bodies. This obvious defect no doubt led John Dollond, in 1753, to the
                    happy idea of the divided object-glass micrometer, in which the two halves of an
                    object-glass are made to recede from the position in which they form a complete
                    object-glass. When the centres of the two halves coincide, they obviously form
                    one lens, and give only one image. When the centres arc slightly separated the
                    images will be slightly separated; and small objects may be brought into
                    contact, and have the angles which they subtend accurately measured. The scale
                    will, therefore, have a zero corresponding to the coincidence of the centres of
                    the semi-lenses. The principle of this instrument will be understood from fig.
                    5, where H, E are two semi-lenses, whose centres are at H, E, and F their focus.
                    If PQ be a circular object whose diameter is to be measured, or P, Q two points
                    whose angular distance is to be determined, the lenses arc to be separated till
                    the two images <hi rend="italic">x, z</hi> are in contact at F.</p>
                <p>As the rays QHF, PEF pass unrefracted through the centres H, E of the
                    semi-lenses, the angle subtended by QP will be equal to the angle HFE, or that
                    which the distance of the centres of the semi-lenses subtends at F. As the
                    angles, therefore, are very small, they"will vary as HE; and when the angles
                    corresponding to any one distance of the centres is determined, those for any
                    other distance will be ascertained by simple proportion.</p>
                <p>Mr Dollond, who had not at this time invented the achromatic telescope, applied
                    his micrometer to the object end of a reflecting telescope, as shown in Plate
                    CCCLVIL fig. 5, which represents the micrometer as seen from beyond the object
                    end of the reflector. A piece of tube B, carrying the micrometer, slides into or
                    over the tube A of the telescope, and is fastened to it by a screw. The tube B
                    carries a wheel (not seen in the figure) formed of a ring racked at the outer
                    edge, and fixed*, td the brass plate CC, so that a pinion moved by the handle D
                    may turn it into any position. Two plates F, G are kept close to the plate CC by
                    the rabbeted bars H, H, but with so much play that they can move in contrary
                    directions by turning the handle E, which drives a concealed pinion that works
                    in the two racks seen in the highest part of the figure. As the two semi-lenses
                    are fixed to the plates F, G, their centres will be separated by the action of
                    the handle E, and their degree of separation is measured by a scale of five
                    inches subdivided into 20ths of an inch, and read off by a vernier on the plate
                    F, divided into 25 parts, corresponding to 24 of the scale, so that we can
                    measure the separation of the semi-lenses to the <hi rend="subscript"> y</hi> ½
                    <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> th <hi rend="superscript"> an lnc</hi> ^∙ The
                    vernier is seen to the right of H, and may be adjusted to the zero of the scale,
                    or the position of the lenses when they give only one image, by means of the
                    thumb-screw I, a motion of the vernier being permitted by the screws which fix
                    it to the plate F passing through oblong holes.<note anchored="true"

                <p>In this construction, the micrometer is too far from the observer, and destroys
                    the equilibrium of the telescope. The instrument itself, however, has more
                    serious defects, as it has been found that the measures of the sun’s diameter,
                    taken by different observers, with the same instrument, and at the same time,
                    differ so much as 12 or 15 seconds. This defect has been ascribed to the
                    different states of the observers’ eyes, according as they have a tendency to
                    give distinct vision within or beyond the focal point, where the image is most
                    perfect; in the former case the limbs being somewhat separated, and in the
                    latter overlapping. Μ. Mosotti, in the <hi rend="italic">Effemeride</hi> of
                    Milan for 1821, has discovered the true cause of this defect, by a scries of
                    accurate experiments which he made with this micrometer attached to a Gregorian
                    reflector of two feet in focal length. The focal length of the divided
                    object-glass was 511∙3357 inches, or 42 feet 7½ inches. Μ. Mosotti has shown
                    that a diversity of measures will be obtained by the same observer, if, for the
                    purpose of obtaining distinct vision, he gives a slight displacement to the
                    small speculum by the adjusting screw. If the position of this speculum which
                    gives distinct vision were a point, it would be easy to find that point; but as
                    distinct vision may be obtained within a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819404?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9404-0015"/> space of 10 or
                    12 thousandths of an ineh, owing to aberration, every different observer will
                    place the mirror at a different point within that range, and consequently obtain
                    a measure corresponding to the image which he views. Μ. Mosotti recommends that
                    the axis of the adjusting screw, which carries the small speculum, should carry
                    a vernier connected with a scale on the outer surface of the tube A. By means of
                    this vernier the observer is able to give a fixed position to the small
                    speculum, so that he always views the same image, and is thus sure of obtaining
                    the same measure of the same object, so far as the observation is concerned. Μ.
                    Mosotti found also that the measures were affected by a change of temperature,
                    which, by changing the length of the tube, displaced the small speculum. In his
                    instrument this displacement amounted to 0∙0075 of an inch, which, he has shown,
                    corresponds to a change of foeal length from 5] 1∙3357 to 514∙84 inches; and
                    that the error from this eause, upon a length of 30', will be 13" in exeess.</p>
                <p>The following is Dr Pearson’s enumeration of the different sources of error in
                    the divided objeet-glass micrometer when applied to reflectors.</p>
                <p>1. A variation in the position of the small mirror when the eye estimates the
                    point of distinct vision.</p>
                <p>2. A displacement of the small mirror by change of temperature.</p>
                <p>3. A change of foeal distance when central and extreme rays are indiscriminately
                    used. The amount of this error depends on the aberration of the semi-lenses.</p>
                <p>4. A defect of adjustment, or of perfect figure, in the two specula, as they
                    regard each other, the measures varying when taken in different directions.</p>
                <p>In order to enable Dollond’s micrometer to measure differences of declination and
                    right ascension, Dr Maskelyne introduced the aid of cross wires, which he fixed
                    in a moveable ring at the place where the double image is formed. One or both of
                    the two planets or stars are referred to one or other of these lines, as will be
                    seen in the annexed figure, which we take as an example, out of four cases. Let
                    ENWS be the field of view, NS the meridian, and EW the line of east and west;
                    then, in order to obtain the difference of right ascension and declination of
                    two stars, he opened the semi-lenses till he obtained double images of each
                    star. He then turned round the micrometer till the two images of the first star
                    passed over the vertical wire NS at the same instant, and having counted the
                    time that elapsed till the two images of the other star passed over the same
                    line, he had the difference of right ascension in time. By means of the screw
                    whieh elevated his telescope, and partly by opening the semi-lenses, he made the
                    north image of one star, and the south image of the other, as at A, B, describe
                    in their motion the horizontal wire EW, and at that position of the semi-lenses
                    the scale indicated the difference of declination.</p>
                <p>A very important improvement upon the divided objectglass micrometer ∖w as made
                    by Mr Dollond’s son, who adapted it to a refracting telescope, and removed the
                    different sources of error to which it had been found liable. This improvement
                    consists both in the <hi rend="italic">nature, form,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >position</hi> of the semi-lenses. The semi-lenses are made eoncave, and consist
                    of crown and flint glass, so as to give an achromatic image along with the
                    object-glass of the tele scope to which they are applied. These concave
                    semilenses, of course, lengthen the focal distance of that objectglass. When a
                    <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> lens was bisected, as in the old construction,
                    the metallic parts whieh held the semi-lenses obstructed the light in proportion
                    to their separation; a defect of a serious nature in an instrument. In order to
                    correct this evil, Mr J. Dollond substituted two long slices of glass cut from
                    the diametral portion of a lens nearly six inches in diameter. Hence, in every
                    position of these oblong semi-lenses, none of the metallic setting eomes before
                    the objeet-glass, and consequently the light is never obstructed, and is always
                    of the same amount, whatever be the separation of the lenses. In the old
                    construction, where the diameters of each lens slid along each other in contact,
                    a part of the eentral portions having been removed by grinding the diameters
                    smooth, the two images of an object never eould coincide so as to give an
                    accurate <hi rend="italic">zero</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in the new
                    construction, the space equal to what was removed by grinding is filled up with
                    a brass scale and vernier, and the only evil of this is the loss of light
                    corresponding to the thickness of this scale; but this trifling defect is amply
                    compensated by the perfect coincidence of the images at <hi rend="italic"
                    >zero.</hi></p>
                <p>This important instrument is shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 6, where the same
                    letters are used as in fig. 5 to denote the analogous parts of the two
                    instruments. The end of the telescope is shown at A, and B is the rim of brass,
                    which, by sliding upon A, fixes the micrometer to the telescope. The frame CC',
                    moved by teeth on its outer edge, carries one of the halves G of the lens, and a
                    similar frame with teeth carries the other half F. The scale S, six inches long,
                    is fastened like an edge-bar to CC', andeaeh inch is subdivided into 20 parts,
                    which are read off with a vernier of 25 parts, which is fastened as an edge-bar
                    to the moveable frame that carries F. The two moveable frames are imbedded in a
                    fixed plate HH', screwed to the tube B of the-micrometer, and having a circular
                    hole in its middle equal to the diameter of the object-glass. The two
                    semi-lenses are separated by turning the milled head to the right of A, which
                    moves the frame CC', and then the other frame F through the medium of a
                    coneealed wheel and a concealed pinion. The mechanism for giving the rotatory
                    motion is also concealed. The adjustment of the vernier to zero is effected by
                    the screw I.</p>
                <p>The property which the double-image micrometer possesses, of measuring angles in
                    all directions, directed to it the attention of Ramsden and other eminent
                    opticians. Ramsden accordingly communicated to the Royal Society of London, in
                    1777,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Phil. Trans,
                    vol. Ixix. 1779, p. 419.</p></note> an account of two instruments of this kind,
                    under the name of the <hi rend="italic">Dioptric</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catoptric</hi> Micrometers. In order to avoid the effects of aberration,
                    Ramsden proposed, in his dioptric micrometer, to place two semi-lenses in the
                    conjugate focus of the innermost lens of the ereet eye-tube of a refracting
                    telescope. In place of the imperfections of the lenses being magnified by the
                    whole power of the telescope, they are magnified only about five or six times,
                    and the size of the micrometer glass does not require to be T⅜o th part of the
                    area which is necessary in Dollond’s instrument. This instrument is shown in
                    Plate CCCLVIL fig. 7, where A is a convex or concave lens, bisected in the usual
                    way. One of the semi-lenses is fixed in a frame B and the other in a similar
                    frame E, both of which slide upon a plate H, against which they are pressed by
                    thin plates α, <hi rend="italic">a.</hi> The milled button D, by means of a
                    pinion and raek, moves these frames in opposite directions; and the separation
                    of the semi-lenses thus effected is measured by a scale of equal parts L on the
                    frame B, the zero being in the middle, and the divisions read off by two
                    verniers at Μ and N, carried by the frame E; the <pb break="no"

                    showing the relative motion of the two frames when the frame B moves to the
                    right, and N when the frame B is moved to the left. An endless screw F gives the
                    whole micrometer a motion round the axis of vision. This instrument being only
                    the divided object-glass micrometer in miniature, and differently placed, the
                    reader will have no difficulty in understanding its construction and use, from
                    the details already given in the preceding pages.</p>
                <p>Dr Pearson informs us, on the authority of Mr Troughton, that a Captain Countess,
                    R. N. having accidentally broken the third lens of a terrestrial eye-piece of
                    his telescope, observed the double images which it produced; and that tlιis
                    observation led to the contrivance of the coming-up glass that was first made by
                    Nairne, with a double screw for separating the halves of the amplifying lens.
                    Hence it is <hi rend="italic">conjectured</hi> that Ramsden derived his idea of
                    using a bisected lens for his dioptric micrometer and dynameter. The above facts
                    may be quite true, but Ramsden certainly did not require any such hint, as it
                    was a very natural transition from a bisected object-glass to a bisected
                    eye-glass.</p>
                <p>Dr Pearson also states that Mr George Dollond had constructed a dioptric
                    micrometer almost the same as Ramsden’s, without knowing any thing of what
                    Ramsden had proposed. We have no doubt that both these ingenious opticians were
                    quite original in their ideas, for it will not be supposed that Captain
                    Countess’s broken lens furnished Mr Dollond with the idea of his contrivance. Dr
                    Pearson has given a drawing and description of Mr Dollond’s construction of the
                    micrometer as made for Mr Davies Gilbert and himself.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Introduction to Practical Astronomy, vol. ii.
                    p. 182.</p></note> It does not appear that Mr Ramsden ever constructed it. The
                    weight of this micrometer was found by Dr Pearson too great for an ordinary
                    achromatic telescope.</p>
                <p>Mr Ramsden likewise proposed a catoptric double-image micrometer,‘which, from
                    being founded on the principle of reflection, is not disturbed by the
                    heterogeneity of light, while he considered it as “avoiding every defect of
                    other micrometers,” having “no aberration, nor any defect which arises from the
                    imperfection of materials or of ^execution, as the extreme simplicity of its
                    construction requires no additional mirrors or glasses to those required for the
                    telescope.” “It has also, peculiar to itself, the advantages of an adjustment to
                    make the images coincide in a direction perpendicular to that of their motion.
                    In order to effect these objects, Mr Ramsden divided the small speculum of a
                    Cassegrainian reflector into two equal halves, and by inclining each half on an
                    axis at right angles to the plane that separated them, he obtained two distinct
                    images; but as their angular separation was only half the inclination of the
                    specula, which would give only a small scale, he rejected this first idea, and
                    separated the semi-specula by making them turn on their centre of curvature, any
                    extent of scale being obtained by fixing the centre of motion at a proportional
                    distance from the common centre of curvature. The mechanism necessary to effect
                    this is shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 8, where A is the bisected speculum, one of
                    the semi-specula being fixed on the inner end of the arm B, its outer end being
                    fixed on a steel axis X extending across the mouth of the tube C. The other
                    semi-speculum is fixed on the inner end of the arm D, its outer end terminating
                    in a socket <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> which turns upon the steel axis <hi
                    rend="italic">x.</hi> These arms are braced by the bars <hi rend="italic">a,
                    a.</hi>. A compound screw G, having its upper part cut into double the number of
                    threads in an inch, viz. 100, to the lower part <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> which
                    has only 50, works with the handle in a nut F in the side of the tube, while the
                    part <hi rend="italic">g</hi> turns in a nut H fixed to the arm B. The point of
                    the compound screw separates the ends of the arms B and D, and, pressing against
                    the stud <hi rend="italic">h</hi> fixed to the arm D, turns in the nut H on the
                    arm B. A spiral spring within the part <hi rend="italic">η</hi> presses the two
                    arms B, D against the direction of the double screw <hi rend="italic">e
                    g</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> so as to prevent all shake or play in
                    the nut H. The progressive motion of the screw through the nut will be half the
                    distance of the semi-specula, so that these specula will be moved equally in
                    opposite directions from the axis of the telescope.</p>
                <p>A graduated circle V, divided into 100 parts on its cylindrical surface, is fixed
                    on the upper end of the screw G, so as to cause it to separate the semi-specula.
                    The fixed index I shows the parts of a revolution performed by the screw, while
                    the number of whole revolutions of the screw is shown by the divisions of the
                    same index. A steel screw R, moveable by a key, inclines the small speculum at
                    right angles to the direction of its motion. Distinct vision is procured in the
                    usual manner, and the telescope has a motion about its axis, in order to measure
                    the diameter of a planet in any direction; and the angle of rotation in
                    reference to the horizon is shown by a level, graduated circle, and vernier, at
                    the eye end of the large tube.</p>
                <p>A catoptric double-image micrometer has been suggested by Sir David Brewster as
                    applicable to the Newtonian telescope. The plane mirror is bisected, and is made
                    to form two images, either by giving each semi-speculum a motion round .their
                    common line of junction, or round a line perpendicular to that common line. The
                    mechanism by which this may be effected does not require any description. If the
                    micrometer is required for the sun or any luminous body, the small mirror may be
                    made of parallel glass, which would have the advantage of not obstructing any of
                    the light which enters the telescope, while it reflects enough for the purposes
                    of distinct vision. We shall again have occasion to refer more particularly to
                    this idea in the next section.</p>
                <p>Professor Amici of Modena has described, in the Memoirs of the Italian Society, a
                    new micrometer, which gives double images by means of semi-lenses separated by
                    mechanical means; but as we have not access to this work, we shall draw our
                    description of the instrument from one given by Dr Pearson, which is very far
                    from being distinct, in so far at least as the construction of the semi-lenses,
                    or <hi rend="italic">bars of glass</hi> as they are called, are concerned. The
                    semi-lenses seem to be portions of a large concave lens, separated in the usual
                    manner, so as to give two distinct images of objects; but the peculiarity of the
                    invention seems to consist in the lenses being placed between the object-glass
                    of a telescope and its principal focus, the cone of rays being divided at a
                    point about six inches before the place where the focal image is formed. Dr
                    Pearson, who made experiments with one of these instruments, has hinted at the
                    inconveniences which he experienced in using it.</p>

                    BY TW0 SIMPLY REFRACTING LENSES, SEMI-LENSES, OR PRISMS, ARE SEPARATED
                    OPTICALLY.</p>
                <p>In the year 1776 Dr Maskelyne constructed and used his prismatic micrometer,
                    which he had contrived with the view of getting rid of the sources of error to
                    which he found the divided object-glass micrometer liable. Having cut a prism or
                    wedge of glass into two parts, so as to form two prisms of exactly the same
                    refracting angle, he conceived the idea of fixing them together, so as to
                    produce two images, and to vary the angle which these two images formed, by
                    making the prisms move between the object<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819430?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9430-0017"/>-glass and its
                    principal focus; so that the scale is equal to the whole focal length of the
                    telescope. The two prisms may be placed in three, ways, with their thin edges
                    joined, with their square thick edges or backs joined, or with their sides or
                    triangular edgés joined. In the first position the double images will have only
                    one half of the light which is incident on the object-lens when the prisms are
                    close to it, and their degree of illumination will diminish as they approach the
                    focus. In the second position they will, as before, have only one half of the
                    incident light when close to the object-glass, but the illumination will
                    gradually increase as the prisms advance to the focus. In the third case, the
                    prisms being in a reverse position, the light will be the same in every part of
                    the scale, each of them receiving half the rays which fall upon the objectglass.
                    On this account Dr Maskelyne preferred this last arrangement.</p>
                <p>In the instrument which Dr Maskelyne constructed, and which seemed to have had
                    only a thirty-inch objectglass, the prisms were not achromatic, and consequently
                    the touching limbs of a luminous body were affected with the prismatic colours.
                    In the case of the sun, where all the rays might have been absorbed but the red,
                    this was of little consequence; but in other cases it was a serious defect,
                    which could be removed only by making the prisms achromatic; or it might have
                    been diminished by making the prisms of fluor spar, in which the dispersion is
                    very small. One of the Dollonds, accordingly, executed for Dr Maskelyne an
                    achromatic prism, which performed well. It does not appear that Dr Maskelyne
                    made any observations of value with this instrument.</p>
                <p>A new divided object-glass micrometer has been constructed by Sir David Brewster,
                    and described in his Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments. It consists of
                    an achromatic object-glass LL, fig. 7, between which and its principal focus/
                    two achromatic semi-lenses, fixed at a given distance, are made to move. These
                    lenses are shown in fig. 8, and are fixed on a piece of tube, which screws into
                    a tube; by pulling out and pushing in which, they are made to recede from or
                    approach to the object-glass LL. By this motion the angle subtended by the two
                    images varies in the same manner as the angle subtended by a pair of fixed wires
                    was made to vary by the motion of a second object-glass. When the semilenses are
                    close to LL, as shown at A, B, fig. 7, the two images which they form are much
                    separated, and their centres subtend a large angle; but as the lenses approach
                    to/ the centres of the images gradually approach each other, and consequently
                    the angle which they subtend continually increases. Hence, if we determine by
                    experiment the angular distance of their centres when the lenses are close to
                    LL, and likewise the angle when they are at <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the other
                    end of the scale, and if we fill up the intermediate points of the scale either
                    from theory or direct experiment, we shall have an instrument which will measure
                    with the greatest accuracy all angles between the two extreme ones. Another or
                    more pair of semi-lenses may be used in the same telescope, and placed at
                    smaller or greater distances, so that, by means of other scales adapted to them,
                    we may obtain all angles that may be required. The lenses A, B may be concave or
                    convex; and when a large scale is required, with a tenth of an inch to a second,
                    or even greater, we have only to use semi-lenses of long foci, and the scale may
                    be confined to the part of the tube nearest the focal point.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster has proved, both from theory and experiment, that the scale is
                    one of equal parts; so that, after having ascertained by experiment the two
                    extreme angles, the whole scales may be completed by dividing the interval into
                    any number of equal parts, and these subdivided, if necessary, by a vernier
                    scale.</p>
                <p>When the semi-lenses are placed without the objectglass LL, and this object-glass
                    moved towards <hi rend="italic">f</hi> as in the annexed figure, the angular
                    distance of the images is invariable.</p>
                <p>This instrument has been constructed for measuring distances, and as a coming-up
                    glass for ascertaining whether a ship is approaching to or receding from the
                    observer. In this form it constitutes part of fig. 4, Plate CCCLVII., the
                    semi-lenses being made to screw into the same place as the second object-glass,
                    and having a separate scale for themselves. In this form many of the instruments
                    have been constructed by Tulley.</p>
                <p>Among the optical micrometers, we may describe another invented by Sir David
                    Brewster, and adapted solely to the Newtonian telescope. In order to get rid of
                    the loss of light by the reflection of the small plane speculum, he uses an
                    achromatic prism to reflect the light just as much out of the axis of the
                    telescope as will allow the bead of the observer to be applied to the eye-tube,
                    without obstructing any of the light which enters the tube. By using two prisms,
                    as in Maskelyne’s instrument, and moving them along the axis of his telescope
                    through a small distance, we shall obtain a good micrometer. The prisms may be
                    separated mechanically, or a doubly refracting prism may be fixed upon the face
                    of the single or achromatic prism used to turn aside the rays. The achromatism
                    of a single glass prism may be corrected by the doubly refracting prism, a
                    balance of refraction being left sufficient to turn aside the image to the
                    observers eye.</p>
                <p>CHAP. V. DESCRIPTION OF DOUBLE-IMAGE MICROMETERS</p>
                <p>IN WHICH THE TWO IMAGES ARE FORMED BY DOUBLE REFRACTION.</p>
                <p>The happy idea of applying the two images formed by double refraction to the
                    construction of a micrometer unquestionably belongs to the Abbé Rochon; and
                    though Dr Pearson has laboured to show that Dr Maskelyne’s prismatic telescope
                    was constructed before Rochon’s, yet this does not in the smallest degree take
                    away from the originality and priority of Rochon’s invention; for the idea of
                    varying the angle by the motion of the prisms can scarcely be viewed as an
                    essential part of the invention.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819443?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9443-0018"/>
                <p>Although the double refraction of rock-crystal is small, yet, from its limpidity
                    and hardness, the Abbé Rochon regarded it as superior to any other substance for
                    making doubly refracting prisms. When he used one prism so cut that its
                    refracting edge coincided with the axis of the prism, in which case its double
                    refraction was the greatest, he found that the separation of the two images was
                    too small to-give the angles which he required.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In his first experiments Rochon corrected the
                    dispersion of the rock-crystal prism by a similar prism placed in front of it,
                    and having its exterior face perpendicular to the axis of the crystal. This
                    prism, having no effect in doubling the image, gave him a complete correction of
                    the dispersion for the ordinary image.</p></note> He therefore fell upon a most
                    ingenious plan of doubling the amount of the double refraction of one prism, by
                    using two prisms of rock-crystal, so cut out of the solid as to give each the
                    same quantity of double refraction, and yet to double that quantity in the
                    effect produced. This construction of the compound prism was so difficult, that
                    Μ. Rochon informs us, that “he knew only one person, Μ. Narci, who was capable
                    of giving rock-crystal the prismatic form in the proper direction for obtaining
                    the double refractions necessary to the goodness of the micrometer.” The method
                    used by Narci seems to have been kept a secret, for in 1819 Dr Wollaston set
                    himsèlf to discover the method of constructing these compound prisms, and has
                    described it in the Philosophical Transactions,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1820, p. 126.</p></note> but not
                    in such a manner as to be very intelligible to those who are not familiar with
                    such subjects. We conceive that the process may be easily understood from the
                    following rule. Cut a hexagonal prism of quartz into two halves by a plane
                    passing through or parallel to its axis. Grind and polish the two cut faces, and
                    by means of Canada balsam cement the one upon the other, so that any line or
                    edge in the one face may be perpendicular to the same line in the other. Cut and
                    polish a face on each of the united portions, so that the common section of
                    these faces with the cemented planes may be parallel to the axis of the crystal,
                    while they are equally inclined to these planes, and the prism will be
                    completed.</p>
                <p>We shall now'explain, by a diagram, a more simple and economical way of cutting
                    these prisms, though the principle is exactly the same. Let AKGDBLHF be half of
                    a hexagonal prism of quartz, the height of which, DF, is equal to half of its
                    diameter AD. Bisect AD in C, and join CK, CG, and draw CE parallel to AB or DF.
                    This line CE will be the axis of the prism. Grind and polish the section ABFD,
                    and cut off the prisms AKCBLE and DGCFHE, setting aside the intermediate similar
                    prism KGCLHF. The faces ACEB, DCEF arc square and equal, so that if we cement
                    these faces together, making the line AB coincide with FE, AC will coincide with
                    FD, CE with CF, and EB with CF. If we wish each prism to have an angle of 60°,
                    we may take either GDFH or GCEH for the refracting face of it; we shall suppose
                    the former. In this case we must grind and polish a face on the other prism ABL,
                    which is accurately parallel to the face GDFH, and the compound prism will be
                    completed. If 60° is too great, we must grind down the face GDFH till it has the
                    desired inclination to DF, and grind and polish a face parallel to it on the
                    other prism. The external faces, in short, to be made upon each prism, must be
                    equally inclined to the cemented planes DCEF, ABEC, and have their common
                    section DF parallel to the axis CE of the prism.</p>
                <p>In place of cutting off the prism AKCBLE, we may cut off only the prism GCDHEF,
                    leaving the intermediate one KGCLHE attached to AKCBLE, and proceed as before.
                    The object of this is to leave enough of solid quartz at KL to give a face of
                    the same breadth as GDFH. If the prisms required are small compared with the
                    quartz crystal, we may obtain, by the first method, six prisms qut of the
                    crystal, or three pair of compound ones. On the other hand, if the required
                    prism is large compared with the crystal of quartz, it may require one half of
                    the crystal to make one prism, and the other half the other. Nay, it may be
                    necessary to cut each individual prism out of separate crystals, the method of
                    doing which is very obvious from the preceding description.</p>
                <p>When the prism is completed, it is obvious that a ray of light incident
                    perpendicularly on the face GHFD wi∏ be perpendicular to the axis of the prism
                    CE, and therefore the extraordinary ray will suffer the greatest deviation, viz.
                    17'; and the same is true of the other prism. But when the ray passes through
                    both, it is found to have a deviation of 34', which is produced in the following
                    manner: Let AB be a line viewed through one of the prisms, with its refracting
                    angle turned upwards; two images of it will be seen, viz. the extraordinary
                    image at E, and the ordinary one at 0.</p>
                <p>If we now interpose the other prism with its refracting angle downwards, both
                    these images E, O will be refracted downwards. But, owing to the transverse
                    cutting of the prisms, the extraordinary image E, which was most raised, now
                    suffers ordinary refraction, and is least depressed, so that in place of being
                    refracted back to AB, it comes only to E'O'. On the other hand, the ordinary
                    image 0, which suffered the least refraction, is now extraordinarily refracted,
                    and, in place of reaching AB, is depressed to O'E'; and since the double
                    refraction of each prism, as well as the angles of the prism, are equal, the
                    angular distance of the images E'O', O'E ’ formed by the combined prisms will be
                    double of the distance EO, or 34'.</p>
                <p>The same rule may be followed in cutting the prism out of the limpid arid
                    homogeneous topazes of New Holland, the principal axis of which coincides with
                    the axis of the prism. When the crystals are amorphous, the cleavage planes will
                    be a sufficient guide, as the above axis is always perpendicular to them. Such
                    prisms are incomparably superior, as we have practically experienced, to those
                    made of rock-crystal.</p>
                <p>When a very large angle is required for any particular purposes, artificial
                    crystals, such as carbonate of potash, &amp;c. may be advantageously employed,
                    the crystals being ground with oil, or any fluid in which they are not soluble.
                    By cementing plates of parallel glass on their outer surfaces, they will be as
                    permanent as rock-crystal.</p>
                <p>Dr Pearson fitted up with one of Rochon’s micrometers an achromatic telescope 33
                    inches in focal length, and having a magnifying power of 35½. He applied to it
                    two separate compound prisms, one of which had a constant angle of 32', and the
                    other an angle only of 5', the vernier in the former case indicating seconds,
                    and in the latter tenths of seconds. A drawing is given of the tube, with the
                    prisms and scales, in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 9 and 10, as given by Dr Pearson. The
                    tube is graduated from the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819456?mode=fullsize"

                    each side of the slit or opening cut along the middle of the tubes, to allow the
                    sliding piece, shown separately in fig. 10, to move from the object-glass to the
                    solar focus. This sliding piece holds the prism, the larger prism of 32' being
                    shown as placed with its sliding piece in the tube, and the smaller prism of 5'
                    being shown in the separate sliding piece, fig. 9. The two verniers of the
                    scales are seen on each side of the two screws with milled beads, which pass
                    through the slit, and serve to move the sliding piece to or from the
                    object-glass when they are not too much tightened.</p>

                    M.Rochon makes the following observations. “I ought not to omit, that in this
                    new construction there are difficulties of execution not easy to surmount, which
                    may have been one reason why these instruments, so useful to navigators, and in
                    certain very nice astronomical observations, have not been adopted. This induced
                    me at length to adopt Euler’s method. In the construction of achromatic
                    object-glasses I found I could increase or diminish the absolute effect of the
                    double refraction within certain limits, by means <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    interval between the glasses of different refracting powers; the separation of
                    the images at the focus being so much the greater, as the interval is larger,
                    when the flint-glass is the first of the object-glasses, and less when it is the
                    second. Conformably to these new principles, I have had two telescopes with a
                    doubly refracting medium constructed under my own inspection, which General
                    Gantheaumc will employ for determining the position of his ships, and to find
                    whether he be approaching any he may meet with at sea.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>In 1812 Μ. Rochon constructed his doubly refracting micrometer in another form,
                    from which he anticipated great advantages. He made a parallelopiped of
                    rock-crystal, consisting of two prisms whose refracting angles were each about
                    30°, so that the angle which they gave was less than 30', and the two images of
                    the sun of course overlapped each other. The prisms being firmly united by
                    mastic, he ground the parallelopiped into a convex lens, so that when combined
                    with a concave one of flint-glass, it formed an achromatic object-glass with a
                    focal length of about 3 decimetres, or nearly 12 inches. This object-glass
                    separated the centres of the images of the sun about 28 minutes. “He then
                    adapted to this objectglass a common micrometer, which measured angles of 10
                    minutes, and he had thus 3 decimetres and 10 minutes to complete the measure of
                    the diameters of the sun or moon.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Μ. Arago appears to have been the first person to apply doubly refracting prisms
                    to the eye-pieces of telescopes for the purpose of measuring very small angles.
                    He explained his general method to the writer of this article in July 1814, and
                    mentioned the results which he had obtained with it in measuring the diameters
                    of the planets. We do not recollect distinctly how he varied the constant angle
                    of the doubly refracting prism; but Dr Pearson and ,Μ. Biot state,<note

                    by placing the prism in an oblique direction as regards the line of vision; and
                    “that he determined the respective values of the angles thus increased by means
                    of concentric circles placed vertically at a measured distance from the eye

                    could generally find one out of the number which would come into exact contact
                    with its image, and thus give the value of the constant angle.”<note

                    which the constant angle is varied by Sir David Brewster’s variable eye-piece

                    by a convex or concave lens moving between the object-glass and its principal
                    focus; but what would be still better, by pulling out or pushing in the
                    eye-piece of a Gregorian or Cassegrainian telescope.</p>
                <p>In 1821 Mr George Dollond communicated to the Royal Society an account of his
                    spherical crystal micrometer, a very ingenious instrument, though, we should
                    think, one difficult to execute; and, at the same time, even when well executed,
                    liable to error. Mr Dollond’s improvement consists in making a sphere or lens
                    from a piece of rock-crystal, and adapting it to a telescope in place of the
                    usual eye-glass, as shown in Plate CCCLVIL fig. 11, where <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> is the sphere or lens, formed of rock-crystal, and placed in <hi
                    rend="italic">half holes,</hi> from which is extended the axis <hi rend="italic"
                    >bb,</hi> with an attached index, the face of which is shown in fig. 12. This
                    index registers the motion of the sphere on the graduated circle. The sphere <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is so placed in the half holes, that when its natural axis
                    (axis of double refraction, we presume) is parallel to the axis of the
                    telescope, it gives only one image of the object. In a direction perpendicular
                    to that axis, it must be so placed that when it is moved the separation of the
                    images may be parallel to that motion. The method of acquiring this adjustment
                    is by turning the sphere <hi rend="italic">a</hi> in the half holes parallel to
                    its own axis. A second lens <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is introduced between the
                    sphere and the primary image given by the object-glass, and its distance from
                    the sphere should be in proportion to the magnifying power required. The
                    magnifying powers engraven in fig. 12 are suited to an object-glass of 44 inches
                    focal length. The following are the advantages of this construction, as stated
                    by its inventor. 1. It is only necessary to select a piece of perfect crystal,
                    and, without any knowledge of the angle that will give the greatest double
                    refraction, to form the sphere of a proper diameter for the focal length
                    required. 2. The angle may be taken on each side of <hi rend="italic">zero,</hi>
                    without reversing the eye-tube; and intermediate angles may be taken between
                    zero and the greatest separation of the images, without exchanging any part of
                    the eye-tube, it being only required to move the axis in which the sphere is
                    placed. 3. It possesses the property of a common eye-tube and lens; for when the
                    axis of the crystal is parallel to that of the objpct-glass, only one image will
                    be formed, and that as distinctly as with any lens that does not refract
                    doubly.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Phil. Trans.
                    1821, p. 101-104.</p></note></p>
                <p>Dr Pearson had one of these instruments constructed by Mr Dollond, and applied to
                    an achromatic object-glass 43∙6 inches in focal length. He has shown that the
                    scale is not one of equal parts, and has pointed out a method of determining the
                    constant angle of the crystal.</p>
                <p>Knowing from experience the imperfect structure of rock-crystal, especially in
                    directions approaching to the axis, we dreaded that a spherical eye-glass of
                    this material would not give perfect vision. Dr Pearson confirms this opinion by
                    actual observation. He attempted to measure the diameter of Mars when about 9",
                    “but its limits were <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819469?mode=fullsize"

                    strongly recommend to Mr Dollond the substitution of limpid topaz from New
                    Holland, in place of the rock-crystal.</p>
                <p>CHAP. VI. DESCRIPTION OF POSITION MICROMETERS.</p>
                <p>A position micrometer is an instrument for measuring angles when a plane passing
                    through the two lines which contain these angles is perpendicular to the axis of
                    vision. Sir W’. Herschel first proposed such an instrument for the purpose of
                    verifying a conjecture, that the smaller of the two stars which compose a double
                    star revolves round the larger one. Hence it became necessary to observe if a
                    line joining the centres of any two stars always formed the same angle with the
                    direction of its daily motion. After constructing the instrument which we are
                    about to describe, and making a long series of observations, he verified his
                    conjecture by the important discovery, that the double stars formed binary
                    systems, in which the one revolved round the other.<note anchored="true"

                    The position micrometer used by Sir William Herschel in his earliest
                    observations, viz. those made in 1779-1783, was made by Nairne, and was
                    constructed as shown in Plate CCCLVII. fig. 13, which represents it when
                    enclosed in. a turned case of wood, and ready to be screwed into the eye-piece
                    of the telescope. “A is a little box which holds the eye-glass. B is the piece
                    which covers the inside work, and the box A screwed into it. C is the body of
                    the micrometer, containing the brass work, showing the index-plate <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> projecting at one side, where the case is cut away to
                    receive it. D is a piece having a screw <hi rend="italic">b</hi> at the bottom,
                    by means of which the micrometer is fastened to the telescope. To the piece C is
                    given a circular motion, in the manner the horizontal motion is generally given
                    to Gregorian reflectors, by the lower part going through the piece D, where it
                    is held by the screw E, which keeps the two pieces C and D together, but leaves
                    them at liberty to turn on each other. Fig. 14 is a section of the case
                    containing the brass work, where may be observed the piece B hollowed out to
                    receive the box A, which consists of two parts enclosing the eye-lens. This
                    figure shows how the piece C passes through D, and is held by the ring E. The
                    brass work, consisting of a hollow cylinder, a wheel and pinion, and
                    index-plate, is there represented in its place. F is the body of the brass work,
                    being a hollow cylinder with a broad rim C at its upper end; this rim is partly
                    turned away to make a bed for the wheel <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> The pinion <hi
                    rend="italic">e</hi> turns the wheel <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and carries the

                    which arm serves also to confine the wheel <hi rend="italic">d</hi> to its place
                    on c. The other pivot is held by the arm <hi rend="italic">g</hi> fastened to
                    F.</p>
                <p>A section of the brass work is shown in fig. 15, where the wheel <hi

                <p>We do not know the value of the divisions in the instrument used by Sir William
                    Herschel; but in the position micrometer of the five-feet equatorial used by Sir
                    John Herschel and Sir James South, in their observations on double stars, the
                    position circle was large enough to show distinctly minutes of a degree by means
                    of its vernier.</p>
                <p>The position micrometer which we have now described has been greatly improved by
                    Sir David Brewster; and the following account of these improvements, which is
                    not susceptible of abridgment, is given in his own words.</p>
                <p>In the position micrometer invented by Sir William Herschel, “the two wires
                    always cross each other at the centre of the field, and consequently their
                    angular separation is produced uniformly by the motion of the pinion. This very
                    circumstance, however, though it renders it easy for the observer to read off
                    the angle from the scale, is one of the greatest imperfections of the
                    instrument. The observations must obviously be all made on one side of the
                    centre of the field, as appears from fig. 16; and the use of the instrument is
                    limited to those cases in which Ss is less than the radius SC. The greatest
                    disadvantage of the instrument, however, is the shortness of the radius SC; for
                    the error of observation must always diminish as the length of this raditfs
                    increases. This disadvantage does not exist in measuring the angle of position
                    of two stars S, <hi rend="italic">s, for</hi> the distance Ss remains the same
                    whatever be the length of SC; but in determining the angle which a line joining
                    two stars forms with a line joining other two stars, or those which compose a
                    double star (an observation which it may often be of great importance to make),
                    and all other angles contained by lines whose apparent length is greater than
                    SC, this imperfection is inseparable from the instrument. Nay, there are some
                    cases in which the instrument completely fails; as, for instance, when we wish
                    to measure the angles formed by two lines which do not meet in a focus, but only
                    tend to a remote vertex. If the distance of the nearest extremities of these
                    lines is greater than the chord of the angle which they form measured upon the
                    radius SC, then it is impossible to measure that angle, for the wires cannot be
                    brought to coincide with the lines by which it is contained. Nay, when the chord
                    of the angle does exceed the distance between the nearest extremities, the
                    position of the wires which can be brought into coincidence with the lines is so
                    small as to lead to very serious errors in the result.</p>
                <p>The new position micrometer which we propose to substitute for this instrument is
                    free from the defects just noticed, and is founded on a beautiful property of
                    the circle. If any two chords, AB, CD, fig. 12, intersect each other in the
                    point O within the circle, the angle which they form at 0 will be equal to half
                    the sum of the arches AC, BD; but if these chords do not intersect each other
                    within the circle, but tend to any point 0 without the circle, when they would
                    intersect each other if continued, as in fig. 13, then the angle which they form
                    is equal to half the difference of the arches AC, BD; that is, calling <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;ρ</hi> the angle required, we have, in the first case, as
                    shown in fig. 12,</p>
                <p>AC + BD , . <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi><hi rend="italic">&lt;f&gt;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> ·_·; and in the second case, as shown in fig.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819482?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9482-0021"/>
                <p>13, <hi rend="italic">&lt;p</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="strikethrough"
                    >g BD</hi>. Hence, if the two wires AB, CD be placed in the focus of the first
                    eye-glass of a telescope, the moveable one AB may be made to form every possible
                    angle with the fixed one CD, and that angle may be readily found from the arches
                    AB, CD.</p>
                <p>The mechanism for measuring these arches is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 17,
                    where the graduated circular head CD may be divided only into 180°, in order to
                    save the trouble of halving the sum or the difference of the arches AC, BD; but
                    as it would still be necessary to measure <hi rend="italic">two</hi> arches
                    before the angle could be ascertained, we have adopted another method,
                    remarkable for its simplicity, and giving no more trouble than if the wires
                    always intersected each other in the centre of the field.</p>
                <p>Let AB, for example, fig. 13, be the fixed wire, and CD the moveable one, and let
                    it be required to find at one observation the angle AOC or ç&gt;. Set the index
                    of the vernier to <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> when D coincides with B; and as C
                    will be at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> when D is at B, the arch cAwill
                    beaconstantquantity, which we shall call <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> Making AC =
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and BD = <hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> we have <hi rend="italic">&lt;p ~</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> m</hi><hi rend="superscript"> n</hi>. But since the extremity C
                    will move over the space Cc while D describes the space DB, these arches must be
                    equal, consequently <hi rend="italic">b = rn</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">η</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> hcnce, adding 2n to each side of
                    the equation, we obtain <hi rend="italic">b + 2n</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 1 1</hi><hi rend="italic">m + n .</hi><hi rend="italic">= m +
                    n</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> or ½ <hi rend="italic">o + n</hi> =
                    —~—, consequently <hi rend="italic">φ = ½ b + η.</hi> Hence the angle AOC is
                    equal to half the arch Ac added to the arch DB; or, since Ac is invariable, the
                    half of it is a constant quantity, and the angle required is equal to the sum of
                    this constant quantity and the arch DB.</p>
                <p>When the wires do not intersect each other, as in fig. 13, we have <hi
                    rend="italic">φ</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    m</hi><hi rend="superscript"> ¾</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">b = m + n;</hi>
                    hence, sub-trading <hi rend="italic">2n</hi> from each side of the equation, we
                    have <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">2n =
                    nι</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi><hi rend="italic

                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">n</hi> = ———, consequently <hi
                    rend="italic">&lt;f&gt; = ½ b</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >n.</hi> That is, the angle AOC is equal to the difference between half the arch
                    Ac and the arch DB, or to a constant quantity diminished by the arch DB.</p>
                <p>In finding the angle AOC, therefore, we have merely to observe the place of the
                    index when the wires are in their proper position; and as the scale commences at
                    B, or where D and B coincide, and is numbered both ways from B, tbe degree
                    pointed out on the circular head CD, when increased or diminished by the
                    constant quantity, will give the angle of the wires which is sought. The
                    semicircle on each side of a diameter drawn through B is divided into 180°, the
                    180th degree being at the opposite end of that diameter.</p>
                <p>We may simplify still further the method of reading off the angle AOC, so as to
                    save the trouble even of recollecting the constant quantity, and of adding it
                    to, or subtracting it from, the arch pointed out by the index of the vernier.
                    This advantage is obtained by making the index of the vernier point to the
                    constant quantity upon the part of the scale below B, fig. 12, when the points
                    D, B coincide, or when the wire CD is in the dotted position cB; for it is
                    obvious that if <hi rend="italic">z</hi> marks the zero of the scale, and Bz is
                    equal to the constant quantity, the arch <hi rend="italic">Oz,</hi> which is
                    pointed out by the index of the vernier, will be equal to <hi rend="italic">½ b
                    + n</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> y</hi> or the angle AOC. In like manner, in
                    fig. 13, where the wires do not cross each other within the field, and where Bz
                    is the constant quantity, the arch Dz marked out by the index of the vernier is
                    obviously equal to ½ó—n, or the angle AOC, which the wires tend to form at 0. By
                    means of this adjustment, therefore, we are able to read off the angle AOC with
                    the same facility as if the wires intersected each other in the centre of the
                    field, when the arches are accurate measures of the angles at the centre.</p>
                <p>The end of the eye-tube is represented in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 17, where the
                    circular head CD is divided into 360°, and subdivided by the vernier V. L is the
                    level, and AB the part of the eye-piece which contains the diaphragm, with the
                    fixed and moveable wires. The head CD, and the level L, are firmly fixed to the
                    eye-tube T; and from the head CD there rises an annular shoulder, concentric
                    with the tube, and containing the diaphragm, across which the fixed wire is
                    stretched. This diaphragm, which is rcpre≠ sented in fig 18, with the wire
                    extended across, projects through the circle of brass EF. All these parts remain
                    immoveable, while the outer tube AB, and the other half EF, of the circular head
                    which contains the vernier V, have a rotatory motion upon the shoulder, which
                    rises from CD. The tube AB is merely an outer case, to protect a little tube
                    within it, which contains the eye-glass, and the moveable diaphragm, with its
                    wire extended across it. The enclosed tube is screwed into the ring EF, and the
                    outer tube is also screwed upon the same ring, so that by moving AB, a motion of
                    rotation is communicated to the vernier V, and to the diaphragm and wire
                    belonging to the inner tube, while the rest of the eye-piece, containing the
                    other diaphragm with its wire, remains stationary. By these means the moveable
                    wire is made to form every possible angle with the fixed wire, and the angle is
                    determined by the method which we have already explained. The fixed wire is
                    placed a good deal ont of the centre of the diaphragm to which it belongs; and
                    the diaphragm itself is placed in a cell, in which it can be turned round so as
                    to adjust the wire to a horizontal line when the level is set. The moveable wire
                    is likewise placed at a distance from the&gt;centre of its diaphragm, as shown
                    in Plate CCCLVIH. fig. 19; but, by means of screws which pass through the inner
                    tube into the edge of this diaphragm, it can be moved in a plane at right angles
                    to the axis of the eye-piece, so that the moveable wire may be placed either in
                    the centre of the field or at different distances from it.</p>
                <p>The double-image micrometer affords a convenient method of measuring angles of
                    position; and we believe this application of it was first made by Sir David
                    Brewster.</p>
                <p>In every instrument in which a double image of an object is formed by means of
                    two semi-lenses with their centres at a distance, the one image appears to have
                    a rotatory motion round the other when the telescope is turned about its axis.
                    Thus, in Plate CCCLVIIL fig. 20, if A, B be images of two objects formed by the
                    upper semi-lens when the common diameter of the semi-lenses is perpendicular to
                    the horizon, and C, D the images of the same objects formed by the lower
                    semi-lens; then, by turning the telescope about its axis, or the semi-lenses
                    round in their tube, the image A will appear to move round C in the circle A«E,
                    and the image B round D in the circle B6F, or in the opposite direction if the
                    telescope, or the semi-lenses, arc turned the other way. When the distance AC is
                    equal to CD, as in fig. 21, the image A will pass over the image D; or if the
                    telescope is turned in the opposite direction, the image B will pass over the
                    image C. In like manner, when AC is greater or less than CD, the images will
                    move as we have represented them in fig. 20 and 22. In all these cases the four
                    images may be brought into one straight line; and when this takes place, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819495?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9495-0022"/> the
                    line which passes through all the images will uniformly form the same angle with
                    the horizon, as the common diameter of the semi-lenses. It is very easy to
                    ascertain with the utmost accuracy when the images form one straight line; but
                    particularly in the case where AC, fig. 21, is equal to CD, for the image of A
                    will then pass over D; and the coincidence of the images will mark the instant
                    when the line which joins them is parallel to the common diameter of the lenses.
                    Hence, as we obtain by this means the relation of the line joining the images to
                    a fixed line in the instrument, the relation of this line to the horizon may be
                    easily found by means of a level, and a divided circular head. If the image is a
                    straight line (fig. 22), then the coincidence of the two images, so as to form
                    one straight line, will indicate the parallelism of that line to the diameter of
                    the semi-lenses.</p>
                <p>In constructing a micrometer <hi rend="italic">of</hi> this kind solely for the
                    purpose of measuring angles when the eye is not at their vertex, either the
                    object-glass or the third eye-glass might be made the divided lens. If the
                    object-glass is divided, it should be so constructed that it may have a rotatory
                    motion in its cell, by applying the hand to a milled circumference AB, Plate
                    CCCLVIII. fig. 23. Connected with the tube TT of the telescope is a circular
                    ring of brass CD divided into 360°; and the divisions upon this scale are
                    pointed out by the index of a vernier <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> which moves
                    along with the semi-lenses. A level L is fixed to the plate AB, having its axis
                    parallel to the common diameter of the lenses, and being adjusted to a
                    horizontal line when the index points to the zero of the scale. In using the
                    instrument, therefore, the observer turns round the semi-lenses by means of the
                    projecting milled circumference AB, till the coincidence of the two images is
                    distinctly perceived. The index of the vernier will then point out upon the
                    graduated head the inclination of the line which is required.</p>
                <p>When the telescope is long, this form of the instrument, though extremely simple,
                    is not very convenient. The construction represented in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 24,
                    is in general to be preferred. This instrument consists of three tubes BL, LC,
                    CA. At the extremity B of the first tube is placed the divided object-glass, and
                    at the other extremity L is fixed the divided circular head EF. The tube CL,
                    which remains always at rest, is fixed to the stand HI by means of the clasp and
                    screw at H. The tube AC, which contains an eye-piece, moves within both the
                    tubes CL and LB. The tube BL extends towards C within the tube CL, and round its
                    circumference are cut a number of teeth, in which the endless 'screw G works,
                    and thus gives a rotatory motion to the tube LB and the divided head EF. By this
                    means the common diameter of the semi-lenses at B is made to form every possible
                    angle with a horizontal line, which is indicated-by a level above L, having its
                    axis parallel to the common diameter of the semi-lenses. The index of the
                    vernier <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> fixed to the stationary tube CL, points out on
                    the graduated head the angle required. When the instrument is constructed so
                    that the semi-lenses are in the eye-piece, the graduated head must be placed in
                    the eye-tube.</p>
                <p>If the principle of this micrometer is applied to the double-image micrometer
                    described in Chap. IV. in which a pair of fixed semi-lenses moves between the
                    object-glass and its principal focus, we obtain an instrument which will measure
                    at the same observation the angle subtended at the eye of the observer by a line
                    joining two points, and likewise the angle which that line forms with the
                    horizon or any other line. When the two images of the line which joins the two
                    points are brought into contact by the motion of the semi-lenses along the axis
                    of the tube, these images must necessarily be in the same straight line, so that
                    the relation of that line to the horizon, or to any other given line, and the
                    contact of the two images of it which determines its angular magnitude, are
                    obtained simultaneously, without any additional observation or adjustment.</p>
                <p>Dr Pearson has given some very useful details respecting the use of double-image
                    micrometers in measuring angles of position.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>When the brightness of the two stars which compose a double star is considerable,
                    their discs may be drawn out into lines of light either by cylindrical
                    refraction or reflection, and the coincidence of these lines will furnish the
                    means of determining the angle of position.</p>
                <p>A position micrometer upon a new principle has been proposed by Sir David
                    Brewster. He expands the images of the two stars into luminous discs till they
                    overlap each other. The southern limb of the lower disc is then made to move
                    along the fixed wire of the position micrometer. A line joining the two points
                    where the circumferences of the discs intersect each other, is obviously
                    perpendicular to a line joining the centres of the stars, and will therefore
                    form an angle with the fixed wire-equal to the complement of the angle of
                    position required. If we therefore make the moveable wire pass through the two
                    points where the luminous discs intersect each other, the micrometer scale will
                    give the complement of the angle of position.<note anchored="true"

                <p>AND THE LUCID-DISC MICROMETER.</p>
                <p>In measuring the distances and angle of position of double stars, Sir William
                    Herschel encountered many practical difficulties which interfered with the
                    accuracy of his results. The uncertainty of the real zero of his scale, the
                    inflexion of light, the imperfections of the screws and divided bars and
                    pinions, and the difficulty of obtaining fibres sufficiently minute for his
                    purpose, but, above all, the disappearance of small stars by the illumination of
                    the wire, led this eminent astronomer to the contrivance of his <hi
                    rend="italic">lamp micrometer,</hi> which, while it is exempt from these sources
                    of error, has also the advantage of a large scale.</p>
                <p>Thelampιnicrometer is represented in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 25, where AB is the
                    upright part of the stand, 9 feet high, upon which a wooden semicircle <hi
                    rend="italic">qhogp,</hi> 14 inches radius, may be fixed at different heights,
                    by a peg <hi rend="italic">p</hi> put into holes in the stand. An arm L, 30
                    inches long, moves round a pivot in the centre of the board by means of the
                    handle P, which works by a string <hi rend="italic">eqho</hi> fastened to a hook
                    at the back of L. The arm L is kept at any inclination to the horizon by the
                    weight of the handle P, which is 10 feet long. A small slider <hi rend="italic"
                    >b,</hi> about 3 inches long, moves along the front of L towards and from the
                    centre at <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> by means of the handle rD, which operates by
                    a string passing over the pulley <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> returning by <hi rend="italic">η</hi> to a barrel at
                    <hi rend="italic">τ,</hi> while a second string <hi rend="italic">bnw,</hi> with
                    a weight <hi rend="italic">w,</hi> causes the slider <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to
                    return to the centre. The end of the arm L is shown on a large scale in fig.
                    26.</p>
                <p>Two lamps <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> figs. 27 and 28, 1½ inch high and 1∣ inch
                    deep, having sliding doors with small apertures made with a fine needle opposite
                    the flame òf a single cotton-thread wick, so that when the sliders are shut
                    down, nothing is seen but two fine lucid points like stars of the third or
                    fourth magnitude. The lamp <hi rend="italic">α</hi> is placed at the centre <hi
                    rend="italic">τι,</hi> so that its lucid point may occupy that centre, while <hi

                    required position by the handle P; and by the handle D he may place them at any
                    distance, from six tenths of an inch to twenty-five inches.</p>
                <p>In using this micrometer, SirW. Herschel placed it ten feet from his left eye,
                    while with his right he viewed a double star through his Newtonian reflector. By
                    means of his left eye the double star is seen projected upon the micrometer, and
                    he then placed his two lucid points at such a distance that they were exactly
                    covered by the stars. The distance of the lucid points was the tangent of the
                    magnified angles subtended by the stars to a radius of ten feet. This angle,
                    therefore, being divided by the magnifying power of the telescope, gives the
                    real angular distance of the centres of a double star. With a power of 460 the
                    scale was a quarter of an inch for every second. Sir W. Herschel, in measuring
                    the apparent diameter of α <hi rend="italic">Lyrae</hi> with this instrument,
                    used a magnifying power of 6450. The magnified angle was 38' 10", so that the

                <p>In using high magnifying powers, Sir W. Herschel employed another apparatus
                    called the lucid-disc micrometer. A lucid disc made of oiled paper, or any other
                    semi-transparent substance, was placed in the front slider of a lantern, and
                    illuminated by a flame behind it. The lantern was then removed to a distance
                    till the diameter of the disc appeared equal to that of a planet seen in the
                    telescope, so that the angular diameter of the planet became known by dividing
                    the angle subtended by the disc by the magnifying power of the telescope. The
                    result was affected by the colour of the disc and the degree of illumination.
                    The measure was always too small when the illumination was strong, and too great
                    when a black disc was placed on an illuminated ground. Hence Sir William
                    Herschel took a mean of the two as the true measure.</p>
                <p>Μ. Schroeter of Lilienthal, in measuring the diameters of the four new planets,
                    used a lucid-disc micrometer, which we presume was not much different from Sir
                    W. Herschel’s.</p>
                <p>Dr Pearson constructed and used an analogous instrument, in which the left eye
                    looked into a tube containing a system of lines upon a disc of glass, or a
                    spider’s line micrometer, so that the object seen with the right eye was
                    projected against these divisions, and its angular diameter ascertained.<note

                <p>CHAP. VIII DESCRIPTION OF FIXED MICROMETERS WITH</p>
                <p>AN INVARIABLE SCALE.</p>
                <p>The earliest fixed micrometer of which we have a distinct account is that of
                    Huygens, who placed a circular diaphragm in the focus of the eye-glass of his
                    telescope, and found its angular value to be seventeen and a quarter minutes by
                    the time which a star took to pass across it. He then formed two or three long
                    brass plates of different breadths so as to form wedges of different angles. In
                    measuring the diameter of a planet with one of these, he made one of them slide
                    through two slits in the opposite sides of the tube, so that the plane of the
                    brass wedges touched the plane of the circular diaphragm; and having observed in
                    what part of the wedge its breadth just covered the whole planet, he took this
                    breadth in a pair of compasses, and having found what part it was of the whole
                    aperture, he divided seventeen and a quarter minutes by this part, and obtained
                    the diameter required. Sir Isaac</p>
                <p>Newton has stated, that the measures thus taken are always in excess. Had Huygens
                    used long wedge-shaped slits or openings, he would by the same process have
                    obtained measures which erred in defect, and the mean between these two measures
                    would have given the true diameter of the planet.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">reticulum</hi> or fixed micrometer, composed of wires, was
                    invented and used by Cassini. It is shown in the annexed figure, where <hi
                    rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd, ef, gh,</hi> are four hairs or wires
                    intersecting each other at right angles at <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> in the
                    focus of the eye-glass, <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi><hi rend="italic">cd</hi>
                    being inclined 45° to <hi rend="italic">ef</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gk.</hi>
                    In order to find with this apparatus the differences of the right ascension and
                    declination of two stars, direct the telescope so that the first or <hi
                    rend="italic">preceding</hi> star may appear upon the wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab,</hi> and turn round the tube till that star moves along <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab.</hi> The time when this star reaches <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is carefully
                    noted, and also the time when the <hi rend="italic">following</hi> star reaches
                    the wire <hi rend="italic">ed.</hi> The interval between these times, converted
                    into degrees, is the difference of right ascension required. To find the
                    difference of their declinations, mark the time of the second or <hi
                    rend="italic">following</hi> star’s arrival at the points <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> of the oblique wires <hi rend="italic">ef,
                    gh.</hi> The half of the interval between these times is the time in which the
                    star describes the space <hi rend="italic">lm</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mk,</hi>
                    which, converted into degrees <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> is the angular distance
                    <hi rend="italic">lm,</hi> which, multiplied by the cosine of the declination of
                    the known or preceding star, gives an approximate difference, which, when
                    applied to the declination of the known star, gives the approximate declination
                    of the unknown or following star. If we now multiply the angular value of <hi
                    rend="italic">lm</hi> by the cosine of this approximate declination, we shall
                    have the correct difference of declination, which, applied to the declination of
                    the known star, will give the true declination of the unknown star.</p>
                <p>In using the above reticulum, Dr Bradley found his observations embarrassed by
                    the crossing of all the wires at <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which hid the
                    preceding star at the very point where it was required to be most distinctly
                    seen. He therefore proposed the construction shown in the annexed figure, where
                    the wires <hi rend="italic">hg, hi,</hi> intersect one another perpendicularly
                    at <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> the centre of the rings. Two slender bars of brass
                    <hi rend="italic">pg, og</hi> are fixed to the ring <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi>
                    and inclined each to the diameter <hi rend="italic">hg</hi> 26° 34', half the
                    angle of a rhomb whose greater diagonal is double of the lesser. Hence <hi
                    rend="italic">fk</hi> and <hi rend="italic">f i</hi> will be each one half of
                    <hi rend="italic">fg, hi = fg,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fm = nl</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">ik.</hi> To avoid the inconvenience of
                    turning the telescope about its axis, Dr Bradley placed the ring <hi
                    rend="italic">abc,</hi> which carries the wires or brass bars in a groove in the
                    fixed ring ABC, and, confining it laterally by three pieces of brass at A, B,
                    and C, he employed an endless screw DEF to work in a toothed rack <hi
                    rend="italic">de,</hi> fixed to the inner ring <hi rend="italic">abc.</hi> Let
                    us now suppose the telescope so directed that a star is at <hi rend="italic"
                    >f,</hi> and moving in any line <hi rend="italic">fg</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> then, by turning the milled head D, the wire/Ãwill move round/till it
                    touches the star at <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> and will then lie in the direction
                    of the star’s motion, while all other stars will move parallel to it. The mode
                    of obtaining accurate results from this apparatus will be understood<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819521?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9521-0024"/>
                    from the following description of an analogous contrivance described by
                    Lacaille.</p>
                <p>This eminent astronomer used a rhomb FMIL, the diagonals of which, FI, ML, must
                    be exactly perpendicular to one another, and as two to one. The length F was 15
                    ’ 4 lines, the angle subtended by ML 1° 25'∙5, and consequently FI 2° 50' 10",
                    as determined by the passage of several of the equatorial stars. Now, as the
                    vertical height of each triangle in the rhomb is equal to the short diagonal,
                    the path of any star passing through the field in a line parallel to that
                    diagonal will always cut off a similar triangle, and the distance of this path
                    from the common apex will have the same ratio to the vertical height of the
                    large triangle, one half FI, or ML, that the value of the diagonal in time has
                    to the observed time of the passage. Hence the time which any star takes to pass
                    from <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to Z, reduced to degrees, and multiplied by the
                    cosine of the declination, is the difference of declination required. The
                    difference of right ascension is obtained as before. With this simple apparatus,
                    Lacaille observed the comparative right ascensions and declinations of the 1942
                    stars which are given in his <hi rend="italic">Coelum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Australe</hi><hi rend="italic">Stelliferum.</hi> Lacaille constructed another
                    reticulum, in which ML was one fourth of FI.</p>
                <p>Mr Wollaston employed a reticulum similar to that shown in the annexed figure, AB
                    being the horary line, and CD the equatorial line. The four squares being within
                    the field, any of them may be used separately, so that observations made
                    successively in a pair of them will check each other as well as the principal
                    observation made in the large right-angled triangle. As the diagonals are equal
                    to one another, they afford a larger passage of a star, and thus increase the
                    accuracy of the observation.</p>

                    Nismes has proposed the reticulum shown in fig. 18, as possessing several
                    advantages over others. It consists of three wires AB, CD, AD, and the
                    equatorial one MN perpendicular to AB, CD. The arches AC, CM, MD, DB, &amp;c.
                    are all 60°. When the stars pass parallel to the equator, the angle formed at
                    the vertex A or B will be 30°, and its cotangent = √3 = 1·732; therefore,
                    calling <hi rend="italic">t</hi> the line of passage of one star from the first
                    to the second wire, and <hi rend="italic">tl</hi> that of the other star, the
                    difference of declination will be 1∙732 (∑±z <hi rend="italic">t</hi> zψz f),
                    and the difference of right ascension will be had from the times of the stars
                    passing the middle of the space between CD and AB, or the means of the times of
                    passing CD and AB. Baron Zach observes, that this reticulum requires no
                    illumination, that the values of its lines do not require to be known, and that
                    it maybe used out of exact adjustment to the parallel of declination, as the
                    corrections for such want of adjustment are easily computed.</p>
                <p>The fixed net-micrometer of Fraunhofer is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 29. The
                    vertical and oblique lines shown in the figure are cut upon glass with fluoric
                    acid or dia mond, and the plate has a circular motion in its cell. These lines
                    are illuminated by light passing through the eye-tube and falling on their cut
                    edges, so that no light passes down the tube. The lines parallel to <hi
                    rend="italic">ef</hi> are adjusted perpendicular to a circle of declination, and
                    in that position the oblique light of the lamp illuminates both the vertical and
                    inclined lines. The mutual distances both of the vertical and inclined lines are
                    known from the machine by which they were drawn, and hence the ratio of the
                    times of transit of a star from the vertical to the inclined lines will enable
                    us to determine the position of these in reference to a circle of declination.
                    “The great number of lines,” says Dr Pearson, “afford the means of making
                    several observations, which, on an average, will give right ascensions and
                    declinations equally exact, whether the differences of declination be great or
                    small. When the difference of right ascension is small, as in the case of double
                    stars, the transit of both stars cannot well be observed over the same
                    individual line, but one of them may be observed at the first, and the other at
                    the second line, alternately, till the observer is satisfied with his
                    observation; and should the network experience an alteration of position from
                    any cause, it will in all probability be detected before the computation is
                    commenced. The ingenious artist contrived an engine by which he could cut
                    straight parallel lines at distances so small as <hi rend="subscript"> τσ</hi> ½
                    <hi rend="subscript"> σπ</hi><hi rend="superscript"> un</hi> R <hi
                    rend="superscript"> s</hi> from each other, and to be crossed by other parallel
                    lines at any given angle of declination; and in the net-micrometer he formed the
                    parallel lines at such a distance from each other that the inclined intervals
                    bear the same proportion to the vertical intervals that the cosine of the angle
                    of inclination bears to radius, so that about as tnany transits will take place
                    over the inclined <hi rend="subscript"> tu</hi> as over the vertical lines. Five
                    lines only are drawn at equal distances from each other, and the sixth line,
                    including the fifth interval, is cut at the distance of one interstice and a
                    half; yet the whole value of any number of intervals may always be known,
                    provided it be noticed how many of the larger kind are included in the whole
                    number. When the cell containing the disc is attached to a revolving graduated
                    circle, the position of a line uniting two stars may also be measured, by first
                    adjusting <hi rend="italic">zero</hi> to the equatorial position of the line <hi
                    rend="italic">fg,</hi> and then turning the divided disc round till all its
                    parallels successively receive both the stars at the same instant as they pass
                    through the field, which contemporary ingresses may be effected by repeated
                    adjustments and subsequent trials, when the telescope is mounted on an
                    equatorial stand properly rectified.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Another micrometer of Fraunhofer’s is shown in Plate CCCLVI1I. fig. 30, and
                    consists of concentric circles cut upon glass, and illuminated like the
                    preceding one. The inner and smallest circle is like a dot. Other five circles
                    are seen in a telescope of fi,ve feet focal length, magnifying 110 times. With a
                    power of 63, eight circles are visible; and with the lowest power of 45, eleven
                    circular lines are visible. The observer may choose any circle he likes for
                    observing the passage of the star, avoiding those in which it would pass near
                    the centre or near the circumference. The observation, too, may be made with
                    more rings than one. The following are the dimensions of the circles in one of

                <p>Fraunhofer’s suspended annular micrometer, which is a more perfect instrument
                    than the preceding, is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 31, which represents a disc
                    of glass, having a hole in its centre a little larger than the inner diameter of
                    a metallic ring oo, turned truly in a lathe. This ring is cemented on the glass
                    disc, and when placed in the field of view of a telescope, the observer notes
                    the instants when, a star on the limb of a planet enters and emerges from each
                    side of the ring. The only data required for computing the difference of right
                    ascension and declination, are the times that an equatorial star takes to pass
                    along the internal and external diameters of the ring. The passage of stars
                    whose relative position is required, must be observed at a distance from the
                    centre, as well as from the upper edge of the ring. The formulae of Bessel for
                    using this and other circular micrometers will be found in Zach’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Monailiche Correspοndenz,</hi> vol. xvii. xxiv. and xxvi.</p>
                <p>A simple and useful fixed micrometer, proposed by Mr Cavallo, is a divided slip
                    of thin mother-of-pearl stretching across the diaphragm of the telescope, and
                    finely divided into 200ths of an inch. It is shown in Plate CCCLVIII. fig. 32,
                    crossing the diaphragm of the telescope. The value of the division maybe
                    ascertained either by measuring a bar, or by the passage of an equatorial star
                    across the field of view.</p>
                <p>In a portable telescope this micrometer is very convenient, though it has the
                    great disadvantage of shutting out the field of view. In telescopes upon stands
                    it will measure only angles in one direction, unless there is a contrivance to
                    turn it round. This micrometer has also the additional imperfection, that its
                    divisions, from being unequally distant from the eye-glass, are not all seen
                    with the same distinctness.</p>
                <p>To remove these imperfections, Sir David Brewster proposed, in 1805, the circular
                    mother-of-pearl micrometer, which is shown in Plate CCCLVIII.fig.33, where the
                    black ring which forms part of the figure is the diaphragm of the telescope, and
                    the more luminous part is an annular portion of mother-of-pearl divided on its
                    inner circumference into 360°. This divided circumference can be placed exactly
                    in the focus of the eye-glass, and all its parts seen with perfect distinctness.
                    In order to understand the use of the instrument, let Ay&gt;B be the inner edge
                    of the mother-of-pearl ring, and <hi rend="italic">mη</hi> the object to be

                <p>CHAP. IX.—DESCRIPTION OF MICROMETERS FOR MICRO</p>
                <p>SCOPES.</p>
                <p>All the micrometers above described may be adapted to compound microscopes, where
                    the eye-glass has a considerable focal length. A good micrometer, however, for
                    single microscopes, which can be used with facility, and at the same time give
                    accurate results, is still a desideratum. When the single lens is so minute, or
                    when the first lens of a microscopic doublet or triplet almost touches the
                    surface of the object, it is an extremely difficult matter to introduce any
                    scale, or any minute body of known dimensions, with which the object may be
                    compared. In some cases, when the object to be measured is minute, the seed of
                    the <hi rend="italic">lycopeτdon bovista</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >puff-ball</hi> might be introduced, its diameter being about the <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τr</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> σ</hi> th part of an inch; and
                    when the object is less minute, the seed of <hi rend="italic">lycopodium</hi>
                    may be used, its diameter being <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> ½ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π</hi> th of an inch. We may advantageously adopt, in some
                    cases, the method of Dr Jurin,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Physico-Mathematical Dissertations, p. 45.</p></note> who
                    introduced into the field small pieces of silver or brass wire, whose diameter
                    he had previously ascertained by coiling the wire round a cylinder, and
                    observing how many breadths of <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> the wire were
                    contained in a given number of inches.</p>
                <p>This method of introducing a substance of known dimensions may be carried much
                    farther. We may use all the variety of hairs and wool which have a known
                    diameter; and for this purpose Dr Young’s .tables of substances measured by the
                    eriometer will be of great use. The following are a few of them:</p>

                <p>1he distance of the fibres of the crystalline lens of fishes may also be
                    advantageously used, and also the distance of the teeth which unite the fibres.
                    For this purpose, the lens must be well dried, and perfectly hard, so that with
                    a sharp knife we can detach minute portions of any of the laminae. The thinnest
                    should be used; and as the fibres always taper to the pole, and the teeth become
                    smaller in proportion as the fibres diminish, we must determine the distance of
                    the fibres, and also those of the teeth, at both ends of the laminae, by the
                    method described by Sir David Brewster in the Philosophical Transactions for
                    1833, p. 324. The larger lined scales of moths and butterflies may also be used,
                    especially as we can measure the distance of the lines by the coloured spectra
                    which these lines produce.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>The late Mr Pond has observed, that the pale, slender, double-headed scales
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Poηtiα</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pieris brassica,</hi>
                    which taper to a point, and terminate in a brush-like appendage, are of an
                    invariable length, about⅛th of an inch.</p></note> These operations will require
                    much dexterity on the part of the observer, and they are recommended only to
                    those who cannot succeed in their measurements by other methods.</p>
                <p>An excellent method of measuring microscopic objects is to project the image of
                    the object against a divided scale, at a given distance from the eye. The scale
                    must be seen either by the same eye which is looking into the microscope, or by
                    the other eye. In the first case, the rays from the microscope will enter one
                    side of the pupil, and the rays from the divided scale the other side; the
                    aperture through which we look at the scale, and the aperture of the microscope,
                    being at a distance less than the diameter of the pupil. When the right eye
                    looks at the divided scale, the left, which looks into the microscope, will see
                    the object projected against the scale, although it has no vision of the scale
                    itself. This second method may be carried into effect in two ways. The scale may
                    form no part <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819547?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9547-0026"/> of the instrument, and may be viewed by the naked
                    eye; or it may form part of the instrument, like a binocular telescope, the left
                    eye looking into one tube, viz. the microscope, while the right eye looks into
                    another tube, in which a divided scale is magnified by an eye-lens.</p>
                <p>Dr Wollaston has constructed and used a very ingenious micrometer on the first of
                    the principles above mentioned, viz. when the object and the scale are viewed by
                    the same eye; but its use is limited to microscopes with small lenses. When the
                    lenses are larger, we have adopted another method, namely, to perforate the lens
                    with a small hole in or near the centre, or, if it is thought better, near the
                    margin of the lens. A slit extending from the margin of the lens may often be
                    executed more easily.</p>
                <p>The following is Dr Wollaston’S own description of this instrument:</p>
                <p>“This instrument,” says Dr Wollaston, “is furnished with a single lens of about
                    ⅛th of an inch focal length. The aperture of each lens is necessarily small, so
                    that when it is mounted on a plate of brass, a small perforation can be made by
                    the side of it in the brass, as near to its centre as ⅛th of an inch.</p>
                <p>“When a lens thus mounted is placed before the eye for the purpose of examining
                    any small object, the pupil is of sufficient magnitude for seeing distant
                    objects at the same time through the adjacent perforation, so that the apparent
                    dimensions of the magnified image might be compared with a scale of inches,
                    feet, and yards, according to the distance at which it might be convenient to
                    place it.</p>
                <p>“A scale of smaller dimensions, attached to the instrument, will, however, be
                    found preferable, on account of the steadiness with which the comparison may be
                    made; and it may be seen with sufficient distinctness by the naked eye, without
                    any effort of nice adaptation, by reason of the smallness of the hole through
                    which it is viewed.</p>
                <p>“The construction that I have chosen for the scale is represented in Plate
                    CCCLVIII. fig. 33. It is composed of small wires about <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> ⅛th of an inch in diameter, placed side by side so as to form a scale of
                    equal parts, which may be with ease counted by means of a certain regular
                    variation of the lengths of the wires.</p>
                <p>“The external appearance of the whole instrument is that of a common telescope
                    consisting of three tubes. The scale occupies the place of the object-glass, and
                    the little lens is situated at the smaller end, with a pair of plain glasses
                    sliding before it, between which the subject of examination is to be included.
                    This part of the apparatus is shown separately in fig. 35. It has a projection,
                    with a perforation, through which a pin is inserted to connect it with a screw,
                    represented at <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> fig. 34. This screw gives lateral
                    motion to the object, so as to make it correspond with any particular part of
                    the scale. The lens has also a small motion of adjustment, by means of the cape,
                    fig. 36, which renders the view of the magnified object distinct.</p>
                <p>“Before the instrument is completed, it is necessary to determine with precision
                    the indications of the scale, which must be different, according to the distance
                    to which the tube is drawn out. In my instrument, one division of the scale
                    corresponds to <hi rend="subscript"> τσ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> ππ</hi> th
                    of an inch when it is at the distance of 16∙6 inches from the lens; and since
                    the apparent magnitude in small angles varies in the simple inverse ratio of
                    this distance, each division of the same scale will correspond to <hi
                    rend="subscript"> y</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> π</hi> th at the distance of 8

                    The basis on which these indications were founded in this instrument was a wire,
                    carefully ascertained to be g⅜(yth of an inch in diameter, the magnified image
                    of which occupied fifty divisions of the scale when it was at the distance of
                    16∙6 inches; and hence one divi-</p>

                    estimate of this wire must pervade all subsequent measures derived from it, the
                    substance employed was pure gold drawn till fifty-two inches in length weighed
                    exactly five grains. If we assume the specific gravity of gold to be 19-36, a
                    cylindrical inch will weigh 3837 grains; and we may hence infer the diameter of
                    such a wire to be ^⅛(&gt;th of an inch, more nearly than can be ascertained by
                    any other method.</p>
                <p>“For the sake of rendering the scale more accurate, a similar method was, in
                    fact, pursued with several gold wires of different sizes, weighed with equal’
                    care; and the subdivisions of the exterior scale were made to correspond with
                    the average of their indications.</p>
                <p>“In making use of this micrometer for taking the measure of any object, it would
                    be sufficient, at any one accidental position of the tube, to note the number on
                    the outside as denominator, and to observe the number of divisions and decimal
                    parts which the subject of examination occupies on the interior scale as
                    numerator of a fraction, expressing its dimensions in proportional parts of an
                    inch; but it is preferable to obtain an integer as numerator, by sliding the
                    tube inward or outward, till the image of the wire is seen to correspond with
                    some exact number of divisions, not only for the sake of greater simplicity in
                    the arithmetical computations, but because we can by the eye judge more
                    correctly of actual coincidence than of the comparative magnitudes of adjacent
                    intervals. The smallest quantity which the graduations of this instrument
                    profess to measure, is less than the eye can really appreciate ∙ in sliding the
                    tube inward or outward. If, for instance, the object measured be really ^ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> πy</hi>, it may appear <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> θ⅛ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> π77</hi>, or -g⅛θ, in which case the doubt amounts to <hi

                    quantity. But the difference is here exceedingly small in comparison to the
                    extreme division of other instruments, where the nominal effect of its power is.
                    the same.</p>
                <p>“A micrometer with a divided eye-glass may profèss to measure as far as <hi
                    rend="subscript"> τσ</hi> ⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> ππ</hi> of an inch; but the

                <p>The micrometer microscopes used for reading off the divisions on the graduated

                <p>Notwithstanding the value of the methods described above, the want of a simple

                <p>The three measures of 1000, 2000, and 2500, have been recently given by Mr Bauer
                    himself, as the different steps which he made towards what he conceives the best
                    measure, viz. 1-2500th, which he obtained repeatedly with an improved achromatic
                    microscope. As Dr Young obtained his measure <hi rend="italic"
                    >criometrically,</hi> namely, by measuring the diameter of the first red ring
                    produced by looking through the blood at a luminous object, we cannot conceive
                    it possible that he could have committed such a mistake as to make the diameter
                    of that ring nearly <hi rend="italic">thrice as great</hi> as it should be,
                    according to Mr Bauer’s results, or more than thrice as great as the concurring
                    measures obtained by Jurin and Leewenhoeck. The only explanation we can give is,
                    that the particles of the blood must have an organized structure, or consist of
                    portions separated by lines which have the magnitude assigned by Dr Young. In
                    order to submit this explanation to the test of experiment, Sir David Brewster
                    examined the particles of blood a few minutes after it was drawn, when dried by
                    natural evaporation on a plate of glass. Each particle he found to consist of a
                    dark rim, within which is a bright circle, then a darkish central spot, which
                    spot in some globules may be resolved into a dark ring, a bright ring within
                    this, and then a small central black spot. Here, then, is the cause of Dr
                    Young’s mistake. The red ring of light which he measured in the eriometer was
                    not that which was due to the globule as a whole, but to the parts of the
                    globule. Being anxious to obtain more complete evidence of this fact, we placed
                    lycopodium powder beside the globule of blood, and found that the diameter of
                    the globules was to that of the lycopodium seed as 5 to 18. We then compared the
                    diameter of the red ring produced by the seed with the diameter of the red ring
                    produced by division on steel, in which there were 1250 to the inch, as executed
                    for us by the late Sir John Barton, and found the diameter of the seed to be the
                    697th of an inch. We compared it also with the ring produced by divisions of
                    which there were 625 to the inch, and found its diameter the 717th part of an
                    inch. The mean of these two is the 710th<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    with the recent measure of Mr Bauer.</p>

                    of disclosing the structure and laws of matter, and of making as important
                    discoveries in the infinitely minute world, as the telescope has done in that
                    which is infinitely distant.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.—ON SINGLE MICROSCOPES.</p>
                <p>A single microscope is one in which only one convex lens is used for magnifying
                    objects. The object to be examined is placed before the lens,∙in its focus; and
                    the rays which emerge from the lens after refraction are parallel, and therefore
                    give distinct vision of the object to the eye placed behind it. The simplest
                    form of the single microscope is when the lens is fitted into a rim of brass
                    furnished with a handle, and the object being held in the left hand and the lens
                    in the right, it may be examined with great correctness. If the convex lens is
                    very minute, and has a short focal length, such as from the 10th to the 100 th
                    of an inch, it cannot be conveniently used in the hand, and must therefore be
                    placed in a firm microscope stand, having a shelf for holding the object, a
                    screw or a rack and pinion for placing the object in the focus of the lens, and
                    a lens or mirror, or both, for throwing light upon the object. In this form,
                    however complex be its structure, it is still called a single microscope.</p>
                <p>A single microscope, in order to have all the perfection which art can give, must
                    consist of a <hi rend="italic">substance</hi> perfectly homogeneous, like a
                    fluid without double refraction, or any variation of density. Its <hi
                    rend="italic">figure</hi> ought to be that of a planoconvex lens, whose convex
                    surface is part of a hyperboloid, in order to correct completely the spherical
                    aberration. Its <hi rend="italic">surface</hi> should be perfectly smooth and
                    highly polished, so as not to disturb the perfection of vision; and the
                    substance of which it is made should have the <hi rend="italic">lowest
                    dispersive</hi> power. As it is a great object to obtain high magnifying powers
                    with as little convexity as possible, and a large aperture, substances with high
                    refractive and low dispersive ones are the most suitable for single lenses, such
                    as <hi rend="italic">diamond, garnet,</hi> or which have no double refraction
                    when well crystallized; or such as <hi rend="italic">ruby, sapphire, topaz,</hi>
                    &amp;c. which have double refraction. As <hi rend="italic">fluor spar</hi> has
                    the lowest <hi rend="italic">dispersive power,</hi> it might be used with great
                    advantage when high powers are not wanted, and when the diminution of colour is
                    an object.</p>
                <p>Of all the substances we have named, fluids have properties best suited for
                    single microscopes. They possess perfect homogeneity, their surfaces when made
                    into lenses are perfectly smooth, and it is possible to mould minute drops of
                    them into a form approaching to that of the hyperboloid. Their defect, however,
                    consists in their not having a high refractive power, in their want of
                    durability, and the difficulty of forming sufficiently minute lenses for
                    producing high magnifying powers. These defects, however, especially the last,
                    may be overcome by patience and experience; and in proof of this we may state,
                    that we <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819573?mode=fullsize"

                    they are made after their methods, and in the most perfect manner which the
                    methods will permit, they are of no value compared with lenses of glass when

                <p>We shall therefore proceed to describe a single microscope when fitted up in the
                    best form for observation.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Description of a Single Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>The most essential part of this instrument is the lens or lenses, upon which the
                    value of the microscope depends. The lenses are generally made of plate-glass,
                    and should have focal distances varying from the 1-10th to the 1-50th of an
                    inch. In order that the spherical aberration of these lenses may be the smallest
                    possible, the radii of their two surfaces should be as 1 to 6; the surface whose
                    radius is as 1, or the most convex side, must be turned towards the eye. The
                    lenses, thus made, are then set in the centre of the lower surface of concave
                    brass caps, a section of one of which is shown in Plate CCCLIX. fig. 1.</p>
                <p>The best mode of fitting up the microscope is that contrived by Mr Pritchard,
                    which is represented in fig. 2, on a scale about one third of its real size. It
                    is shown in an inclined position; but it may be used either in a vertical or a
                    horizontal one, according to the convenience of the observer. The body of the
                    instrument rests on a pillar <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> supported by three legs,
                    shown at α, and is connected with it by the clip <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> being
                    fixed by the pinching screw <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> Within the tube <hi
                    rend="italic">c</hi> there slides a tube Λ, connected by a screw which passes
                    through it to the triangular tube or bar <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> carrying the
                    arm <hi rend="italic">ij,</hi> into which is placed the brass cap y which
                    carries the lens. This lens is adjusted to the distinct vision of objects placed
                    on the stage <hi rend="italic">I</hi> by sliding the tube <hi rend="italic"
                    >h</hi> up or down, and a perfect adjustment is obtained by turning the milled
                    head <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> The stage <hi rend="italic">I,</hi> which carries
                    the objects, is fitted into the triangular box <hi rend="italic">r</hi> at the
                    extremity of the stem, by means of two pins, and can be removed at pleasure. The
                    spring slider-holder, for holding the sliders in which the objects are placed,
                    is fixed by a bayonet-joint into the stage; and it may be used to hold stops or
                    diaphragms for limiting the field of view. The tube above <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> represents an illuminator fixed to the slider-holder. Upon the tube <hi
                    rend="italic">c,</hi> two sockets <hi rend="italic">d, e</hi> slide with
                    sufficient spring and friction to keep them in their place. The socket <hi
                    rend="italic">d</hi> carries the reflector <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the
                    socket <hi rend="italic">e</hi> carries the condensing lens, which is not
                    inserted in the figure.</p>
                <p>A section of the stem <hi rend="italic">rck</hi> is shown in fig. 3, in order to
                    exhibit the mechanism by which the adjustment is effected. Into the box <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> screwed into the top of the stem, is fitted the triangular
                    tube <hi rend="italic">ii',</hi> which carries the arm <hi rend="italic"
                    >ij.</hi> In the lower end <hi rend="italic">i'</hi> of this triangular tube is
                    a small block with a fine screw working in it, the stem of which turns along
                    with the milled head <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> to which it is fixed. The upper
                    end of a spiral spring, shown in the figure, bears against the block <hi
                    rend="italic">i'</hi> at the bottom of the triangular tube, while its lower end
                    acts against a stop fixed within the sliding tube Λ. The method of managing,
                    illuminating, and examining opaque objects with this microscope is the same as
                    that used in the achromatic compound microscope, in the drawing of which it will
                    be more distinctly seen.</p>
                <p>The preceding instrument of Mr Pritchard’s is intended for general purposes; but
                    as the dissection of botanical and other objects is now a leading object with
                    naturalists, we shall add an account of another microscope, constructed by Mr A.
                    Ross, with much skill, for Mr W. Valentine of Nottingham, the parts of which are
                    given in considerable detail.</p>
                <p>A perspective view of this microscope is shown in Plate CCCLIX. fig. 4. It is
                    supported on a closing tripod, <hi rend="italic">aaa,</hi> whose feet can be
                    folded together, and are made of hard bell-metal, prevented from springing by
                    edge bars, as seen on the left-hand foot. A firm pillar, which rises from the
                    tripod, carries the stage <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> which is fixed on brackets,
                    to give a steady support to the hands of the operator. A capital, <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> fixed to the top of the tube by three screws, has in its
                    axis a triangular hole, into which is fitted the triangular tube/ the lower end
                    of which passes through another similar triangular tube in the piece <hi
                    rend="italic">gg,</hi> fixed to the tube. This triangular tube is made to slide
                    up and down by a fixed screw, <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> which is wrought by a
                    large milled head, o, which is most judiciously placed at the base of the
                    pillar. At the top and bottom of the triangular tube, at <hi rend="italic"
                    >g</hi> and near r, are fitted two pieces, with triangular holes through them
                    for receiving the triangular bell-metal bar ss, which moves up and down in them.
                    This bar carries the arm 10 with the lenses. It is moved up and down, so as to
                    adjust the lenses to distinct vision of the objects on the fixed stage, by the
                    rack and pinion <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> when a quick adjustment is required;
                    but when a slow and nicer adjustment is wanted, it is effected by the milled
                    head <hi rend="italic">o.</hi> A slit, <hi rend="italic">uv,</hi> is made in the
                    shaft of the pillar, to allow the neck of the small milled head <hi
                    rend="italic">t</hi> to move up and down; for when the screw is in action by the
                    large milled head <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> the triangular tube and the bar move
                    together. The triangular bar is perforated at both ends, the upper perforation
                    for receiving a conical pin, and the lower for admitting the adjusting screw to
                    preserve the length of the bar. The piece <hi rend="italic">w</hi> is removed
                    from the side of the pillar, to show the beàrings of the pinion <hi
                    rend="italic">t,</hi> which are attached to the triangular tube. The bar moves
                    1½ inch, and the tube 1½, so that we can command an elevation of 3 inches. At
                    the ingenious suggestion of Mr Solly, the screw <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> moved
                    by the milled head <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> has fifty threads in an inch, and
                    the milled head is graduated into 100 parts, for the purpose of measuring the
                    thickness of any vessel or other object in the direction of the axis of vision.
                    For this purpose the upper surface of the body is brought into distinct vision;
                    the division at which the index or pin of the tripod stands is then observed;
                    and the under surface being in like manner brought into focus by turning the
                    milled head <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> the division is again observed. The number
                    of divisions, which are each 5000ths of an inch, between these two numbers, <hi
                    rend="italic">will indicate,</hi> according to Mr Valentine, <hi rend="italic"
                    >the space through which the lens has passed, which is the diameter of a
                    vessel.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="superscript"> %</hi> This is not the case, as the refraction of the light
                    issuing from the lower side of the vessel or object is not considered. The right
                    mode is, after having observed the upper surface of an object lying upon glass,
                    remove the object, and observe the divisions when the surface of the glass is
                    seen distinctly: the difference will be the true thickness. Mr Samuel Varley is
                    said to have constructed an instrument on this principle for measuring the
                    thickness of foci of lenses; but unless he removed his lens after observing the
                    first surface, his results must have been all erroneous.</p></note></p>
                <p>In this microscope, different parts of an object may be brought into the field,
                    either by moving the stage or the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819586?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9586-0029"/> lens, a very
                    important requisite in a microscope used for the purposes of discovery. With
                    this view, the large stage <hi rend="italic">x</hi> is formed of three plates,
                    the lowest of which is fixed to the pillar by the ring 1; and,.to make it bear
                    the weight of the hands, it rests upon the strong brackets 2, 2. The under side
                    of this plate is shown in fig. 6; the middle plate, fig. 7, contains two pair of
                    dovetail slits, 3, 3 and 4, 4, the widest orifice of each being on opposite
                    sides of the plate. The dovetail pieces in 4, 4 screw into the upper side of the
                    upper plate, fig. 8, the points of the screws being shown at 4. 4 in that
                    figure, while the dovetail pieces in 3, 3 are secured to the upper side of the
                    under plate by the screws 3, 3, fig. 3. The plates are thus moved diagonally,
                    and at right angles to one another, by the adjusting screws 7 and 8. One of the
                    screws, with its ball and milled head, is shown in fig. 9. In the adjusting
                    screw 7, the ball is placed in spring couplings, and fastened to the under side
                    of the upper plate. These screws are judiciously placed, one on each side of the
                    pillar, that the hand may reach them easily and not intercept the light. By
                    turning first one screw, and then the other, or both at once, any part of the
                    object may be brought into the field.</p>
                <p>The arm for holding the lenses is shown at 10, in fig. 1 and fig. 10. A conical
                    pin projects from underneath, and fits into a hole made down the triangular bar,
                    as shown at 9, fig. 8. The lens will therefore have a circular movement in a
                    horizontal plane, and it may be placed at any point in this plane by the action
                    of the rack and pinion at 10. Hence the most complete adjustment can be obtained
                    without any motion of the stage.</p>
                <p>The elevated stage for holding the objects is shown at 11 in fig. 4 and 8. A
                    tube, 12, fig. 11, screws into the upper plate, and upon this fits the tube 11,
                    carrying the finger spring, shown in fig. 4. Objects of different thickness are
                    thus kept down upon the plates by the pins sliding in the small pipes. An
                    elevated stage is shown in fig. 12, for viewing the sides of objects without
                    disturbing them. A condensing lens, fig. 13, slides into the sockets 5 or 6; and
                    fig. 14 shows the pincers, to be applied in the same manner.</p>
                <p>The large reflector above α, fig. 8, may be removed, and any other illuminating
                    apparatus substituted. That of Dr Wollaston is shown in fig. 15, at 19. The
                    handles 18, 18 serve to move the lens up and down in the tube.</p>
                <p>The mode of attaching the body of a compound microscope is shown in fig. 16. For
                    this purpose the arm 10, fig. 4, is withdrawn, and the conical pin 20 is made to
                    fit in the same hole in the triangular bar.</p>
                <p>Mr Valentine informs us, that with this instrument he can dissect under a lens
                    ^&gt;θth of an inch focus.</p>
                <p>As the stand and apparatus now described may be used along with all single
                    microscopes, and also with what are called doublets and triplets, we shall now
                    proceed to give an account of the various improvements which the single
                    microscope has undergone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Single Microscopes made of Precious Stones.</hi></p>
                <p>The low refractive power of glass rendered it necessary, when high powers were
                    wanted, to use lenses with very short foci, and consequently with very deep
                    curves and very small diameters, so as to admit only a narrow pencil of light
                    into the eye.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster was the first person who pointed out the value of using other
                    materials for the construction of lenses; and he remarked, that no essential
                    improvement could be expected in the single microscope, unless from the
                    discovery of some transparent substance, which, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diamond,</hi> combines a high refractive with a low dispersive power. Having
                    experienced the greatest difficulty in getting a small diamond cut into a prism
                    in London, he did not conceive it' practicable to grind and polish a diamond
                    lens,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Mr Pritchard
                    informs us (see <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Journal of Science,</hi> No. 1, new
                    series, p. 149, July 1829), that Messrs Rundell and Bridge of Ludgate Hill had,
                    at the time when Mr Pritchard began his experiments, many Dutch diamond-cutters
                    at work; and that the foreman, Mr Levi, with all his men, assured him, <hi
                    rend="italic">that it was impossible</hi> to work diamonds into spherical
                    lenses. The same opinion, he adds, was also expressed by several others, who
                    were considered of standard authority in such matters. When Mr Pritchard had,
                    contrary to the expectation of many, succeeded in finishing his first lens, it
                    was examined by Mr Levi, who expressed great astonishment at it, and added, that
                    he was not acquainted with any means by which that figure could have been
                    effected.</p></note> and therefore did not put his opinion to the test of
                    experiment. He got two lenses, however, executed in Edinburgh by Mr Peter Hill,
                    an ingenious optician, the one made of ruby, and the other of garnet; and these
                    lenses he found to be greatly superior to any lenses that he had previously
                    used.</p>
                <p>Dr Goring, whose zeal and success in the improvement of microscopes has not been
                    surpassed, directed the attention of Mr Pritchard in 1824 to the passages in Sir
                    David Brewster’s Treatise on New Philosophical Instruments, respecting the value
                    of the precious stones for single microscopes; and having immediately seen their
                    full force, it was agreed that they should undertake to grind a diamond into a
                    magnifier.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Diamond Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>The history of this attempt is so interesting, that we must give it in Mr
                    Pritchard’s own words :—“For this purpose,” says he, “Dr Goring forwarded me a
                    small brilliant diamond to begin upon; and it was proposed to give it the curves
                    that in glass would produce a lens of a twentieth of an inch focus, with the
                    proportion of the radii of their surfaces as <hi rend="italic">two</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">five.</hi> This stone I ground with the proper curves, and
                    polished the flatter side, contrary to the expectations of many whose judgment
                    in these matters was thought of much weight, who predicted that the crystalline
                    structure of the diamond would not permit it to receive a spherical figure. When
                    thus far advanced, fate decreed that I should lose the stone, and my only
                    consolation was, to discover afterwards, that had it been completed, its
                    thickness and enormous refractive power would probably have caused the focus to
                    fall within the substance of the stone.</p>
                <p>“Having, however, in this experiment proved the possibility of working lenses of
                    adamant, I set about another, and selected a rose-cut diamond, in order to form
                    it into <hi rend="italic">a</hi> plano-convex lens, and thereby save a moiety of
                    the labour.</p>
                <p>“In the progress of working this stone, the heat generated by friction, in the
                    course of the abrasion of the diamond, was perpetually melting the cement
                    (shell-lac) by which the flat side was affixed to the tool, and compelled me to
                    seek some means by which it might be prevented. After several trials, I found,
                    that when a portion of finely powdered pumice-stone was mixed with the
                    shell-lac, the cement was much stronger, and less liable to melt, than any other
                    similar substance.</p>
                <p>“On thefirst of December 18241 had the pleasure of first looking through a
                    diamond microscope, and it was doubtless the first time this precious gem had
                    been employed in making manifest the hidden secrets of nature. A few days after,
                    I had polished it sufficiently to put it into the hands of Dr Goring, who tried
                    its performance on various objects, both as a single microscope and as the
                    objective of a compound. He states in a letter addressed to me, dated 3d <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819599?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9599-0030"/>
                    January 1825, ’ that it has shown the most difficult transparent objects I have
                    submitted to it ;’ and again, ‘ I can clearly perceive the amazing superiority
                    it will possess when completely finished.’ I must, however, inform my readers,
                    that we discovered in this state various flaws in the stone, in consequence of
                    which we abandoned all thought of completing it. In this condition the project
                    remained for about a year, when I determined to resume my attempts; and having
                    worked several stones into lenses, I at last succeeded in obtaining a perfect
                    one. In the course of these labours, a new though not unexpected defect appeared
                    in several lenses, which would have subverted the whole scheme, had not the
                    first diamond lens been free from it.</p>
                <p>“These lenses, instead of giving a single image like the first, gave a double or
                    triple one. This rendered them utterly useless as magnifiers, and made the
                    defects of soft and hard parts in the same stone, and the small cavities in
                    others, of comparatively trifling consequence. The images exhibited in such
                    lenses overlapped each other, but were never entirely separated, though the
                    quantity of overlapping varied in different specimens.</p>
                <p>“It was now evident that these defects arose from polarisation, though this stone
                    is described as <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> refracting single.’ I
                    subsequently learned from Dr Brewster, after I had overcome these obstacles,
                    that this property of the diamond had been observed by him, and an account of it
                    given in the Edinburgh Philosophical Transactions.<note anchored="true"

                    referring to his paper, it appears Dr Brewster found that some stones ‘
                    polarised in particular <hi rend="italic">parts,</hi> while other <hi
                    rend="italic">portions of the same stone were quite free from any trace of
                    polarity,'</hi> and thus perfectly adapted to our purpose, as had previously
                    been demonstrated in the first diamond lens.</p>
                <p>“Notwithstanding these difficulties, and the consequent expense and labour they
                    entailed on me before sufficiently experienced in working upon this refractory
                    material with certainty, I have, now the satisfaction of being able, by
                    inspection <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> to decide whether a diamond is fit
                    for a magnifier or not; and have now executed two planoconvex magnifiers of
                    adamant, whose structure is quite perfect for microscopic purposes. One of these
                    is about the twentieth of an inch focus, and is now in the possession of his
                    Grace the Duke of Buckingham; the other, in my hands, is the thirtieth of an
                    inch focus, and has consequently amplification enough for most practical
                    purposes.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Microscopic
                    Cabinet, p. 107-111.</p></note></p>
                <p>As the expense of the diamond, and the labour of working it, are very great,
                    about fifty or sixty hours being necessary to complete a diamond lens with
                    double convexity, it is of the greatest consequence to ascertain beforehand if
                    the substance of the diamond is homogeneous, that is, free from difference of
                    density or double refraction, and if it does not contain any small cavities. The
                    best way is to examine the stone, by cutting two flat faces upon it, unless it
                    is a <hi rend="italic">laske</hi> or table diamond, which always has two flat
                    faces upon it; but this labour may often be avoided by examining it when plunged
                    or held in a glass trough containing <hi rend="italic">oil of cassia,</hi> the
                    fluid which approaches nearest to it in refractive power. This will diminish all
                    the refractions at the irregular surface of the diamond, and make any internal
                    imperfections as easily seen as if its substance was plate-glass.</p>
                <p>By comparing the indices of refraction of diamond and glass, it may be easily
                    shown that the same magnifying power may be obtained with a <hi rend="italic"
                    >diamond</hi> lens having its curvature with a radius of 8, as with a <hi
                    rend="italic">glass</hi> lens, the radius of whose curvature is 3; and as the
                    spherical aberration increases with the depth of curvature or the thickness of
                    the lens, a lens of diamond will bear a much larger aperture than one of glass
                    before indistinctness of vision is produced. Mr Pritchard has given a very
                    useful ocular representation of the relative value of a diamond and a glass
                    lens. In the annexed figure, G is the section of a semi-lens of glass, and D the
                    section of one of dia mond, so placed that their principal focus F shall be at
                    the same point. In the diamond semi-lens the marginal rays will intersect the
                    axis at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and in the glass semi-lens at <hi
                    rend="italic">g;</hi> the longitudinal aberration being &lt;7F in the <hi
                    rend="italic">diamond,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gF</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">glass</hi> lens.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain a numerical increase of these aberrations, Mr Pritchard
                    computed them from the formula, and found that of the diamond lens to be ^ths of
                    its own thickness, that of the glass lens being½ths of its thickness; and by
                    taking the thickness of the diamond lens to be 255, while that of the glass is
                    758, he obtained ⅞ths of 255= 108, and ½ths of 758 = 884, and hence it follows
                    that <hi rend="italic">the actual aberration of a</hi><hi rend="italic
                    smallcaps"> diamond</hi><hi rend="italic">lens is only about one ninth of the
                    aberration of a</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> glass</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lens</hi> of the same power and aperture.</p>
                <p>If we suppose the diamond lens to be ground on the same tool with the glass lens,
                    so as to have the same curvature, the same thickness, and the same diameter, the
                    longitudinal aberration of the diamond will be to that of the glass lens as 43
                    is to 117, or nearly one third of it; and if we suppose the focal length of both
                    to be⅛th of an inch, the magnifying power of the diamond lens will be 2133,
                    while that of the glass one will be only 800. In order that a lens of glass may
                    have the same magnifying power as that of the diamond above mentioned, its focal
                    distance would require to be only the 200th part of an inch.</p>
                <p>The durability of the diamond lens is also another valuable property, which
                    allows it to be burnished into a disc of metal, and taken out and cleaned
                    without any danger of being scratched. In treating of microscopic doublets and
                    achromatic microscopes, we shall have occasion to recur again to the diamond
                    lens.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sapphire Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>The ruby and the sapphire are the same substance, differing only in colour. Mr
                    Pritchard has, with his usual success, executed many lenses of sapphire, which,
                    though inferior to those of diamond, are vastly superior to the best executed
                    lenses of glass. When a double convex lens of sapphire and one of plate-glass
                    are ground to the same focus, so as to have the same aperture and magnifying
                    power, their relative curvatures are as 5 to 3, and their thicknesses as shown
                    in the annexed figure, where A is the section of a semi-lens of sapphire, whose
                    focus is at F, and B a section of a semilens of glass, having its focus at the
                    same point. This figure points out in the clearest manner another advantage of
                    using the precious stones in place of glass. In small lenses of glass, the
                    thickness of the glass is such that there is no room between its anterior
                    surface and the object for the admission of instruments for dissection, and not
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819612?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9612-0031"/>
                    even for the thinnest plate of glass, so that it is impossible to use glass
                    lenses of small foci in viewing objects placed in glass sliders. If the
                    preceding figure represents lenses with a focus of ⅛th of an inch, the distance
                    of the glass lens B from F will be little more than <hi rend="subscript">
                    π</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of an inch, which is less than the
                    thinnest glass.</p>
                <p>In using the <hi rend="italic">Sapphire</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ruby,</hi> or
                    any precious stone which refracts doubly, such as <hi rend="italic">zircon,
                    topaz,</hi> &amp;c. for lenses, we are exposed to a very serious defect, arising
                    from the duplication of minute lines, in consequence of the double refraction of
                    these crystals. In order to remedy this defect, the optician endeavours to cut
                    the stone so that the axis of the lens may coincide with the axis of double
                    refraction. This, howevêr, is a difficult task; and, even if it were
                    accomplished, we should not get rid entirely of the duplication of the images,
                    as in all double convex lenses, as well as in plane convex lenses with the plane
                    side turned to the object, the rays cannot pass through the lens in parallel
                    directions, and therefore must suffer double refraction, however small. It may
                    be reduced, however, to the smallest possible amount, and even to nothing, for
                    pencils of rays diverging from a point in the axis, by making the lens
                    plano-convex, and turning the plane side to the eye, as in the annexed figure,
                    where rays issuing from F, and entering the eye parallel at E, must pass through
                    the lens AB in parallel directions, suffering all their refraction at the first
                    or curved surface of the lens. By adopting this form and position of the lens,
                    we, however, lose more than we gain; for the lens is placed in the position
                    which gives a maximum spherical aberration. When the magnifying power is not
                    very high, the residual double refraction is not injurious; and in proof of this
                    we may state, that we have in our possession a double convex lens of sapphire,
                    executed by Mr Pritchard, which exhibits minute objects with the greatest beauty
                    and precision. The only way, therefore, is to employ precious stones, such as
                    the <hi rend="italic">diamond,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">garnet,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">spinelle ruby,</hi> which have no double refraction when their
                    crystallization has been regularly effected.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Garnet and Spinelle Ruby Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>The garnet is superior in its structure to the spinelle ruby, and the best and
                    purest which we have seen is that which is brought from Greenland, and has a
                    slight tinge of purple. We have used lenses made of this substance by Mr Hill,
                    Mr Adie, Mr Blackie, and Mr Veitch, all of which exhibit minute objects with
                    admirable accuracy and precision; and we can state with confidence, that we have
                    never experienced the slightest inconvenience from the colour of the garnet,
                    which diminishes with its thickness, and consequently disappears almost wholly
                    in very minute lenses.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Single Fluid Microscopes.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Stephen Gray long ago proposed to construct single microscopes with drops of
                    water, which he lifted up with a pin, and deposited in a small hole made in a
                    piece of brass. The drop retained a sort of imperfect sphericity, and showed
                    objects with some distinctness; but it is obvious that the very weight of the
                    drop destroyed its spherical form, even if it had not been disturbed by minute
                    irregularities on the circumference of the aperture in which it was placed.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster long ago constructed fluid lenses in a different manner, so as
                    to avoid the irregularities above mentioned. He placed minute drops of very pure
                    turpentine varnish, and other viscid fluids, on plates of thin and parallel
                    glass. By this means he formed plano-convex lenses of any focal length; and by
                    dropping the varnish on both sides, he formed double convex lenses, with their
                    convexities in any required proportion. By freeing the glass carefully from all
                    grease with a solution of soda, the margin of these lenses was beautifully
                    circular; and the only effect of gravity, which diminishes with the viscidity of
                    the fluid and with the smallness of the drop, is to elongate the lower lens and
                    flatten the upper one. These lenses were found to answer well as the
                    object-glasses of compound microscopes.</p>
                <p>After experiencing’the extreme difficulty of obtaining precious stones free of
                    double refraction or difference of density, and from little cavities and
                    imperfections, as well as the difficulty of giving their surfaces a perfect
                    polish and a correct figure, Sir David Brewster has, we understand, recently
                    made an extended series of experiments on the formation of minute fluid lenses,
                    which should equal in power and distinctness those made of precious stones. The
                    primary difficulty which was encountered in this attempt was that of depositing
                    a sufficiently minute drop of fluid upon a surface of glass. This arose from two
                    causes, from the difficulty of taking up on the slenderest fibre a minute
                    globule of a fluid of any moderate tenacity, and the still greater difficulty of
                    overcoming its adhesion to the fibre, and laying a portion of it on glass. The
                    first of these difficulties he overcame by a suitable mixture of two fluids, and
                    the second by a mechanical process. Having thus succeeded in obtaining lenses
                    too small to be recognised distinctly by the eye, he next endeavonred.to make
                    their figure approximate to the hyperbolic form when the lenses were not of the
                    smallest size, and the results which he obtained were far beyond his
                    expectation. Some of these lenses preserved their perfection for more than a
                    year, and if protected from dust might have been kept much longer. If fluids
                    could be obtained of a high refractive power, and not of a volatile nature,
                    microscopes of extreme perfection might thus be readily constructed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Catadioptric Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>A single lens, by which light is both refracted and reflected, seems at first
                    sight to be something paradoxical. Such a lens, however, which was proposed and
                    used by Sir David Brewster, is shown in the annexed figure, where ABC is a
                    hemispherical plano-convex lens, which, if we use it in the common way, will
                    have a certain magnifying power; but if we use it as shown in the figure, it
                    acts as a double convex lens of the same radius, and has consequently twice the

                    at an angle of 45°, not a ray of it will be lost, as it suffers total
                    reflection. The lens thus used has less spherical aberration than when used as a
                    whole, ABC, and there is no error from imperfect centring. This lens may be used
                    as the object-glass of a compound microscope; and it will be seen in another <pb

                <p><hi rend="italic">The Grooved Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>This lens derives its name from its having a deep groove cut round it in the
                    plane of a great circle perpendicular to the axis of vision. Sir David Brewster
                    was led to its construction by the doublet of Dr Wollaston, which will be
                    described in another section. It consists of a spherical lens or sphere, with a
                    deep concave groove cut round it, so as to cut off the marginal pencils, and
                    thus give a wider field and a more perfect image. It is represented in the
                    annexed figure, where AB CD is a sphere of glass, having the unshaded parts
                    below AC and above BD cut away, in order to prevent rays that fall very
                    obliquely from reaching the eye. The central thickness of the lens may be made
                    so small as to render the spherical and even the chromatic aberration almost
                    insensible. As all the pencils pass through the centre, every part of the image
                    will be equally distinct; a property possessed by no other lens whatever.</p>
                <p>Mr Coddington,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil.
                    Trans. 1830, part i. p. 69-84.</p></note> who entertains a high opinion of the
                    value of this lens, observes: “Besides all this, another advantage appears in
                    practice to attend this construction, which I did not anticipate, and for which
                    I cannot now at all account. I have stated, that when a pencil of rays is
                    admitted into)the eye, which, having passed without deviation through a lens, is
                    bent by the eye, the vision is never free from the coloured fringes produced by
                    eccentrical dispersion. Now with the sphere I certainly do not perceive this
                    defect, and I therefore conceive that if it were possible to make the spherical
                    glass on a very minute scale, it would be <hi rend="italic">the most perfect

                    as its use extends, its only defects being the very small field of view, and the
                    impracticability of applying it, except to transparent objects seen by
                    transmitted light. Now the sphere has this advantage, that whereas it makes <hi
                    rend="italic">a very good simple microscope, it is more peculiarly</hi> fitted
                    for the object-glass of a compound instrument, since it gives a perfectly
                    distinct image of any required extent, and that, when combined with a proper
                    eye-piece, it may without difficulty be employed for opaque objects.” We do not
                    rightly apprehend the exact import of these observations. Mr Coddington
                    distinctly asserts that the grooved sphere is the most perfect simple
                    microscope, or the most perfect microscope with one lens; and yet he says in the
                    next paragraph that it is only “a very good simple microscope,” being “more
                    peculiarly fitted for a compound instrument.”</p>
                <p>With regard to the difficulty of making it on a small scale, it is by no means
                    great; for if we can grind and polish its two surfaces, we may readily excavate
                    it round its margin. We have now before us a grooved sphere of garnet ^⅛th of an
                    inch radius, executed by Mr Blackie: The focus is almost close to the lens,
                    which in many kinds of observation is a great advantage, and its performance is
                    remarkably fine.</p>
                <p>It will be seen in our article on <hi rend="smallcaps">Optics,</hi> that when the
                    refractive inde*x of a sphere exceeds 2∙000, its focus falls within the sphere.
                    Hence a grooved sphere made of diamond is useless. When made with garnet, it is
                    invaluable, and its focus is just thrown so near its surface, that i the objects
                    may be laid upon its surface, or pressed against it by a concave surface of the

                <p>The crystalline lens of minnows and small. fishes may ( be taken out of the eye
                    in a state of such perfection, that, 1 when used as single microscopes, they
                    give a very perfect &lt; image of minute objects. In such lenses which have an
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> increasing density towards their centre, the
                    spherical aberration is almost wholly corrected. Great care, however, must be
                    taken to make the axis of the lens the axis of vision, to prevent its form from
                    being injðred by pressure against the aperture which holds it. The best way is
                    to make a ring at the end of a piece of wire, having its diameter a little
                    greater than that of the lens. A ring of viscid fluid is then made to line the
                    ring of wire, and the lens is suspended in the ring of fluid, some of the fluid
                    encroaching upon its anterior or posterior surface.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Magnifying Forcer of Single Microscopes.</hi></p>
                <p>Having thus described the various kinds of single microscopes, we shall now
                    consider the subject of their magnifying power. When an eye in the prime of
                    life, and neither long nor short sighted, views the minutest object which it can
                    recognise, it will generally place it at the distance of about five inches. When
                    the same object is viewed through a single microscope, the distance at which it
                    is seen is equal to the focal length of the lens; and as the apparent magnitude
                    of objects is inversely as the distances at which they are seen, we have only to
                    divide the distance five inches by the focal length of the lens, in order to
                    know its magnifying power, or its apparent magnitude when seen through the
                    lens.</p>
                <p>The following table shows the magnifying power of lenses of all focal lengths,
                    from 5 inches up to the 100th of an inch, and is applicable to all lenses, of
                    whatever substance they are made.</p>

                <p>We have already mentioned the advantages which the precious stones have over
                    glass ones, in having a much less spherical aberration. In order that a glass
                    lens may have the least spherical aberration, its radii of curvature must be as
                    one to six, the flattest side being turned to the object; but this is not the
                    case with bodies of a different refractive power. Mr Coddington, in his valuable
                    Treatise on the Reflection and Refraction of Light,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Page 111, Cambridge, 1829.</p></note> has
                    computed the ratio of the curves when the aberration is a minimum for various
                    indices of refraction from 1∙5 up to 2O, and the amount of the aberration itself
                    in parts of the thickness of the lens. This table is very important in a
                    practical point of view, as will be seen from the observations which follow
                    it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Table showing the Spherical Aberration of Lenses of Glass and
                    the Precious Stones, and the proper proportion of their Radii when the
                    Aberration is a Minimum.</hi></p>
                <p>It appears from the preceding table, that when the refractive index is between
                    1∙4 and 1∙6 and a little more, but less than 1∙7, the second surface of the
                    double convex lens must be <hi rend="italic">convex,</hi> in order to have the
                    least spherical aberration; but that when the index is above 1 <hi

                    rend="italic">concave,</hi> in order to make the aberration a minimum, and this
                    concavity, in the case of zircon and sulphur, is so much as — 5, so that in
                    diamond it must be nearly — 3; so that we must sacrifice a great deal of
                    magnifying power in order to obtain this advantage in diamond; but the sacrifice
                    will be well bestowed, for such a lens will be almost wholly free of spherical
                    aberration. It appears from the table, that when the index of refraction is a
                    little less than l∙7, a plano-convex lens, with its plane side turned to the
                    object, is the best form for a single microscopè.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the difficulty of the task, we would earnestly direct the
                    attention of artists to the subject of grinding plano-convex lenses of a
                    hyperbolic form for single microscopes. The smallness of a lens must increase
                    the difficulty; but in this case the effect may be accidentally obtained, as it
                    is often done in giving a parabolic and an elliptical form to specula. Mr Potter
                    has given, and put to the test of experiment, a method of obtaining any curve
                    derived from revolution, by giving a particular form to the grinding and
                    polishing tools.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>CHAP. II.—DESCRIPTION OF MICROSCOPIC DOUBLETS AND TRIPLETS.</p>
                <p>Under this chapter we propose to describe all combinations of lenses in which two
                    or more are placed in contact, or at such a distance that no image is formed
                    between them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Wollaston's Periscopic Doublet.</hi></p>
                <p>The earliest proposal of a doublet lens was that which Dr Wollaston described in
                    1812,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1812,
                    p. 375.</p></note> under the name of a periscopic microscope. The following is
                    his own description of it: “The great desideratum,” says he, “in employing high
                    magnifiers, is sufficiency of light; and it is accordingly expedient to make the
                    aperture of the little lens as large as is consistent with distinct vision. But
                    if the object to be viewed is of such magnitude as to appear under an angle of
                    several degrees on each side of the centre, the requisite distinctness cannot be
                    given to the whole surface by a common lens, in consequence of the confusion
                    occasioned by oblique incidence of the lateral rays, excepting by means of a
                    very small aperture, and proportionable dimi nution of light. In order to remedy
                    this inconvenience, I conceived that the perforated metal which limits the
                    aperture of the lens might be placed with advantage in its centre; and
                    accordingly I procured two plano-convex lenses ground to the same radius, and
                    applying their plane surface on opposite sides of the same aperture, in a thin
                    piece of metal (as is represented by a section, fig. 6), I produced the desired
                    effect, having virtually a double convex lens, so contrived that the passage of
                    oblique pencils was at right angles with its surface, as well as the central
                    pencil. With a lens so constructed, the perforation that appeared to give thς
                    most perfect distinctness was about <hi rend="italic">one-fifth</hi> part of the
                    focal length in diameter; and when such an aperture is well centred, the visible
                    field is at least as much as 20* in diameter. It is true, that a portion of
                    light is lost by doubling the number of surfaces; but this is more than
                    compensated by the greater aperture which, under these circumstances, is
                    compatible with distinct vision.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Periscopic Sphere.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding passage Dr Wollaston describes only a double convex periscopic
                    microscope, consisting of two plano-convex lenses; but he does not take the case
                    where these two lenses are hemispheres, and, consequently, where the doubly
                    convex one which they form is a sphere. When the lenses are not hemispheres, the
                    pencils are not centrical, and the rays from different parts of the object do
                    not each suffer the same species of refraction as they do when passing through a
                    sphere, so that every part of the field is not equally distinct. It is obvious
                    also that Dr Wollaston did not think of filling up the central aperture<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819651?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9651-0034"/>
                    with a fluid of the same refractive power as the lens, in order to remove the
                    loss of light from the double number of surfaces, which he mentions as a defect
                    in his microscope.</p>
                <p>The construction of a periscopic sphere proposed by Sir David Brewster combines
                    these two properties. The lenses, whether they are hemispherical or not, must be
                    so placed that their convex surfaces form part of the same sphere, as shown in
                    the annexed figures.</p>
                <p>In fig. 7, the plano-convex lenses AB, CD may be cemented to a piece of plate
                    glass <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> of such a thickness in one direction as to
                    complete the sphere, and of such a diameter in the direction <hi rend="italic"
                    >mu</hi> as to form a suitable contraction of the aperture.</p>
                <p>In fig. 8, the space between the lenses may be filled up, as in the figure, by
                    two pieces of plate-glass ArønB, C≡D, between which is a plate of brass, or of
                    thin black paper, containing a suitable aperture in the centre of the lenses.
                    Here there are <hi rend="italic">six</hi> surfaces within the sphere, but, by
                    uniting them with a proper cement, the whole becomes a single sphere, in which
                    there is no perceptible loss of light.</p>
                <p>In fig. 9, lenses of unequal size and thickness are combined, either with a plate
                    of glass, or a fluid between them of the same refractive power as the glass, and
                    the apertures may be placed on the plane surfaces AB, CD.</p>
                <p>In fig. 10, two convex lenses may be combined into a sphere, the intermediate
                    portion being filled up with a fluid of the same refractive power. This may be
                    readily done by cementing each lens on the end of a brass or glass tube <hi
                    rend="italic">ab,</hi> and introducing the fluid by an aperture.</p>
                <p>In uniting these lenses, it is obviously necessary that the convex outer surfaces
                    should be exactly of the same curvature, and of the same kind of glass. The best
                    way of effecting this is to grind a thick lens ABC, either greater or less than
                    a hemisphere, and then to bisect it at AD, and out of the portions ADB, ADC to
                    form two plano-convex or two double convex lenses AB, CD. The outer surfaces of
                    these two lenses will belong accurately to the same sphere. The perfect
                    similarity of the inner surfaces is of less consequence, as all refraction by
                    them is removed by the cement.</p>
                <p>By these different steps Sir David Brewster was led to the idea of the grooved
                    sphere, or the lens already described under the head of single microscopes, in
                    which the aperture is contracted by excavating the sphere all round in one of
                    its great circles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Periscopic Achromatic Spheres.</hi></p>
                <p>If, in the construction shown in fig. 12, in place of making the fluid <hi
                    rend="italic">op</hi> of the same refractive and dispersive power as the two
                    lenses, we make it such as to correct the colour of these lenses, we shall
                    obtain an achromatic sphere, as proposed by Sir David Brewster; and the compound
                    lens may be still farther improved as a microscope, by attaching, either by
                    cement or not to the back of the first lens AB, a convex speculum of silver or
                    steel for illuminating the object, the contracted aperture being the hole in the
                    centre of the speculum. The concave fluid lens is shown at <hi rend="italic"
                    >op</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and such a curvature must be given to the

                    lenses (double convex ones), in opposite positions, a concave lens of a medium
                    more highly dispersive than that of the lenses, adjusting the curvatures so that
                    the outer surfaces of the crossed lenses shall be portions of the same sphere,
                    and that the interior surfaces shall exactly fit into each other.</p>
                <p>“In such a system, we may consider the effect to be the same as that of an entire
                    sphere of the same medium as the two lenses diminished by that of a concave lens

                    investigated with care till Sir John Herschel took up the subject in 1821. The

                <p>“Whether we ought or ought not,’’ says Sir John, “to aim at the rigorous
                    destruction of rays parallel to the axis, the use to which the lens is to be
                    applied must decide. In a burning-glass it is of the highest importance. A
                    slight consideration will suffice to show, that the difference of temperatures
                    produced in the foci of a double convex lens of equal radii, and one of the same
                    focal length, but of the best form, must be very considerable. In order to try
                    whether even the latter might not be improved by the shortening of the focus,
                    and the superior concentration of the exterior rays, by applying a correcting
                    lens of one of the forms above calculated, in spite of the loss of heat in
                    passing through a second glass, I procured two lenses to be figured to the radii
                    assigned in the first column of the foregoing table. They were about three
                    inches in aperture, and when combined as above described, the aberration was
                    almost totally destroyed, and probably would have been so completely had the
                    index of refraction proper to the glass been employed instead of that adopted in
                    our calculation for brevity. Their combined effect as a burning-lens appeared to
                    me decidedly superior to that of the first lens used alone, and there is
                    therefore good reason to presume, that the effect of the other construction,
                    which, with the same loss of heat, affords a much greater contraction of the
                    focus, would be still better; and I regret not having tried it in
                    preference.</p>

                <p>Mr Pritchard informs us, that he has executed some of these doublets for the
                    object-glasses of compound microscopes, “for which,” he says, “they answer
                    remarkably well, but their angle of aperture is small compared with combinations
                    of double achromatics.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>We owe also to Sir John Herschel the construction of a periscopic doublet with a
                    very large field of moderate distinctness. “In spectacles,” says he,
                    “reading-glasses, magnifiers of moderate power, and eye-glasses for certain
                    astronomical purposes, the correction of the aberration in the centre of the
                    field may be sacrificed with little inconvenience. By far the best periscopic
                    combination I am acquainted with consists of a double convex lens of the best
                    form, but placed in its worst position (radii as 6 to 1) for the lens next the
                    eye, and a plane concave whose focal length is to that of the other as 2∙6 to 1,
                    or as 13 to 5, placed in contact with its flatter surface, and having its
                    concavity towards the object, as in the annexed figure, for the farthest; yet
                    for destroying the aberration of rays parallel to the axis nothing can be
                    worse.</p>
                <p>In fact our formula gives for the aberration in this construction 22∙02, or about
                    22 times what the best single lens of equal power would give; yet, on
                    accidentally combining two such lenses in this manner, I was immediately struck
                    with the remarkable extent of oblique vision, with the absence of fatigue on
                    reading some lines with a power much beyond that of the natural eye, and with
                    the freedom from colour at the edges of the field, arising from <hi
                    rend="italic">the opposition of the prismatic refractions</hi> of the two
                    solids, an advantage which a single meniscus does not possess.” The focal length
                    of the compound lens which Sir John tried was 1 ’ 84 of an inch. The field of
                    tolerably distinct vision extended fully 40° from the axis, and the letters of a
                    book might be read, and the forms of objects distinguished, with management, as
                    far as the 75th degree. In using such a combination the lenses should be very
                    thin, and the eye applied as close as possible.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Plano-Convex Doublet.</hi></p>
                <p>A doublet of much simpler construction, and withits spherical aberration greatly
                    diminished, has also been proposed by Sir John Herschel. It is represented in
                    the annexed figure, and consists of. two convex lenses of equal focal lengths,
                    the convex sides being placed in contact, and the eye and object opposite the
                    plane sides. In this case the aberration will be only 0∙6028. But if we make the
                    focal length of the first to that of the second as 1 to 2∙3, the aberration will
                    be reduced to 0 ’ 2481. In order to have an idea of the value of such a doublet,
                    we shall give the series of aberrations for single lenses, as investigated by
                    Sir John Herschel.</p>

                <p>As these calculations are made for glass, the advantage of such a doublet made of
                    garnet or sapphire must be much greater. In a garnet the minimum aberration
                    takes place when the form of the lens differs very little from that of
                    plano-convex; and as it is then to that of glass as 35 to 107, the aberration
                    will be only about 0 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 08, or next to

                <p>The advantage of the first lens having its plane side next the object is, as Dr
                    Wollaston states, that if it should touch a fluid, the view is not only not
                    impaired, but improved, whereas a double convex lens would require to be taken
                    out and cleaned. The following excellent observations on this doublet are made
                    by Pritchard.</p>
                <p>s “Having mounted some plano-convex lenses of the relative foci named by Dr
                    Wollaston, in such a manner that the distances might be varied at pleasure, I
                    was surprised to find, that after the doublet was adjusted <hi rend="italic">by
                    trial,</hi> so as to obtain the maximum of distinctness, the distance between
                    the lenses did not accord either with the rule given by Huygens,or that of Dr
                    Wollaston. Supposing that I had not got the combination intended by Dr
                    Wollaston, I procured several doublets made by different artists, and to my
                    astonishment found they agreed with my own, and therefore presumed the doctor
                    was mistaken in the distance by the thickness of the lenses and the minuteness
                    of the space between them. The distance which appeared to me essential to obtain
                    the best effect, <hi rend="italic">is the difference of the focal length of the
                    two lenses, making a proper allowance for their thickness.</hi> The proportion
                    of the foci of the two lenses may be varied <hi rend="italic">ad libitum.</hi>
                    All that is requisite in this respect is, that the difference must be greater
                    than the thickness of the anterior lens, while it may be observed (in high
                    powers), that the greater the difference between their two focal lengths, the
                    more space will be left in front; and as this is of great practical importance,
                    they should never be less than as 1 to 3. I have made some very good ones,
                    differing as much as 1 to 6. Another advantage resulting from attending to this
                    point is, that we do not lose so much magnifying power in such combinations as
                    when the difference between the lenses is less.</p>
                <p>“The delicacy and beauty with which these doublets exhibit the structure of
                    tissues will justify my entering into some minute details respecting them. The
                    following is necessary to ensure their goodness.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">First,</hi> The convex surface of each
                    lens must be <hi rend="italic">truly spherical.</hi> If this is not obtained, it
                    will be in vain to procure a good doublet, however beautifully the lenses may be
                    polished, or accurately adjusted. From this circumstance, I have found globules
                    perform very well, providing they are free from air-bubbles, which, however, is
                    rarely the case. It should be observed, that a slight scratch on their surface
                    is trifling compared to air-bubbles; for the latter not only stop the light,
                    but, by the reflection around the edges of each bubble, produce considerable fog
                    or glare. <hi rend="italic">Second,</hi> The distance between the lenses is the
                    next point of importance; its adjustment is best accomplished by trial, mounting
                    the lenses in such a manner that their distance can be varied at pleasure, and
                    capable of being turned round, so as to adjust the centring. When this is
                    obtained, they should be fixed so that their distance and position cannot be
                    altered. This it is necessary to regard, as I have sometimes spent whole days in
                    re-adjusting a doublet that had been separated to examine the lenses singly. <hi
                    rend="italic">Third,</hi> The stop or diaphragm, for limiting the aperture in
                    these combinations, should be placed immediately behind the anterior lens. From
                    the difference of the situation of this stop in the various doublets I have
                    examined, it will appear that their makers did not know that the field of view
                    depended upon the plane of the stop. I have found, that when the stop is
                    situated <hi rend="italic">close</hi> behind the anterior lens, no other is
                    required, and the field is enlarged without sensibly augmenting the aberration.
                    On this account, the lenses of the finest doublet, when used singly with the
                    same aperture as combined, has so much aberration and distortion that distinct
                    vision cannot be obtained, even with the most rigid adjustment of the focus.
                    From the difficulty of procuring a flat surface, some makers have worked the
                    anterior surface of the lens next the object concave: these lenses do not
                    possess any advantage in point of performance, not even to compensate for the
                    loss of power from the negative side.”</p>
                <p>Mr Pritchard remarks, that when the lens next the object is a jewel, the
                    performance of the doublet is improved; but that he has not observed any
                    advantage when both lenses are gems. This must be a mistake; for lenses of any
                    gem, that are superior to glass ones when acting singly, must, if suitably
                    combined, be superior also when united. In proof of this, we have a garnet
                    doublet before us, executed by Mr Blackie, the performance of which, is quite
                    remarkable. The lenses are made of Elie garnets, and their convex sides are
                    placed towards each other. The radius of the smallest lens near the object is
                    <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi> ⅛th <hi rend="italic">{one seventieth}</hi> of an
                    inch, and that of the other g⅛th <hi rend="italic">{one twentieth} of</hi> an
                    inch. Its magnifying power is very high, exceeding greatly that of the
                    semi-jewel doublet made by Mr Pritchard, with a sapphire lens ∙ <hi
                    rend="subscript"> s</hi> ⅛th <hi rend="italic">{one sixtieth}</hi> of an inch
                    focus, combined with a glass lens -∣⅜th <hi rend="italic">{one tenth}</hi> of an
                    inch focus.</p>
                <p>In the experiments to which we have already referred on fluid lenses, Sir David
                    Brewster has constructed doublets, one of the lenses of which is made of glass
                    or a precious stone, and the other a fluid one, and he has been enabled to
                    increase the power of any single lens by the addition of a fluid one, till the
                    object touches the anterior surface of the object-lens. He has also made fluid
                    spheres contracted in the middle, and fluid doublets in which the centring is
                    effected by an infallible process.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Pritchard</hi><hi rend="italic">'s</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Triplet.</hi></p>
                <p>Upon the same principle as the doublets, Mr Pritchard has constructed triplets,
                    the third or posterior lens having a longer focal length than the two others.
                    This combination requires much more precision in the adjustment, and more
                    attention in the centring. Mr Pritchard remarks, that, “when perfected, they
                    amply repay the pains bestowed upon them, in the accuracy with which they
                    exhibit the most difficult lined objects, though it is to be regretted that
                    neither these nor the doublets of deep power will show pleasantly cylindrical
                    bodies of large diameter, such as a large mouse or bat’s hair.” Having long made
                    use of one of Mr Pritchard’s triplets, we can amply confirm the account which he
                    has given of the excellence of this combination. MrBlackiehas executed for us a
                    triplet, the centre lens of which is garnet, the posterior one of quartz, and
                    the anterior one of flat glass. It is a very powerful combination, and performs
                    admirably.</p>
                <p>Sir David Brewster has made triplets in which two of the lenses are fluids and
                    the third a solid, and some inwhich they are all fluids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Single Achromatic Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>In many of the doublets which we have already described, the chromatic aberration
                    is partially, and sometimes greatly corrected, but still not to such a degree as
                    to entitle<pb break="no" facs="nls:193819690?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9690-0037"/> them to the name of achromatic. The great
                    improvement which has taken place in the art of grindino∙ and polishing small
                    lenses, has enabled the optician to execute <hi rend="italic">double</hi> and

                    size with an angle of aperture of 65°. These lenses may be advantageously used
                    where very high powers are not required, or when they cannot be applied, though
                    it is usual to employ them as the object-glasses of compound microscopes, as we
                    shall afterwards see.</p>

                    metallic speculum of a short focal length, so that any minute body placed in its
                    focus will be seen magnified. The form of the speculum should of course be
                    parabolic. Such a microscope is principally useful for looking at one’s own eye,
                    or any part of it not far from the pupil. In these cases no image is formed, as
                    the rays enter the eye parallel.</p>

                    rubbed with it the inner circle of the ring A, so as to give it a mercurial

                    the ball of the finger, it will adhere to the ring, and when cleansed with a

                    supported by the base D. A stage, ECFG, may be moved up and down, so as to place

                <p>CHAP. II.—ON COMPOUND MICROSCOPES.</p>
                <p>A compound microscope is an instrument in which a distinct and enlarged image of
                    an object is formed by an object-glass or a speculum, and this enlarged image
                    again magnified by one or more eye-glasses.</p>
                <p>There is every reason to believe, that the earliest compound microscopes, which
                    were used by Jansen and Galileo, consisted of a convex lens for an object-glass,
                    and a concave one for an eye-glass, like the telescope which was at that time in
                    use.</p>
                <p>Fontana in 1646 used <hi rend="italic">two</hi> convex lenses; Dr Hooke <hi

                    convex sides towards each other, to give a high power and a large and flat
                    field. In 1691 Philip Bonnani<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    added to it an illuminating apparatus with two lenses.'</p>
                <p>The reflecting compound microscope was first suggested by Sir Isaac Newton, and
                    its construction varied and made more complex by Dr Barker and Dr Smith of
                    Cambridge. The simple contrivance of Sir Isaac has in modern times been greatly
                    improved by Amici, Potter, Tulley, Cuthbert, and Dr Goring, whose labours in
                    improving the microscope have been indefatigable, arid in the highest degree
                    successful. An account of these improvements will be given in this chapter.</p>
                <p>%</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Compound Refracting Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>The principle of the compound microscope with two lenses will be understood from
                    the annexed figure, where MN is a minute object placed in the focus of the
                    objectglass AB, or rather a little farther from it than its principal focus. An
                    image of this objectwill be formed atwm, at some distance behind AB, the
                    distance nA increasing as AM diminishes. The size of the image <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> will be to that of the object MN as ?zA is to AM, their distances from
                    the lens AB. If we now view this magnified image <hi rend="italic">rnn</hi>
                    through an eye-glass EF, so placed that <hi rend="italic">rnn</hi> is in its
                    principal focus, we shall again magnify it in the inverse proportion of En to
                    the distance at which the eye secs minute objects most distinctly, which is
                    about five inches. The object MN is thus doubly magnified, so that if nA is six
                    times AM, and the lens EF has a focal length of half an inch, the magnifying
                    power will be 6 × 5 -÷- ½ s≡ 60. While the lenses are the same, the magnifying
                    power may be increased to any extent by increasing the distance between the
                    lenses EF and AB, but the object becomes indistinct as the magnifying power
                    increases, so that it is not advisable to make the distance nA more than five,
                    six, or seven inches; or callingy the focal distance of the eye-glass, D = AM,
                    <hi rend="italic">d</hi> = An, and Δ the distance at which we see objects
                    distinctly, then this magnifying power Μ will be Μ = -^∙ × -y. <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi>, <hi rend="italic">J</hi><hi rend="italic">⅛</hi></p>
                <p>In this arrangement of lenses the field of view is small, and therefore we cannot
                    see the whole of many objects at one view. In order to remedy this, a large
                    lens, called the amplifying glass, is placed between the image and the
                    object-glass, as shown in fig. 20, where <hi rend="italic">nm</hi> is the image
                    formed by AB alone; but in consequence of the interposition of GH, it is
                    contracted into <hi rend="italic">νμ,</hi> and this contracted image is
                    magnified by the eyeglass EF. In order to widen the field still farther, and
                    make it flat, two plano-convex lenses have been placed at E, F, having their
                    convex sides in contact. In order to find the magnifying power when the lens GH
                    is used, we must multiply the magnifying power, as obtained by the preceding<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193819703?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9703-0038"/>
                    formula, by the quantity-^-, p representing the focal ð <hi rend="superscript">

                    third glasses</p>
                <p>Dr Goring prefers the following method of finding the magnifying power of these
                    microscopes. Measure the aperture of the object glass and call it <hi
                    rend="italic">a,</hi> make AM = <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and having measured
                    with a micrometer scale the diameter of the usual pencil of rays before they
                    enter the eye, call it <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then <hi
                    rend="italic">a ∙.f = d</hi>: F, F being the focal length of a single lens
                    having the same power as the compound microscope. But the magnifying power <hi
                    rend="italic">m</hi> of a lens F is —. Hence the magnifying power Μ of the
                    compound micro-</p>
                <p>scope will be Μ = —.</p>
                <p>In accurate investigations with the microscope, the common compound refracting
                    instrument above described is of little use, and has been superseded by better
                    combinations. As it is, however, very serviceable for common purposes, we shall
                    describe one of them of the most convenient and modern construction. This
                    instrument is shown in Plate CCCLX. fig. 19, where the body of the microscope
                    and all its parts are seen. They all slide on a triangular bar S, the sliding
                    pieces having springs on one side. The three lenses within the body of the
                    microscope are shown at EF, GH, AB, as in the last figure. The object MN is
                    placed on a slider attached to the stage PQ. The reflector for illuminating the
                    field is at R, being moved by a Hooke’s universal joint at XX. A condensing lens
                    is placed at C, for increasing the light reflected from the mirror R. The body
                    of the instrument is adjusted to distinct vision of the object MN, by a rack and
                    pinion working a triangular bar at right angles to the bar S. It is often
                    thought preferable to move the stage towards the microscope, rather than the
                    microscope towards the stage; but as the motion of the stage often disturbs
                    animalcules, and may derange the position of inanimate objects, the motion of
                    the body of the microscope has many advantages. When the stage, however, is
                    moveable, it is made to consist of <hi rend="italic">three</hi> plates. The
                    upper plate, which carries the sliderholder, is secured with a screw across the
                    middle plate, which middle plate is carried across the lower stage-plate by a
                    similar motion, but in a direction at right angles to the upper plate. By these
                    movements the object can be placed in any position with regard to the axis of
                    the fixed microscope, first by turning the one screw and then the other.</p>
                <p>Some attention is requisite in adjusting the apertures of the object-glasses
                    employed. The smaller they are, the less will be the spherical and chromatic
                    aberration of the object-glass, but the less will be the light. When a
                    planoconvex lens about half an inch focus is used, its plane side should be
                    towards the object, and its aperture limited to - <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi><hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi><hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi>-th of an
                    inch.</p>
                <p>A compound microscope is sometimes so constructed that it can be used as a single
                    microscope. This is done by screwing the lower end of the body round the
                    objectglass into a projecting arm at the top of the stand. When the body is
                    unscrewed and removed, a single lens or a doublet or triplet may be screwed into
                    the same place, and the moveable stage, with the slider and object, brought near
                    the single lens, just as if it had been the object-glass of a compound
                    microscope.</p>

                    the annexed figure, where A is a plano-convex lens with its flat side next the
                    object, having its focal distance about one half or two thirds that of the piano
                    or double convex lens B. A stop D is placed in the posterior focus of the
                    object-glass A. Mr Pritchard remarks, that when the focal length of A “is not
                    less than half an inch, this combination has been employed with considerable
                    advantage, both as regards distinctness and aperture.”</p>

                    Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>The improvement suggested by Mr Coddington on the eye-pieces of compound
                    microscopes is shown in Plate CCCLX. fig. 20. The object of the contrivance is
                    to fulfil the condition proposed by Huygens in his excellent telescopic
                    eye-piece, namely, to have the refraction of the pencils divided between the two
                    lenses, and to produce the greatest possible flattening of the field. Mr
                    Coddington found that the most proper form of the lenses was that shown in. the
                    annexed figure, where the two ⅛ye-glasses con sist of a meniscus A next the eye,
                    and a double equi-convex lens B, while the field-glass is composed of two
                    mensicuses C, D. Mr Coddington, however, informs us, that he “found no sensible
                    error arise from the substitution of plano-convex lenses for the
                    meniscus-glasses, which are difficult and expensive to form.” He remarks also,
                    that theory <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> indicates “a farther flattening of <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> the field to be made by separating the eye-glasses a
                    little, which requires the distance of the first eye-glass from the field-glass
                    to be diminished by about half as much but he did not perceive any improvement
                    arising from this alteration in practice, and therefore he does not recommend
                    the change. The object-glass which Mr Coddington uses in this microscope is
                    shown at <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and is the grooved sphere proposed by Sir
                    David Brewster.</p>
                <p>In his treatise on the eye and optical instruments, Mr Coddington has proposed a
                    different combination for the eye-glasses and the field or amplifying-glass.
                    Supposing the distance between the object-glass and field-glass tobe 1 inch, and
                    the focal length of the field and eye-glasses 1 inch each, and the distance
                    between the field-glass andnear-est eye-glass 1 inch, he finds the distance of
                    the two eyeglasses to be ½th of an inch. He finds also, “that all indistinctness
                    arising from the oblique refractions will be corrected when the field-glass is
                    convexo-convex, nearly convexo-plane, the first eye-glass convexo-convex<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The flattest side next the

                    eye.</p></note> (radii as 1: Ô).”</p>
                <p>Taking another case, he supposes the distance of the object-glass from the
                    field-glass to be 2 inches, and the eye-glasses to be in contact, as in fig. 22,
                    then “it appears that for the achromatism we must have the distance between the
                    field-glass and second eye-glass 1 inch.” <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819716?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9716-0039"/> Then the
                    field-glass must be convexo-plane nearly; the first eye-glass equi-convex, and
                    the second eye-glass a meniscus with the radii as 1:5.</p>
                <p>Dr Goring, who examined one of the instruments constructed on these principles,
                    states, <hi rend="italic">that both the chromatic and spherical aberration of
                    the objective part was wholly untouched, and that the eye-piece, consisting of
                    four glasses, was achromatic.</hi> He adds also, that nothing can surpass the
                    beauty of the field of this microscope for extent of flatness. Now we think that
                    Dr Goring has mistaken Mr Coddington, who never pretended to correct the
                    spherical and chromatic aberration of the object-glass.<note anchored="true"

                    of the grooved sphere, which is the object-glass he uses, as reduced to very
                    small quantities, by leaving only a small channel in its axis for the passage of
                    the rays. Whatever the residual aberration may be, Mr Coddington is not
                    answerable for it, as his object was merely to make the other part of the
                    microscope good, which, according to Dr Goring, he has succeeded in doing.</p>

                <p>Although the achromatic microscope has only recently come into use as an
                    effective and superior instrument, yet it can scarcely be considered as a new
                    instrument. Every person knew that an achromatic object-glass was most desirable
                    in a compound microscope. So early as 1776 Euler proposed to employ them in
                    compound microscopes; but so late as 1821 Μ. Biot considered their introduction
                    as out of the question, from the impracticability of achromatizing lenses as
                    small as those which the microscope requires.</p>
                <p>In 1823 Μ. Selligues and Dr Goring were both occupied with the subject, the
                    former having employed MM. Chevalier, two excellent opticians in Paris, and the

                    Selligues, however, in so far as we can learn, that we are indebted for the new
                    and happy idea of making the object-glass consist of <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    achromatic compound lenses, each consisting of two lenses. This idea is the
                    actual source of the superiority of the achromatic microscopes; andin proof of
                    this we may state, that Professor Amici, who had early been following out the
                    old idea of a single achromatic object-glass, abandoned his attempts in 1815,
                    but afterwards successfully resumed them by adopting Μ. Selligues’ plan of the
                    superposition of several object-glasses. In Μ. Selligues’ instrument the focal
                    length of each object-glass was 18 lines, its diameter 6 lines, and its
                    thickness at the centre 6 lines. In that of Amici the focal length of each was
                    about 6 lines, and MM. Chevalier have executed them having only 2 lines in focal
                    length. More recently, however, Mr Pritchard has surpassed all these artists by
                    making them of one sixteenth of an inch in focal length.</p>
                <p>From this brief historical detail, we shall proceed to give a more minute account
                    of the lenses executed by these different individuals, for which we are indebted
                    to Mr Jackson Lister, whose able memoir on this subject is, as we shall see, one
                    of the most valuable contributions to the science of the microscope that has for
                    a long time appeared.</p>
                <p>The achromatic object-glasses of Μ. Selligues’ microscope made by MM. Chevalier,
                    consisted of a plano-concave lens of flint glass, and a double convex one of
                    crown or plate glass, with their inner curves cemented together by a mixture of
                    mastic and turpentine, to remove the reflection of the interior surfaces, and
                    prevent the introduction of dampness. Four of these lenses, of from 1½ to 1½ of
                    an inch in focal length, were made to screw before each other; so as to be used
                    either all together, or any of them individually, in the usual manner, like the
                    object-glasses of a compound microscope. The aberration of colour was thus
                    corrected in a considerable degree, but the glasses were fixed in their places,
                    with their convex sides towards the object, which is their worst position; and
                    in consequence of this, the spherical aberration was enormous, and was
                    distinctly seen, even with the small aperture to which it was necessary to
                    reduce them.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this defect, the grand idea of the combination was acquired: and
                    Μ. Chevalier having observed the mistake committed by Μ. Selligues, made them of
                    less focal length, and more achromatic; and turning the concave lens to the
                    object, he produced in 1825 an instrument far above that of Μ. Selligues. His
                    deepest glasses were four tenths of an inch in focal length; and in his first
                    microscope two such compound lenses were combined for his highest power.</p>
                <p>The date of Fraunhofer’s achromatic microscopes is not known. Many years ago the
                    writer of this article ordered an achromatic object-glass from Fraunhofer for a
                    large microscope, for the purpose of making a particular class of observations;
                    but at that time he seems not to have made any compound lenses to be combined
                    after the manner of Selligues. Mr Robert Brown<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Phil. Trans. 1830, p. 188.</p></note> has a
                    series of five such object-glasses, recently obtained from Utz-schneider, whose
                    focal lengths are from 1∙8 to 0∙43 of an inch.</p>
                <p>When Professor Amici visited London in 1827, he brought with him some compound
                    object-glasses, which performed very well; and Mr Lister has since learned from
                    him that he has executed a combination of 2∙7 lines in focal length, and 2∙7
                    lines in aperture, which greatly excels the former.</p>
                <p>Among the most successful improvers of the achromatic microscope we must rank Mr
                    Jackson Lister, who has discovered some curious and valuable properties of these
                    lenses that have escaped the notice of the most skilful analysts. Mr Lister has
                    investigated the subject entirely as a matter of observation, and therefore his
                    results are more likely to have a higher practical value.</p>
                <p>Mr Lister takes as the basis of a microscopic objectglass two conditions, 1. that
                    the flint glass shall be planoconcave; and, 2. that it shall be joined by some
                    cement to the convex lens. The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> condition obviates
                    the risk of error in centring the two curves, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second</hi> diminishes by nearly a half the loss of light from reflection,
                    which is very great at the numerous surfaces of a combination of compound
                    object-glasses.</p>
                <p>Now Mr Lister has found that in every such compound lens which he has tried,
                    whether the flint glass was Swiss or English, with a double convex of plate
                    glass, which has been rendered achromatic by the form given to the outer curve
                    of plate glass, the ratio between the refractive and dispersive powers has been
                    such that its figure has been correct for rays issuing from some point in its
                    axis not far from the principal focus on its plane side; and these rays either
                    tend to a conjugate focus within the tube of the microscope, or emerge nearly
                    parallel.</p>
                <p>If AB represents such an object-glass, let us suppose that it is free from
                    spherical and achromatic aberration for a ray FDEG radiating from F, then the
                    angle of emergence GEH will be about three times as great as that of incidence
                    FDI. If the radiant point is now made <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819729?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9729-0040"/> to approach
                    the lens, the angles of incidence and emergence will approach to equality, and
                    the spherical aberration produced by the two will bear a less proportion to the
                    opposing error of the single correcting curve ABC, and hence in this case the
                    rays will be <hi rend="italic">overcorrected</hi> for such a focus.</p>
                <p>As F continues to approach the lens, the angle of incidence continuing to
                    increase, it will exceed that of emergence, which has been in the mean time
                    diminishing, so that the spherical aberration produced by the two outer surfaces
                    will recover their original proportion. When F has reached this point F'' (at
                    which the angle of incidence does not exceed that of emergence so much as it had
                    at first come short of it), the rays will again be free from spherical
                    aberration. If F" still comes nearer the lens, or is carried beyond F in the
                    opposite direction, the angle of incidence in the former case, or of emergence
                    in the latter, becomes disproportionately effective, and in either case the
                    aberration exceeds the correction, or the rays are <hi rend="italic"
                    >under-corrected.</hi> Hence Mr Lister gives the following rule.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic superscript"> t,</hi><hi rend="italic">That in general an
                    achromatic object-glass·, of which the inner surfaces are in contact, or nearly
                    so, will have on one side of it two foci in its axis, for the rays proceeding
                    from which the spherical aberration will be truly corrected at a moderate
                    aperture</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">that for the space
                    between these two points, its spherical aberration ινill be over-corrected, and
                    beyond them either way, under-corrected?</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Lister found also, “that when the longer aplanatic focus is used, the marginal
                    rays of a pencil not coincident with the axis of the glass are distorted, so
                    that a coma is thrown outwards, while the contrary effect of a coma directed
                    towards the centre of the field is produced by the rays from the shorter focus.”
                    These interesting results obviously furnish the means of destroying both
                    aberrations in a large focal pencil, and of thus surmounting what has been
                    hitherto the chief obstacle to the perfection of the ‘microscope. And when it is
                    considered that the curves of its diminutive object-glasses have required to be
                    at least as exactly proportioned as those of a large telescope, to give the
                    image of a bright point equally sharp and colourless, and that any change made
                    to correct one aberration was liable to disturb the other <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> some idea may be formed of what the amount of that obstacle would have
                    been. It will, however, be evident, that if any objectglass is but made
                    achromatic, with its lenses truly worked and cemented, so that their axes
                    coincide, it may with certainty be connected with another possessing the same
                    requisites, and of suitable focus, so that the combination shall be free from
                    spherical error also in the centre of its field.</p>
                <p>For this the rays have only to be received by the front glass B, from its shorter
                    aplanatic focus F, and transmitted in the direction of the larger correct pencil
                    FA of the other glass A. It is desirable that the latter pencil should neither
                    converge to a very short focus, nor be more than very slightly, if at all,
                    divergent; and a little attention at first to the kind of glass used will keep
                    it within this range, the denser flint being suited to the glasses of shorter
                    focus and larger angle of aperture. If the two glasses which in the diagram are
                    drawn as at some distance apart, are brought nearer together (if the place of A,
                    for instance, is carried to tbe dotted figure), the rays transmitted by B in the
                    direction of the larger aplanatic pencil of A, will plainly be derived from some
                    point (Z) more distant than F' <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>, and lying between
                    the aplanatic foci of B; therefore (according to what has been stated) this
                    glass, and consequently the combination, will then be spherically
                    over-corrected. If, on the other hand, the distance between A and B is
                    increased, the opposite effects are of course produced.</p>
                <p>In combining several glasses together, it is often convenient to transmit an
                    under-corrected pencil from the front glass, and to counteract its error by
                    over-correction in the middle one.</p>
                <p>Slight errors in colour may, in the same manner, be destroyed by opposite ones;
                    and on the principles described, we not only acquire fine correction for the
                    central ray, but by the opposite effects at the two foci in the transverse
                    pencil, all coma can be destroyed, and the whole field rendered beautifully flat
                    and distinct.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>PhiL

                    Microscopes, with Solid and Fluid Lenses.</hi></p>
                <p>In 1812, a very simple method was employed by Sir David Brewster, for making both
                    single and compound achromatic microscopes. Almost all objects are seen to the
                    greatest advantage when immersed in a fluid, even the finest test objects, such
                    as the scales of the Podura. Having placed the object on a piece of glass, he
                    put above it a drop of an oil having a greater dispersive power than the single
                    lens, or than the concave lens which formed the object-glass of the microscope.
                    The lens was then made to touch the fluid, so that the surface of the fluid was
                    as it were formed into a concave lens. Now if the radius of the outward surface
                    of this lens was such as to correct the dispersion, we have here a perfect
                    achromatic microscope, both simple and compound. The best way is to over-correct
                    the colour of the plate-glass lens by the fluid, and then to reduce the
                    dispersion of the fluid by mixing it with one of a less dispersive power. This
                    will be understood from the annexed diagram, where AB is an unequally convex
                    lens, the flattest side of which is plunged in the fluid <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> placed in a watch-glass CD. The object is placed at <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> and the dispersion of the concave surface of the fluid compensates
                    that which is produced by the lens. All errors of centring are here removed, and
                    also the loss of light at the touching surfaces of solid lenses. If AB is a
                    single microscope, the object <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be placed in its
                    principal focus, and the emergent parallel rays will enter the eye; but if it is
                    the object-glass of a compound microscope, an image will be formed a few inches
                    behind AB, by withdrawing AB a little from <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> or placing
                    the object a little without its principal focus. W’e have already had occasion
                    to describe an achromatic grooved sphere, but in the process of achromatizing
                    it, tlιe sphere loses in a very small degree its valuable property of refracting
                    in the very same manner all the pencils that enter the eye. This property,
                    however, may be preserved in the bird’s-eye sphere by the achromatic method
                    which we have now described. Let AB be the grooved sphere, and CD the
                    watch-glass containing the fluid; it is obvious that every ray which passes
                    through the centre of the sphere will enter and <hi rend="subscript"> k</hi>
                    quit it perpendicularly, without suffering any refraction? The same mode of
                    achromatizing the sphere AB may be adopted<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819742?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9742-0041"/> with a solid
                    concentric concave lens ABCD of flint-glass or other substance, or the sphere
                    may be placed between two such concentric lenses. The greater the dispersion of
                    the flint-glass, the nearer must the outer surface CD approach to AB. By these
                    means the grooved sphere may be rendered perfect, both as a single microscope
                    and as the objectglass of a compound one.</p>
                <p>The principle above described may be applied to a system of object-glasses like
                    those of Selligues’ microscope. Let A, B, E be three convex lenses, so placed at
                    the end of the tube of a compound microscope, that the highly dispersive fluid
                    in the watch-glass CD will enter between' the glasses A, B, and E. The concave
                    lenses of fluid will over-correct the three lenses A, B, aàd E; but if a very
                    deep curvature on the outside of A is not sufficient to compensate this
                    over-correction, it may be effected by a suitable lens at F. If the three lenses
                    are made of the precious stones, with a high refractive power and a low
                    dispersive one, the concave fluid lenses will not over-correct them.</p>

                <p>Sir Isaac Newton seems to have been the firfet person who described a reflecting
                    microscope. He communicated his plan to Oldenburg in 1679, as shown in the
                    annexed diagram, where AB is a concave speculum, 0 the object, F the place where
                    an image of it is formed, and CD an eye-glass for magnifying it. In another
                    letter to Oldenburg, dated 11th July of the same year, he refers to another
                    improvement on microscopes, which is to “illuminate the object in a darkened
                    room, with <hi rend="italic">the light of any convenient colour, not too much
                    compounded</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>-for by that means the microscope will,
                    with distinctness, have a deeper charge and larger aperture, especially if its
                    construction be such as 1 may hereafter describe.” Wc are not aware that this
                    idea was ever further developed by its author.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Mr Potter<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh
                    Journal of Science, Jan. 1832, No. XI. p. 61.</p></note> has recently described
                    “a new construction of Sir Isaac Newton’s microscope,” principally with the view
                    of removing the difficulty of illuminating the object. His first construction
                    was for opaque objects; and in order to illuminate them, he cut a large circular
                    aperture <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> in the tube, between the object and the
                    speculum; but the light which fell on the sides of the tube occasioned a good
                    deal of indistinctness in the field of view. This defect, however, was
                    completely removed by lining all the lower parts of the tube with black velvet.
                    Mr Potter found it advantageous to concentrate the light on these objects that
                    required it, by a large lens at <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> For transparent
                    objects he applied a lens, as shown at <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> Its convergent
                    beam is reflected on the object placed at the end of the wire <hi rend="italic"
                    >a,</hi> fixed to a handle A, by means of a small diagonal mirror in the axis of
                    the tube, and inclined to this axis 45°. By this means a very strong light may
                    be thrown through, and past the object. By means of moveable caps to cover the
                    opening <hi rend="italic">abc,</hi> and the lens <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> all
                    interference of foreign light is prevented; and without altering the position of
                    the object, both methods of illumination may be successively adopted. Mr Potter
                    attaches his objects to thin brass pins <hi rend="italic">α</hi> stuck into
                    wooden handles <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and these pins pass through a slit cut
                    into a small piece of cork attached to the sliding piece <hi rend="italic"
                    >g,</hi> which at the same time carries the lens <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and
                    the plane mirror, the whole of which are moved by the small arm connected to the
                    crank, as at <hi rend="italic">i.</hi> The adjustment of the object to the focus
                    of the mirror is effected by turning a nut attached to the pivot on which the
                    crank is fixed.</p>
                <p>In the microscope used by Mr Potter, he employs a speculum one inch in diameter,
                    with a focal length of 1½ inch; and he generally employs a distance of from 12
                    to 14 inches between the object and the image.</p>
                <p>This size of the speculum allows him to place an insect <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819755?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9755-0042"/> or other
                    object of ½th of an inch square in the tube, without any perceptible bad effect
                    resulting from it.</p>
                <p>When Mr Potter had adjusted the illuminators in the manner which we shall
                    afterwards have occasion to describe, he “saw quite easily what are called the
                    diagonal lines on the scale from the wing of the white cabbage butterfly, which
                    has been proposed as a difficult test object by Dr Goring; and it is such a one
                    as those who have only seen the stronger longitudinal striae or scales from the
                    wings of moths and butterflies have little idea of.” Mr Potter was also able to
                    resolve a delicate blue tissue in the web of a spider called the <hi
                    rend="italic">clubiona atrdx,</hi> into its component fibres.</p>
                <p>The great size of speculum used by Mr Potter arises from his being able to give
                    all his specula a true ellipsoidal figure, so as to remove all spherical
                    aberration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The process
                    by which he does this is fully described in the Edinburgh Journal of Science,
                    No. 12, new series.</p></note> We have in our possession t&amp;o of Mr Potter’s
                    instruments, one of them with a <hi rend="italic">spherical</hi> and the other
                    with an <hi rend="italic">ellipsoidal</hi> mirror. The quantity of light and the
                    defining power of the latter are unusual in such instruments.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Amici's Reflecting Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>This instrument is shown jn section in the annexed figure, where <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> is a small ellipsoidal speculum about 1 inch in diameter,
                    and 2 <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi> ¾ths in focal length. The object is placed on
                    a stage <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> below the tube of the microscope, and the
                    rays which issue from it fall upon a small speculum <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    inclined 45° to the axis of the ellipsoidal speculum, in the same manner as if
                    the object had been placed in the tube as far to the right hand of the small
                    mirror as it is below it. An image of this object is of course formed in
                    the.other focus of the ellipsoidal speculum, and may be viewed by a single or
                    double eye-piece, as in other compound microscopes. Professor Amici, however,
                    uses a negative eye-piece, consisting of two plano-convex lenses A, B.</p>
                <p>The new and peculiar part of this instrument is the use of the small speculum,
                    which allows the object to be placed without the tube, and illuminated with the
                    utmost facility. Dr Goring, to whom science is indebted for the perfection of
                    the reflecting microscope, remarks, that “the instrument was turned out of
                    Professor Amici’s hands in a rough and ineffective state, owing to the concave
                    metal being of too long a focus and too small an angle of aperture, and the
                    diagonal one (or small mirror <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which was half an inch
                    in diameter) of too large a diameter, which caused it to intercept too large a
                    quantity of light from the other, leaving only a narrow rim of reflexion to
                    enter the retina, which occasioned a disagreeable nebulosity in the middle of
                    the field of view, unless the eye-glass was of great depth.”<note

                    Improved Reflecting Microscope.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Cuthbert, an ingenious London optician, constructed one of Amici’s
                    instruments, the speculum having 1⅜ inch of aperture, and a focal length of 3
                    inches, and the body of the microscope being about 1 foot long. Dr Goring and he
                    having tried it on the test objects which the doctor had newly introduced, found
                    its performance quite unsatisfactory. Dr Goring, therefore, recommended that the
                    speculum should be only half an inch in focal length, and the body 4 or 5 inches
                    long. Mr Cuthbert accordingly finished a pair of metals six tenths of an inch in
                    focal length, and only three tenths in diameter. The excellent performance of
                    this instrument induced Dr Goring and Mr Pritchard to turn their attention to
                    its improvement; and, as Mr Cuthbert<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The process by which Mr Cuthbert is able to accomplish this
                    difficult task is similar to that by which he gives truly hyperbolic figures to

                    five inches of focal length.</p></note> has been able to execute perfectly
                    ellipsoidal metals, having an aperture equal to their sidereal focal length, or
                    54°, and of so small a diameter as three tenths of an inch, they have been able
                    to produce an instrument of a very perfect kind.</p>
                <p>This microscope is represented in Plate CCCLXI.fig. 26, 27, where the instrument
                    is seen to rest on a tubular pillar, its body being held by a split socket. The
                    pillar is screwed to a solid cruciform stand, to one of the legs of which an
                    adjusting screw is applied, to produce steadiness. The body moves round a cradle
                    joint at the top of the pillar, and may be firmly fixed at any degree of
                    inclination. The body of the microscope is shown at <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                    the eye-tube at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and the eye-piece, which is a
                    Huygenian one, at <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> The focal lengths of the interior
                    glasses of the eye-pieces, of which there are usually three, are three fourths,
                    three eighths, and three sixteenths of an inch. The tube containing the specula
                    is shown at <hi rend="italic">bc.</hi> The triangular bar which carries the
                    illuminating reflector, the stage, and the apparatus for adjustment, is shown at
                    <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∕ and is soldered to the neck of the body. The
                    mirror <hi rend="italic">k</hi> is plane on one side, and has a plaster of Paris
                    surface on the other. The stage <hi rend="italic">l</hi> is a combination of
                    rack and screw work, wrought by two concentric milled heads at <hi rend="italic"
                    >m.</hi> The smallest of these moves the object in the direction of the body,
                    and the other in an opposite direction. The stage can be lifted out of the
                    triangular socket <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> which carries the adjusting screw
                    <hi rend="italic">i</hi> for obtaining distinct vision, and the clamping screw

                <p>When the body and stand are used for a compound achromatic microscope, a tube,
                    shown in fig. 27, and containing the compound object-glasses below it,
                    increasing in diameter from the object, is screwed into the body at <hi

                <p>The metals No. 1, 2, and 3 arc those most useful for examining opaque objects.
                    No. 3 is excellent also for all kinds of transparent objects. No. 5 can scarcely
                    be used for opaque objects, as it leaves almost no space between the tube and
                    the object for allowing the latter to be illuminated. No. 6 cannot be used at
                    all for opaque objects, but is especially intended for the most difficult class
                    of transparent test objects.</p>

                <p>Having constructed one of Sir Isaac Newton’s microscopes in 1738, Dr Smith of
                    Cambridge observed that the colours of objects were much more beautiful and
                    natural than in refracting microscopes. He found that objects were very distinct
                    and sufficiently light when the microscope bad the following dimensions :—</p>
                <p>Focal length of the speculum 2½ inches.</p>
                <p>Diameter of ditto 1</p>
                <p>Focal length of the plano-convex eye-glass 2½</p>
                <p>Ratio of the distance of the object from the fo cus of the speculum to the focal
                    distance of the speculum 1 to 19.</p>
                <p>Finding that, in order to obtain a high magnifying power, the speculum required
                    to be very concave and small, he contrived another microscope with two
                    reflecting spherical surfaces of any size, but so related to each other that the
                    second reflexion should correct the aberration of the first. This instrument is
                    shown in fig. 31.</p>
                <p>Dr Smith’s microscope is shown in fig. 31, where AA is a concave spherical
                    speculum, having its polished convex surface inwards. The rays from an object o
                    placed in the slider <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be reflected from the
                    concave speculum AA upon the convex CC, and will have a distinct and magnified
                    image of it formed before the convex eye-glass E, by which it will be magnified
                    still more. This instrument, in short, is nothing more than the Cassegrainian
                    telescope converted into a microscope, with this difference only, that in the
                    telescope distinct vision is obtained by moving the, convex mirror, whereas in
                    the microscope it is obtained by a motion of the eye-glass. Dr Smith constructed
                    one of these microscopes, which he found to perform “nearly as well, in all
                    respects, as the very best refracting microscopes ;” and the writer of this
                    article has one of them now before him, which performs wonderfully well, though
                    both the specula have their polish considerably injured. It shows the lines on
                    some of the test objects with very considerable sharpness.</p>

                <p>Notwithstanding the excellence of Professor Amici’s miscroscope, as constructed
                    with Dr Goring’s improvements and with Mr Cuthbert’s specula, we are quite
                    convinced that it does not owe these advantages to the peculiarity in its
                    construction which constitutes it a different instrument from Newton’s. This
                    peculiarity is in our opinion a disadvantage, and we consider the instrument as
                    recommended solely by its possessing an ellipsoidal speculum, with a large angle
                    of aperture. The only advantage which can be ascribed to Amici’s instrument is a
                    more convenient mode of illumination, though not much more so than Mr Potter’s;
                    but this advantage, whatever be its amount, is purchased at great sacrifices. 1.
                    The whole instrument is an a <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> wkward-looking piece
                    of mechanism, with its triangular bar and all its appendages dangling at one end
                    of it. 2. It cannot be used in the vertical position, which we consider a very
                    great defect. 3. By the use of the small reflecting speculum, <hi rend="italic"
                    >more, than one half of the whole light is lost.</hi> 4. With small concave
                    specula, such as those <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi rend="superscript">
                    3</hi> θths of an inch in diameter, opaque objects cannot be illuminated, as
                    stated by Dr Goring.</p>
                <p>The construction which has been proposed by Sir David Brewster to remedy most of
                    these defects is shown in the annexed figure, where ABC is the body of the
                    instrument, which screws at its lower end C into the horizontal projecting arm
                    DE of the stand, either of the achromatic microscope or the single microscope,
                    so that we get rid of all trouble about the objects placed at <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn,</hi> and their mode of illumination, as every thing concerning them is the
                    same as in other microscopes. This, we must say, is a great advantage; for
                    neither naturalists nor amateurs are disposed to purchase and use two sets of
                    the extended apparatus necessary for holding, moving, and illuminating
                    microscopic objects. At the lower end C of the body, exactly where the
                    object-glasses of the compound and achromatic object-lenses are placed, is a
                    small tube <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> at the lower end of which is placed the
                    concave speculum <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> perforated with a very small hole at
                    its centre, and with its concave surface upwards. Above it is the plane speculum
                    <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> fixed by a slender arm to the side <hi rend="italic"
                    >bd</hi> of the small tube, and having its diameter a little greater than the
                    perforation in the speculum <hi rend="italic">cd.</hi> This little tube <hi
                    rend="italic">abed</hi> screws into the arm DE, as if it were a microscopic
                    doublet or single lens; and the body ABC may <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819781?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9781-0044"/> either screw
                    upon the outside of this tube, or, what is better, upon a stronger piece of tube
                    forming part of the arm DE. A concave illuminating reflector <hi rend="italic"
                    >kh,</hi> for opaque objects, may screw on the back of the speculum <hi
                    rend="italic">cd,</hi> or that speculum may be made thick, and ground and
                    polished on both sides, so that while one side magnifies the objects, the other
                    illuminates them.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that rays proceeding from an object at <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    will be reflected from the plane speculum e, upon the concave speculum <hi
                    rend="italic">cd,</hi> exactly as if the objects were placed at <hi
                    rend="italic">τ,</hi> as far above <hi rend="italic">e</hi> as <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> is below it, and an image of it would be formed in the other focus of
                    the ellipsoid, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> being the one focus, if the rays were
                    not intercepted by the eye-piece AB, by which the image is farther magnified. By
                    this mode of construction, the whole of the reflecting microscope, in place of
                    having a separate stand and separate apparatus costing a large sum of money, is
                    comprehended in the little tube <hi rend="italic">abed,</hi> and may be
                    considered as a reflectingobject-speculum, forming part of a general microscope,
                    furnished with single lenses, doublets, and compound ach-ro ma tics.</p>
                <p>By the means now described are removed all the defects which we enumerated as
                    belonging to Amici’s combination, except the <hi rend="italic">third,</hi> which
                    is one of such importance that it is of consequence to consider how far it is
                    capable of being remedied. Sir David. Brewster has proposed to get rid of this
                    loss of light by placing the object mn, as in Amici’s instrument, outsideof the
                    tube, but inclined to its axis, and refracting its rays upon the specu-lurçi <hi
                    rend="italic">cd,</hi> by means of an achromatic prism <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>
                    in a manner analogous to his method of producing a similar effect in the
                    Newtonian telescope.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Treatise on Optics, Lardner’s Cabinet Cyclopaedia, p. 3õ4.</p></note> The
                    faces of this prism are equally inclined to the axis of the microscope and the
                    axis of the pencil issuing from the point of the object under examination. As
                    the prisms of plate and flint glass which compose <hi rend="italic">e</hi> are
                    cemented by a substance of nearly the same refractive power, there will be no
                    farther loss of light than what is reflected at the two surfaces. A socket may
                    be placed at D, for holding an illuminating lens, or the little apparatus for
                    opaque objects, shown in Plate CCCLXI. fig. 27. But in order to avoid the
                    encumbrance and expense of separate stands and apparatus for this, as well as
                    Amici’s form of the instrument, we would propose that a strong piece of tube
                    should be inserted in the opening, above <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> to screw
                    into the upper side of the projecting arm, as shown in the preceding figure; or
                    a solid screw attached to the upper side of the tube, a little to the right hand
                    of C, and above the opening, might screw into the lower end of the projecting
                    arm DF. In these cases the object at <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> will be placed on
                    the ordinary stage, and illuminated in the common manner; but it will be
                    necessary to have a counterpoise at D, to balance the weight of the body
                    ABC.</p>
                <p>Those who are acquainted with the principle of the Cassegrainian telescope, and
                    of Dr Smith’s compound microscope, will readily see that the reflecting
                    microscope, with the perforated speculum, may be converted into a more compound
                    reflector, analogous to Dr Smith’s, by making the little speculum <hi

                <p>CHAP. III.—ON SOLAR AND OXYΠYDROGEN MICROSCOPES.</p>
                <p>The solar microscope is a well-known popular instrument, for exhibiting on a
                    white screen in a dark chamber, magnified images of minute objects, illuminated
                    by the condensed light of the sun. As the sun cannot often be commanded in our
                    climate, this instrument may be considered as having fallen into disuse; but the
                    discovery of the lime-ball light by Mr Drummond amply supplies the place of the
                    great luminary, in so far as the microscope is concerned. The instrument has
                    accordingly been revived under the name of the oxyhydrogen microscope, and is
                    now a favourite public exhibition.</p>
                <p>The solar microscope was proposed by Dr Lieberkhun in 1738; and early in 1739,
                    when he paid a visit to London, he exhibited an instrument of his own
                    construction to several members of the Royal Society, and to Mr Cuff, Mr Adams,
                    and other London opticians.</p>
                <p>This microscope is nothing more than a convex lens, in front of which, a little
                    farther from it than its principal focus, is placed a microscopic object, the
                    rays of the sun being reflected in a horizontal line, and condensed by a lens.
                    This will be understood from the annexed figure, where CD is the convex lens, E
                    the object placed before it, and AB the illuminating condenser. An enlarged
                    image of E will be formed to the right hand of CD, on a wall or screen, and the
                    size of the enlarged image will be to that of the object as the distance of CD
                    from the screen or wall is to CE, the distance of the object from the lens. Dr
                    Lieberkhun’s solar microscope had no mirror for reflecting the sun’s rays into
                    the tube, so that it could only be used a few hours, when the tube could be
                    conveniently pointed to the sun. The improvement of adding a mirror was made by
                    Mr Cuff, who constructed the instrument in a very superior manner.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Baker on the Microscope,
                    vol. i. p. 22.</p></note> Dr Lieberkhun subsequently fitted up the solar
                    microscope to show opaque objects; but the method which he employed is not
                    known. Since the time of Mr Cuff, the solar microscope has undergone many
                    improvements. Mr Benjamin Martin added greatly to the value of this instrument,
                    by fitting it up both for opaque and transparent objects, in the manner shown in
                    Plate CCCLXI. figs. 28 and 29. In fig. 28 it is shown as fitted up for opaque
                    objects. The body ABCDEF has the part ABCD of a conical, and the part CDEF of a
                    tubular form. A large convex lens, corresponding with AB, in fig. 34 is placed
                    at AB, at the end of the conical tube ABCD, which screws into the square plate
                    QR, which is fastened to a window-shutter opposite a hole of at least the size
                    of the lens AB, by means of the screw e, <hi rend="italic">d.</hi> Upon the
                    square plate QR there is a moveable circular plate <hi rend="italic">abc.</hi>
                    To this circular plate is attached the silvered glass mirror NOP, placed in a
                    brass frame, which moves round a joint PP, and which may be placed in any
                    position with regard to the sun, so as to reflect his rays into the tube ABCD by
                    means of rack-work and pinions at Q and R. The pinion Q moves the circular plate
                    <hi rend="italic">abc</hi> (to which the mirror NOP is fixed) in a plane
                    perpendicular to the horizon, while the nut R gives it a motion in an opposite
                    plane. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819794?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9794-0045"/> light introduced by this mirror falls upon the
                    lens AB, which throws it in a condensed state upon any object in the tube. But
                    before it reaches the opaque object, it is received by a mirror Μ, placed in the
                    box HILX, which reflects the condensed light back upon the face of the object E,
                    fig. 34, next to the lens CD, fig. 34. This mirror is adjusted to a proper angle
                    by the screw S.</p>
                <p>Above the body ABEF is seen the part ∕VK which carries the sliders or objects,
                    and the object-glass or lens CD, fig. 34. The tube K slides within the tube V,
                    and V again slides into the box HILX. These tubes carry each a magnifying lens.
                    The inner tube K is sometimes taken out of the other V, seen within the box, and
                    used alone. The sliders and objects are introduced into a slit or opening at H.
                    The brass plate to the left of H is fixed to a tube A, by means of a spiral wire
                    within the tube, which presses the plate against the side of the box HILX, so
                    that the sliders, when placed in the opening, are pressed against the side of
                    the box.</p>
                <p>In using this microscope, the sun's rays are first made to pass along the tube
                    ABCD, by the nuts Q and R. The box for opaque objects, HILX, is then slid by its
                    tube G into the tube EF. The slider containing the object, having its face to be
                    examined turned to the right hand, is then pushed into the opening at H, till
                    the object is in the centre of the tubes V, K. The condensed light falling on
                    the mirror Μ is then thrown back on the face of the object in the slider, and
                    the door <hi rend="italic">hi</hi> shut. Upon a white paper screen or cloth,
                    from <hi rend="italic">four</hi> to <hi rend="italic">eight</hi> feet square,
                    and placed at the distance of from six to ten feet from the window, the
                    observer, in the room made thoroughly dark, will see on the screen a magnified
                    representation of the object, which may be rendered distinct at different
                    distances of the screen, by pulling out or pushing in the tubes V, K containing
                    the convex lenses. As the sun is constantly moving, its rays must be kept in the
                    axis of the tubes by now and then turning the nuts Q and R.</p>
                <p>When the microscope is to be used for transparent objects, the box HI LX, with
                    its tube G, and other appendages, is removed, and the apparatus shown in fig. 31
                    substituted for it. This is done by sliding the tube Y of fig. 31 into the tube
                    EF of fig. 30. A slider containing the magnifying lens is then slipped through
                    the opening at <hi rend="italic">n,</hi> and a second condenser may or may not
                    be inserted in the opening at <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> The slider with the
                    object is then placed in the opening <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> and when its
                    magnified picture falls upon the screen, it is adjusted to distinctness by
                    turning the milled nut 0.</p>
                <p>The picture formed by a solar microscope being in Dr Robison’s opinion “generally
                    <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> so indistinct that it is fit only for amusing
                    ladies,” he proposed to use as an objectglass the achromatic eye-piece of four
                    lenses, constructed by Mr Ramsden for telescopes. Having made the experiment, he
                    found the image “perfectly sharp,” and recommended this application “to the
                    artists, as a valuable article of their trade.”</p>
                <p>A much simpler method, however, of correcting the defects of the microscope, is
                    to use compound achromatic lenses, which were first suggested by Mr Benjamin
                    Martin.</p>
                <p>Another mode of improving the instrument was proposed in 1812 by Sir David
                    Brewster,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Treatise on
                    New Philosophical Instruments, p. 410.</p></note> who has described a new solar
                    microscope, which can be rendered achromatic. The method of doing this is shown
                    in the diagram, fig. 34, where AB is the condensing lens, and CD the
                    object-glass, cemented firmly into one end of a tube »zCD?z, which has a tubular
                    opening at E, while the other end of the tube has a circular piece of parallel
                    glass cemented upon it. The tube wCDn is then filled with water, or any other
                    fluid; and the object, when placed upon a slider, or held in a pair of forceps,
                    is introduced at the opening E into the fluid. The mechanism for producing these
                    effects is easily conceived. By the instrument thus constructed, imperfectly
                    opaque and corrugated objects, rendered transparent, and extended by the fluid
                    medium, may be examined in this microscope, though incapable of being used in
                    any other. Objects may be even dissected in the aqueous tube. Nay, objects
                    preserved in spirits might be exhibited by immersing the bottle, if it is small,
                    in the trough or tube <hi rend="smallcaps">∞CDλ,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Treatise on New Philosophical
                    Instruments, p. 401, for an account of the advantages of examining objects

                <p>But the most important purpose effected by this form of the instrument is, that
                    it can be rendered perfectly achromatic by using a fluid of higher dispersive
                    power than the glass lens CD, and making the interior curvature of the side CD,
                    which touches the fluid, of that degree of convexity which will convert the
                    fluid into a concave lens capable of correcting the colour of CD. The lens CD
                    may be made most advantageously of fluor spar, which, from its low dispersive
                    power, might form an achromatic combination with water.</p>
                <p>Although, in so far as we know, metallic’specula have never been regularly fitted
                    up as a reflecting solar microscope for use, yet every person familiar with, and
                    in the habit of using, specula and lenses, must have made the experiment of
                    forming magnified images both in solar and artificial light, with small concave
                    specula. The perfection of these images cannot be doubted; and it has often
                    appeared to us surprising that the optician did not avail himself of such a
                    combination for a solar microscope. Neither the Newtonian nor the Amician form
                    of the instrument offer facilities for this purpose. Sir David Brewster has
                    therefore proposed to employ his form of the reflecting microscope for a solar
                    and oxyhydrogen instrument. Its facilities for this purpose are very great, and
                    there can be little doubt that it will be practically successful, and will be as
                    superior to other solar microscopes as the best reflecting compound microscope
                    is to other compound microscopes. Dr Goring made an experiment with the Amician
                    microscope; but he obviously considers it as not likely to succeed, remarking,
                    that “after all that could be done, a refractor would be sure to beat it hollow;
                    therefore I shall take my leave of the subject, as I cannot conscientiously
                    recommend such an instrument.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dr Goring states, that a friend of his had constructed a
                    solar microscope with metals on the Araician principle, and without a body or
                    eye-glass, which exhibited a variety of test objects in a highly satisfactory
                    manner.</p></note> It is no wonder that this experiment failed, because Dr
                    Goring seems to have used <hi rend="italic">the whole of the Aηιiciaη
                    microscope,</hi> eye-glasses and all, as the magnifier in the solar microscope,
                    and therefore it could not be considered as a <hi rend="italic">reflecting</hi>
                    solar microscope, being in fact as much a <hi rend="italic">refracting</hi> one.
                    The construction to which we have above referred is shown <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193819807?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9807-0046"/> in the annexëd
                    figure, where AB is the illuminating lens, throwing the condensed rays of the
                    sun upon a transparent object <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi> The rays from this
                    object falling upon the small speculum <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> are reflected
                    to the deep concave speculum <hi rend="italic">cd,</hi> so placed, that the
                    image is formed at MN on a screen at some distance behind it, distinct vision
                    being obtained either by moving the object or the speculum.</p>
                <p>For opaque objects this form of the instrument is peculiarly adapted. The
                    parallel rays of the sun falling upon the deep speculum <hi rend="italic"
                    >kh,</hi> are condensed by it and thrown on the inner face of the object <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> of which a magnified image is formed, as before, at MN. A
                    greater condensation of light may be obtained by using the lens AB, so that the
                    speculum <hi rend="italic">kh</hi> shall receive its convergent beam before the
                    rays reach their focus and complete their convergency.</p>
                <p>ìn this construction we have the disadvantage of two reflections, belonging also
                    to the Amician form ;’ but this may be considered as compensated by the image
                    being without the tube, and more under our command. Though this is true in the
                    compound microscope, yet the advantage of having the object outside the tube is
                    of less consequence in a solar microscope. To avoid therefore two reflections,
                    and two mirrors with their relative adjustments, Sir David Brewster has proposed
                    to construct the reflect ing solar microscope in the manner shown in the annexed
                    figure, where CD is the perforated concave speculum, <hi rend="italic">mn</hi>
                    the object in one of its foci, and MN the magnified image in its other focus.
                    The object <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> placed on a slider passing through an
                    opening in front of the speculum, is illuminated as an opaque object by the lens
                    AB, whose refracted rays are farther condensed by a lens placed in the aperture
                    of the speculum. This form of the solar microscope is therefore singularly
                    adapted for opaque objects; and as the whole of the effect of the instrument is
                    produced by a single reflection from a single surface, it is the simplest
                    optical instrument in existence. In order to throw light upon <hi rend="italic"
                    >mn</hi> as a transparent object, the rays must pass through it in-an opposite
                    direction from the side MN, and this may be done by the very same method given
                    by Mr Potter, and represented in fig. 29.</p>
                <p>The simplicity and practical value of this instrument will be immediately
                    recognised by comparing it with the complex opaque box, which in all solar
                    microscopes is a necessary appendage for opaque objects. See Plate CCCLXI. fig.

                <p>Dr Goring, whose indefatigable genius has improved almost all our popular

                    horizontal curved surface, placed in a darkened camera, at which two or more
                    persons can look at the same time. It is in reality a new instrument, but can
                    also be used like the common solar microscope in a darkened room.<note

                <p>This instrument, with ail its parts, is shown in Plate CCCLXI. figs. 30,31,32,
                    and 33; fig. 30being a geometrical elevation of the instrument <hi rend="italic"
                    >one-tenth</hi> of the real size, the various parts being represented as if
                    formed of transparent matter. A strong framework A of wood rests upon four legs,
                    having a large hole in it, into which the instrument is fixed with two screws F,
                    F. The frame is large enough to protect the observer from the solar rays. A long
                    plane mirror B is fixed to an arm C, which moves round a pin fixed to the side
                    of the mirror frame, and also round a joint attached to a strong round wire E,
                    which slides backwards and forwards in the tube D, having a spring within, and a
                    pinching nut to fix it in its place. The inclination of the mirror is varied by
                    pulling out or pushing in the mirror, which has also another motion produced by
                    the action of the milled head G on a rack and pinion. A common illuminating
                    lens, five inches in diameter and one foot in focal length, is placed at H. Dr

                    he says that he has never used one. The main body of the microscope is conical,
                    having a hayonet catch at L to receive the rest of the instrument, viz. the tube
                    carrying the stage and rackwork. This tube 11 moves within the conical one by
                    means of the milled head Μ and rack and pinion N. The end of this tube is
                    closed, and an ordinary slider-holder 0 is fixed to it. On the inner side of the
                    stage, near N, is fixed a condensing lens, about one and a half inch in diameter
                    and two inches in focal length, which, by means of a sliding wire passed through
                    a hole in the stage, can be moved from one side of the tube to the other, and
                    also made to approach to or recede from the stage. A second tube PPP, slit open
                    at the sides, is screwed into the tube in which the stage moves; and into this
                    tube the optical part <hi rend="italic">q</hi> is made to slide, the objectglass
                    being placed at K. Dr Goring here remarks, that “the focus may of course be
                    roughly adjusted, by sliding the body backwards and forwards in its containing
                    tube, before it is attached to the camera, fig. 31; but when this has been done,
                    it must of course remain immoveable. I look upon it,’’ he continues, “as a <hi
                    rend="italic">principle</hi> in the solar microscope, <hi rend="italic">that the
                    magnifier or object-glass should not be moved, but always remain at a fixed
                    distance from the illuminators</hi> Perhaps we do not distinctly understand the
                    import of this passage; but we apprehend that the magnifier or object-glass may
                    be, nay, must be moved in any way that is necessary to produce distinct vision
                    upon the screen, whatever be its distance; and that the essential condition is,
                    that the distance of the illuminator and the object shall be invariable, the
                    object being, if possible, accurately situated in the focus, unless where a
                    slight deviation is necessary to prevent its destruction by the concentrated
                    heat of the solar rays.</p>
                <p>The end of the tube Q is now pushed into another piece of tube at R, fig. 31,
                    which communicates with a conical tube of brass, “having a rectangular prism,

                    the box or camera, where it is to be received on paper (at T), or on a surface
                    of plaster of Paris duly curved to suit its shape.” The camera WWXX is
                    constructed with windows V, V. to permit two persons to view the picture on the
                    table T. Two pieces of wood WW carved out to fill the slope of the upper part of
                    the face, are placed as in the figure (one of them is shown separately in a plan

                    thus spoils the image but he does not mention whether this is the object of the

                <p>The great popularity of the public exhibition made with this instrument has
                    turned the attention of opticians and amateurs to its improvement. Mr Pritchard
                    has written a long and interesting chapter of nearly fifty pages on the subject
                    of solar and oxyhydrogen gas microscopes, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Micrographia</hi> already referred to, and has given a most popular and minute
                    account of all the details of the instrument. These details, to which we must
                    refer our readers, do not belong to an article like the present; and we shall
                    content ourselves with explaining what an oxyhydrogen microscope is, and how the
                    optical apparatus of a solar microscope may be readily converted into that of an
                    oxyhydrogen one, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi></p>
                <p>An oxyhydrogen gas microscope differs from a solar one chiefly in this, that a
                    brilliant light obtained by igniting a ball of lime the ’ size of a pea (hence
                    called the <hi rend="italic">pea</hi> or <hi rend="italic">lime</hi> light, or
                    more appropriately the <hi rend="italic">Drummond</hi> light, from its inventor
                    Mr Drummond) with oxyhydrogen gas, is substituted in place of the solar rays.
                    This enables us to enjoy the amusement of the solar microscope apparatus in all
                    weathers and at all hours of the day.</p>
                <p>As the lime-ball light, however, is at our elbow, it sends forth diverging rays;
                    whereas the rays of the sun are parallel. A very beautiful principle, already
                    referred to in our article <hi rend="smallcaps">Micrometer,</hi> enables us to
                    give the simplest direction for this purpose. Let AB be the illuminating lens of
                    the common solar microscope, throwing the parallel rays <hi rend="italic"
                    >ef</hi> of the sun upon the object <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and let the whole
                    instrument be in perfect adjustment; then, without moving or changing any part
                    of it, we may convert it into an oxyhydrogen microscope, where the light
                    diverges from the lime ball L, simply by placing in front of AB another lens CD,
                    whose focal length is equal to the distance of the lime-ball light L from the
                    lens AB. The oxyhydrogen microscope will then have its objects at <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> illuminated in precisely the same way as they were by the
                    sun’s rays. The two lenses CD, AB, should be in contact, the space being left to
                    show the parallel rays <hi rend="italic">ef.</hi> Now, as L is the focus of the
                    lens CD, the converging rays <hi rend="italic">ef</hi> will be parallel, and
                    consequently will be refracted by AB, exactly as if they had been the rays of
                    the sun.</p>
                <p>If the instrument had been made originally as an oxyhydrogen microscope, with a
                    large and deep lens at AB, which would be required to refract rays diverging
                    from L tó <hi rend="italic">inn,</hi> then we might convert the instrument into
                    a solar microscope by simply placing a <hi rend="italic">concave</hi> lens in
                    front of AB, whose focal distance is equal to the distance of L from AB. This
                    concave lens will give such a divergency to the parallel rays of the sun that
                    they will have their focus at <hi rend="italic">mn.</hi></p>

                    OBJECTS.</hi></p>
                <p>The methods of illuminating microscopic objects that have been long in use have
                    been described in the preceding chapters. They consist in throwing light upon
                    the object, either by means of a mirror or a lens, or both combined; but the
                    nature of the light employed, the magnitude of the pencil, its condition with
                    regard to parallelism, divergency or convergency, and the diameter of the pencil
                    employed, or the direction in which it falls upon the object, have never been
                    discussed as matters of science, and upon which the performance of the finest
                    instrument essentially depends.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819833?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-9833-0048"/>
                <p>In so far as we know, the most important of these topics was pressed upon the
                    notice of the scientific reader by Sir David Brewster, in the year 1820; and in
                    order that the progress of improvement in this essential branch of the art of
                    making discoveries with the microscope may be understood, we shall quote his
                    observations on the subject.</p>
                <p>“The art of illuminating microscopic objects is not of less importance than that
                    of preparing them for observation. No general rules can be given for adjusting
                    the intensity of the illumination to the nature and character of the object to
                    be examined; and it is only by a little practice that this art can be acquired.
                    In general, however, it will be found that very transparent objects require a
                    less degree of light than those that are less so; and that objects which reflect
                    white light, or which throw it off from a number of lucid points, require a less
                    degree of illumination than those whose surfaces have a feeble reflective
                    force.</p>
                <p>“Most opticians have remarked, that microscopic objects are commonly seen better
                    in candle-light than in day-light; a fact which is particularly apparent when
                    very high magnifying powers are employed; and we have often found that very
                    minute objects, which could scarcely be seen at all.in day-light, appeared with
                    tolerable distinctness in candle-light. So far as we know, the cause of this has
                    not been investigated; and as it leads to general views respecting the
                    illumination of microscopic objects, we shall consider it with some
                    attention.</p>
                <p>“Let LL, fig. 38, be a single microscope placed before the eye at E, and let /be
                    a microscopic object placed in its anterior focus, and illuminated by two
                    candles at A and B. As the rays <hi rend="italic">Afa</hi> and B∕S cross at <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> the focus of parallel rays, and as the two shadows of the
                    microscopic object will be formed at <hi rend="italic">a</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">b,</hi> as it were, by rays diverging from <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> the images of these two shadows formed upon the retina will coincide and
                    make only one image, so that the object <hi rend="italic">f</hi> will appear
                    perfectly distinct. If the object, however, is placed either within or without
                    the focus <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> its shadows being formed, as it were, by
                    rays diverging from a point either within or without the principal focus fi wilΓ
                    not coincide on the retina, but appear to form two images, either overlapping
                    each other, or completely separated. If, instead of two candles, A, B, we have
                    4, 5, or 6, we shall have 4, 5,-or 6 overlapping or separated images. Now, as it
                    is impossible to place the different parts of a microscopic object exactly in
                    the focus <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> and as every lens has different foci for the
                    differently coloured rays, and even for homogeneous light, in consequence of its
                    spherical aberration, it necessarily follows, that when microscopic objects are
                    illuminated by light proceeding from several points, the image upon the retina
                    must consist of a number of images not accurately coincident; and hence it
                    becomes of the greatest importance that the object be <hi rend="italic"
                    >illuminated only from one point,</hi> and not from a large surface of light,
                    such as the sky, which is equivalent to an infinite number of radiant
                    points.</p>
                <p>“The following rules may therefore be laid down respecting the illumination of
                    microscopic objects, and the method of viewing them.</p>
                <p>“1. The eye should be protected from all extraneous light, and should not receive
                    any of the light which proceeds from the illuminating centre, excepting that
                    portion of it which is transmitted through or reflected from the object.</p>
                <p>“2. Delicate microscopical observations should not be made when the fluid which
                    lubricates the cornea of the observer’s eye happens to be in a viscid state,
                    which is frequently the case. See Brande’s <hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> vol.
                    ii. p. 127.</p>
                <p>“3. The figure of the cornea will be least injured by the lubricating fluid,
                    either by collecting over any part of the cornea, or moving over it, when the
                    observer is lying on his back, or standing vertically. When he is looking
                    downwards, as into the compound vertical microscope, the fluid has a tendency to
                    flow towards the pupil, and injure the distinctness of the vision.</p>
                <p><hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> 4. If the microscopic object is longitudinal,
                    like a fine hair, or consists of longitudinal stripes, the direction of the
                    lines or stripes should be towards the observer's body, in order that their form
                    may be least injured by the descent of the lubricating fluid over the
                    cornea.</p>
                <p>“5. The field of view should be contracted, so as to exclude every part of the
                    object, excepting that which is under immediate examination.</p>
                <p>“6. The light which is employed for the purpose of illuminating the object,
                    should have as small a diameter as possible. In the day time it should be a
                    single hole in the window-shutter of a darkened room, and at night it should be
                    an aperture placed before an argand lamp.</p>
                <p>“7. In all cases, and particularly when very high powers are requisite, the
                    natural diameter of the light employed should be diminished, and its intensity
                    increased by optical contrivances.</p>
                <p>“8. When a strong light can be obtained, and indeed in almost every case,
                    homogeneous light should be thrown upon the object. This may be done either by
                    decomposing the light with a prism, or by transmitting it through a coloured
                    glass, which has the property of admitting <hi rend="subscript"> fc</hi> only
                    homogeneous rays.”</p>
                <p>In the same article Sir David Brewster has described “a new method of
                    illuminating objects in the solar and the lucernal microscopes.” “The great
                    defects,” says he, “which still attach to the solar and lucernal microscopes,
                    arise from the imperfect method of illuminating the objects. The method
                    suggested by AEpinus, and employed almost universally by opticians, of
                    reflecting the light concentrated by a lens upon the objects, by means of a
                    plane mirror, is good enough so far as it goes; but in consequence of the light
                    arriving from one direction only, the surface of the illuminated object is
                    covered with deep shadows, and the intensity of illumination is by no means
                    sufficient when the power of the instrument is considerable. We propose,
                    therefore, that in the solar microscope the sun’s light should be reflected by a
                    very large mirror through four apertures, A, B, C, D (surrounding the tube T),
                    each of which is furnished with an illuminating lens. The four cones, if
                    condensed, are then received, before they reach their focus, each by an inclined
                    mirror, which reflects them upon the object; the distance of the lens from the
                    mirror, added to the distance of the mirror from the object, being always less
                    than the focal length of the illuminating lens. In the lucernal microscope it
                    would be desirable to place an argand lamp opposite each of the apertures A, B,
                    C, D. By these means the light would <hi rend="italic">fall upon the surface of

                <p>should always fall upon the object, for the reasons already assigned, yet in the
                    preceding method, applied to the solar microscope, a deviation from this rule
                    becomes necessary, for <hi rend="italic">two</hi> reasons: lsi, Because, if the
                    focus of the illuminating lens fall exactly upon the object, it might burn it,
                    or destroy it by corrugation; and, <hi rend="italic">⅛dly,</hi> In the ordinary
                    illuminating lenses, the diameter of the focal spot, or image of the sun, is not
                    sufficient to cover the whole object, or to give a sufficient luminous field
                    around it. For these reasons it is recommended in the preceding extract to place
                    the object a little way within the focus of the illuminator, that is, between
                    the illuminator and its focus. But if the object is such that it cannot be
                    injured by the solar heat, or if the illuminator is sufficiently large to give a
                    focal spot capable of filling the field of the microscope, then the object
                    should be placed in the solar focus of the illuminator.</p>
                <p>After a lapse of nearly ten years, the subject of microscopic illumination was
                    discussed by Dr Wollaston, in his paper on the microscopic doublet, published in
                    the Phil. Trans, for 1829. This eminent philosopher, whose ingenuity never
                    failed in executing in the best manner whatever he attempted, was then on his
                    death-bed; and this, among other papers, was published without that complete
                    revision which its author would otherwise have given it.</p>
                <p>“The state of my health,” says Dr Wollaston, “induces me to commit to writing
                    rather more hastily than I have been accustomed to do, some observations on
                    microscopes; and I trust that, in laying them before the Royal Society, they
                    will meet with that indulgence which has been extended to all my former
                    communications.</p>
                <p>“In the illumination of microscopic objects, whatever light is collected and
                    brought to the eye beyond that which is fully commanded by the object-glasses,
                    tends rather to impede than to assist distinct vision.</p>
                <p>“My endeavour has been to collect as much of the admitted light as can be done by
                    simple means, to a focus in the same plane as the object to be examined. For
                    this purpose I have used with success a plane mirror to direct the light, and a
                    plano-convex lens to collect it; the plane side of the lens being towards the
                    object to be illuminated.”</p>
                <p>These two principles of illumination, the first of which is the same as the first
                    and fifth of the rules already given, though not so fully developed, and the
                    second founded upon a mistaken principle, have been carried into effect by Dr
                    Wollaston in the following manner:</p>
                <p>“T, U, B, E represents a tube about six inches long, and of such a diameter as to
                    preclude any reflection of false light from its sides; and the better to insure
                    this, the inside of the tube should be blackened. At the top of the tube, or
                    within it at a small distance from the top, is placed either a plano-convex lens
                    ET, or one properly curved, so as to have the east aberration, about ∣ths of an
                    nch focus, having its plane side next the object to be viewed; and at the bottom
                    is a circular perforation A, of about γ⅞ths of an inch diameter, for limiting
                    the light reflected from the plane mirror R, and which is to be brought to a
                    focus at α, giving a neat image of the perforation A, at the distance of about
                    ⅛ths of an inch from the lens ET, and in the same plane as the object which is
                    to be examined. The length of the tube, and the. distance of the convex lens
                    from the perforation, may be somewhat varied. The length here given, six inches,
                    being that which it was thought would be most convenient for the height of the
                    eye above the table, the diameter of the image of the perforation A must not,
                    excepting with lower powers than are here meant to be considered, exceed one
                    twentieth of an inch.</p>
                <p>“The intensity of illumination will depend upon the diameter of the illuminating
                    lens and the proportion of the image to the perforation, and may be regulated
                    according to the wish of the observer.</p>
                <p>“The lens ET, or the perforation A, should have an adjustment by which the
                    distance between them may be varied, and the image of the perforation be thus
                    brought up to the same plane as the object to be examined.</p>
                <p>“For the perfect performance of this microscope, it is necessary that the axis of
                    the lenses, and the centre of the perforation A, should be on the same right
                    line. This may be known by the image of the perforation being illuminated
                    throughout its whole extent, and having <hi rend="italic">its whole
                    circumference equally well defined.</hi> For illumination at night, <hi
                    rend="italic">a common bull's-eye lanthorn may be used with great
                    advantage.</hi></p>
                <p>“Supposing the plano-convex lens to be placed at its proper distance from the
                    stage, the image of the perforation may be readily brought into the same plane
                    with the object, by fixing temporarily a small wire across the perforation with
                    a bit of wax, viewing any object placed upon a piece of glass upon the stage of
                    the microscope, and varying the distance of the perforation from the lens by
                    screwing its tube <hi rend="italic">until the image of the</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >taire</hi><hi rend="italic">is seen distinctly at the same time with the object
                    upon the piece of 'glαss.'</hi> ’</p>
                <p>In the preceding passages we have extracted every one of Dr Wollaston’s
                    observations in reference to his method of illuminating microscopic objects, so
                    that the reader will be enabled thoroughly to understand it.</p>
                <p>This method of illumination was highly commended by optical writers. Dr
                    Goring<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Microscopic
                    Illustrations, Exord. p. 1, Lend. 1830.</p></note> considered it as most
                    effective, and enumerates it among the inventions which founded a new era in the
                    history of the microscope; and he elsewhere states, that “there is no
                    modification of daylight illumination superior to that invented by Dr
                    Wollaston.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Microscopic
                    Cabinet, p. 181, Lond. 1832.</p></note></p>
                <p>The marked difference between the methods of illumination proposed by Dr
                    Wollaston and Sir David Brewster, induced the latter to publish, in 1831, a
                    paper “On the Principle of Illumination of Microscopic Objects.”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Edinburgh Journal of Science,
                    new series, No. AI. p. 83.</p></note> In this paper the mistake committed by Dr
                    Wollaston is clearly pointed out. The rays which Dr Wollaston throws upon the
                    object, in place of being <hi rend="italic">rays actually converged to a
                    focus,</hi> as they ought to be, are rays which diverge from a focus situated
                    between the object and the lens. He makes the focal point of the circular margin
                    of the perforation fall upon the object, without considering that the rays which
                    pass through that perforation do not diverge from it, and therefore cannot be
                    collected in the conjugate focus corresponding to the perforation. In Dr
                    Wollaston’s diagram (Phil. Trans. 1829, plate ii. fig. 1), the rays which are
                    incident on the mirror R are actually drawn as parallel rays; and it is quite
                    clear that he meant them to be parallel rays issuing from the bull’s-eye
                    lanthorn which he re <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819859?mode=fullsize"

                    is used, the error is just of the same nature. It is a distinct image of the <hi
                    rend="italic">flame</hi> that should be thrown upon the object; and hence the
                    perforation A should be placed close to the flame,—the source of light and the
                    illuminated object forming the conjugate foci of the lens. After explaining this
                    principle, Sir D. Brewster adds in the same paper :—“I have no hesitation in
                    saying, that the apparatus for illumination <hi rend="italic">requires to be as
                    perfect as the apparatus for vision</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and on this
                    account I would recommend <hi rend="italic">that the illuminating lens should be
                    perfectly free of chromatic and spherical aberration, and that the greatest care
                    be taken to exclude all extraneous light, both from the object and from the eye
                    of the observer”</hi></p>
                <p>At the meeting of the British Association at York in 1831, the preceding methods
                    were communicated to Mr Potter, who was then engaged in inquiries with the
                    reflecting microscope, and who had used only the common method of illuminating
                    his objects. The effect which he obtained by it is thus described.<note

                    information on the necessity of having the focus of the illuminating lens for
                    transparent objects to fall exactly upon the object, when great nicety of vision
                    is required. Having adjusted my microscope carefully on this point (see our
                    figure, p. 41, where the object is seen in the focus of the illuminating rays),
                    I saw quite easily what are called the diagonal lines on the scale from the wing
                    of the white· cabbage butterfly, which has been proposed as a difficult test
                    object by Dr Goring; and it is such a one as those who have only seen the
                    stronger longitudinal striae on scales from the wings of moths and butterflies
                    have little idea of.” By the same means Mr Potter’s instrument “showed him
                    easily not only the striae on the scales of the wing of the small house-moth,
                    but also the diagonal lines.” Mr Potter afterwards applied his microscope, and
                    the new method of illumination, to “a much more difficult object than those just
                    referred to.” This object is the broad bluish band first noticed in the web of
                    the spider, the <hi rend="italic">Clubioηa</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    fleecy-looking web.</p></note> “There can be no doubt,” says Mr Potter, “that
                    this blue band consists of lines produced by the spider, and woven into the
                    delicate tissue. To demonstrate these fibres, however, is a work for an expert
                    microscopist, provided with a first-rate instrument. So critical a defining
                    power is required, at the same time with a large quantity of light, that I doubt
                    much whether any compound refracting microscope, even the best achromatic, will
                    ever show the construction of this web on a transparent object. When viewed in
                    this manner through good common compound microscopes, the blue band can scarcely
                    be perceived at all with a moderately high power. It is better seen as an opaque
                    object by the light of the sun, and it was on this method that I discovered it,
                    when highly illuminated and highly magnified, to be covered very regularly and
                    closely with white spots. This was sufficient information that it was of an
                    uniform texture; but as there is always in such a light a strong display of
                    irradiations and prismatic colours, it was impossible to trace the fibres. I had
                    discovered something of the texture with small globules of glass, used after the
                    manner prescribed by Leewenhoeck; but with very high powers the distinct field
                    of view is so small, that I dared hardly to pronounce decidedly upon the general
                    structure; <hi rend="italic">and it was only after adjusting the illuminating
                    lens of my microscope very carefully, that I saw with it the complete structure

                <p>After this strong testimony to the practical utility òf Sir David Brewster’s
                    method of illumination, and the unquestionable optical principles on which it is
                    founded, we were surprised to observe that Dr Goring and Mr Pritchard should, in
                    the Microscopic Cabinet, published in 1832, still recommend and use a method so
                    decidedly erroneous in theory, and founded on no optical principles whatever. Dr
                    Goring has even contrived what he calls an improved illuminator, which is just
                    Dr Wollaston’s, with a stop in the focus of the lens.</p>
                <p>As the progress of discovery with the microscope must depend upon the scientific
                    illumination of the objects under examination, we shall proceed to describe, in
                    detail, the method of illumination used by Sir David Brewster. Let <hi
                    rend="italic">mn</hi> be the plane surface on which the object rests accurately
                    perpendicular to the axis of the lens, lenses, or mirrors, which constitute the
                    microscope. Let PQRST be a tube from one and a half to two inches long, and
                    wholly lined with black velvet.</p>
                <p>This tube has an opening at ST, and must be so attached by an universal joint, or
                    any analogous contrivance, to the slider-hold-≈ er, that the axis FL of the tube
                    can be inclined at any angle to the surface <hi rend="italic">mn</hi> from 90°,
                    its general position, to 60° or less, as circumstances may require. It should
                    also have a circular motion about its axis, in order that the inclination may be
                    made in any azimuth. A doublet AB, CD, of no aberration, and having a focal
                    length of from half an inch to an inch, is then placed in the tube, with a rack
                    and pinion, or any other adjustment, to bring its focus for parallel rays F, or
                    its conjugate focus for diverging rays, accurately to a point in the plane <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> and upon the object lying in that plane, for examination.
                    A short way below it is placed a metallic speculum (not a silvered glass one),
                    which receives parallel or diverging rays, entering the tube at ST, and reflects
                    them upon the doublet ABCD. This speculum should be of pure virgin silver,
                    notwithstanding its liability to tarnish, and should be wrought with the same
                    care as the plane speculum of a Newtonian telescope; or it might be a
                    rectangular prism of good homogeneous glass, acting by total reflection. This
                    part of the illuminator forms part of the microscope.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>If the axis of the microscope is placed
                    horizontally, or even with some obliquity, we may dispense with this speculum
                    altogether, and direct the tube at once to the illuminating flame.</p></note>
                    The other part of the illuminator, which is detached, is no less essential. It
                    consists of the flame S, which should be as bright and small as will give the
                    necessary quantity of light after condensation. As close to it as possible is
                    placed a stand for holding a screen, with different circular apertures, and a
                    variable rectilineal aperture. If a stronger light is required than can be
                    obtained from the plane S, its light must be condensed into a parallel beam SL,
                    by another doublet of no aberration, A'B'C <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> D',
                    the flame S being in its anterior focus.</p>
                <p>The illuminator, as now described, is adapted to homogeneous light, either as
                    obtained from a monochromatic lamp, or by means of coloured glasses, or from the
                    prismatic spectrum; but if we employ common light, the doublets ABCD, A'B'C'D'
                    must be achromatic. We have <pb break="no" facs="nls:193819872?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-9872-0051"/> mentioned above a variable rectilineal aperture.
                    This is a most essential accompaniment for giving perfection to the vision of
                    lined objects. The aperture should be made to form every possible angle with a
                    vertical line, and should be opened and shut by means of a screw, till as much
                    light is introduced as is necessary to obtain a perfect view of the object. The
                    image of the slit, which is close to the flame, must be thrown upon <hi
                    rend="italic">mn,</hi> so as to be parallel with the lines of the object. When
                    the objects are circular, circular apertures are preferable to any other.</p>
                <p>We have already stated that no light should reach the eye, either from the field
                    of the microscope, or any other source. For this reason it would be desirable to
                    have circular and rectilineal apertures of different sizes, to be placed
                    immediately beneath <hi rend="italic">rnn,</hi> so as to allow no part of the
                    field to be seen, excepting that which is occupied by the object or part of it
                    under examination.</p>
                <p>The above apparatus being provided, let us suppose that the observer is called to
                    examine some structure very difficult to be resolved, such as the blue band of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Clubiona</hi><hi rend="italic">atrox,</hi> or the
                    structure and nature of the lines on test objects. We omit at present the
                    consideration of the preparation of the object and the eye of the observer, and
                    also the nature of the light which he is to use, as these will be separately
                    considered; and confine ourselves to the use of the illuminator. The object is
                    first placed on a piece of thin colourless parallel glass, or film of topaz or
                    sulphate of lime, near its middle, and the microscope is directed to it, so that
                    it can be seen distinctly in the ordinary way. Put the illuminator in its place,
                    and set the proper aperture close to the small plane. Adjust the doublet ABCD by
                    its screw or pinion till a distinct image of the aperture GH is seen in the
                    field; and, by means of the apertures below <hi rend="italic">mη,</hi> any
                    strong or unnecessary light may be still more completely excluded. If the
                    structure is not rendered sufficiently distinct by this process, it will be
                    proper to try the effects of oblique illumination, by inclining the axis FL of
                    the illuminator to the plate <hi rend="italic">mn,</hi> and observing carefully
                    the effects which it produces in different azimuths. If all these means are
                    insufficient, we must have recourse to new auxiliaries,—to monochromatic light
                    if the microscope is not achromatic, or to monochromatic illumination if it is
                    achromatic; and we must prepare both the eye and the object, the one for
                    exhibiting and the other by viewing to the best advantage the structure which we
                    are anxious to develope. These important topics we shall treat in their order,
                    with as much brevity as possible.</p>
