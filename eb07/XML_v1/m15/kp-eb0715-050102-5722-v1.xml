                <p><label type="entry">MORGHEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Raphael</hi></label>, one of
                    the most distinguished engravers that ever lived, was born at Naples in 1758.
                    His father followed the profession of engraver, and from him young Morghen
                    received his earliest instructions; but, in order more profoundly to initiate
                    him in the art, he was afterwards placed as a pupil under the celebrated
                    Volpato. He assisted this great master in engraving the famous pictures of
                    Raffaelle in the Vatican, and the print which represents the miracle of Bolsena
                    is inscribed with his name. He married the daughter of his master, and being
                    invited to Florence to engrave the masterpieces of the Florentine gallery, he
                    removed thither with his wife in 1782. All the works which he produced on this
                    occasion were admirable; one in particular, the copy of Raffaelle’s Madonna
                    della Seggiola, is considered not only as the most excellent in the collection,
                    but as a <hi rend="italic">chef-d'oeuvre</hi> of art. His reputation now became
                    so great as to induce the artists of Florence to recommend him to the grand duke
                    as a fit person to engrave Leonardo da Vinci’s noble composition of the Last
                    Supper, which adorns the wall of the refectory in the Dominican Convent at
                    Milan. This picture is not only itself dilapidated, but the drawing which was
                    made for Morghen being unworthy of the great original, the print of our artist,
                    although an admirable production, fails to convey a correct idea of the style
                    and merit of Leonardo. His fame, however, soon extended over Europe; and the
                    Institute of France, as a mark of their admiration of his talents, chose him as
                    an associate in 1803. In 1812, Napoleon invited Morghen to Paris, and paid him
                    the most flattering attentions. A list of this great artist’s works was
                    published at Florence in 1810; the number comprised two hundred compositions,
                    but subsequently to this period he produced a considerable variety of admirable
                    prints. Amongst the most remarkable of Morghen’s productions, besides those
                    already mentioned, may be noticed the Transfiguration, from Raffaelle; a
                    Magdalen, from Murillo; a Head of the Saviour, from Da Vinci; the Car of Aurora,
                    from Guido; the Hours, from Poussin; the Prize of Diana, from Domenichino; the
                    Monument of Clement XIII. from Canova; Theseus vanquishing the Minotaur;
                    portraits of Dante, Petrarca, Ariosto, Tasso, and a number of other eminent
                    individuals. Some remarks on the style and general merits of this artist will be
