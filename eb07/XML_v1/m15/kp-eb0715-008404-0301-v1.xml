                <p><label type="entry">MILO, <hi rend="smallcaps">T. Annius</hi></label>, a native
                    of Lanuvium, who attempted to obtain the consulship at Rome by means of intrigue
                    and seditious tumults. Clodius the tribune opposed his views; yet Milo would
                    have succeeded but for an event which has given a collateral celebrity to his
                    name. As he was going into the country, attended by his wife and a numerous
                    retinue of gladiators and servants, he met on the Appian road his enemy Clodius,
                    who was returning to Rome with three of his friends and some domestics
                    completely armed. A quarrel arose between the servants; Milo supported his
                    attendants, and the dispute became general; Clodius received many severe wounds,
                    and was obliged to retire to a neighbouring cottage. Milo pursued his enemy in
                    his retreat, and ordered his servants to despatch him. The body of the murdered
                    tribune was carried to Rome, and exposed to public view. The enemies of Milo
                    inveighed bitterly against the violence and barbarity with which the sacred
                    person of a tribune had been treated. Cicero undertook the defence of Milo; but
                    the continual clamours of the friends of Clodius, and the sight of an armed
                    soldiery, which surrounded the judgment seat, so terrified the orator, that he
                    forgot the greater part of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193820314?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-0314-0085"/> his arguments, and the defence he made was weak
                    and injudicious. Milo was condemned, and banished to Massilia. Cicero soon
                    afterwards sent his exiled friend a copy of the oration which he had prepared
                    for his defence, in the form in which it now appears; and Milo, after having
                    read it, exclaimed, “0 Cicero, hadst thou spoken before my accusers in these
                    terms, Milo would not now be eating figs at Marseilles.” The friendship and
                    cordiality of Cicero and Milo were the fruits of long intimacy and familiar
                    intercourse. It was by the successful exertions of Milo that the orator was
                    recalled from banishment, and restored to his friends.</p>
