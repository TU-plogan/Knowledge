                <p><label type="entry">MONTSERRAT</label>, a celebrated monastery of the
                    Benedictines, in Spain. It is about nine leagues to the northwest of Barcelona,
                    being situated on the right bank of the river Llobregat, on an insulated
                    mountain nearly eight leagues in circumference, and raising its head above the
                    surrounding bills till it reaches the height of 3300 feet. It appears, from the
                    road to it, like ahuge pile of most enormous bowls,The bitumen which joined the
                    stones having been decomposed. As the traveller ascends, he observes vegetation
                    gradually decreasing, till towards the top, when it entirely ceases, and nothing
                    is presented to the view but naked rocks, separated like pillars, forming
                    various pyramids, varying in height from 20 to 150 feet. The ascent, though
                    steep and fatiguing, is not dangerous, as far as the church, which is large and
                    richly ornamented; but the constant smoke of upwards of eighty lamps lighted
                    with oil has sullied the statues and pictures, and dimmed the brilliancy of the
                    silver. The number of monks and lay-brothers residing here amounts to upwards of
                    one hundred; besides which, there are twenty-five boys who officiate in.the
                    choir, with a physician, surgeon, and servants. Besides those who reside in the
                    convent, there are several of the monks who live in a kind of hermitage or
                    oratory on the pinnacle of several of the insulated rocks. These hermits are

                    fruits. They are not permitted to eat meat, or to converse with each other, but
                    live a life of perfect solitude, possibly of devotion, during the whole day,
                    excepting when they descend to the general service, which is performed in the
                    church of the convent. The term of the noviciate for the ordinary monks is six
                    months; but those who wish to live in one of the hermitages must pass six years
                    of very severe probation before they can be allowed to reside in them. Although
                    the romantic situation, the extensive and varied prospects, and the natural
                    curiosities of the place, draw to it many travellers who are not infected with
                    any devotional feeling, yet the number of real votaries is very great. These
                    come to say prayers, to pass a few days in devotion and contemplation, to kiss
                    with reverence the hand of a miraculous image of the holy Virgin; and, what is
                    of most importance to the institution, to deposit votive offerings, which are
                    eagerly accepted by the recluse inhabitants. By the rules of the order, they are
                    bound to maintain for three days every pilgrim who comes to pay his devotions to
                    the sacred image. The devotees are allowed bread in the morning, broth at noon,
                    and bread again at night. Although this parsimonious kind of hospitality is not
                    very expensive for each individual who arrives, yet the number is so great that
                    the annual cost is considerable; and although the presents from the rich far
                    exceed the cost of their maintenance, yet these presents are preserved carefully
                    till they are quite spoiled by age. Their original endowment was only the
                    mountain; but by rigid economy they have, in the course of ages, been enabled to
                    purchase considerable estates in the vicinity. Some of these, indeed, have been
                    appropriated by the government to its own use, and probably at no distant period
                    the remainder may share the same fate.</p>
                <p>It is singular that there should be always a number of candidates, both for the
                    cells of the monks and for the hermitages of the recluses. They make a vow never
                    to quit the mountain, and they are not allowed to enter into holy orders. This
                    may perhaps account for the continuance of those who are once admitted; but it
                    is not easy for Protestants to understand that state of mind which induces men
                    in the full vigour of their bodily and mental faculties to withdraw from the
                    world, and abandon every pursuit but that of inactive devotion and the tiresome
                    repetition of prayers, with no variety to amuse and no excitement to animate
                    them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Montserrat,</hi> one of the West Indian islands, belonging
                    to Great Britain, is situated in 16. 47. north latitude, and 92. 13. 25. west
                    longitude. It is about twelve miles in length by seven and a half in breadth,
                    and contains a superficies of 30,000 acres. Like the islands in its vicinity, it
                    runs from south-east to north-west, and presents an equally broken and
                    mountainous surface; an arrangement and physical structure which has led to the
                    conclusion that these islands owe their origin to volcanic eruption. The
                    extremity of the mountain chain terminates on the north in a bold headland
                    coast, where there is no landingplace and little anchorage. The land slopes to
                    the sea in a supcession of conglomerate eminences, which extend to the base of
                    the mountain. On the south there is no approach for vessels of any size until
                    they get to the westward, the sea for a mile or two being studded with huge
                    rocks and shelving banks of coral. The island then suddenly shoots up to the
                    height of 1500 feet, and continues to rise pile above pile, throwing out lateral
                    branches, until they attain the altitude of 2500 feet above the level of the
                    Atlantic. This chain stretches across to the northern extremity of Montserrat,
                    where it terminates, as we have mentioned. Many of the mountains are
                    inaccessible, and are separated from each other by immense perpendicular chasms
                    several hundred feet in depth. These gullies, however, as well as the mountains,
                    are covered to the very summits with lofty woods, and all the beautiful variety
                    of vegetation which a mountainous region within the tropics presents. On the
                    south-west side of the chain is a small <hi rend="italic">souffrière,</hi>
                    situated 1000 feet above the sea, in a dell formed by the approximation of three
                    conical hills, the scenery around which has been described by Mr Coleridge as
                    grand and beautiful in the highest degree. The road from Plymouth, the capital
                    of Montserrat, to this place, after stretching along the margin of the sea,
                    winds inwards by a gentle declivity towards the mountains. The path becomes
                    strewed with the snowy amaryllis <hi rend="italic">(pancratia Cα-ribbaea),</hi>
                    and the scarlet hibiscus; and on either side lime and orange trees form a
                    verdant hedge. The whole of the valley in which the souffrière lies is broken
                    into vast and irregular masses of clay and limestone, which are scattered about
                    in the utmost confusion. The surface of the ground is everywhere hot, indeed so
                    much so near the streams of water which run between the fragments, that it is
                    difficult for the foot to support it more than half a minute. The water at its
                    source boils up violently, and a cloud of vapour constantly settles over it. The
                    sides of the mounds of clay are encrusted with pure alum; but, notwithstanding
                    this, the vegetation of bushes and creepers all round is green and luxuriant,
                    whilst the rampart of mountains in which the solitary valley is embosomed is
                    clothed with woods whose feathery grass-like plumage bends devotedly to the
                    setting sun under the unceasing breath of the trade-wind. There are no marshes,
                    but there is a small lake on the top of a hill about two miles west from
                    Plymouth, which remains constantly full. Plymouth, the capital, is small, but
                    substantially built, of a fine gray stone, and has a comfortable appearance. The
                    geological features of this island are similar to those of the islands in the
                    neighbourhood. Many of the rocks have been termed only vast masses of clay of
                    divers hues; but in the conical hills carbonate of lime, iron pyrites, and
                    aluminous earth abound. The soil is in general dry, light, thin, gravelly, and
                    thickly covered with blocks of clay and sandstone, excepting in the valleys
                    where the loamy earth is deposited by rains. The climate of Montserrat is
                    remarkable for its salubrity, a characteristic which has obtained for it the
                    name of the Montpellier of the West Indies. The temperature of course varies
                    according to the locality and the elevation above the sea. It is subject to
                    hurricanes, but these are neither frequent nor severe. To enumerate the staple
                    products of Montserrat, would be merely to recapitulate what is said of them
                    under the heads of <hi rend="smallcaps">Jamaica, St Lucia,</hi> and other West
                    India islands. Indigo was formerly-raised in great quantities, but this branch
                    of agriculture is now abandoned. The sugar and rum produced are highly esteemed.
                    Of the former there were exported in 1832, 2,322,208 pounds, valued at L.16,549;
                    and of the latter, 74,064 gallons, valued at L.3307. The total amount of exports
                    for the same year was L.21,517, and of imports L.11,067. In 1830 the shipping
                    inwards was 5824 tons, and outwards 6576 tons. By the latest return it appears
                    that, between the 5th of January 1836 and the 5th of January 1837, there were
                    imported into the united kingdom from this island 12,152 cwts. of sugar, 16,256
                    gallons of rum, and 2694 cwts. of molasses.</p>
                <p>The executive of this island is embodied in the government of Antigua, but the
                    inhabitants enjoy their separate council and house <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    assembly, the former consisting of six members and the latter of eight, two
                    being sent from each of the four districts into which Montserrat is divided. The
                    gross annual revenue is about L.2500. There are five places of public worship,
                    capable of containing 1000 persons, and also a Wesleyan missionary station; and
                    there are six public or free schools, with 298 male and 390 female scholars.
                    Montserrat was at one time more densely peopled with Europeans than it is at
                    present. The popu <pb break="no" facs="nls:193824942?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0715-4942-0441"/> lation, including all classes, is now estimated
                    at about 7400. This island was discovered by the companions of Columbus, and
                    called by them Montserrat, a name expressive, in the Spanish language, of its
                    broken and mountainous appearance. It was first settled in 1632, by Sir Thomas
                    Warner, under the protection of the British government. It was taken by the
                    French about the year 1664, but restored to Britain at the peace of Breda, and
                    it has ever since formed a part of our empire.</p>
