                <p><label type="entry">MUSES</label>, certain fabulous deities amongst the Pagans,
                    who were supposed to preside over the arts and sciences. The Muses were
                    originally mere singers and musicians in the service of Osiris, or the great
                    Egyptian Bacchus, under the instruction and guidance of his son Horus; but in
                    succeeding times they were denominated the “daughters of Jupiter and Mnemosyne.”
                    Sir Isaac Newton tells us, that the singing women of Osiris were celebrated in
                    Thrace by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Muses;</hi> and that the daughters
                    of Pierius, a Thracian, who imitated them, were celebrated by the same name.
                    Diodorus Siculus informs us, that Aleman of Messene, a lyric poet who flourished
                    in the 27th Olympiad, or 670 years before Christ, makes them the daughters of
                    Uranus and Terra. It has been asserted by some ancient writers, that at first
                    they were only three in number; but Homer, Hesiod, and other profound
                    mythologists, admit of nine. In his hymn to Apollo, Homer says, “By turns the
                    <hi rend="italic">nine</hi> delight to sing ;” and Hesiod, in his Theogony,
                    names them all. They arc said to preside severally over some art or science, as
                    music, poetry, dancing, astronomy. By certain authors they are called <hi
                    rend="italic">virgins,</hi> because the virtues of education appear unalterable;
                    they are called <hi rend="italic">Muses,</hi> from a Greek word which signifies
                    to explain mysteries, because they have taught things the most curious and
                    important to be known, but which are above the comprehension <hi
                    rend="subscript"> -</hi> of vulgar minds. Each of their names <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827048?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7048-0603"/> is said to
                    include some particular allegory. <hi rend="italic">Clio,</hi> for instance, was
                    so called, because those who are praised in verse acquire immortal fame; <hi
                    rend="italic">Euterpe,</hi> on account of the pleasure accruing to those who
                    hear learned poetry; <hi rend="italic">Thalia</hi> implies for ever flourishing;
                    <hi rend="italic">Melpomene</hi> indicates that her melody insinuates itself
                    into the inmost recesses of the soul; <hi rend="italic">Terpsichore</hi> marks
                    the pleasure which those receive who are versed in the liberal arts; <hi
                    rend="italic">Erato</hi> seems to signify that the learned command the esteem
                    and friendship of all mankind; <hi rend="italic">Polyhymnia</hi> intimates that
                    many poets are become immortal by the number of hymns which they have addressed
                    to the gods; <hi rend="italic">Urania</hi> means that those whom she instructs
                    elevate their contemplations and celebrity to the heavens and the stars; and,
                    lastly, the exquisite voice of <hi rend="italic">Calliope</hi> has acquired her
                    that appellation, as the inventress and guardian of eloquence and rhetoric.
                    Concerning the Muses, the ancients had numberless ingenious and fanciful ideas,
                    on which it would be useless to expatiate. It seems as if the first poets,
                    enchanted with the beauties of nature, were occasionally led to invoke the
                    nymphs of the woods, hills, and fountains; and that, yielding to the prevailing
                    taste for allegory, they gave to these, names relative to the influence which
                    they might be supposed to have over the productions of the mind. At first three
                    Muses only were admitted; but in proportion as improvement was made in the art
                    of versification, its characters and effects were personified, the number of the
                    Muses increased, and the names they now received referred to the charms of
                    poetry, its celestial origin, the beauty of its language, the pleasure and
                    gaiety it inspires, the song and dance which add to it new charms, and the glory
                    with which it is crowned.</p>
