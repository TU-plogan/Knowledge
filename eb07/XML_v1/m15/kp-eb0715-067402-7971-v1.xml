                <p><label type="entry">MYSTICS</label>, <hi rend="italic">mystici,</hi> a kind of
                    religious sect, distinguished by their professing pure, sublime, and perfect
                    devotion, with an entire disinterested love of God, free from all selfish
                    considerations. The mystics, to excuse their fanatical ecstacies, appeal to that
                    passage of St Paul, where he says, “The spirit prays in us by sighs and groans
                    that are unutterable.” Now, if the spirit, say they, pray in u⅛, we must resign
                    ourselves to its motions, and be swayed and guided by its impulse, by remaining
                    in a state of merë inaction. Hence passive contemplation is that state of
                    perfection to which the mystics all aspire. The authors of this mystical
                    science, which sprung up towards the close of the third century, are not known;
                    but the principles from which it was formed are manifest. Its first promoters
                    proceeded upon the known doctrine of the Platonic school, which was also adopted
                    by Origen and his disciples, that the divine nature was infused through all
                    human souls; or that the faculty of reason, from which proceed the health and
                    vigour of the mind, was an emanation from God into the human soul, and
                    comprehended in it the principles and elements of all truth, human and divine.
                    They denied that men could by labour or study excite this celestial flame in
                    their breasts; and therefore they disapproved highly of the attempts of those
                    who, by definitions, abstract theorems, and profound speculations, endeavoured
                    to form distinct notions of truth, and to discover its hidden nature. On the
                    contrary, they maintained that silence, tranquillity, repose, and solitude,
                    accompanied with such acts as might tend to extenuate and exhaust the body, were
                    the means by which the hidden and internal word was excited to produce its
                    latent virtues, and to instruct men in the knowledge of divine things. They
                    reasoned in this manner. Those who behold with a noble contempt all human
                    affairs, who turn away their eyes from terrestrial vanities, and shut all the
                    avenues of the outward senses against the contagious influences of a material
                    world, must necessarily return to God when the spirit is thus disengaged from
                    the impediments which prevented that happy union. And in this blessed frame they
                    not only enjoy inexpressible raptures from their communion with the Supreme
                    Being, but are also invested with the inestimable privilege of contemplating
                    truth undisguised and uncorrupted in its native purity, whilst others behold it
                    in a vitiated and delusive form. The number of the mystics increased in the
                    fourth century, under the influence of the Grecian fanatic, who gave himself out
                    as Dionysius the Areopagite, disciple of St Paul, and probably lived about this
                    period; and, by pretending to higher degrees of perfection than other
                    Christians, and practising greater austerities, their cause gained ground,
                    especially in the eastern provinces, in the fifth century. A copy of the
                    pretended works of Dionysius was sent by Balbus to Louis the Meek in the year
                    824, which kindled the holy flame of mysticism in the western provinces, and
                    filled the Latins with the most enthusiastic admiration of this new religion. In
                    the twelfth century, these mystics took the lead in their method of expounding
                    Scripture; and, by searching for mysteries and hidden meanings in the plainest
                    expressions, forced the word of God into a conformity with their visionary
                    doctrines, their enthusiastic feelings, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193827984?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0715-7984-0675"/> and the system
                    of discipline which they had drawn from the excursions of their irregular
                    fancies. In the thirteenth century they were the most formidable antagonists of
                    the schoolmen, and towards the close of the fourteenth many of them resided and
                    propagated their tenets in almost every part of Europe. In the fifteenth century
                    they had many persons of distinguished merit in their number; and in the
                    sixteenth, previously to the Reformation, if any sparks or remains of piety
                    subsisted under the despotic empire of superstition, they were only to be found
                    amongst the mystics.</p>
