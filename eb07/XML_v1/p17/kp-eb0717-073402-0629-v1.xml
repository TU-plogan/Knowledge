                <p><label type="entry">PIAUHY</label>, a large province of Brazil, is bounded on the
                    east by the Serra Hibiappaba, which separates it from the province of Seara; on
                    the south by the Serra of Piauhy, which separates it from Pernambuco; on the
                    north by the Atlantic Ocean; and on the west it is separated from Maranham by
                    the river Parnahiba. Although classed amongst the inland provinces, it has about
                    eighteen leagues of coast, its form being almost triangular, whilst on the
                    southern side, where it borders on Pernambuco and Goyaz, it expands to upwards
                    of one hundred leagues in width. It stretches from the Atlantic Ocean inland,
                    that is, from north to south, about one hundred and twenty leagues; so that if
                    we estimate its average breadth at fifty leagues, its area will be equal to that
                    of England and Wales. Originally it formed a comarca of Maranham; but in the
                    year 1718 it was erected into a separate province, although it did not receive
                    resident governors until forty years after that period. Originally Piauhy was
                    explored and subdued on account its pastures, and not for the sake of slaves or
                    from its possessing mines of the precious minerals or metals, for in these it
                    appears to be deficient. Domingos Affbnso, its conqueror, was the most extensive
                    grazier in Pernambuco, and at his death bequeathed thirty of his large fazendas
                    to the Jesuits, in trust for specified objects of charity; but on the expulsion
                    of the order the trust fell into the hands of the crown. These estates, with
                    three others added by the Jesuits, continue to be administered by government for
                    the purpose intended by the original donor. The number of fazendas in the
                    province is very great; as early as the year 1724 they amounted to no less than
                    four hundred. It is to Piauhy that the neighbouring provinces of Pernambuco,
                    Maranham, Bahia, and Minas Geraes look chiefly for their supply of cattle. A
                    flourishing fazenda produces annually nearly one thousand calves; but after
                    deductions for tithes and herdsmen, it is only able to export from two hundred
                    and fifty to three hundred oxen. The cows are always reserved for breeding and
                    home consumption; the rest are accounted for by the plague of flies,
                    vampire-bats (from which the folds afford no security), jaguars, snakes,
                    poisonous herbs (of which there are many kinds), and, above all, by drought,
                    which frequently converts all the grass in the country into standing hay; and
                    when that is consumed, the cattle perish by thousands.</p>
                <p>Piauhy occasionally suffers greatly from drought, but the evils consequent
                    thereupon are much ameliorated by the presence of several trees which yield
                    abundance of grateful and wholesome juices. Travellers have sometimes owed their
                    lives to the <hi rend="italic">imbuzeiro</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    a remarkable tree, which is found in the most arid regions of Brazil. “Bulbs,”
                    says Southey, “about a palm in diameter, and full of water, are attached to its
                    shallow roots. Arruda names this tree <hi rend="italic">spondia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tuberosa.</hi> Its fruit is smaller than a hen’s <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> gg&gt; <hi rend="superscript"> an</hi> d, under a
                    tough skin, contains a succulent pulp of a grateful flavour, at once acid and
                    sweet. The Brazilians make a dainty of its juice with curds and sugar. The
                    people of Piauhy make a beverage from the <hi rend="italic">bwriti,</hi> one of
                    the loftiest and most beautiful of the palm tribe, but which grows only in moist
                    or swampy places. Its fruit is about the size and shape of a hen’s egg, covered
                    with red scales arranged spirally; under these is an oily pulp of the same
                    vermilion colour. The liquor which they prepare from it is said to be nutritious
                    and palatable; but if drunk in excess it has the singular property of tinging
                    the skin and the white of the eyes, without appearing to affect the general
                    health.” Another tree of great importance to a country like Piauhy, where
                    drought is the great evil, is the <hi rend="italic">piqui</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> which prospers in a dry and sandy soil, and produces
                    abundantly a wholesome oily fruit, the size of an orange, to which the
                    inhabitants are very partial. It grows to the height of fifty feet, having a
                    proportional girth; and the timber is useful for ship-building. Some parts of
                    the country have been redeemed from a desert state by tanks being formed on the
                    rivers which dry up in summer. By thus laying in a store of water during the
                    season when the streams are at the fullest, the herdsmen were enabled to
                    establish fazendas, where otherwise it would have been certain destruction to
                    the cattle to allow them to range.</p>
                <p>The capital of this province, which, till the year 1762, bore the name of Mocha,
                    received from king Joze, along with the title of city, the appellation of
                    OEyras, in honour of the great minister, the first count of that name. It is
                    situated on a small stream, which, three miles lower down, falls into the
                    Caninde, a confluent of the great Parnahiba, with which it unites twenty miles
                    below. The town is small, and only remarkable from its being the capital of the
                    province. It contains a church and two chapels; and the houses, although not
                    numerous, are said to be commodiously and even elegantly constructed. The
                    greater part of the inhabitants are Europeans, and, including the surrounding
                    district, amount to fourteen or fifteen thousand.</p>
                <p>A larger and much more important town than the capital, is St Joam da Barra da
                    Parnahiba, situated seventy-five leagues north of OEyras. It is built on sandy
                    ground, five leagues from the sea, on the right bank of the eastern and largest
                    branch of the river from which it takes its name. This is the seaport of the
                    province, but the river, although navigable for barks of considerable tonnage
                    more than a hundred leagues up, has diminished in depth so much near its
                    embouchure, that vessels which used to ascend to the town are now under the
                    necessity of mooring two leagues below it. The entrance is besides rendered
                    dangerous by shoals and a heavy surf. Parnahiba contains some houses of one
                    story above the ground floor, which are not seen in any other town in the
                    province. This place is badly supplied with water, and fevers prevail to some
                    extent; but its advantageous position on the great stream which traverses the
                    western limits of the province, as well as its being the only seaport, secures
                    it a considerable trade, and it is a great dépôt for cotton and hides. The
                    surrounding country produces also excellent melons, and the tobacco raised in
                    the south-western part of the province is prefeιred even to that of Bahia. There
                    are several other towns, the principal of which is Piracuruca, situated on a
                    river of the same name, and lying on the line of road from Villa Vicoza to
                    Pernambuco. It carries on a considerable trade in cotton, and mandioc is
                    cultivated to some extent. The river Piauhy, from which the province derives its
                    name, originates in the southern frontier, and, running northward through
                    pasture lands, enters the Caninde fifty miles below <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193500642?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-0642-0735"/> the capital,
                    after a course of 140 miles. There are no serras of any consequence, nor any
                    large forests, in this province. It consists, indeed, of vast grassy plains,
                    little wooded, but in which numerous tall herbs attest the bounty of the sun.
                    The population maybe estimated at 50,000. <hi rend="smallcaps">(r.r.r.)</hi></p>
