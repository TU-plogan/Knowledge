                <p><label type="entry">PAULICIANS</label>, a branch of the ancient Manicheans, so
                    called from their founder, Paulus, an Armenian, who lived in the seventh
                    century, and who, with his brother John, both of Samosata, formed this sect; but
                    others are of opinion that they were so called from another Paul, an Armenian by
                    birth, who lived under the reign of Justinian II. In the seventh century a
                    zealot called Constantine revived this drooping sect, which had suffered much
                    from the violence of its adversaries, and was ready to expire under the severity
                    of the imperial edicts, and the zeal with which these were carried into
                    execution. The Paulicians, however, by their number, and the countenance of the
                    Emperor Nicephorus, became formidable in all the East.</p>
                <p>But the cruel rage of persecution, which had for some years been suspended, broke
                    forth with redoubled violence under the reigns of Michael Curopalates and Leo
                    the Armenian, who inflicted capital punishment upon such of the Paulicians as
                    refused to return into the bosom of the church. The Empress Theodora, tutoress
                    of the Emperor Michael, in 845 obliged them either to recant or to quit the
                    empire; upon which several of them were put to death, and more retired amongst
                    the Saracens.</p>
                <p>Upon this they entered into a league with the Saracens; and choosing as their
                    chief an officer of the greatest resolution and valour, whose name was Carbeus,
                    they declared against the Greeks a war which was carried on during fifty years
                    with the greatest exasperation and fury. During these commotions, some
                    Paulicians spread their doctrines amongst the Bulgarians; but many of them,
                    either from a principle of zeal for the propagation of their opinions, or from a
                    natural desire of flying from the persecution which they suffered under the
                    Grecian yoke, retired, about the close of the eleventh century, from Bulgaria
                    and Thrace, and formed settlements in other countries. Their first migration was
                    into Italy; and thence, in process of time, they sent colonies into almost all
                    the other provinces of Europe, and formed gradually a considerable number of
                    religious assemblies, who adhered to their doctrine. In Italy they were called
                    <hi rend="italic">Patarini,</hi> from a certain place called Pataria, being a
                    part of the city of Milan, where they held their assemblies; and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gathari</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gazaτi,</hi> from Gazaria, or
                    the Lesser</p>
                <p>Tartary. In France they were called <hi rend="italic">Albigenses,</hi> and
                    anxiously concealed their more obnoxious doctrines. The first religious assembly
                    which the Paulicians had formed in Europe is said to have been discovered at
                    Orleans in 1017, under the reign of Robert, when many of them were condemned to
                    be burned alive. The ancient Paulicians, according to Photius, expressed the
                    utmost abhorrence of Manes and his doctrine; but it is nevertheless certain that
                    their successors were Manicheans. The Greek writers comprise their errors under
                    the six following heads. They denied that this inferior and visible world is the
                    production of the Supreme Being, distinguishing the Creator of the world and of
                    human bodies from the Most High God who dwells in the heavens; they treated
                    contemptuously the Virgin Mary; they refused to celebrate the institution of the
                    Lord’s Supper; they loaded the cross of Christ with contempt and reproach; they
                    rejected the books of the Old Testament, and looked upon the writers of that
                    sacred history as inspired by the Creator of this world, and not by the Supreme
                    God; and they excluded presbyters and elders from all share in the
                    administration of the church.</p>
