                    Galoup de la</hi></label>, the celebrated but unfortunate French navigator, was
                    born at Albi in the year 1741. His father intended to train him up to a maritime
                    life, for which purpose he sent him, when very young, to the marine school,
                    where he became enthusiastically attached to his profession, and ambitious to
                    emulate the fame of the most celebrated navigators. He was appointed midshipman
                    on the 19th of November 1756, and behaved with great bravery in that station,
                    having been severely wounded in the engagement between Hawke and Conflans on the
                    20th of November 1759. The <hi rend="italic">Formidable,</hi> in which he
                    served, was taken, after a vigorous resistance; and it is probable that Perouse
                    reaped some advantage from his acquaintance with British officers. He was
                    promoted, on the 1st of October 1764, to the rank of lieutenant; and as he
                    abhorred a life of ease and idleness, he contrived to be employed in six
                    different ships of war during the peace between Great Britain and France. In
                    1776 he was promoted to the rank of master and commander. In 1779 he commanded
                    the <hi rend="italic">Amazone,</hi> belonging to the squadron of Vice-admiral
                    Count d’Estaing; and when that officer engaged Admiral Byron, the duty assigned
                    to La Pérouse was to carry the orders of the admiral to the whole of the line.
                    He afterwards took the sloop <hi rend="italic">Ariel,</hi> and contributed to
                    the capture of the <hi rend="italic">Experiment.</hi> In the year 1782, La
                    Pérouse was sent with the <hi rend="italic">Sceptre</hi> of seventy-four guns,
                    and two frigates of thirty-six guns each, having some troops and field-pieces on
                    board, to destroy the English settlements in Hudson’s Bay; a task which he
                    easily accomplished, as there was nothing on shore to oppose the smallest force.
                    When he had destroyed the settlements, having learned that some of the English
                    had fled at his approach into the woods, he generously left them provisions, and
                    arms to defend themselves against the savages. In the year 1785, he was
                    appointed to the command of some ships commissioned for a voyage round the
                    world, which unfortunately proved his last. Of this voyage, as far as it was
                    accomplished, full accounts have already been published, from which it is
                    manifest that Pérouse was admirably qualified to discharge such a trust. He was
                    an experienced and skilful seaman; skilled in mathematical and physical science;
                    uncorrupted by that false philosophy which disgraced many of his attendants; and
                    capable of the utmost perseverance in every commendable pursuit. To these
                    valuable qualities he added caution and courage, with a disposition truly
                    benevolent towards the savages whom he visited. Most of the calamities attendant
                    on the voyage, with the exception of the last, were occasioned by the
                    disobedience of his officers, or their neglecting to follow his advice. The last
                    despatches received from this excellent man were dated from Botany Bay, the 7th
                    of February 1788; but since that period no authentic account of him has ever
                    been obtained.</p>
