                    most unfortunate Protestant merchant at Toulouse, inhumanly butchered under
                    forms of law which were prostituted to shelter the sanguinary dictates of
                    ignorant and fanatical zeal. He had <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193743269?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3269-0785"/> lived forty
                    years at Toulouse. His wife was an Englishwoman of French extraction, and they
                    had five sons, one of whom, Louis, had turned Catholic through the persuasions
                    of a Catholic maid who had lived thirty years in the family. In October 1761 the
                    family consisted of Calas, his wife, Mark Antony their son, Peter their second
                    son, and this maid. Antony was educated for the bar; but being of a melancholy
                    turn of mind, was continually dwelling on passages from authors on the subject
                    of suicide, and one night in that month hanged himself on a bar laid across two
                    folding doors in the shop. The crowd collected by the confusion of the family on
                    so shocking a discovery took it into their heads that he had been strangled by
                    the family to prevent his changing his religion, and that this was a common
                    practice among Protestants. The officers of justice adopted the popular tale,
                    and were supplied by the mob with what they accepted as conclusive evidence of
                    the fact. The fraternity of White Penitents got the body, buried it with great
                    ceremony, and performed a solemn service for him as a martyr; the Franciscans
                    did the same; and after these formalities no one doubted the guilt of the
                    devoted heretical family. Being all condemned to the torture in order to bring
                    them to confession, they appealed to the parliament; but this body, being as
                    weak and as wicked as the subordinate magistrates, sentenced the father to the
                    torture, ordinary and extraordinary, to be broken alive upon the wheel, and then
                    to be burnt to ashes; a diabolical decree, which, to the shame of humanity, was
                    actually carried into execution. Peter Calas, the other son, was banished for
                    life; and the rest were acquitted. The distracted widow, however, found some
                    friends, and among these Voltaire, who laid her case before the council of state
                    at Versailles; and the parliament of Toulouse was ordered to transmit the
                    proceedings. These the king and council unanimously agreed to annul; the chief
