                    king of Boeotia, was beloved by Jupiter, who debauched her in the similitude of
                    a lambent flame, and then carried her from Epidaurus to a desert island called
                    <hi rend="italic">OEnopia,</hi> which afterwards obtained her own name.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">AEgina,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Ancient Geography,</hi> an
                    island in the Saronic gulf, 20 miles distant from the Piraeus, formerly vying
                    with Athens in naval power, and at the sea-fight of Salamis disputing the palm
                    of victory with the Athenians. It was the country and kingdom of AEacus, who
                    called it <hi rend="italic">AEgina,</hi> from his mother’s name, it being before
                    called <hi rend="italic">OEnopia.</hi> (Ovid.) The inhabitants were called <hi
                    rend="italic">AEginetae,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">AEginenses.</hi> The Greeks
                    had a common temple dedicated to Jupiter in AEgina, the remains of which still
                    exist. The AEginetae applied themselves to commerce, and were the first who
                    coined money called <hi rend="italic">Νόμισμα</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Αιγιvαιον∙,</hi> hence <hi rend="italic">AEgineticum aes,</hi> formerly in
                    great repute. The inhabitants were called <hi rend="italic">Myrmidones,</hi> or
                    a nation of ants, from their great application to agriculture. The island was
                    reckoned 180 stadia, or 22 miles and a half, in circumference. It is now called
                    <hi rend="italic">AEgina,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">g</hi> soft and the <hi
                    rend="italic">i</hi> short, and was generally the seat of the Greek government
                    in 1828 and 1829. The temple above mentioned is situated upon the summit of a
                    mountain called <hi rend="italic">Panhellenius,</hi> at some distance from the
                    shore. It was of the Doric order, and had six columns in front. Twenty-one of
                    the exterior columns are yet standing, with two in the front of the pronaos and
                    of the posticum, and five of the number which formed the ranges of the cell. The
                    entablature, except the architrave, is fallen. The stone is of a light brownish
                    colour, much eaten in many places, and indicating a very great age. Some of the
                    columns have been injured by boring to their centres for the metal. In several,
                    the junction of the parts is so exact that each seems to consist of one piece.
                    This ruin Mr Chandler considers as scarcely to be paralleled in its claim to a
                    remote antiquity. The situation, on a lonely mountain at a distance from the
                    sea, has preserved it from total demolition amid all the changes and accidents
                    of numerous centuries. The soil of this island is, as described by Strabo, very
                    stony, especially the bottoms; but in some places not unfertile in grain.
                    Besides corn, it produces olives, grapes, and almonds; and abounds in pigeons
                    and partridges. It has been related, that the AEginetans annually wage war with
                    the feathered race, carefully collecting or breaking their eggs, to prevent
                    their multiplying to such numbers as to produce a famine. They have no hares,
                    foxes, or wolves. The rivers in summer are all dry.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">AEgina,</hi> the capital of the above island. Its site has
                    been long forsaken. Instead of the temples mentioned by Pausanias, there are 13
                    lonely churches, all very mean; and two Doric columns supporting their
                    architrave. These stand by the sea-side, towards the low cape; and, it has been
                    supposed, are a remnant of a temple of Venus, which was situated by the port
                    principally frequented. The walls belonging to the ports and arsenal were of
                    excellent masonry, and may be traced to a considerable extent, above, or nearly
                    even with the water. At the entrance of the mole, on the left, is a small chapel
                    of St Nicholas; and opposite, a square tower with steps before it, detached from
                    which a bridge was laid across, to be removed on any alarm. This structure,
                    which is mean, was erected by the Venetians while at war with the Turks in
                    1693.</p>
