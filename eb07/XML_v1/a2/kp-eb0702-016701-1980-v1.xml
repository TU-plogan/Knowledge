                <p><label type="entry">ADVOCATE</label>, among the Romans, a person skilled in their
                    law, who undertook the defence of eauses at the bar. The Roman advocates
                    answered to one part of the office of a barrister in England, viz. the pleading
                    part; for they never gave counsel, that being the business of thejwrå- <hi
                    rend="italic">consulti.</hi></p>
                <p>The Romans, in the first ages of their state, held the profession of an advocate
                    in great honour; and the seats of their bar were crowded with senators and
                    consuls, they whose voices commanded the people thinking it an honour to be
                    employed in defending them. They were styled <hi rend="italic">comites,
                    honorati, clarissimi,</hi> and even <hi rend="italic">patroni</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> as if their clients were not less obliged to them than
                    freedmen to their masters. The bar was not at that time venal. Those who aspired
                    to honours and offices took this way of gaining an interest in the people, and
                    always pleaded <hi rend="italic">gratis.</hi> But no sooner were luxury and
                    corruption introduced into the commonwealth, than the bar became a sharer in
                    them. Then it was that the senators let out their voices for pay, and zeal and
                    eloquence were sold to the highest bidder. To put a stop to this abuse, the
                    tribune Cineius procured a law to be passed, called from him <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lex</hi><hi rend="italic">Cincia,</hi> whereby the advocates were forbidden to
                    take any money of their clients. It had before this been prohibited the
                    advocates to take any presents or gratuities for their pleading. The emperor
                    Augustus added a penalty to it; notwithstanding whieh, the advocates played
                    their part so well, that the emperor Claudius thought it an extraordinary
                    circumstance, when he obliged them not to take above eight great sesterces,
                    which are equivalent to about L.64 sterling, for pleading each cause.</p>

                    appointed for the defence of the church, rather by arms and authority than by

                    every person was obliged to maintain his own property by force. Bishops and
                    abbots not being permitted to bear arms, and the scholastic or gowned advocates
                    being equally unacquainted with them, recourse was had to knights, noblemen,
                    soldiers, or even to princes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Nominative</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Advocates,</hi>
                    those appointed by a king or pope. Sometimes the churches petitioned kings,
                    &amp;c. to appoint them an advocate; at other times this was done of their own
                    accord. By some regulations, no person was capable of being elected advocate
                    unless he had an estate in land in the same country.</p>

                    those appointed by other superior ones, acting under them, and accountable to

                    as, the superior quality of the principal advocate, his being detained in war,
                    or being involved in other affairs; but chiefly the too great distance of some
                    of the church-lands, and their lying in the dominions of foreign princes.</p>

                    Advocates</hi><hi rend="italic">were</hi> those who had the authority in chief,

                    >general</hi> advocates. Such, in many cases, were kings, &amp;c. when they had
                    either been chosen advocates, or became such by being founders or endowers of
                    churches. Princes had also another title to advocateship, some of them
                    pretending to be <hi rend="italic">advocati nati</hi> of the churches within
                    their dominions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Advocates,</hi> in the English courts, are more

                    ADVOCATES,</hi> in Scotland, a respectable body of lawyers, who plead in all
                    causes before the courts of session, justiciary, and exchequer. They are also
                    entitled to. plead in the house of peers and other supreme courts in
                    England.</p>
                <p>A candidate for the office of an advocate undergoes three several trials: the
                    first is in Latin, upon the civil law, and Greek and Roman antiquities; the
                    second, in English, upon the municipal law of Scotland; and, in the third, he is
                    obliged to defend a Latin thesis, which is impugned by three members of the
                    faculty. All this, however, has become very much matter of form. Immediately
                    before putting on the gown, the candidate makes a short Latin speech to the
                    lords, and then takes the oaths to the government and <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">fideli.</hi></p>
                <p>The faculty at present (1829) consists of 324 members. As the profession of an
                    advocate is esteemed the genteelest in Scotland, many gentlemen of fortune
                    become members of the faculty without having any intention of practising at the
                    bar. This circumstance greatly increases their number, gives dignity to the
                    profession, and enriches their library and public fund. It is from this
                    respectable body that all vacancies on the bench are generally supplied.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lord ADVOCATE,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kings ADVOCATE,</hi>
                    one of the eight great officers of state in Scotland, who as such sat in
                    parliament without election. He is the principal crown lawyer in Scotland. His
                    business is to act as a public prosecutor, and to plead in all causes that
                    concern the crown, but particularly in such as are of a criminal nature. The
                    office of king’s advocate is not very ancient: it seems to have been established
                    about the beginning of the sixteenth century. Originally he had no power to
                    prosecute crimes without the concurrence of a private party; but, in the year
                    1597, he was empowered to prosecute crimes at his own instance. He has the
                    privilege of pleading in court with his hat on. This privilege was first granted
                    to Sir Thomas Hope, who having three sons lords of session, it was thought
                    indecent that the father .should plead uncovered before the sons, who as judges
                    sat covered.</p>
