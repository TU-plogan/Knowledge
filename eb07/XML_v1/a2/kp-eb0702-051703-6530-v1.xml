                <p><label type="entry">ALLAHABAD</label>, a large province of Hindostan, which is
                    situated between the 24th and 26th degrees of N. lat. It is bounded on the north
                    by the provinces of Oude and Agra, on the south by the Hindoo’ province of
                    Gund-wana, on the east by the provinces of Bahar and Gund-wana, and on the west
                    by the provinces of Malwah änd Agra. It may be estimated in length at 270
                    ‘miles, by 129 the average breadth. The principal geographical and political
                    subdivisions of Allahabad are the following: lst, The District of Allahabad; 2d,
                    Benares; 3d, District of Mirzapoor; 4th, District of Juanpoor; 5th, The Re-wah
                    Territory; 6th, District of Bundeleund; 7th, District of Cawnpoor; 8th,
                    Maniepoor Territory.</p>
                <p>The surface of this province is unequal. Along the shores of the Ganges and Jumna
                    the eountry is flat and extremely fertile; but to the south-west, in the
                    Bundel-cund territory, the land rises, aňd is diversified with high hills, which
                    abound in strongholds. This mountainous region contains the famous diamond mines
                    of Pannah. Its climate is also more temperate than that of the lower plains,
                    which are extremely sultry, and subject to hot winds. The province is in many
                    parts well watered. The principal rivers in the north are the Ganges, the Jumna,
                    the Goomty, and the Caramnassa, besides other streams of inferior note, which,
                    supplying abundant moisture, diffuse fertility over several of the subdivisions,
                    especially those of Benares and Allahabad. In the high country water is scarce,
                    and the principal rivers are the Kena and Goggra. The husbandman consequently
                    depends for supplies of moisture on the periodical rains, or on wells, whieh are
                    often sunk to a great depth. On the whole, however, Allahabad may be elassed
                    among the most productive provinces of India. The exports are, diamonds,
                    saltpetre, opium, sugar, indigo, eotton, eotton-eloths, &amp;c. The imports are
                    various, consisting of European manufactures, salt from the maritime ports of
                    Bengal being one of the staple articles in regular demand. The principal towns
                    within this province are, Benares, Allahabad, Callinjer, Chatterpoor, Juanpoor,
                    Mirzapoor, Chunar, and Ghazipoor. The inhabitants are estimated at 7,000,000,
                    the proportion being one Mahometan to eight Hindoos. In remote times this
                    province held a high rank, as it contained Allahabad and Benares, two of the
                    most venerated plaees θf Brahminical pilgrimage. The province is now
                    comprehended within the British jurisdiction, with the exception of a small
                    portion of the Bundelcund division, whieh is held by petty chiefs under British
                    protection.</p>
                <p>It is mentioned by Abul Fazel, that the territory whieh now forms the province of
                    Allahabad was invaded in the year 1020 by Sultan Mahmood of Ghizni. He returned
                    in 1023, but made no permanent establishment. It was afterwards subdued by the
                    Patan emperors of Delhi, and swallowed up in the Mogul empire, of whieh it was
                    formed into a distinet province by the emperor AEbar, under the name of
                    Allahabad, which it still retains. On the dissolution of the Mogul dynasty, the
                    northern quarter was taken possession of by the nabobs of Oude. But in 1764,
                    through the interference of Lord Clive with the nabob of Oude, Korah and
                    Allahabad were eeded to Shah Allum, the nominal though fugitive sovereign of
                    Delhi. In 1772 they reverted to the nabob of Oude; andin 1775 the Bengal
                    government acquired the Benares districts by treaty with Azoph-ud-Dowlah, and
                    Allahabad and the adjaeent districts in 1801 by ecssĩon, from his successor on
                    the throne of Oude. The south-eastern districts were received from the Mahratta
                    peshwa in 1803, in exchange for a tract of equal value in the Carnatie, above
                    the Ghauts and Gujerat. (Hamilton’s <hi rend="italic">Geographical, Statistical,

                    of Allahabad, most "favourably situated in a dry and healthy soil, on a
                    triangle, at the ĵunetion of the two mighty streams, tlιe Ganges and the Jumna.
                    It has been occasionally the residence of royalty, and still contains some fine
                    ruins; but it never appears to have beęn a great and magnifieent eĩty, and has
                    now a desolate and ruinous appearance, having obtained among the natives the
                    name of Fakeerabad, or Beggar abode. The city is small, with very poor houses,
                    and narrow, irregular streets, eonfined to the banks of the Jumna. Nine-tenths
                    of the present native buildings are of mud, raised on the foundations of more
                    substantial brick edifiees, whieh have long ago fallen to deeay. The port, whieh
                    is plaeed at the distance of a quarter of a mile, on a tongue of land washed by
                    the Jumna and the Ganges, is lofty and extensive, and completely commands the
                    navigation of the two rivers. It is strong both by nature and art, and has a
                    noble eastle. It has gained as mueh in strength as it has lost in appearanee by
                    some modern improvements which it has undergone, by whieh its lofty towers have
                    been lowered into bastions and ravelins, and its high stone ramparts covered
                    with turf parapets, and obscured by a green sloping glaeis. It is still,
                    however, according to Bishop Heber, a striking plaee, and its principal gate,
                    surmounted by a dome, with a wide hall beneath, surrounded by areades and
                    galleries, and ornamented with rude but glowing paintings, forms a noble
                    entrance to a plaee of arms. The barracks are handsome and neat. On one side is
                    a large range of buildings, whieh are still in the oriental style, and eontain
                    some noble vaulted rooms, ehiefly oeeupied as officers’ quarters, and
                    overlooking from a considerable height the rapid stream and eraggy banks of the
                    Jumna. The principal mosque, which is still in good repair, ' is but little
                    frequented. This building, which is solid and stately, but without mueh
                    ornament, is advantageously situated on the banks of the Jumna, adjoining the
                    eity on one side, and an esplanade before the glacis of the fort on the other.
                    It was at one time the residence of the general of the station, but has sinee
                    been restored to its original destination. The finest buildings in the
                    neighbourhood are the sultan’s serai and garden. The former is a noble
                    quadrangle, with four fine Gothie gateways, surrounded within an embattled wall
                    by a range of eloisters for the accommodation of travellers, the whole now in a
                    dilapidated condition. Adjoining the serai is a neglected garden, plant <pb

                    princes and a prineess of the imperial family. The houses of the eivil servants

                <p>Allahabad is one of the most noted resorts of Hindoo pilgrimage. It owes its
                    eelebrity to the confluence of three saered rivers, the Ganges, the Jumna, and
                    the Se-reswati. This latter river is no longer to be seen; but the Hindoos
                    assert that it joins the other two under ground, and that consequently the same
                    religious merit is acquired by bathing at this saered eonfluenee as by bathing
                    in all the three separate rivers. From this superstition a shameful tax is
                    collected by government, of three rupees, for permission to bathe in the river;
                    and crowds of pilgrims eollect for this purpose from all quarters. They amounted
                    in 1812-13 to 218,792; and by their eagerness to rush into the river to bathe,
                    they exposed themselves to risks which were sometimes fatal. The gross amount of
                    the receipts amounted in 1812-13 to 221,066 rupees. In 1815-16 they had fallen
                    off to 79,779 rupees. Allahabad is now the permanent station of the British
                    eourt of justice, which makes an annual cireuit through the province for
                    deciding suits between the natives. Allahabad was taken in the year 1765 by the
                    British army under Sir R. Fletqjιer∙ It is 820 miles from the sea by the river.
                    The travelling distance is only 550 miles, from Benares 53, from Lueknow 57,
                    from Agra 296, and from Delhi 212 miles. In 1803 the population, exclusive of
                    the garrison, amounted to 20,000. Long. 81. 50. E. Lat. 25. 27. N. ∙ (r.)</p>
