                    the year 491, and was inaugurated that same year on the 11th of April.
                    Anastasius reigned 27 years 3 months and 3 days, and died July the 10th, A. c.
                    518, in the 88th year of his age.</p>

                    >Artemius,</hi> was in the year 713 elevated to the throne of Constantinople,
                    from the low station of a secretary, by the free voice of the senate and Roman
                    people. His natural talents, improved by education and daily exertion, enabled
                    him to manage with great prudence the affairs of the empire during the time that
                    he was secretary to his predecessor Philippicus. The Saracens had made inroads
                    upon Asia Minor in the beginning of his reign; but he sent a strong army to the
                    frontiers of Syria for its protection, under the command of Leo the Isaurian, a
                    man of great military experience. These enemies of the empire also meditated the
                    design of taking Constantinople; but the vigilance of Anastasius defeated their
                    purpose, by providing a formidable naval force, -repairing and strengthening the
                    walls of the city, and by forcing all the inhabitants either to provide
                    themselves with provisions for three years, or instantly to depart from the
                    city. Disappointed in their design, the enemy’s fleet sailed to Phoenicia, and
                    the imperial fleet assembled at Rhodes to watch the motions of the enemy. But
                    the measures of the emperor received a severe check from the conduct of the
                    sailors, who raised a mutiny, and slew their admiral for no other cause than his
                    honourable endeavours to maintain proper discipline in the fleet. Justly
                    dreading severe punishment, the seamen raised the standard oí rebellion,
                    declared Anastasius unworthy to reign, and conferred the purple upon one
                    Theodosius, a person of mean birth. Informed of this sedition, Anastasius fled
                    from his tottering throne to Nice. The new emperor hastened to besiege
                    Constantinople, which, after a feeble defence of six months, he reduced to his
