                    Collège, Cambridge, where he took his degree in arts, and was afterwards proctor
                    of the university. In 1525 he was appointed master of Eaton school, then became
                    fellow of that college, and finally provost. In 1529 he went to Oxford, where,
                    being first incorporated bachelor of divinity, in the following year he
                    proceeded doctor in that faculty. In 1531 he-was made archdeacon of Colchester,
                    in 1534 canon of Windsor, and the same year registrary of the order of the
                    Garter. He was consecrated bishop of Carlisle in the year 1537, and died at
                    Horncastle in Lincolnshire in 1556. He wrote, 1. Epistola ad Gul. Hormanum, in

                    great share in the controversy with the Papists in the reign of James II.; and
                    Bishop Burnet ranks him among those who examined all the points of Popery with a
                    solidity of judgment, clearness of argument, depth of learning, and vivacity of
                    writing, far beyond any who had before that time written in our language. He
                    rendered himself so conspicuous, that at the Revolution, when Massey the Popish
                    dean of Christ-church fled, his deanery was conferred on him. In this station he
                    behaved in an exemplary manner, and. that fabric owes much of its beauty to his
                    ingenuity<pb break="no" facs="nls:193034944?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-4944-0395"/>: it was Aldrich who designed the beautiful square
                    called Peckwater Quadrangle, which is esteemed an excellent piece of
                    architecture. In imitation of his predecessor Dr Fell, he published yearly a
                    piece of some ancient Greek author, as a present to the students of his house.
                    He published a System of Logic, with some other pieces; and the revising of
                    Clarendon’s History of the Rebellion was intrusted to him and Bishop Sprat.
                    Besides his preferments above mentioned, Dr Aldrich was also rector of Wem, in
                    Shropshire. He was chosen prolocutor of the convocation in 1702. This worthy
                    person died at Christ-church on the 14th of December 1710. As to his character,
                    he was a most universal scholar, and had a taste for all sorts of learning,
                    especially architecture. Sir John Hawkins has favoured the public with several
                    particulars relative to Dr Aldrich’s skill in music; and on account of the
                    Doctor’s eminence in this respect, Sir John ha§ given his life, with his head
                    prefixed. His abilities as a musician rank him,· we are told, among the greatest
                    masters of the science. He composed many services for the church, which are well
                    known; as are also his anthems, nearly to tlιe number of 20. He adapted, with
                    great skill and judgment, English words to many of the notes of Palestrina,
                    Carissimi, Victoria, and other Italian composers for the church, some of which
                    are frequently sung in our cathedrals as anthems. By the happy talent which Dr
                    Aldrich possessed, of naturalizing the compositions of the old Italian masters,
                    and accommodating them to an English ear, he increased the stores of our own
                    church. Though the Doctor chiefly applied himself to the cultivation of sacred
                    music, yet being a man of humour, he could divert himself by producing pieces of
                    a lighter kind. There are two catches of his, the one, Hark the bonny
                    Christ-church Bells; the other, entitled A Smoking Catch, to be sung by four men
                    smoking their pipes, which is not more difficult to sing than diverting to hear.
                    His love of smoking was, it seems, so excessive, as to be an entertaining topic
                    of discourse in the university. Such was Dr Aldriclfs regard for the advancement
                    of music, and the honour of its professors, that he had formed a design of
                    writing a history of the science; and the materials from which he proposed to
                    compile it are yet extant in the library of his own college. It appears from
                    these materials that he had marked down every thing which he had met with
                    concerning music and musicians, but that he had brought no part of them into any
                    kind of form.</p>
                <p>Dr Aldrich is of some note as a Latin poet. In the <hi rend="italic">Jtlus&lt;ε
                    Anglicanae</hi> we find two elegant copies of verses by him; one on the
                    accession of King William III., and the other on the death of the duke of
                    Gloucester. Sir John Hawkins has preserved a humorous translation by him of the
                    well-known English ballad,</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> A soldier and a sailor, </l>
                    <l part="N"> A tinker and a tailor, &amp;c. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>The following epigram, entitled “Causae Bibendi,” is likewise ascribed to Dr
                    Aldrich :—</p>
                <p><l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Si bene quid memini, Causae sunt quinque
                    bibendi;</hi></l><l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Hospitis Adventus, proesens
                    Sitis, atque futura,</hi></l><l part="N"><hi rend="italic">Aut Vini Bonitas, aut
                    quoelibet altera Causa.</hi></l></p>
                <p>The epigram has been thus translated :—</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> If on my theme I rightly think, </l>
                    <l part="N"> There are five reasons why men drink; </l>
                    <l part="N"> Good wine, a friend, because I’m dry, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Or lest I should be by and by, </l>
                    <l part="N"> Or any other reason why. </l>
                </lg>
                <p>The translation is not equal to the original. It is evident, from the verses
                    cited and referred to, that Dr Aldrich was of a very cheerful and pleasant turn
                    of mind.</p>
                <p>Indeed he is always spoken of as having been a man of wit, and as one who to his
                    great talents and virtues joined those amiable qualities which rendered him the
                    object of general affection, as well as of general esteem and respect. Having
                    never been married, he appropriated his income to works of hospitality and
                    beneficence, and encouraging learning to the utmost of his power, of which he
                    was a most magnificent patron, as well as one of the greatest men in England, if
                    considered as a Christian or a gentleman. He had always the interest of his
                    college at heart, whereof he was an excellent governor. His modesty and humility
                    prevented him from prefixing his name to the learned tracts which he published
                    during his life. At his death he wished to be buried in the cathedral, without
                    any memorial; which his thrifty nephew complied with, depositing him on the
                    south side of Bishop Fell’s grave, December 22, eight days after his decease,
                    which happened in the 63d or 64th year of his age.</p>
