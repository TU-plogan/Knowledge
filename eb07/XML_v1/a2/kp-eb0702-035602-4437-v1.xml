                <p><label type="entry">AGRIGENTUM</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Ancient
                    Geography</hi>, a city of Sicily, part of the site of which is now occupied by a
                    town called <hi rend="italic">Girgenti,</hi> from the old name. Sec <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Girgenti.</hi> According to ancient authors, Daedalus, the most
                    famous mechanician of fabulous antiquity, fled to this spot for protection
                    against Minos, and built many wonderful edifices for Cocalus, king of the
                    island. Long after his flight, the people of Gela sent a colony hither 600 years
                    before the birth of Christ, and, from the name of a neighbouring stream, called
                    the new city <hi rend="italic">Acragas,</hi> whence the Romans formed the word
                    <hi rend="italic">Agrigentum.</hi> These Greeks converted the ancient abode of
                    the Siculi into a citadel to guard the magnificent city which they erected on
                    the hillocks below. An advantageous situation, a free government with all its
                    happy effects, and an active commercial spirit, exalted their commonwealth to a
                    degree of riches and power unknown to the other Greek settlements, Syracuse
                    alone excepted. But the prosperity of Agrigentum appears to have been but of
                    short duration, and tyranny soon destroyed its liberties. Phalaris was the first
                    who reduced it to slavery. His name is familiar to most readers on account of
                    his cruelty, and the brazen bull in which he tortured his enemies. Sec <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Phalaris.</hi> Phalaris met with the common fate of tyrants,
                    and after his death the Agrigentines enjoyed their liberty for 150 years; at the
                    expiration of which term Thcro usurped the sovereign authority. The moderation,
                    justice, and valour of this prince preserved him from opposition while living,
                    and have rescued his memory from the obloquy of posterity. He joined his
                    son-in-law Gelo, king of Syracuse, in a war against the Carthaginians; in the
                    course of which victory attended all his steps, and Sicily saw herself for a
                    time delivered from her African oppressors. Soon after his decease, his son
                    Thrasydeus was deprived of the diadem, and Agrigentum restored to her old
                    democratical government. Ducetius next disturbed the general tranquillity. He
                    was a chief of the mountaineers, descendants of the Siculi; and was an overmatch
                    for the Agrigentines while they were unsupported by alliances, but sunk under
                    the weight of their union with the Syracusans. Some trifling altercations
                    dissolved this union, and produced a war, in which the Λgrigentines were
                    worsted, and compelled to submit to humiliating terms of peace. Resentment led
                    them to embrace with joy the proposals of the Athenians, then meditating an
                    attack upon Syracuse. Their new friends soon made them feel that the sacrifice
                    of liberty and fortune would be the price of their protection, and this
                    consideration brought them speedily back to their old connections. But, as if it
                    had been decreed that all friendship should be fatal to their repose, the recon
                    ciliation and its effects drew upon them the anger of the Carthaginians. By this
                    enemy their armies were routed, their city taken, their race almost extirpated,
                    and scarce a vestige of magnificence was left. Agrigentum lay 50 years buried
                    Under its own ruins, when Timoleon, after triumphing over the Carthaginians, and
                    restoring liberty to Sicily, collected the descendants of the Agrigentines, and
                    sent them to re-establish tlιe dwellings of their forefathers. Their exertions
                    were rewarded with astonishing success; for Agrigentum rose from its ashes with
                    such a renewal of vigour, that in a very short time we find it engaged in the
                    bold scheme of seizing a lucky moment, when Agathocles and Carthage had reduced
                    Syracuse to the lowest ebb, and arrogating to itself supremacy over all the
                    Sicilian republics. Xenodicus was appointed the leader of this arduous
                    enterprise; and had his latter operations been as fortunate as his first
                    campaign, Agrigentum would have acquired such a preponderance of reputation and
                    power, that the rival states would not have even dared to attack it. But a few
                    brilliant exploits were succeeded by a severe overthrow·; the Agrigentines lost
                    courage, disagreed in council, and humbly sued for peace to Agathocles. This
                    commonwealth afterwards took a strong part with Pyrrhus, and, when he left
                    Sicily to the mercy of her enemies, threw herself into the arms of Carthage.
                    During the first Punic war Agrigentum was the headquarters of the Carthaginians,
                    and was besieged by the Roman consuls, who, after eight months’ blockade, took
                    it by storm. It nevertheless changed masters several times during the contest
                    between these rival states, and in every instance,suffered most cruel outrages.
                    After this period very little mention of it occurs in history, nor do we know
                    the precise time of the destruction of the old city and the building of the new
                    one. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Girgenti.</hi></p>
                <p>The hospitality and parade for which the Agrigentines are celebrated in history
                    were supported by an extensive commerce; by means of which, the commonwealth was
                    able to resist many shocks of adversity, and always to rise again with fresh
                    splendour. It was, however, crushed by the general fall of Grecian liberty; the
                    feeble remnants of its population, which had survived so many calamities, were
                    at length driven out of its walls by the Saracens, and obliged to lock
                    themselves up for safety among the bleak and inaccessible rocks of the present
                    city.</p>
                <p>The principal part of the ancient city lay in the vale; the present town, called
                    <hi rend="italic">Girgentì,</hi> occupies the mountain on which the citadel of
                    Cocalus stood. The whole space comprehended within the walls of the ancient city
                    abounds with traces of antiquity, foundations, brick arches, and little channels
                    for the conveyance of water; but in no part are any ruins that can be presumed
                    to have belonged to places of public entertainment. This is the more
                    extraordinary, as the Agrigentines were a sensual people, fond of shows and
                    dramatic performances, and die Romans <pb break="no"

                    any place long without introducing their savage games. Theatres and
                    amphitheatres seem better calculated than most buildings to resist the outrages
                    of time; and it is surprising that not even the vestiges of their form should
                    remain on the ground.</p>
