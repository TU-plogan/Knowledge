                <p><label type="entry">AMBOISE</label>, a town of France, in the former province of
                    Touraine, now the department of the Indre and Loire, seated at the confluence of
                    the rivers Loire and Masse. The town is the capital of a district, and has been
                    rendered famous in history by the conspiracy of the Protestants in 1560, which
                    opened the fatal wars of religion in France. The castle is situated on a craggy
                    rock, extremely difficult of access, and the sides of which are almost
                    perpendicular. At its foot flows the Loire, which is divided into two streams by
                    a small island. To this fortress the duke of Guise, when he expected an
                    insurrection among the Huguenots, removed Francis II. as to a place of perfect
                    security. Only two detached parts of the ancient castle now remain, one of which
                    was constructed by Charles VIII. and the other by Francis I. The former of these
                    princes was born and died at Am-boise. The town is situated in long. 0. 34. E.
                    lat. 47. 25. N.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amboise,</hi><hi rend="italic">Francis d',</hi> son of a
                    surgeon to Charles IX. of France. He very early obtained the patronage of that
                    prince, and was supported by his liberality in the prosecution of his studies at
                    the university of Navarre, where he devoted his talents to rhetoric and
                    philosophy with great assiduity and success. His eloquence and extensive
                    information raised him in 1572 to the place of solicitor of the French nation.
                    He afterwards applied to the study of the law, and became one of the most
                    accomplished advocates of the parliament of Paris. He was next advanced to be
                    counsellor in the parliament of Bretagne, and afterwards to be a master of
                    requests and counsellor of state. He visited different countries, and published
                    the history of his travels, with several poetical pieces. He prefixed an
                    apologetical preface to the edition of Abelard’s works in 1616, and with much
                    industry collected many of his manuscripts. His brother Adrian rose to
                    considerable consequence in the church; and his brother James was not less
                    eminent as a physician.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amboise,</hi><hi rend="italic">George d',</hi> a French
                    cardinal and minister of state, was born in the year 1460. His father was a
                    descendant of the renowned house of Amboise, and, through the influence of his
                    powerful connections, he beheld the path of church preferment open before his
                    son; therefore he destined him to the clerical order. In these sanguine
                    expectations he was not disappointed; for he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193037557?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7557-0596"/> had sufficient
                    influence to procure for him the bishopric of Montauban at the early age of
                    fourteen. Louis XI. appointed him one of his almoners; and, in the course of
                    political events, he became strongly attached to the duke of Orleans, and
                    suffered imprisonment in his cause. When this prince, however, had regained his
                    favour at court, he was elevated to the archbishopric of Narbonne. After he had
                    remained there for some time, he changed that station for the archbishopric of
                    Rouen. When the duke of Orleans was governor of Normandy, he made him
                    lieutenant-general; and in that situation he was of essential service to the
                    province, in restoring justice and order. When the duke of Orleans became Louis
                    XII. Amboise was suddenly raised to the elevated station of cardinal and prime
                    minister. The same regard to equity which characterized his conduct when
                    lieutenant-general, induced him to diminish the imposts, which rendered him very
                    popular as first minister of France. In 1499, by his advice, the king undertook
                    the conquest of the Milanese, and, on their revolt, the prime minister was sent
                    to quell the rebellion. The great confidence which Louis had reposed in him
                    induced the pope to make him his legate in France; and, in that station, he
                    piously laboured to reform the ecclesiastical orders. He enforced his doctrine
                    by precept, and not only set them an example of holding only one benefice at a
                    time, but also devoted two thirds of its revenue to the poor, and to the repair
                    of religious edifices. According to his own account, he was ambitious of the
                    papal chair “merely for the purpose of effecting the reformation of abuses and
                    the correction of manners.” It is reported that, upon the death of Pius HL, he
                    would have been elected pope had he not been deceived by the Italian cardinals.
                    Disappointed in his views with regard to the papal honours, he persuaded his
                    master to declare war against the Venetians, to whose influence he attributed
                    his failure. But this imprudent undertaking was suddenly interrupted; for, in
                    the prosecution of his journey for the Venetian war, he was seized with an
                    illness, and confined in the city of Lyons. Affliction rouses the reflecting
                    powers of the mind, and calls to remembrance the past actions of life. From the
                    consciousness of his past errors and faults he was induced to express his
                    contrition to a brother of the infirmary who attended him at the convent of the
                    Celestines. In the year 1510, and in the 50th of his age, he breathed his last
                    in that place. Industry, steadiness, and good intention, characterized his
                    conduct as a prime minister. He shone with peculiar brightness as a man of
                    literature. By his liberality and patronage the arts and sciences flourished
                    under his administration. It may be proper to add, that, assisted by some of the
                    ablest lawyers in the kingdom, he formed a code of laws to reform the reigning
                    abuses in the nation. Thus, by steadily pursuing the general welfare, he
                    obtained the appellation of the “father of the people.”</p>
