                <p><label type="entry">DEUTEROCANONICAL</label>, in the school theology, an
                    appellation given to certain books of Scripture, which were added to the canon
                    after the rest, either by reason of their not being written till after the
                    compilation of the canon, or of some dispute as to their canonicity. The word is
                    Greek, being compounded of δεur⅛∙ς, <hi rend="italic">second,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">×ανονoοος, canonical.</hi></p>
                <p>The Jews, it is certain, acknowledged several books in their canon, which were
                    inserted there at a later period than the rest. They say, that under Esdras a
                    great assembly of their doctors, which they call by way of eminence the Great
                    Synagogue, made the collection of the sacred books which we now have in the
                    Hebrew Old Testament; and they agree that this assembly put books therein which
                    had not been so before the Babylonish captivity, such as those of Daniel,
                    Ezekiel, Haggai, and those of Esdras and Nehemiah.</p>
                <p>The Roman Catholic church has since added others to the canon, which were not,
                    and could not be, in the canon of the Jews, by reason’that some of them were not
                    composed till afterwards. Such is the book of Ecclesiasticus, with several of
                    the apocryphal books, as the Maccabees, Wisdom of Solomon, &amp;c. Others were
                    added at a still later period, by reason that their canonicity had not yet been
                    examined; and till such examination and judgment took place they might be set
                    aside at pleasure. But since that church has pronounced as to the canonicity of
                    these books, there is no more room now for her members to doubt of them, than
                    there was for the Jews to doubt of those of the canon of Esdras; and the
                    deuterocanonical books are with them as canonical as the protocanonical; the
                    only difference between them consisting in this, that the canonicity of the one
                    was not generally known, examined, and settled, as soon as that of the
                    others.</p>
