                <p><label type="entry">CITY</label>, according to Cowel, is a town corporate, which
                    has a bishop and cathedral church, and is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >cłviïas,</hi><hi rend="italic">oppidum,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">urbs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">civitas,</hi> because it is governed by
                    justice and order of magistracy; <hi rend="italic">oppidum,</hi> because it
                    contains a great number of inhabitants; and <hi rend="italic">urbs,</hi> because
                    it is in due form surrounded with walls.</p>
                <p>Kingdoms have been said to contain as many cities as they have sees of
                    archbishops and bishops; but, according to Blount, <hi rend="italic">city</hi>
                    is a word that has obtained since the Conquest; for in the time of the Saxons
                    there were no cities, but all the great towns were called burghs, and even
                    London was then called <hi rend="italic">Londonburgh,</hi> as the capital of
                    Scotland is called <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh.</hi> And long after the Conquest
                    the word <hi rend="italic">city</hi> is used promiscuously with the word <hi
                    rend="italic">burgh,</hi> as in the charter of Leicester, where it is called
                    both <hi rend="italic">civùas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">burgus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> which shows that those writers were mistaken who tell us
                    that every city was or is a bishop’s see, though with us the word city signifies
                    such a town corporate as has usually a bishop and a cathedral church.</p>
                <p>As to the ancient state of cities and villages, whilst the feudal policy
                    prevailed they held of some great lord, on whom they depended for protection,
                    and were subject to his arbitrary jurisdiction. The inhabitants were deprived of
                    the natural and most unalienable rights of humanity. They could not dispose of
                    the effects which their own industry had acquired, either by a latter will or by
                    any deed executed during their life. They had no right to appoint guardians for
                    their children during their minority. They were not permitted to marry without
                    purchasing the consent of the lord on whom they depended. If once they had
                    commenced a law-suit, they durst not terminate it by an accommodation, because
                    that would have deprived the lord, in whose court they pleaded, of the
                    perquisites due to him on giving his judgment. Services of various kinds, no
                    less disgraceful than oppressive, were exacted from them without mercy or
                    moderation. The spirit of industry was checked in some cities by absurd
                    regulations, and in others by unreasonable exactions; nor would the narrow and
                    oppressive maxims of a military aristocracy have permitted it ever to rise to
                    any degree of height or vigour.</p>
                <p>The freedom of cities was first established in Italy, owing principally to the
                    introduction of commerce. As soon as they began to turn their attention towards
                    this object, and to conceive some idea of the advantages they might derive from
                    it, they became impatient to shake off the yoke of their insolent lords, and to
                    establish among themselves such a free and equal government as would render
                    property secure and industry flourishing. The German emperors, especially those
                    of the Franconian and Suabian lines, as the seat of their government was far
                    distant from Italy, possessed a feeble and imperfect jurisdiction in that
                    country. Their perpetual quarrels, either with the popes or their own turbulent
                    vassals, diverted their attention from the interior policy of Italy, and gave
                    constant employment for their arms. These circumstances induced some of the
                    Italian cities towards the beginning of the eleventh century to assume new
                    privileges, to unite together more closely, and to form themselves into bodies
                    politic, under the government of laws established by common consent. The rights
                    which many cities acquired by bold or fortunate usurpations, others purchased
                    from the emperors, who deemed themselves gainers when they received large sums
                    for immunities which they were no longer able to withhold; and some cities
                    obtained them gratuitously, from the facility or generosity of the princes on
                    whom they depended. The great increase of wealth which the crusades brought into
                    Italy, occasioned a new kind of fermentation and activity in the minds of the
                    people, and excited such a general passion for liberty and independence, that
                    before the conclusion of the last crusade, all the considerable cities in that
                    country had either purchased or extorted large immunities from the emperors.</p>
                <p>This innovation was not long known in Italy before it made its way into France.
                    Louis le Gros, in order to create some power that might counterbalance those
                    potent vassals who controlled or gave law to the crown, first adopted the plan
                    of conferring new privileges on the towns situated within his own domain.. These
                    privileges were called <hi rend="italic">charters of community,</hi> by which he
                    enfranchised the inhabitants, abolished all marks of servitude, and formed them
                    into corporations or bodies politic, to be governed by a council and magistrates
                    of their own nomination. These magistrates had the right of administering
                    justice within their own precincts, of levying taxes, and of embodying and
                    training to arms the militia of the town, which took the field when required by
                    the sovereign, under the command of officers appointed by the community. The
                    great barons imitated the example of their monarch, and granted similar
                    immunities to the towns within their territories. They had wasted such great
                    sums in their expeditions to the Holy Land, that they were eager to lay hold on
                    this new expedient for raising money by the sale of those charters of liberty.
                    Though the constitution of communities was as repugnant to their maxims of
                    policy as it was adverse to their power, they disregarded remote consequences in
                    order to obtain present relief. In less than two centuries, servitude was
                    abolished in most of the cities of France, which consequently became free
                    corporations, instead of dependent villages without jurisdiction or privileges.
                    Much about the same period the great cities of Germany began to acquire like
                    immunities, and laid the foundations of their present liberty and independence.
                    The practice spread quickly over Europe, and was adopted in Spain, England,
                    Scotland, and all the other feudal kingdoms.</p>
                <p>The Spanish historians are almost entirely silent concerning the origin and
                    progress of communities in that kingdom; so that it is impossible to fix, with
                    any degree of certainty, the time and manner of their first introduction there.
                    It appears, however, from Mariana, that, in the year 1350, eighteen cities had
                    obtained a seat in the Cortes of Castile. In Aragon, cities seem early to have
                    acquired extensive immunities, together with a share in the legislature. In the
                    year 1118, the citizens of Zaragoza had not only obtained political liberty, but
                    they were declared to be of equal rank with the nobles of the second class; and
                    many other immunities, unknown to persons in their rank of life in other parts
                    of Europe, were conferred upon them. In England, the establishment of
                    communities or corporations was posterior to the Conquest. The practice was
                    borrowed from France, and the privileges granted by the crown were perfectly
                    similar to those above enumerated. It is not improbable that some of the towns
                    in England were formed into corporations under the Saxon kings; and that the
                    charters granted by the kings of the Norman race were not charters of
                    enfranchisement<pb break="no" facs="nls:193356207?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6207-0708"/> from a state of slavery, buta confirmation of
                    privileges which they had already enjoyed. The English cities, however, were
                    very considerable in the twelfth century. ' A clear proof of this occurs in the
                    history just referred to. Fitz-Stcphcn, a contemporary author, gives a
                    description of the city of London in the reign of Henry II.; and the terms in
                    which he speaks of its trade, its wealth, and the number of its inhabitants,
                    would suggest no adequate idea of its state at present, when it is the greatest
                    and most opulent city in Europe. But all ideas of grandeur and magnificence are
                    merely comparative. It appears from Petcr of Blois, archdeacon of London, who
                    flourished in the same reign, and who had good opportunity of being informed,
                    that this city, of which Fitz-Stephen gives such a pompous account, contained no
                    more than 40,000 inhabitants. The other cities were small in proportion, and in
                    no condition to extort any extensive privileges. That the constitution of the
                    burghs of Scotland in many circumstances resembled that of the towns of France
                    and England, is manifest from the <hi rend="italic">Leges Eurgorum</hi> annexed
                    to the <hi rend="italic">Pe-giaιn</hi><hi rend="italic">Majestatem.</hi></p>
