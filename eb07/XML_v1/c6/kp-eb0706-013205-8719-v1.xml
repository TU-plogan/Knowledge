                <p><label type="entry">CARAITES</label>, in ecclesiastical history, a religious sect
                    among the Jews, of which there are still some subsisting in Poland, Russia,
                    Constantinople, Cairo, and other places of the Levant, whose distinguishing
                    tenet and practice it is to adhere closely to the words and letter of the
                    scripture, exclusive of allegories, traditions, and the like.</p>
                <p>Leo of Modena, a rabbi of Venice, observes, that of all the heresies among the
                    Jews before the destruction of the temple, there is none now left but that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Caraim,</hi> a name derived from <hi rend="italic"
                    >Micra,</hi> which signifies the pure text of the Bible, because of their
                    keeping to the Pentateuch, observing it to the letter, and rejecting all
                    interpretations, paraphrases, and constitutions of the rabbin. Aben Ezra, and
                    some other rabbin, treat the Caraites as Sadducees; but Leo de Juda calls them,
                    more accurately, Sadducees Reformed, because they believe in the immortality <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193348732?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8732-0133"/> of
                    the soul, paradise, hell, the resurrection, and other doctrines which the
                    ancient Sadducees denied. He adds, however, that they wcre doubtless originally
                    real Sadducees, and sprung from among them. But Μ. Simon, with more probability,
                    supposes them to have taken their rise in this way, namely, that the more
                    knowing among the Jews opposing the dreams and reveries of the rabbin, and using
                    the pure texts of Scripture to refute their groundless traditions, had the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Caraim</hi> given them, which signifies the same thing as
                    the barbarous Latin <hi rend="italic">Scriptĩirarii,</hi> that is, people
                    attached to the text of Scripture. The other Jews gave them the odious name
                    Sadducees, from their agreement with those sectaries on the head of traditions.
                    Scaliger, Vossius, and Spanheim, rank the Caraites among the Sabaeans, Magi,
                    Manichees, and Mussulmans, but by mistake. Wolfgang, Fabricius, and others say
                    that the Sadducees and Esseni were called Caraites, in opposition to the
                    Pharisees; while others take them for the doctors of the law so often mentioned
                    in the gospel. But these are all conjectures; for Josephus and Philo make no
                    mention of them, which shows them to be more modern than either of those
                    authors. In all probability this sect was not formed till after the collection
                    of the second part of the Talmud, or the Gemera; perhaps not till after the
                    compilation of the Mischna, in the third century. The Caraites themselves
                    pretend to be the remains of the ten tribes led captive by Shalmaneser. Wolfius,
                    from the Memoirs of Mardacheus, a Caraite, refers their origin to a massacre
                    among the Jewish doctors under Alexander Jannaeus, their kinġ, about a hundred
                    years before Christ; because Simon, son of Schetach, and the queen’s brother,
                    making his escape into Egypt, there forged his pretended traditions, and, at his
                    return to Jerusalem, published his visions, interpolating the law after his own
                    fancy, and supporting his novelties from the notices which God, he said, had
                    communicated by the mouth of Moses, whose depositary he was. He gained many
                    followers, and was opposed by others, who maintained that all which God had
                    revealed to Moses was written. Hence the Jews became divided into two sects, the
                    Caraites and Traditionists. Among the first, Juda, son of Tabbai, distinguished
                    himself; among the latter, Hillel. Wolfius reckons not only the Sadducees, but
                    also the Scribes, in the number of Caraites. But the address of the Pharisees
                    prevailed against them all, and the number of Caraites decreased. In the eighth
                    century, Annan indeed retrieved their credit a little; Rabbi Schalomon did the
                    same in the ninth; and they succeeded pretty well till the fourteenth; but since
                    that time they have been declining.</p>
                <p>The Caraites are but little known, their works coming only into very few hands,
                    even among the greatest Hebraists. Buxtorf never saw more than one, and Selden
                    two; but Mr Trigland says he has recovered enough to speak of them with
                    assurance. He asserts, that soon after the prophets had ceased, the Jews became
                    divided on the subject of w orks and supererogation, some maintaining their
                    necessity from tradition, whilst others, keeping close to the written law, set
                    them aside; and it was from these last that Caraitism commenced. He adds, that
                    after the return from the Babylonish captivity, the observance of the law being
                    to be re-established, there w ere several practices found proper for that end;
                    and these being once introduced, were looked upon as essential, and as appointed
                    by Moses. This was the origin of Pharisaism: while a contrary party continuing
                    to keep close to the letter, founded Caraitism.</p>
                <p>The modern Caraites, Leo of Modena observes, have their synagogues and
                    ceremonies. They pretend to be the sole proper Jews, or observers of the laws of
                    Moses, calling the. rest by the term <hi rend="italic">rαbbinim,</hi> or
                    “followers of the rabbin.” The latter bate the Caraites mortally, refusing to
                    ally or even to converse with them, and treating them as <hi rend="italic"
                    >mamzeim,</hi> or bastards, because of their rejecting the constitutions of the
                    rabbin relating to marriages, repudiations, purifications of women, and the
                    like. This aversion is so great, that if a Caraite should become a rabbinist, he
                    would never be received by the other Jews.</p>
                <p>The Caraites, however, do not absolutely reject all kinds of traditions, but only
                    such as appear to be not well grounded. Selden, who is very express on this
                    point, in his <hi rend="italic">Uxor</hi><hi rend="italic">Hebraica,</hi>
                    observes, that besides the mere text, they have certain interpretations, which
                    they call hereditary, and which are proper traditions. Their theology seems to
                    differ from that of the other Jews, only in that it is purer, and clearer of
                    superstition; and they give no credit to the explications of the Cabbalists,
                    chimerical allegories, nor to any constitutions of the Talmud, but such as are
                    conformable to the Scripture, and may be drawn from it by just and necessary
                    consequences.</p>
                <p>Peringer observes of the Caraites in Lithuania, that they are very different,
                    both in aspect, language, and manners, from the rabbinists, with whom the
                    country abounds. Their mother tongue is the Turkish; and this they use in their
                    schools and synagogues. In visage they resemble the Mahommedan Tartars. Their
                    synagogues are placed north and south; and the reason they give for this is,
                    that Shalmaneser brought them northward; so that, in praying, they must turn to
                    the south, in order to look to Jerusalem. He adds, that they admit all the books
                    of the Old Testament; contrary to the opinion of many of the learned, who hold
                    that they reject all but the Pentateuch.</p>
                <p>Caleb, a Caraite, reduces the difference between them and the rabbinists to three
                    points: 1, In that they deny the oral law to have come from Moses, and reject
                    the Cabbala; 2, in that they abhor the Talmud; 3, in that they observe the
                    feasts, as the sabbaths, &amp;c. much more rigorously than the rabbin do; and to
                    these may be added, that they extend the degree of affinity in which marriage is
                    prohibited, almost to infinity.</p>
