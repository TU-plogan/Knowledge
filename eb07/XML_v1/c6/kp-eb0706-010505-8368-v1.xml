                    the west of Cannae, whither the Romans fled after the defeat sustained there. It
                    was famous for its red shining wool, whence those who wore clothes made of it
                    were called <hi rend="italic">Canusinati.</hi> Now called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Canosa.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Canute,</hi> the first Danish king of England
                    after Ironside. He married Emma, widow of King Ľthelred, and put to death
                    several persons of quality who stood in his way to the crown. Having thus
                    settled his power in England, he made a voyage to his other kingdom of Denmark,
                    in order to resist the attacks of the king of Sweden; and he carried along with
                    him a great body of the English under the command of the Earl of Godwin. This
                    nobleman had there an opportunity of performing a service by which he both
                    reconciled the king’s mind to the English nation, and, gaining to himself the
                    friendship of his sovereign, laid the foundation of that immense fortune which
                    he acquired to his family. He was stationed next to the Swedish camp; and
                    observing a favourable opportunity, which he was obliged suddenly to seize, he
                    attacked the enemy in the night, drove them suddenly from their trenches, threw
                    them into disorder, pursued bis advantage, and obtained a decisive victory over
                    them. Next morning, Canute, seeing the English camp entirely abandoned, imagined
                    that these disaffected troops had deserted to the enemy; but he was agreeably
                    surprised to learn that they were at that time engaged in pursuit of the
                    discomfited Swedes. He was so pleased with this success, and the manner of
                    obtaining it, that he bestowed his daughter in marriage upon Godwin, and treated
                    him ever after with the most entire confidence and regard.</p>
                <p>In another voyage which he afterwards made to Denmark, Canute attacked Norway,
                    and expelled the just but unwarlike Olaus from his kingdom, of which lie kept
                    possession till the death of that prince. He had now by his conquests and valour
                    attained the utmost height of his ambition, and having leisure from wars and
                    intrigues, he felt the unsatisfactory nature of all human enjoyments; and
                    equally weary of the glory and turmoils of this life, he began to cast his view
                    towards that future existence, which it is so natural for the human mind,
                    whether satiated by prosperity or disgusted with adversity, to make the object
                    of its attention. Unfortunately the spirit which prevailed in that age gave a
                    wrong direction to his devotion; and, instead of making atonement to those whom
                    he had formerly injured by his acts of violence, he entirely employed himself in
                    those exercises of piety which the monks represented as most meritorious. He
                    built churches, he endowed monasteries, he enriched ecclesiastics, and bestowed
                    revenues for the support of chantries at Assington and other places, where he
                    appointed prayers to be said for the souls of those who had there fallen in
                    battle against him. He even undertook a pilgrimage to Rome, where he sojourned a
                    considerable time; and, besides obtaining from the pope some privileges for the
                    English school erected there, he engaged all the princes through whose dominions
                    he was obliged to pass to desist<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348381?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8381-0106"/> from those
                    heavy impositions and tolls which they were accustomed to exact from the English
                    pilgrims. By this spirit of devotion, no less than by his equitable and politic
                    administration, he gained in a good measure the affections of his subjects.</p>
                <p>Canute, who was the greatest and most powerful prince of his time, being
                    sovereign of Denmark and Norway as well as of England, could not fail to meet
                    with adulation from his courtiers; a tribute which is liberally paid even to the
                    meanest and weakest of princes. Some of his flatterers breaking out one day in
                    admiration of his grandeur, exclaimed that every thing was possible for him;
                    upon which the monarch, it is said, ordered a chair to be set on the sea shore
                    while the tide was flowing; and as the waters approached, he commanded them to
                    retire, and obey the voice of him who was lord of the ocean. He feigned to sit
                    some time in expectation of their submission; but when the sea still advanced
                    towards him, and began to wash him with its billows, he turned to his courtiers,
                    and remarked to them, that every creature in the universe was feeble and
                    impotent, and that power resided with one Being alone, in whose hands were all
                    the elements of nature, who could say to the ocean, “Thus far shalt thou go and
                    no farther,” and who could level with his nod the most towering piles of human
                    pride and ambition. From that time, it is said, he never would wear a crown. He
                    died in the twentieth year of his reign, and was interred at Winchester, in the
                    old monastery, <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi></p>
