                <p><label type="entry">CHARITY</label>, among divines, one of the three grand
                    theological virtues, consisting in the love of God and of our neighbour, or the
                    habit and disposition of loving God with all our heart, and our neighbour as
                    ourselves.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charity</hi> is also used for the effect of moral virtue,
                    which consists in supplying the necessities of others, whether with money,
                    counsel, assistance, or the like.</p>
                <p>As pecuniary relief is generally the most effieaeious kind of eharity, and at the
                    same time that from whieh men are most ant to exeuse themselves, this braneh of
                    the duty merits particular illustration; and a better cannot be offered than
                    that whieh is contained in the <hi rend="italic">Moral Philosophy</hi> of
                    Archdeacon Paley.</p>
                <p>Whether pity be an instinct or a habit, it is in faet a property of our nature
                    which God has appointed; and the final cause for whieh it was appointed is to
                    afford to the miserable, in the compassion of their fellow-creatures, a remedy
                    for those inequalities and distresses which God foresaw that many must be
                    exposed to under every general rule for the distribution of property.</p>
                <p>The Christian Scriptures are more copious and explicit upon this duty than almost
                    any other. The description which Christ has left us of the proceedings of the
                    last day establishes beyond controversy the obligation of bounty. “When the Son
                    of Man shall eome in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he
                    sit upon the throne of his glory, and before him shall be gathered all nations;
                    and he shall separate them one from another. Then shall the King say unto them
                    on his right hand, Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared
                    for you from the foundation of the world: for I was an hungered, and ye gave me
                    meat; I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink; I was a stranger, and ye took me in;
                    naked, and ye elothed me; I was sick, an. ye visited me; I was in prison, and ye
                    came unto me. And inasmuch as ye have done it to one of the least of these my
                    brethren, ye have done it unto me.” It is not necessary to understand this
                    passage as a literal aceount of what will actually pass on that day. Supposing
                    it only a seenieal description of the rules and principles by which the Supreme
                    Arbiter of our destiny will regulate his deeisions, it eonveys the same lesson
                    to us. It equally demonstrates of how great value and importance are these
                    duties in the sight of God, and what stress will be laid upon them. The apostles
                    also describe this virtue as propitiating the divine favour in an eminent
                    degree. And these recommendations have produced their effect. It does not appear
                    that before the times of Christianity an infirmary, hospital, or public eharity
                    of any kind, existed in the world; whereas most countries in Christendom have
                    long abounded with these institutions. To this it may be added, that a spirit of
                    private liberality seems to flourish amidst the deeay of many other virtues; not
                    to mention the legal provision for the poor, whieh obtains in our i country, and
                    which was unknown and unthought of by the most polished nations of
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p>St Paul adds upon this subject an excellent direction, which is practicable by
                    all who have any thing to give. “Upon the first day of the week (or any other
                    stated time) let every one of you lay by in store, as God hath prospered him.”
                    By this the apostle may be understood to reeommend what is the very thing
                    wanting with most men, <hi rend="italic">the being charitable upon a
                    plan</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> that is, from a deliberate eomparison of our
                    fortunes with the reasonable expenses and expectations of our families, to
                    compute what we ean spare, and to lay by so mueh for ehàritable purposes, in
                    some mode or other. The mode will be a consideration afterwards.</p>
                <p>The effects whieh Christianity produced upon some of its converts were such as
                    might fie looked for from a divine religion coming with full force and
                    miraeulous evidence upon the eonseienees of mankind. It overwhelmed all worldly
                    considerations, in the expectation of a more important existence. “And the
                    multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul; neither said
                    any of them that aught of the things which he possessed was his. own, but they
                    had all things in common. Neither was there any among them that lacked; for as
                    many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of
                    the things that were sold, and laid them down at the apostles’ feet; and
                    distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.”</p>
                <p>Nevertheless, this community of goods, however it mani-rested<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193351267?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-1267-0328"/> the sincere
                    zeal of the primitive Christians, is no precedent for our imitation. It was
                    eonfined to the ehureh at Jerusalem; continued not long there; was never
                    enjoined upon any; and, although it might suit the particular circumstances of a
                    small and select society, is altogether impracticable in a large and mixed
                    community.</p>
                <p>The conduet of the apostles upon the occasion deserves to be noticed. Their
                    followers laid down their fortunes at their feet; but so far were they from
                    taking advantage of this unlimited confidence to enrieh themselves or establish
                    their authority, that they soon afterwards got rid of this business as
                    inconsistent with the main objeet of their mission, and transferred the custody
                    and management of the public fund to deacons elected to that office by the
                    people at large.</p>
                <p>There are three kinds of charity whieh prefer elaims respectively to
                    attention.</p>
                <p>1. The first, and apparently one of the best, is to give stated and considerable
                    sums, by way of pension or annuity, to individuals or families with whose
                    behaviour and distress we are ourselves acquainted. In speaking of considerable
                    sums, it is meant only, that five pounds, or any other sum, given at once, or
                    divided amongst five or fewer families, will do more good than the same sum
                    distributed amongst a greater number in shillings or half crowns; and that,
                    because it is more likely to be properly applied by the persons who receive it.
                    A poor fellow who can find no better use for a shilling than to drink his
                    benefactor’s health, and purchase half an hour’s recreation for himself, would
                    hardly break into a guinea for any such purpose, or be so improvident as not to
                    lay it by for an occasion of importance, for his rent, his clothing, fuel, or
                    stock of winter's provision. It is a still greater recommendation of this kind
                    of eharity, that pensions and annuities, which are paid regularly, and ean be
                    expected at the time, are the only way by whieh we ean prevent one part of a
                    poor man’s sufferings, the dread of want.</p>
                <p>2. But as this kind of eharity supposes that proper objects of such expensive
                    benefactions fall within our private knowledge and observation, whieh does not
                    happen to all, a second method of doing good, whieh is in every one’s power who
                    has the money to spare, is by subscription to public charities. Publie charities
                    admit of this argument in their favour, that the money goes farther towards
                    attaining the end for which it is given, than it can do by any private and
                    separate beneficence. A guinea, for example, contributed to an infirmary,
                    becomes the means of providing one patient, at least, with a physieian, surgeon,
                    apothecary, with medicine, diet, lodging, and suitable attendance; whieh is not
                    the tenth part of what the same assistance, if it could be procured at all,
                    would cost to a siek person or family in any other situation.</p>
                <p>3. The last, and, compared with the former, the lowest exertion of benevolence,
                    is in the relief of beggars. Nevertheless, the indiscriminate rejection of all
                    who implore our alms in this way is by no means to be approved. Some may perish
                    by such a conduct. Men are occasionally overtaken by distress, for whieh all
                    other relief would eome too late; and besides, resolutions of this kind compel
                    us to offer sueh violence to our humanity, as may go near, in a little while, to
                    suffoeate the principle itself; whieh is a very serious consideration. A good
                    man, if he do not surrender himself to his feelings without reserve, will at
                    least lend an ear to importunities whieh are accompanied with outward
                    attestations of distress; and, after a patient hearing of the eomplaint, will
                    direct himself by the circumstances and credibility of the account he
                    receives.</p>
                <p>The pretences by which men excuse themselves from giving to the poor are various;
                    as,</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">That they have nothing to spare·,</hi> that is, nothing for
                    whieh they have not some other use; nothing which their plan of expense,
                    together with the savings they have resolved to lay by, will not exhaust: never
                    refleeting whether it be in their power, or that it is their duty, to retrench
                    their expenses, and contract their plan, “that they;may have to give to them
                    that need or rather that this ought to have been part of their plan
                    originally.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">That they have families of their own, and that charity
                    begins at home.</hi> A father is no doubt bound to adjust his economy with a
                    view to the reasonable demands of his family upon his fortune; and until a
                    sufficiency for these is acquired, or will be in due time probably acquired (for
                    in human affairs probability is enough), he is justified in declining <hi
                    rend="italic">expensive</hi> liberality; for to take from those who want, in
                    order to give to those who want, adds nothing to the stock of public happiness.
                    Thus far, therefore, and no farther, the plea in question is an excuse for
                    parsimony, and an answer to those who solieit our bounty.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">That charity docs not consist in giving money, but in
                    benevolence, philanthropy, love to all manhind, goodness of heart,</hi> and the
                    like. But hear St James: “If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of
                    daily food, and one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and
                    filled, notwithstanding <hi rend="italic">ye give them not those things which
                    arc needful for the body,</hi> what doth it profit?”</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">That giving to the poor is not mentioned in St Paul’s
                    description of charity, in the thirteenth chapter of the first epistle to the
                    Corinthians.</hi> This is not a description of charity, but of good nature; and
                    it is not necessary that every duty be mentioned in every place.</p>
                <p>5. <hi rend="italic">That they pay the poor-rates.</hi> They might as well allege
                    that they pay their debts; for the poor have the same right to that portion of a
                    man’s property which the laws assign them, that the man himself has to the
                    remainder.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="italic">That they employ many poor persons.</hi> If they do so for
                    their own sake, not the poor’s, the excuse is inadmissible; otherwise it is a
                    good plea.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="italic">That the poor do not suffer so much as we imagine; that
                    education and habit have reconciled them to the evils of their condition, and
                    make them easy under it.</hi> Habit can never reconcile human nature to the
                    extremities of cold, hunger, and thirst, any more than it can reconcile the hand
                    to the touch of a red-hot iron; besides, the question is not, how unhappy any
                    one is, but how mueh more happy we can make him.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">That these people, give them what you will, will never thank
                    you, or think of you for it.</hi> In the first place, this is not true; in the
                    seeond place, it is not for the sake of their thanks that they ought to be
                    relieved.</p>
                <p>9. <hi rend="italic">That, we are so liable to be imposed upon.</hi> If due
                    inquiry be made, our motive and merit are the same; besides that the distress is
                    generally real, whatever has been the eause of it.</p>
                <p>10. <hi rend="italic">That they should apply to their parishes.</hi> That is not
                    always practicable; to which we may add, that there are many requisites to a
                    eomfortable subsistence, which parish relief does not always supply; that there
                    are some who would suffer almost as much from receiving parish relief as by the
                    want of it; and, lastly, that there are many modes of charity to whieh this
                    answer does not relate at all.</p>
                <p>11. <hi rend="italic">That giving money encourages idleness and vagrancy.</hi>
                    This is true only of injudicious and indiscriminate generosity.</p>
                <p>12. <hi rend="italic">That we have too many objects of charity at home to bestow
                    any thing upon strangers</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> or that there are other
                    charities which are more useful, or stand in greater need. The value of this
                    excuse depends entirely upon the <hi rend="italic">fact,</hi> whether we
                    actually relieve those neighbouring objects, and contribute to those other
                    charities.</p>

                <p>This enumeration seems to exhaust the pretences which men commonly employ to
                    excuse themselves from dispensing private charity. What they are worth, when put
                    to the test of examination, the reader will judge for himself.</p>

                    the sacraments to the sick in their hospitals. The brothers of charity usually
                    cultivate botany, pharmacy, surgery, and chemistry, which they practise with
                    success. They were first founded at Granada, by St John de Dieu, and a second
                    establishment was made at Madrid in the year 1553. The order was confirmed by
                    Gregory XIII. in 1572. Gregory XIV. forbade them to take holy orders; but by
                    leave of Paul V. in 1609, a few of the brothers might be admitted to orders. In
                    1619 they were exempted from the jurisdiction of the bishop. Those of Spain are
                    separated from the rest; and they, as well as the brothers of France, Germany,
                    Poland, and Italy, have their distinct generals, who reside at Rome. They were
                    first introduced into France by Mary of Medicis in 1601, and have since built a
