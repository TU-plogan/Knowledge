                <p><label type="entry">CENTLIVRE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Susanna</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated confie writer, was the daughter of Mr Freeman of Holbeach, in
                    Lincolnshire; and exhibited such an early turn for poetry, that it is said she
                    wrote a song when she was only about seven years old. Before she was twelve
                    years of age, she could not only read Molière in French, but enter into the
                    spirit of all the characters. Her father dying, left her to the care of a
                    stepmother, whose treatment not being agreeable to her, she determined, though
                    almost destitute of money and every other necessary, to go up to London to seek
                    a better fortune than that which she had hitherto experienced. As she was
                    proceeding on her journey on foot, she was met by a young gentleman from the
                    university of Cambridge, afterwards the well-known Anthony Hammond, Esq. who was
                    so extremely struck with her youth and beauty that he fell instantly in love
                    with her; and inquiring into the particulars of her story, soon prevailed upon
                    her inexperienced innocence to accept the protection which he offered her, and
                    go with him to Cambridge. After some months cohabitation, he persuaded her to
                    proceed to London, where in a short time she was married to a nephew of Sir
                    Stephen Fox. That gentleman, however, did not live above twelve months; but her
                    wit and beauty soon procured her a second husband, whose name was Carrol, an
                    officer in the army. This union was also of short duration; and Carrol having
                    had the misfortune to be killed in a duel about a year and a half after their
                    marriage, she became a second time a widow. For the sake of support she now
                    applied to her pen, and became a votary of the muses; and it is under the name
                    of Carrol that some of her earlier pieces were published. Her first attempt was
                    in tragedy, in a play called the <hi rend="italic">Perjured Husband</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> yet natural vivacity leading her afterwards to comedy, wc
                    find but one more attempt of this kind, among eighteen dramatic pieces which she
                    afterwards wrote. In 1706 she became known to Mr Joseph Ccntlivre, principal
                    cook to her majesty, who married her; and, after passing several years happily
                    with this person, she died at his house in Spring Garden, Charing-cross, in
                    December 1723. ?»Irs Centlivre for many years enjoyed the intimacy of Sir
                    Richard Steele, Mr Rowe, Budgcll, Farquhar, Dr Sewell, and other persons of
                    note; and very few authors received more tokens of esteem and patronage from the
                    great. With regard to her merit as a writer, it must be allowed that her plays
                    do not abound with wit, and that the language of them is sometimes even poor,
                    enervate, incorrect, puerile; but her plots are busy and well conducted, and her
                    characters in general natural and well marked.</p>
