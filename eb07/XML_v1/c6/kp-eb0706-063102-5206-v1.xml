                <p><label type="entry">CHRISTOPHERS, <hi rend="smallcaps">St</hi></label>, one of
                    the West India islands, was discovered by Christopher Columbus in 1493, who
                    bestowed upon it his own Christian name. It is about fifteen miles in length,
                    and in average breadth about four; but towards the eastern extremity it is only
                    three; and between that and the main part of the island there is a strip of land
                    three miles long and only half a mile broad. It is computed to contain 43,726
                    acres of land, about one half of which is under cultivation. This island has a
                    beautiful and picturesque appearance. In the interior are several mountains, one
                    of which, Mount Misery, an extinguished volcano, towers to an elevation of 3711
                    feet above the level of the sea. These eminences, in general rugged, bleak, and
                    precipitous, are amply redeemed by the luxuriant vegetation of the plains, which
                    have been cultivated to the very utmost. The soil is rich, and yields abundant
                    crops of sugar, the principal product of the island. The average produce of this
                    article for a series of years is 16,000 hogsheads, of sixteen cwt. each. Only
                    one half oí the cane land, however, or 8500 acres, is annually cut (the
                    remainder being young canes), so that each'acre of ripe canes thus yields yearly
                    about thirty cwt. of sugar.</p>
                <p>Basse Terre, the capital town, is situated at the southeast end of the island,
                    and at the mouth of a river which disembogues its waters into a bay called Basse
                    Terre road. It possesses many good houses, and a large and handsome square. It
                    is the mart of commerce, and carries on a considerable trade. There are a few
                    other small towns and several villages and hamlets, in general pleasantly
                    situated in the bosom of exuberant villages. The island is defended by several
                    fortresses, one of which stands on Brimstone Hill, and is occupied by the

                    pages which are but too often to be met with in the history of colonization, and
                    which lessen in the eyes of mankind the value of those bencfits which must ever
                    accrue to a savage people from close and every-day intercourse with Europeans.
                    In the year 1623, a party of English under one Warner first settled the island.
                    Shortly afterwards a party of French also arrived under M. d’Esnambue. The
                    English lived for some time on friendly terms with the natives, but having
                    unwarrantably seized on some of their lands, and being apprehensive that the
                    Charaibes would retaliate upon them, they treacherously surprised them during
                    the night, murdered above one hundred, and expelled the rest, reserving the most
                    handsome of the young women for slaves and other degrading purposes. The colony,
                    however, after this inhuman outrage, was far from being in a flourishing
                    condition, and the two leaders were compelled to return to their respective
                    countries for recruits. Warner returned with about 400, and a plentiful supply
                    of necessaries; but the greater part of D’Esnambue’s recruits perished miserably
                    at sea. The wretched remains of the force were well received by the English, and
                    the boundaries of possession which each party was to enjoy were fixed by a
                    treaty. The island was afterwards seized by the Spaniards; but these invaders
                    departed in a short time, and the tranquillity of the settlement was restored.
                    In the numerous wars between the two mother countries, St Christophers suffered
                    severely, and was repeatedly laid waste by the French. So completely had they
                    done their work in 1705, that the parliament of England was obliged to
                    distribute L.100,000 amongst the unhappy sufferers. At the peace of Utrecht the
                    island was wholly ceded to Britain, and the French possessions were sold for the
                    benefit of the English government. In the year 1782 it was taken possession of
                    by a French armament, but again restored in the year following. The population
                    of St Christophers in 1823-4, according to Humboldt, amounted to 23,000, of whom
                    3500 were free persons. Long. 62. 49. W. Lat. 17. 17. N.</p>
