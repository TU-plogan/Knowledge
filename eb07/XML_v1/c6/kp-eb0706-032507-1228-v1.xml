                <p><label type="entry">CHARENTE</label>, a department of France, formed out of a
                    large portion of the ancient Angoumois and parts of Sain tonge and Limousin. The
                    extent is 2280 square miles, or, according to the royal almanack, 588,803
                    hectares. It is bounded on the north by the departments of the Two Sevres and of
                    the Vienne, on the east by' the departments of Upper Vienne and Dordogne, on the
                    south by' Dordogne and the Lower Charente, and on the west by the latter
                    department.</p>
                <p>The face of the country is undulating, but nowhere in any degree mountainous. The
                    soil is chiefly' calcareous, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193351241?mode=fullsize"

                    with large deposits of sea-shells and other organic remains. The climate is the
                    most agreeable, and considered as the most healthful in France. The cultivation
                    of the vine has the precedence of agriculture in this department, and one third
                    of the land is appropriated to that object. The best wine districts are those of
                    Cognac and Angoulême, in both which red and white wines are very extensively
                    produced, and the latter are chiefly applied to the preparation of brandies.
                    Each peasant has his small distillery; and the value of the brandy exported is
                    estimated to amount to four millions of francs annually. The corn consists of
                    wheat, rye, maize, barley, and oats, but is scarcely sufficient for the
                    consumption; besides the grain, some hemp, flax, saffron, and linseed are
                    regularly supplied. There are some mines of iron, and the metal they yield is of
                    good quality; the product is about 1100 tons annually. The inhabitants amount to
                    326,855, of whom about 9000 are Protestants. It is divided into five
                    arrondissements, twenty-nine cantons, and 455 communes. The chief place is the
                    city of Angoulême.</p>

                    Dordogne and Gironde, and on the west by the Gironde and the ocean. The extent
                    is 2866 square miles, or, according to the royal almanack, 716,814 hectares. The
                    face of the country is an undulated plain. On the sea-coast the soil is marshy
                    and rich; in the interior, but especially towards the east part, the land is
                    either sandy or chalky. The climate is mild, and, except on the marshy sea
                    shore, healthy. Agriculture is in a neglected state, and in years of average
                    fertility barely produces corn sufficient for the consumption of half the
                    inhabitants. On the meadows many cows are bred, and on the other parts are large
                    flocks of sheep. The department produces both red and white wine beyond its own
                    demand. One of the chief articles of commerce in the department is salt. This is
                    made in the summer by natural evaporation; and the quantity furnished amounts,
                    in warm seasons, to upwards of 30,000 tons. These operations are carried on in
                    the arrondissements of Rochelle, Rochefort, and Marennes, and on the island of
                    Oleron. The exports consist, besides salt, of wine, brandy, vinegar, fruit,
                    hcmp, flax-seed, and cattle. There are few manufactures, and these of coarse
                    linen or woollen for domestic use. The inhabitants amount to 406,579. The
                    capital is Rochelle.</p>
