                <p><label type="entry">CAMDEN, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, the great
                    antiquary, was born in London in the year 1551. His father was a native of
                    Lichfield, in Staffordshire, who, settling in London, became a member of the
                    company of paper-stainers, and lived in the Old Bailey. His mother was of the
                    ancient family of Curwen of Workington, in Cumberland. He was educated first at
                    Christ’s Hospital, and afterwards at St Paul’s School; from which he was sent,
                    in 1566, to Oxford, and entered servitor of Magdalen College; but being
                    disappointed of a demy’s place, he removed to Broadgate Hall, and, somewhat more
                    than two years afterwards, to Christ Church, where he was supported by his kind
                    friend and patron Dr Thornton. About this time he was a candidate for a
                    fellowship of All-souls College, but lost it by the intrigues of the Popish
                    party. In 1570 he supplicated the regents of the university to be admitted
                    bachelor of arts, but in this also he miscarried. The following year Mr Camden
                    came to London, where he prosecuted his favourite study of antiquity, under the
                    patronage of Dr Goodman, dean of Westminster, by whose interest hc was made
                    second master of Westminster School in 1575. From the time of his leaving the
                    university to this period, he took several journeys to different parts of
                    England, with a view to make observations and collect materials for his <hi
                    rend="italic">Britannia,</hi> in which he was now deeply engaged. In 1581 be
                    became intimately acquainted with the learned President Brisson, who was then in
                    England, and in 1586 he published the first edition of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a work which, though much enlarged and
                    improved in future editions, was even then esteemed as an honour to its author
                    and the glory of its country. In 1593 he succeeded to the head mastership of
                    Westminster School, on the resignation of Dr Grant. In this office he continued
                    till 1597, when he was promoted to be clarencieux king at arms. In the year 1600
                    Mr Camden made a tour to the north, as far as Carlisle, accompanied by his
                    friend Mr (afterwards Sir Robert) Cotton. In 1606 he began his correspondence
                    with the celebrated President de Thou, which continued to the death of that
                    faithful historian. In the following year he published his last edition of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Britannia,</hi> which is that from which the several English
                    translations have been made; and in 1608 he began to digest his materials for a
                    history of the reign of Queen Elizabeth. In 1609, after recovering from a
                    dangerous illness, he retired to Chislehurst in Kent, where he continued to
                    spend the summer months during the remainder of his life. The first part of his
                    annals of the queen did notappear till the year 1615, and he determined that the
                    second volume should not appear till after his death.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The reign of Queen Elizabeth was so recent
                    when the first volume of the annals was published, that many of the persons
                    concerned, or their dependents, w ere still living. It is no wonder, therefore,
                    that the honest historian should offend those whose actions would not bear
                    inquiry. Some of his enemies were clamorous and troublesome, which determined
                    him not to publish the second volume during hiś life; but; that· posterity might
                    be in no danger of disappointment, he deposited one copy in the Cotton Library,
                    and transmitted another to his friend Dupuy at Paris. It was first printed at
                    Leyden in 1625.</p></note> The work was entirely finished in 1617; and from that
                    time he was principally employed in collecting more materials for the further
                    improvement of his <hi rend="italic">Britannia.</hi> In 1622, being now upwards
                    of seventy, and finding his health decline apace, he determined to lose no time
                    in executing his design of founding a history lecture in the university of
                    Oxford. His deed of gift w as accordingly transmitted by his friend Mr Heather
                    to Mr Gregory Wheare, who was by himself appointed his first professor. He died
                    at Chislehurst in 1623, in the seventy-third year of his age, and was buried
                    with great solemnity in Westminster Abbey, in the south aisle, where a monument
                    of white marble was erected to his memory. Camden was a man of singular modesty
                    and integrity, profoundly learned in the history and antiquities of this
                    kingdom, and a judicious and conscientious historian. He was reverenced and
                    esteemed by the literati of all nations, and will be ever remembered as an
                    honour to the age and country in which he lived. Besides the works already
                    mentioned, he was author of an excellent Greek grammar, and of several tracts in
                    Hearne’s collection. But his great and most useful work, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Britannia,</hi> is that upon which his fame is chiefly built. The edition above
                    mentioned, to which he put his last hand, was correctly printed in folio, much
                    augmented, amended where amendment was necessary, and adorned with maps. It was
                    first translated into English, and published in folio at London, in 1611, by the
                    laborious Dr Philemon Holland, a physician of Coventry, who is thought to have
                    consulted our author himself; and therefore great respect has been paid to the
                    additions and explanations that occur therein, on a supposition that they may
                    belong to Camden. But in a later edition of the same translation, published in
                    1636, the doctor has taken liberties which cannot be either defended or excused.
                    A new translation, made with the utmost fidelity from the last edition of our
                    author’s work, was published in 1695, by Edmund Gibson of Queen’s College, in
                    Oxford, afterwards bishop of London; in which, besides the addition of notes,
                    and of all that deserved to be taken notice of in Dr Holland’s first edition,
                    which, though thrown out of the text, is preserved at the bottom of the page,
                    there are many other augmentations and improvements, all properly distinguished
                    from the genuine work <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347471?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7471-0036"/> of the author, as they ought to be; and the same
                    judicious method was followed in the next edition of this performance, which was
                    justly considered as the very best book of its kind that had been hitherto
                    published. But the public was afterwards put in possession of a new translation,
                    and still more improved edition, by that learned and industrious topographer Mr
                    Gough, under whose hands it was enlarged to near double the size of the last of
                    the preceding editions.</p>
