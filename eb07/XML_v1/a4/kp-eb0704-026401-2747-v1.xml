                <p><label type="entry">AZZARA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Joseph Felix Nicholas
                    de</hi></label>, a celebrated Spanish naturalist. He was born in 1731, at
                    Barbanales, a village near Barbastro, in the province of Aragon. He discovered
                    an early disposition towards the arts and sciences, which was directed and
                    stimulated by his near relation the celebrated painter Mengs. He entered into
                    the military service at an early age, and in the capacity of officer passed to
                    South America, and resided many years in different parts of the province of
                    Buenos Ayres. Here he indulged his disposition for the study of zoology, and
                    lived many years in some of the most sequestered parts, making collections and
                    drawings of the various animals of that extensive country. The latter, with
                    descriptions, were at length published at Paris in 1801. When here-turned from
                    South America, he was employed in the diplomatic department, and appointed
                    ambassador to Pope Clement XII., by which he was brought into contact with
                    Buonaparte, who was then occupied in the conquest of Italy. He became much
                    attached to that conqueror, and obtained the appointment of ambassador to him
                    from the court of Madrid. Amidst the shifting politics of that court, he seems
                    to have been, in his latter years, the frequent victim of its indecision. He was
                    at one time recalled suddenly, then banished to Barcelona, again appointed to
                    the embassy, and again as suddenly deprived of it. These vexations affected him,
                    and are said to have hastened his death. He died in Paris on the 26th of January
                    1804.</p>
                <p>B.</p>
                <p>Ε&gt; the second letter, and first consonant, in all known -ŋ? alphabets,
                    excepting the Ethiopie, where it occupies the ninth place. It is a labial and
                    mute, representing the compression of the lips, and consequently incapable of
                    being uttered or pronounced without the aid of a vowel, or a forcible expiration
                    equivalent in effect to vocality. I his letter has a near affinity to the other
                    labials, with which, indeed, it is interchangeable according as the compression
                    of the lips, which it primarily indicates, is modified by simultaneous
                    expiration; and hence, although its ordinary power or effect is intermediate
                    between the smooth and easy sound of P, and the rough aspirations of PH, F, and
                    V, yet, in the articulation of many languages, it is habitually confounded with
                    one or other of the letters of the same class, and, in the same language at
                    different times, is frequently interchanged with its cognate consonants. Thus
                    <hi rend="italic">βο&lt;fxω</hi> in Greek becomes <hi rend="italic">pαseο ⅛</hi>
                    Latin; <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">λβος,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    many other instances. Again, in Latin, the B of the olden time, and of the
                    inscriptions, passes into V in a subsequent age; while, on the other hand, the P
                    of the antique orthgraphy is commuted into B in that of amore recent date. Hence
                    we have <hi rend="italic">abacus</hi> for <hi rend="italic">ababus, ave</hi> for
                    <hi rend="italic">abe,</hi><hi rend="italic">vixit</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                    >lixit, ef^ v&lt;ztus</hi> for <hi rend="italic">curbatus,</hi> and hundreds of
                    other analogous instances in Gruter, Reinesius, Funccius, Gorius, Dempster,
                    Fréret, and Lanzi, not to mention the <hi rend="italic">Monumenti</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">degli pioni,</hi> and similar works; while <hi rend="italic"
                    >Poplius</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Publius, Ρ°Ρ^ licus</hi> for <hi
                    rend="italic">Publicus, Poplicola</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Publicola,</hi> are
                    of frequent occurrence in the inscriptions and other elder monument <hi
