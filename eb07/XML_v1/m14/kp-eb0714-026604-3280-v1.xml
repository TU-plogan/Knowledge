                <p><label type="entry">MARTYR</label> is one who lays down his life, or who suffers
                    death, for the sake of his religion. The word is Greek, <hi rend="italic"
                    >μa%∏)ζ,</hi> and properly signifies <hi rend="italic">a witness.</hi> It is
                    applied, by way of eminence, to those who suffered in witness of the truth of
                    the gospel. The Christian church has abounded in martyrs, and history is filled
                    with accounts of their singular constancy and fortitude under the most cruel
                    torments which human nature was capable of suffering. The primitive Christians
                    were accused by their enemies of paying a sort of divine worship to the martyrs.
                    Of this we have an instance in the answer of the church of Smyrna to the
                    suggestion of the Jews, who, on the martyrdom of St Polycarp, desired the
                    heathen judge not to suffer the Christians to carry off his body, lest they
                    should leave their crucified master, and worship him in his stead. To this,
                    however, they answered, “We can neither forsake Christ, nor worship any other;
                    for we worship him as the Son of God; but we love the martyrs as the disciples
                    and followers of the Lord, for the great affection they have shown to their King
                    and Master.” The primitive Christians believed that the martyrs enjoyed singular
                    privileges; that upon their death they were immediately admitted to enjoy the
                    beatific vision, whilst other souls waited for the completion of their happiness
                    till the day of judgment; and that God would grant chiefly to their prayers the
                    hastening of his kingdom, and the shortening of the times of persecution. The
                    churches built over the graves of the martyrs, and called by their names, in
                    order to preserve the memory of their sufferings, were distinguished by the
                    title <hi rend="italic">martyrum confessio,</hi><hi rend="italic">or</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">memoria.</hi> The festivals of the martyrs are of very ancient
                    date in the Christian church, and may be carried back at least to the time of St
                    Polycarp, who suffered martyrdom about the year of Christ 168. On these days the
                    Christians met at the graves of the martyrs, and offered up prayers and
                    thanksgivings to God for the examples afforded them; they also celebrated the
                    eucharist, and gave alms to the poor, which, together with a panegyrical oration
                    or sermon, and reading the acts of the martyrs, formed the spiritual exercises
                    of these anniversaries.</p>
