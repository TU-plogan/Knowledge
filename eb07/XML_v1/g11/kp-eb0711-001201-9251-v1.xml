                <p><label type="entry">GUADALOUPE</label>, an island in the West Indies, belonging
                    to France, is situated in longitude 62. west, and latitude 16. 20. north. It
                    consists properly of two islands, separated from each other by a narrow channel
                    called Là Riviere Salée, which is navigable by vessels of fifty tons burden. The
                    eastern island or division is called Grande Terre, and the western Basse Terre.
                    Guadaloupe was discovered by Columbus, who found it inhabited by a warlike
                    people; but they were soon subdued by the Spaniards. In 1635 it was taken
                    possession of by the French, who commenced hostilities against the natives; but
                    in 1640 a peace was concluded between the contending parties. For sixty years
                    after its occupation by the French, the island made little advancement; but at
                    length, about the beginning of the eighteenth century, it began to improve, and
                    made rapid progress. In 1759 it was conquered by Britain, but restored to France
                    in 1763. After this period it was twice taken by Britain; but, by the political
                    adjustment of affairs which took place in 1814, it reverted to France, of which
                    country it is now a colony.</p>
                <p>Grande Terre is about six leagues in breadth and fourteen in length, and Basse
                    Terre is fifteen leagues in length by fourteen in breadth. The small islands
                    Desiderade on the east, Marie-Galante on the south-east, and the isles Des
                    Saintes on the south, are subject to the government of Guadaloupe. The surface
                    of these islands taken together has been estimated at 334,142 English acres.
                    There are several volcanic mountains in Basse Terre, one of which, called La
                    Soufrière, still emits volumes of smoke, and occasionally sparks of fire. This
                    portion of Guadaloupe is agreeably diversified by hills, woods, gardens, and
                    enclosures. It is also copiously watered, and very fruitful. The wild
                    lemon-tree, the plant which produces gallianum, the erythrina corallodendrum,
                    and the thorny volkameria, grow in the enclosures. The sugar-cane, although it
                    reaches a great height, is of an inferior quality; and the coffee is not equal
                    to that which is produced in some other of the West India islands. The principal
                    town is called Basse Terre. It possesses many fine buildings, fountains, and
                    public gardens, and is defended by a fort, which also commands an open road,
                    having all the advantages of a safe harbour. Grande Terre is marshy, sterile,
                    and flat, and also labours under a deficiency of water. The metropolis, which
                    contains 15,000 inhabitants, is called Pointe à Pitre. It possesses a spacious
                    port, and here the principal part of the trade is carried on. Desiderade is
                    famed for its cotton, and coffee and sugar are raised on the hills of
                    Marie-Galante. The exports consist chiefly of sugar, coffee, cotton, cacao, wood
                    of various kinds, and a little cloves and spices. The value of the imports into
                    France from Guadeloupe in 1831 was 26,642,222 francs, and the exports from
                    France into the island amounted to 12,146,853 francs. By the returns for the
                    same year, 195 ships, of 47,623 tons burden, were entered, and 194 ships, of
                    47,772 tons burden, were cleared out. According to the last census, which was
                    for the year 1829, the population amounts to 112,111, consisting of whites and
                    people of colour.</p>
