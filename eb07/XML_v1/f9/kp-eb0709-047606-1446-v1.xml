                <p><label type="entry">FAIRS AND MARKETS</label>. The intimate alliance which
                    subsists between these institutions renders it as necessary as it is convenient
                    to treat of them together. As the term is now generally understood, a fair is
                    just a greater species of market, but the periodical recurrence is less
                    frequent. Both are appropriated to the sale of one or more kinds of goods, the
                    hiring of servants, labourers, &amp;c. In most cases, however, fairs are more
                    numerously attended than markets, and are generally characterized by various
                    exhibitions got up for the amusement of the people.</p>
                <p>The follovving account of the origin of fairs is given by Mr M <hi
                    rend="superscript"> i</hi> Culloch, in his <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of
                    Commerce.</hi> “Institutions óf this sort are peculiarly serviceable in the
                    earlier stages of society, and in rude and inland countries. The number of
                    shops, and the commodities in them, are then either comparatively limited, or
                    they are but little frequented by dealers; so that it is for the advantage of
                    all that fairs should be established, and merchants induced to attend them. For
                    this purpose various privileges have been annexed to fairs, and numerous
                    facilities afforded to the disposal of property in them. To give them a greater
                    degree of solemnity, they were originally, both in the ancient and modern world,
                    associated with religious festivals. In most places, indeed, they are still held
                    on the same day with the wake or feast of the saint to whom the church is
                    dedicated; and, till the practice was prohibited, it was customary, in England,
                    to hold them in churchyards. <hi rend="italic">(Jacob</hi><hi rend="italic

                    the disposal and purchase of all sorts of produce at the weekly or monthly
                    markets held in them, the utility of fairs, in this country at least, has very
                    much diminished; they have also lost much of their ancient splendour; and,
                    though some of them are still well attended, and of real use, a good number
                    might be advantageously suppressed.</p>
                <p>“But it is far otherwise in inland countries, where the facilities for carrying
                    on commercial transactions are comparatively circumscribed. There it is of the
                    utmost importance, that certain convenient places and specified periods should
                    be appointed for the bringing together of commodities and dealers. This is not
                    only the readiest and best means of promoting commerce, but also of softening
                    national antipathies, and diffusing a knowledge of the products, arts, and
                    customs of other countries.”</p>
                <p>In England the right of holding a fair must be derived from the crown, and, in
                    the grant obtained, provision is made that no other fair shall be injured by the
                    one to be established. The times of holding the fairs are determined by the
                    letters-patent appointing the fair or market, or by usage; and penalties are
                    imposed if they are held beyond the time specified. A <hi rend="italic">bona
                    fide</hi> sale made in a fair or open market, in general transfers the complete
                    property of the thing sold to the vender, so that, however vicious or illegal
                    the title of the vender may be, the vendee’s is good against every one except
                    the king. But the sale, in order to come within this rule, must be made on the
                    market day, and at the place assigned for the market. Formerly the mayor or
                    steward presided at a court called the court of <hi rend="italic">pie
                    ροudre,</hi> in allusion to the dusty fect of the suitors, where questions as to
                    contracts, &amp;c. w ere decided; but these courts are now entirely set aside.
                    Still, as of old, however, there is a clerk appointed, whose duty it is to see
                    that every thing is sold according to just weights and measures. There is
                    generally a toll attached to fairs and markets, which is paid by the buyer after
                    the thing brought to the market has been sold.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">British Fairs.</hi> Amongst these may be specified that of
                    Stourbridge, in Worcestershire. Bristol has two considerable fairs, one in March
                    and one in September. Exeter December fair is for cattle, horses, and most sorts
                    of commodities. Weyhill fair, in Hampshire (October 10), has probably the
                    greatest display of sheep of any fair in the kingdom. Bartholomew fair, in
                    London, used to be of considerable importance, but is now appropriated only to
                    shows of wild beasts, and such like exhibitions, and might be suppressed with
                    advantage. St Faith’s, near Norwich (October 17), is the principal English fair
                    for Scotch cattle. They are sold to the graziers and feeders of Norfolk,
                    Suffolk, Essex, and other counties, by whom they are fattened for the London
                    markets, where they are met with in great abundance. But besides those sold at
                    St Faith’s, large numbers of Scotch cattle are disposed of at Market Harborough,
                    Carlisle, Ormskirk, and other places. Ipswich has two considerable fairs; one in
                    August, for lambs, and one in September, for butter and cheese; and it is
                    reckoned that above 100,000 lambs are annually sold at the former.
                    Woodborough-hill, in Dorset, is for west-country manufactures, as kerseys,
                    druggets, &amp;c.; and Woodstock October fair, for cheesc. Northampton and
                    Nottingham have each several large fairs, for horses, cattle, cheese, &amp;c.
                    The August fair of Horncastlc, in Lincolnshire, is the largest horse fair in the
                    kingdom, many thousand horses being exhibited for sale during its continuance;
                    and it is resorted to by crowds of dealcrs from all parts of Great Britain, by
                    several from the Continent, and sometimes even from North America. Howden, in
                    Yorkshire, has also a very large horse fair, particularly for Yorkshire hunters.
                    Devizes, in Wiltshire, has several large fairs for sheep and cattle. There is
                    usually a large display of cheese at the Gloucester April fair, guild, or
                    jubilee, commencing the last week of August, is held every twentieth year at
                    Preston, in Lancashire; last was held in 1822, and was well attended. The
                    October fair of Market Harborough, Leicestershire, lasts n days, and a great
                    deal of business is usually done in catuθ&gt; cheese, &amp;c. Woodbridge
                    Lady-day fair is celebrated or the show of Suffolk horses. Falkirk fair, or
                    tryst, is one o the most important in Scotland, for the sale of cattle an sheep.
                    The October fair of Ballinasloe, in the county θ. Galwav, is famous for the
                    display of cattle and sheep, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751459?mode=fullsize"

                    raised for sale in Connaught being disposed of at it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">French Fairs.</hi> The principal French fairs are those of St
                    Germains, Lyons, Rheims, Chartres, Rouen, Bordeaux, Troyes, Bayonne, and
                    Beaucaire, but they are said to be for the most part much fallen off, although
                    that which was held in 1833, at the last-named place, was the greatest which had
                    taken place for many years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">German Fairs.</hi> The principal German, or rather European
                    fairs, are those of Frankfort on the Maine, Frankfort on the Oder, and Leipsic.
                    The business transacted at these fairs is in general very great. Merchants of
                    all nations are there assembled, for disposing of the manufactures, merchandise,
                    and productions, for which their several countries are distinguished. Frankfort
                    on the' Maine has two, and Frankfort on the Oder three fairs yearly. Leipsic has
                    also three annual fairs, and these are by far the most celebrated. They are held
                    on the first of January, at Easter, and at Michaelmas. The first is the least
                    important. The two latter, particularly the former, are remarkable for the vast
                    number of new publications usually offered for sale. They are attended by all
                    the principal booksellers of Germany, and by many from the adjoining countries,
                    who adjust their accounts, learn the state of the trade in all parts of the
                    world, and endeavour to form new connections. Most German publishers have agents
                    in Leipsic, which is to the literature of Germany what London is to that of
                    Great Britain. As many as four thousand new publications have been in a single
                    Leipsic catalogue. The fairs ought to close in eight days, but they usually
                    continue for about three weeks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Italian Fairs.</hi> Of these, the most celebrated is that of
                    Sinigaglia, on the Misa. It commences on the 14th of July, and continues for
                    about twenty days. Here, as at the German fairs, are assembled merchants from
                    almost all nations.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Russian Fairs.</hi> These are numerous, and many of them are
                    well attended. The most important is held at Nishnei-Novogorod, a city situated
                    at the confluence of the Oka with the Wolga. It is the great emporium of the
                    internal trade of Russia. The fair generally lasts from six weeks to two months,
                    and is well known all over the east of Europe. In point of value this fair is
                    considered as second to none in Europe. Another celebrated Russian fair is that
                    of Kiachta, on the Chinese frontier. At this fair by far the largest part of the
                    commerce between the Russian and Chinese empires is transacted. The goods
                    disposed of are principally tlιe products of the respective countries.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Eastern Fairs.</hi> The most important fair in the eastern
                    world is that held at Mecca, during the resort of pilgrims in the month of
                    Dhalhajja. It has declined of late years, but the concourse which attends it is
                    still very great. The greatest fair in India is that held at Hurdwar in
                    Hindustan. The town, although inconsiderable, is famous for being one of the
                    principal places of Hindu pilgrimage, which takes place along with the fair at
                    the vernal equinox.</p>
                <p>The fairs of Portobello, Vera Cruz, and Acapulco, once so famous, are now totally
                    deserted; and that of the Havannah is also much fallen off.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fair,</hi> in nautical language, is used for the disposition
                    of the wind, when it is favourable to a ship’s course, in opposition to that
                    which is contrary or foul. The term <hi rend="italic">fair</hi> is more
                    comprehensive than the term <hi rend="italic">large,</hi> and includes about
                    sixteen or eighteen points of the compass. <hi rend="italic">Large</hi> is
                    confined to the beam or quarter, that is, to a wind which crosses the keel at
                    right angles, or obliquely bom the stern, but never to one right a-stern.</p>
