                    and gardeners, the most beautiful part of trees and plants, containing the
                    organs or parts of fructification. Flowers were in great request at the
                    entertainments of the ancients, being provided by the master of the feast, and
                    brought in before the second course; or, as some think, at the beginning of the
                    entertainment.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Preserving of</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Flowers.</hi>
                    The method of preserving flowers in their natural beauty throughout the whole
                    year has been much sought after by many. Some have attempted it by gathering
                    them when dry and not too much opened, and burying them in sand; but this,
                    though it preserves their figure well, diminishes the liveliness of their
                    colour. Muntingius prefers the following method: Gather roses, or other flowers,
                    when they are not yet thoroughly open, in the middle of a dry day; fill the
                    vessel with them up to the top, and when full sprinkle them over with some good
                    French wine, with a little salt in it; then set them by in a cellar, tying down
                    the mouth of the pot. After this they may be taken out at pleasure; and, on
                    placing them in the sun, or within reach of the fire, they will open as if
                    growing naturally; and not only will the colour, but the smell also, be
                    preserved.</p>
                <p>The flowers of plants are by much the most difficult parts Of them to preserve in
                    any tolerable degree of perfection. Of this we have instances in all the
                    collections of dried plants, or <hi rend="italic">horti sicci.</hi> In these the
                    leaves, stalks, roots, and seeds of the plants, appear very well preserved; the
                    strong texture of such parts making them always retain their natural form, and
                    the colours in many species naturally remaining. But it is very much otherwise
                    in regard to flowers, which are naturally the most beautiful parts of the plants
                    to which they belong; they are however so much injured in the common way of
                    drying, that they not only lose, but change their colours, by which means
                    occasion is given to many errors; and they usually also wither up, so as to lose
                    their very form and natural shape. The primrose and cowslip kinds are instances
                    of the change of colours in the flowers of dried specimens; for those of this
                    class of plants easily dry in their natural state, but they lose their yellow,
                    and, instead of it, acquire a fine green colour, much superior to that of the
                    leaves in their most perfect state. The flowers of all the violet kind lose
                    their beautiful blue, and become of a dead white; so that in dried specimens
                    there is no difference between the blue-flowered violet and the white-flowered
                    kinds.</p>
                <p>Sir Robert Southwell has communicated to the world a method of drying plants, by
                    which this defect is proposed to be in a great measure remedied, and all flowers
                    preserved in their natural shape, and many in their natural colours. For this
                    purpose two plates of iron are prepared of the size of a large half sheet of
                    paper, or larger, for particular occasions. These plates should be made so thick
                    as not to be apt to bend; and there must be a hole made near every corner for
                    receiving a screw to fasten them closely together. When the plates are prepared,
                    have in readiness several sheets of paper, and then gather the plants with their
                    flowers when they are quite perfect. Let this be al- <hi rend="superscript">
                    w</hi> ays done in the middle of a dry day; and then place the plant and its
                    flower on one of the sheets of paper doubled m half, spreading out all the
                    leaves and petals as nicely as possible. If the stalk be thick, it must be pared
                    or cut in two, so that it may lie flat; and if it be woody, it may be peeled,
                    and only the bark left. When the plant is thus expanded, lay round about it some
                    loose leaves and petals θ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> hθ flower, which may
                    serve to complete any part that is θ∏cient, When all is thus prepared, lay
                    several sheets of P <hi rend="superscript"> ζ</hi> Ψθ <hi rend="superscript">
                    r</hi> 9 <hi rend="superscript"> ver</hi> th <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi>
                    plant, and as many under it; then put the whole between the iron plates, laying
                    the papers smoothly on one, and placing the other equally over them; screw t e∏ι
                    close, put them into an oven after the bread is drawn, and let them lie there
                    two hours. After this, make a mixture of equal parts of aquafortis and common
                    brandy; shake these well together, and when the flowers are taken out of the
                    pressure of the plates, rub them lightly over with a camel s hair pencil dipped
                    in this liquor; then lay them upon fresh brown paper, and covering them with
                    some other sheets, press them between this and other papiers with a handkerchief
                    till the moisture of these liquors is wholly dried away. When the plant is thus
                    far prepared, take the bulk of a nutmeg of gum-dragon, put this into a pint of
                    pure cold water, and let it stand twenty-four hours, in which time it will be
                    wholly dissolved; then dip a fine hair pencil in this liquor, and with it daub
                    over the posterior sides of the leaves, and lay them carefully down on half a
                    sheet of white paper fairly expanded, and press them down with some more papers
                    over these. When the gum water is fixed, let the pressure and paper be removed,
                    and the whole work is finished. The leaves in this case retain their verdure,
                    and the flowers usually preserve their natural colours. Some care, however, must
                    be taken that the heat of the oven be not too great. When the flowers are thick
                    and bulky, some art should be used to pair off their backs, and dispose the
                    petals in a due order; after which, if any of them are wanting, their places may
                    be supplied with some of the supernumerary ones dried on purpose; and if any of
                    them are only faded, it will be prudent to take them away, and lay down others
                    in their stead. The leaves may be also disposed and mended in the same
                    manner.</p>
                <p>Another method of preserving both flowers and fruits throughout the whole year is
                    also given by the same author. Take saltpetre one pound, Armenian bole two
                    pounds, clean common sand three pounds, and mix the whole well together. Then
                    gather fruit of any kind that is not fully ripe, with the stalk to each; and put
                    in these, one by one, into a widemouthed glass, laying them in good order. Tie
                    over the top with an oil-cloth, carry them into a dry cellar, and set the whole
                    upon a bed of the prepared matter of four inches thick in a box. Fill up the
                    remainder of the box with the same preparation, and let it be four inches thick
                    all over the top of the glass and all round its sides. Flowers are to be
                    preserved in the same sort of glasses, and in the same manner; and they may be
                    taken up after a whole year as plump and fair as when they were buried.</p>
