                <p><label type="entry">FOLKES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Martin</hi></label>, a
                    philosopher and antiquary of considerable eminence, was born at Westminster, in
                    the year 1690. A Mr Cappel, once professor of Hebrew at Saumur, was his private
                    tutor. When about seventeen years of age he was sent to Clare-hall, Cambridge,
                    where he applied himself to the study of philosophy and the mathematics; and
                    when only twenty-three years of age he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society.
                    His ingenious communications acquired him so much applause that he was
                    frequently chosen into its council. He was in habits of friendship with the
                    illustrious Newton, at that time president; and by his influence was elected one
                    of the vice-presidents in the year 1723. Mr Folkes became a candidate for the
                    chair on the death of Sir Isaac Newton; but the superior interest of Sir Hans
                    Sloane rendered his application ineffectual. In 1733, and the two subsequent
                    years, he resided for the most part in Italy, with the view of improving himself
                    in the knowledge of classical antiquity. To ascertain the weight and value of
                    ancient coins, he carefully consulted the cabinets of the curious; and on his
                    return home he presented to the Antiquarian Society, of which he was a member, a
                    dissertation on the subject. He read before the same learned body a dissertation
                    on the measurement of Trajan’s and Antoninus’ pillars, together with other
                    remains of antiquity. The fruits of his observations he presented to the Royal
                    Society, particularly <hi rend="italic">Remarks on the Standard Measure
                    preserved in the Capitol of Rome,</hi> and the model of an ancient globe in the
                    Farnese palace. He visited Paris in 1739, where he was received with great
                    respect, and admitted into the society ot the most distinguished literary
                    characters of that metropolis. This respect indeed he was entitled to by bis
                    unwearied application to many branches of knowledge alike curious and useful.
                    His valuable work upon English Silver Coins was printed in the year 1745.
                    Amongst the many honours conferred upon Mr Folkes, was that of being created
                    doctor of laws by both universities, and chosen president of the Antiquarian
                    Society. He continued to furnish the Philosophical Transactions with many
                    learned papers, till his career was cut short by a paralytic stroke, which
                    terminated his useful life in the year 1654. He was a man of extensive knowledge
                    and approved accuracy; but the chief benefit to science which resulted from his
                    labours was his treatise on the intricate subject of coins, weights, and
                    measures. His cabinet and library, which were large and valuable, were exposed
                    to public sale after his death. His private character was distinguished for
                    politeness, generosity, and friendship.</p>
