                    of Roman history, respecting whom we know but little. In the interval between
                    the first and second Punic wars we find him taking an active part in the
                    subjugation of the Gauls in the north of Italy (225 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.)</hi>; and after the battle of Cannae (216 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.),
                    he was employed by the Romans to proceed to Delphi, in order to consult the
                    oracle <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Apollo. But it is as an historian that he is
                    entitled to our attention; as the earliest of the Roman annalists who set the
                    example of writing the history of his country in prose. The rude muse o Noevius
                    had already celebrated in verse the glory acquired by the Roman arms in the
                    first Punic war, and Ennius had clothed the annals of his adopted country m t
                    <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> language of poetry. The sources from which Fabius
                    erived his history were no doubt the annals of thepontι s who were in the habit
                    of noting on a tablet thθ remar able events of each year, such as prodigies,
                    eclipses, cam <pb break="no" facs="nls:193751381?mode=fullsize"

                    men; and these were afterwards collected into a book. This custom continued till
                    the pontificate of P. Mucius and the times of the Gracchi. Such was the
                    foundation for his history; and his style seems to have partaken much of the dry
                    and jejune character of the memoirs which he copied. Polybius has expressed a
                    doubt respecting their credibility, but, we think, without sufficient reason.
                    That he should have copied from a Greek writer, Diocles of Alexandria, as
                    Dionysius hints, carries with it its own refutation; but it is a curious fact
                    that he wrote his annals in the Greek as well as Latin language. To what period
                    he brought down his history we are unable to determine. Livy speaks of his death
                    169 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> (Molleri <hi rend="italic">Diss, de Q.

                    >Fabius</hi><hi rend="italic">Maximus Verrucosus,</hi> one of the most
                    distinguished men whom Rome produced, the principal events of whose life are
                    included between 233 and 203 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> He first makes his
                    appearance in history as the conqueror of the Ligurians, who had long braved the
                    power of Rome; and though we have no account of his proceedings from this period
                    down to the beginning of the second Punic war, he must have no doubt taken a
                    prominent part in public affairs, as he was then appointed to head the embassy
                    (219 B. c.) sent to Carthage to inquire whether that state approved of
                    Hannibal’s proceedings in attacking Saguntum. The answer proved unsatisfactory;
                    when Fabius, assuming the haughty dignity of a Roman senator, and folding up his
                    cloak so as to form a cavity, thus addressed the nobles of Carthage: “Hic vobis
                    bellum et pacem portamus; utrum placet sumite.” Being answered that he might
                    give which he pleased, he indignantly exclaimed, “Then I denounce war against
                    you ;” and the deputies returned to Rome to state the result of their mission.
                    The disastrous campaign on the Trebia, and the defeat on the banks of the
                    Thrasymene Lake, must have warned Rome that her successful resistance to
                    Hannibal, and even her very existence, mainly depended on the wisdom of the
                    general to whom she had entrusted her troops. Every thing pointed out Fabius as
                    the person on whom the fate of Rome ought to be allowed to depend. The senate
                    appointed him dictator; and the fearless character of Minucius probably induced
                    Fabius to make him, as master of the horse, second in command. The proceedings
                    of Fabius did not eventually disappoint the expectations of his countrymen. The
                    grand object of his policy was to weary out and exhaust the army of Hannibal,
                    without the' risk of a general engagement; and so closely did he adhere to the
                    plan which he had laid down for himself, that he received Torn this circumstance
                    the name of Cunctator. His slow and cautious policy by no means suited the
                    ardent spirit of the Romans, and more particularly that of Minucius, who began
                    to ridicule the proceedings of Fabius, and, when he was absent at Rome, took the
                    opportunity of attacking the enemy, and came off victorious. This tended only
                    more strongly to confirm the opponents of Fabius in their opinion; and Varro,
                    who was at this time exerting ms utmost to acquire notoriety, was the only
                    person who had boldness or impudence enough to propose to the people that
                    Minucius should be made equal in command with Fabius. The result was exactly
                    such as might have been anticipated. Minucius engaged in battle with Hannibal,
                    and his army would have been cut to pieces, but or the opportune arrival of
                    Fabius. Minucius seems to ιιave had the moral courage to confess his folly, and
                    cheerfully to submit to the orders of Fabius. At the end of six months he
                    resigned his command.</p>
                <p>Rut it was not long before Rome was again obliged to <hi rend="superscript">
                    lave</hi> recourse to the experience of Fabius. After the defeat at Cannae (216
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.),</hi> he was appointed, along with Marcellus, to the
                    command of the armies; Fabius being called <hi rend="italic">the shield,</hi>
                    and Marcellus <hi rend="italic">the sword, of</hi> the republic. He laid siege
                    to the important city of Capua; and when llanmbal marched towards Rome,
                    threatening the city itself, Fabius remained firmly at his post, trusting in the
                    known bravery of his fellow-citizens. Again, in his fifth consulship, we find
                    him taking the city of Tarentum; and when it was proposed, towards the
                    conclusion of the war, that Scipio should pass into Africa, Fabius was decidedly
                    opposed to the scheme. But he did not live to witness the final success of
                    Scipio, having died at an advanced age, 203 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c.
                    Plutarch has written his life; and many facts respecting him may be gathered
                    from Livy, xxi.-xxx.</p>
