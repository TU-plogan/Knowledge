                    Des</hi></label>, a French critic, the son of a councillor in the parliament of
                    Rouen, was born in that city on the 18th December 1685, and terminated his
                    career at Paris on the 16th December 1745. At the age of fifteen he entered into
                    the society of the Jesuits, where he received orders; and at thirty quitted it
                    to return to the world. He was a priest, and had a cure in Normandy, which he
                    soon left, and, as a man of wit and letters, lived for a time with the Cardinal
                    d’Auvergne. Having excited some attention at Paris by certain critical
                    productions, Desfontaines was, in 1724, employed to conduct the <hi
                    rend="italic">Journal des Sçavans.</hi> He acquitted himself well in this
                    department, and was peaceably enjoying the applause of the public, when his
                    enemies, exasperated by critical strictures in his journal, caused him to be
                    accused of an abominable crime, and procured his imprisonment. By the credit of
                    powerful friends, however, he was set at liberty in fifteen days: the magistrate
                    of the police took upon himself the trouble of justifying him, in a letter
                    addressed to the Abbé Bignon; and this letter having been read amidst his
                    fellow-labourers in the journal, he was unanimously re-established in his former
                    credit. This happened in 1725. But with whatever reputation he acquitted himself
                    in conducting his journal, frequent disgusts induced him at length to abandon
                    it. Meanwhile he laboured in some new periodical works, from which he derived
                    his greatest fame. In 1731 he commenced one under the title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Le Nouvelliste du Parnasse, ou</hi><hi rend="italic">Reflexions</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sur les Ouvrages Nouveaux;</hi> but it only extended to two
                    volumes, the work having been suppressed by authority, from the incessant
                    complaints of the authors ridiculed therein. About three years after, in 1735,
                    he obtained a new privilege for a periodical production entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les Ecrits Modernes,</hi>
                    which, after extending to thirty-three volumes, was suppressed in 1743. Yet the
                    year following, 1744, he published another weekly paper called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jugenιens</hi><hi rend="italic">sur les Ecrits Nouveaux,</hi> which proceeded
                    to eleven volumes; the last two having been executed by other hands. In 1745 he
