                    >Greeh-FiRE,</hi> a kind of artificial or factitious fire, which burns even
                    under water, and that with greater violence than out of it. It is composed of
                    sulphur, naphtha, pitch, gum, and bitumen; and is only extinguishable by vinegar
                    mixed with sand and urine, or by means of raw hides.</p>
                <p>The motion or tendency of this fire is said to be contrary to that of natural
                    fire, and always follows the direction in which it is thrown, whether it be
                    downwards, sidewise, or otherwise. The French call it <hi rend="italic">Greek
                    fire,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">feu Grequois,</hi> because it was first used by
                    the Greeks, about the year 660; as is observed by Petavius, on the authority of
                    Nicetas, Theophanes, Cedrenus, and others.</p>
                <p>The inventor, according to the same authority, was an engineer of Heliopolis, in
                    Syria, named Callinicus, who first applied it in the sea-fight in which
                    Constantine Po-gonates commanded against the Saracens, near Cyzicus, in the
                    Hellespont; and with such effect, that he therewith burnt the whole fleet, in
                    which were thirty thousand men. But others think it of much older date, and
                    consider Marcus Gracchus as the inventor; an opinion which is supported by
                    several passages both in the Greek and Roman writers, showing it to have been
                    anciently used by both these nations in their wars. Constantines successors used
                    it on different occasions with equal advantage; and, what is remarkable, they
                    were fortunate enough to keep the secret of the composition to themselves, so
                    that in the year 960 no other nation was acquainted with the composition. , <hi

                    of much greater force than the mere arm. That thrown with the mortar sometimes
                    appeared in the air of the size of a tun, with a long tail, and a noise like
                    that of thunder. The French by degrees discovered the secret of extinguishing
                    it, in which they several times succeeded.</p>

                    rend="italic">Meteorology,</hi> are luminous bodies, which appear at a
                    considerable height above the earth, shining occasionally with very great
                    splendour, and sometimes leaving a luminous track behind them after they have
                    disappeared. The larger ones in this hemisphere proceed generally from north to
                    south with great velocity, frequently exploding into globes of smaller size, and
                    sometimes vanishing with a report, sometimes without one. They are not
                    unfrequently attended with a discharge of solid compounds of earthy and metallic
                    matters, called meteoric stones, the descent of which, though stubbornly denied
                    for a time, was finally established about the beginning of this century.</p>
                <p>These luminous appearances no doubt constituted part of the ancient prodigies,
                    blazing stars or comets, which last they sometimes resemble in being attended
                    with a train; but they frequently appear with a round and well-defined disk. The
                    first of these of which we have any accurate account, was observed by Dr Halley
                    and some other philosophers atdifferent places, in the year 1719. From the
                    slight observations they could take of its course, the perpendicular height of
                    this body was computed at about seventy miles above the surface of the earth.
                    The height of others has also been computed, and found to vary from thirty-three
                    to a hundred miles. The velocity at which they travel is estimated at from five
                    to thirty-three miles in a second. The most remarkable of these on record
                    appeared on the 18th of August 1783, about nine o’clock in the evening. It was
                    seen to the northward of Zetland, and took a southerly direction for an immense
                    space, being observed in the southern provinces of France, and, according to one
                    account, in the ecclesiastical capital of Italy. During its course it frequently
                    changed its shape; sometimes appearing in the form of one ball, sometimes of two
                    or more, sometimes with a train, sometimes without one. It passed over Edinburgh
                    nearly in its zenith, and had then the appearance of a well-defined round body,
                    extremely luminous, and of a greenish colour, the light which it diffused on the
                    ground giving likewise a greenish cast to objects. After passing the zenith it
                    was attended by a train of considerable length, which continually augmented, and
                    at last entirely obliterated the head, so that it looked like a wedge, flying
                    with the obtuse end foremost. The motion was not apparently rapid, by reason of
                    its great height; though in reality it must have moved with great velocity, on
                    account of the immense space over which it travelled in a short time. In other
                    places its appearance was very different. At Greenwich we are told that •‘ two
                    bright balls parallel to each other led the way, the diameter of which appeared
                    to be about two feet; and were followed by an expulsion of eight others, not
                    elliptical, seeming gradually to mutilate, for the last was small. Between each
                    two balls a luminous serrated body extended, and at the last a blaze issued
                    which terminated in a point. Minute particles dilated from the whole. The balls
                    were tinted first by a pure bright light, then followed a tender yellow, mixed
                    with azure, red, and green; hich, with a coalition of bolder tints, and a
                    reflection horn the other balls, gave the most beautiful rotundity and variation
                    of colours that the human eye could be charmed with. The sudden illumination of
                    the atmosphere, and the form and singular transition of this bright uminary,
                    tended much to make it awful; nevertheless, Οε amazing vivid appearance of the
                    different balls, and otιer rich connective parts not very easy to delineate, ]
                    gave an effect equal to the rainbow in the full zenith of its glory.</p>
                <p>Dr Blagden, in a paper on the subject inserted in the seventy-fourth volume of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> not only gave a
                    particular account of this and other meteors o the kind, but offered several
                    conjectures as to the probable causes of them. The first thing which occurred to
                    philosophers on this subject was, that the meteors in question were burning
                    bodies rising from the surface of the earth, and flying along the atmosphere
                    with great rapidity. But this hypothesis was soon abandoned, on considering that
                    there was no power known by which such bodies could either be raised to a
                    sufficient height, or projected with the velocity of these meteors. The next
                    hypothesis was, that they did not consist of one single body, but of a train of
                    inflammable vapours, extending a vast way through the atmosphere, which being
                    kindled at one end, displayed the luminous appearances in question by the fire
                    running from one end of the train to the other. To this hypothesis, which was
                    invented by Dr Halley, Dr Blagđen objected that no just explanation was given of
                    the nature of the vapours themselves, the manner in which they were raised up,
                    or their regular arrangement in straight lines of such vast extent; or how they
                    could be supposed to burn in such rarefied air. “Indeed,” says he, “it is very
                    difficult to conceive how vapours could be prevented, in those regions where
                    there is in a manner no pressure, from spreading out on all sides in consequence
                    of their natural elasticity, and instantly losing that degree of density which
                    seems necessary for inflammation. Besides, it is to be expected, that such
                    trains would sometimes take fire in the middle, and thus present the phenomenon
                    of two meteors at the same time, receding from one another in a direct
                    line.”</p>
                <p>For these and other reasons the hypothesis of Dr Halley was abandoned, and
                    another substituted in its place. This was, that the meteors in question are
                    permanent solid bodies, not rising from the earth, but revolving round it in
                    very eccentric orbits, and thus in their perigeon moving with inconceivable
                    rapidity. But this hypothesis is likewise objectionable. Another theory supposes
                    that the meteors in question are a kind of bodies which take fire as soon as
                    they come within the atmosphere of the earth. Sir Humphry Davy’s discovery that
                    the earths and alkalis are metallic oxides, affords some plausibility to this
                    theory, especially in cases where the meteors are accompanied with the descent
                    of solid bodies to the earth. It has been suggested that the bases of the earth
                    may exist in the meteor in a metallic state, and that when the body arrives
                    within the range of our atmosphere, the strong affinity which it is well known
                    these metallic bases have for oxygen, causes them to unite and produce violent
                    combustion. The origin of fire-balls has also been ascribed to the agency of
                    electricity, and there seems little doubt that this is really the true way of
                    accounting for them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Falling</hi> or <hi rend="italic">shooting stars</hi> are the
                    same phenomena upon a smaller scale. They are to be seen at all seasons, but
                    most frequently during the prevalence of the northern lights, and most commonly
                    in the lower regions of the atmosphere. The cause of these phenomena, as of
                    those of a more magnificent description, has been attributed to electricity.
                    This theory, however, was objected to by Sir Humphry Davy; and his opinions on
                    every subject are entitled to the highest deference, and to deliberate
                    consideration. He conceived them to be attributable to falling stones. But the

                    the close of the sixteenth century, and made a figure in almost all the
                    countries of Europe. The distinguishing tenet from which they derived this
                    appellation was, that the intimate essences of natural things were only to be
                    known by the trying efforts of fire, directed in a chemical process. They were
                    also called Theosophists, from their declaring against human reason as a
                    dangerous and deceitful guide, and representing a divine and supernatural
                    illumination as the only means of arriving at truth; and Paracelsists, from
                    Paracelsus, the eminent physician and chemist, who was the chief ornament of
                    this extraordinary sect. It was patronized in England by Robert Flood or Fludd,
                    who endeavoured to illustrate the philosophy of Paracelsus in a great number of
                    treatises; in France it was zealously propagated by Rivier; in Denmark, by
                    Severinus; in Germany, by Kunrath, an eminent physician of Dresden; and in other
                    countries by ardent votaries, who assumed an air of piety and devotion, and
                    proposed to themselves no other end than the advancement of the divinc glory,
                    and the restoration of peace and concord in a divided church. One of the most
                    celebrated of these was Daniel Hoffman, professor of divinity in the university
                    of Helmstadt, who, availing himself of some unguarded passages in the writings
                    of Luther, maintained that philosophy was the mortal enemy of religion; that
                    truth was divisible into two branches, the philosophical and theological; and
                    that what was true in philosophy was false in theology. But Hoffman was
                    afterwards obliged, by the interposition of Henry Julius, duke of Brunswick, to
                    retract his invectives against philosophy, and to acknowledge in the most open
                    manner the harmony of sound philosophy with genuine theology.</p>
