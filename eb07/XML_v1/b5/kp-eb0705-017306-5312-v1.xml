                    bachelor of physic in 1653, was created doctor in that faculty in 1660, and the
                    same year elected master of his college in pursuance of the king’s mandate to
                    that effect. In 1685 he received the appointment of keeper of the records in the
                    Tower of London, and soon after was chosen regius professor of physic in the
                    University of Cambridge. In 1679 he wrote a letter to Dr Sydenham on the

                    made an absolute conquest of the nation; and, thirdly, that the succession to

                    1685, in the parliament of James II., to whom he afterwards became physician in
                    ordinary. But the Revolution put a stop to his public career, and he died in
                    August 1700, immediately after the publication of his History. Dr Brady’s other

                    divine, the son of Nicholas Brady, an officer of the king’s army in the civil
                    war, was born at Bandon in the county of Cork in October 1659. He continued in
                    Ireland till he was twelve years of age; at which period he was sent over to
                    England, entered at Westminster School, and thence in duc time removed to Christ
                    Church, Oxford, where he remained about four years. He then returned to Dublin,
                    where his father resided, and immediately commenced bachelor of arts at Trinity
                    College, which afterwards, on his attaining due standing, presented him with a
                    diploma conferring the degree of doctor in divinity. His first ecclesiastical
                    preferment was to a prebend in the Cathedral <hi rend="italic">of</hi> St Barry
                    at Cork, to which he was collated by Bishop Wettenhall. He was a zealous
                    promoter of the Revolution, and suffered in consequence. When the troubles broke
                    out in Ireland in 1690, Brady, by his influence, thrice prevented the burning of
                    the town <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Bandon, after as many orders had been issued
                    for its destruction; and the same year, being deputed by the people of Bandon,
                    he went over to England to solicit parliament for the redress of some grievances
                    they had suffered while King James was in Ireland. What success attended this
                    mission we know not; but Brady soon afterwards, quitting his preferments in
                    Ireland, settled in London, where he was chosen minister of St Catherine Cree
                    Church, and lecturer of St Michael’s Wood-street. He subsequently became
                    minister of Richmond in Surrey, and Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, and at
                    length rector of Clapham in Surrey, which, together with his living of Richmond,
                    he held till his death. He was also chaplain to the Duke of Ormond’s troop of
                    horse-guards, and to their majesties King William and Queen Mary. He died in May
                    1726, aged sixty-six. Dr Brady was accounted a man of an agreeable temper, and
                    had the reputation of being a polite gentleman, an excellent preacher, and an
                    indifferent poet. His name is familiar as the translator, in conjunction with Mr
                    Tate, of a new version of the Psalms, which was licensed in 1696. He also
                    translated Virgil’s AEneid, published by subscription in 1726, in four vols.
                    8vo; and a tragedy entitled <hi rend="italic">The Pape, or the Innocent
                    Imposture,</hi> both very indifferent performances. His prose works consist of
                    Sermons, three volumes of which were published by himself, and other three by
                    his eldest son, who was a clergyman at Tooting in Surrey.</p>
