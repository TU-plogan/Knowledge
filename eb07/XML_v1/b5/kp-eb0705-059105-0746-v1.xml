                    negleeting literature and the sciences, to which he discovered an early and
                    decided attachment. His study of the Roman history exeited in him a strong
                    desire to visit Italy, whieh he accordingly traversed in 1739, in eompany with
                    his friend Μ. de Sainte-Palaye. On his return to France he published his <hi

                    his death without the consent of his family. In 1760 he published a dissertation

                    afterwards inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopédie Méthodique.</hi> At

                    whieh were afterwards adopted by Pinkerton aid succeeding geographers. In 1765

                    marked by that love of theory whieh is so apt to imbue the cultivators of
                    etymological seienee.</p>
                <p>De Brosses had been occupied, during a great part of his life, in making a
                    translation of Sallust, and in attempting to supply the chasms in that
                    celebrated historian. At length, in 1777, he published <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire du le Siècle</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    la</hi><hi rend="italic">République</hi><hi rend="italic">Romaine,</hi> three
                    vols. 4to; a work whieh would probably have met with great success had the style
                    corresponded with the interest of the subject, and with the author’s historical
                    sagacity and depth of research. To the history is prefixed a learned life of
                    Sallust, which was reprinted at the commencement of the translation of that
                    historian by De Lamalle. After the death of De Brosses a supplement was added to
                    this work, from his MSS. containing the various readings, fragments, and an
                    index of the authors from whom they are taken. This supplement, whieh should be
                    placed at the end of the third volume, is wanting in some eopies.</p>
                <p>These literary occupations did not prevent De Brosses from discharging with
                    ability his official duties, nor from carrying on a constant and extensive
                    correspondence with the most distinguished literary characters of his time.
                    During the leisure afforded him by the suspension of the parliaments in the year
                    1771, he applied himself with greater vigour to literature. In 1758 he succeeded
                    the Marquis de Caumont in the <hi rend="italic">Académie de Belles Lettres;</hi>
                    but was never admitted a member of the Freneh Academy, in consequenee, it is
                    said, of the opposition of Voltaire, who entertained a dislike to him.</p>
                <p>De Brosses died on the 7th of May 1777. He was a man no less distinguished for
                    ease and vivaeity in the general intercourse of society, than for the extent and
                    variety of his literary attainments. Besides the works we have already
                    mentioned, he wrote several memoirs and dissertations in the collections of the
                    Academy of Inscriptions, and in those of the AEademy of Dijon. He also
                    contributed a number of articles to the <hi rend="italic">Dictionnaire
                    Encyclopédique,</hi> on the subjects of grammar, etymology, music, &amp;c.; and
                    he left behind him several MSS. which were unfortunately lost during the
                    revolution. (See the <hi rend="italic">Biographic</hi><hi rend="italic"
