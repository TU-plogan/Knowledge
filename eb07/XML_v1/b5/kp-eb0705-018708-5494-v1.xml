                    architect and politician, was the sęcond son of Sir Richard Bray, one of the
                    privy eouncil to King Henry VI. Sir Reginald was instrumental in the advancement
                    of King Henry VII. to the throne of England, and was greatly in favour with that
                    prinee, who bestowed honours and wealth upon him. His skill in arehiteeture
                    appears from Henry VIĽs ehapel at Westminster, and the ehapel of St George at
                    Windsor; he had a principal eoneern and direction in building the former, and in
                    finishing and bringing to perfection the latter, to whieh he was also a liberal
                    benefaetor. He died in 1501, and was interred in the above chapel, probably
                    under the stone where Dr Waterland lies; for, on opening the vault to admit the
                    body of that gentleman, who died in 1740, a leaden coffin of aneient form was
                    found, whieh, by other appcaranees, was judged to be that of Sir Reginald, and
                    was, by order of the dean, immediately arched over.</p>

                    at Oxford. He was at length presented to the viearage of Over-Whitacre, in
                    Warwickshire; and in 1690 he obtained the reetory of Sheldon, where he composed
                    his Catechetical Leetures. These procured him such reputation, that Dr Compton,
                    bishop of London, pitehed upon him as a proper person to model the infant church
                    of Maryland, and establish it upon a solid foundation; and for that purpose he
                    was invested with the office of eommissary. Fie now engaged in several important
                    undertakings. He caused sums to be raised for purehasing small libraries for the
                    use of the poor ministers in the several parts of our plantations; and the
                    better to promote this design, he published two books. One of these is entitled
