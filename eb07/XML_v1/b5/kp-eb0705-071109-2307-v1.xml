                <p><label type="entry">BURGOS</label>, a province of Castile, in the north of Spain,
                    bounded on the north by the ocean; on the east by Biscay, Alava, and Soria; on
                    the south by Segovia; and on the west by Palencia, Valladolid, Toro, and
                    Asturias. Its extent is 7822 square miles. It is a lofty territory, intersected
                    by ranges of mountains, between which are extensive and fruitful valleys. The
                    soil is for the most part sandy, intermixed with stones, but in some parts is of
                    a good loamy description. The loftiest mountains are in the north, called the
                    Cantabrian, which are covered with woods; whilst the Sierra Reynosa and others
                    are bare, and almost utterly barren. The valleys in the province are watered by
                    various small streams, and their tributary rivulets, the waters of all which are
                    collected in part by the Ebro, which conveys them to the Mediterranean Sea, and
                    in part by the Douro, which runs to the Atlantic Ocean. The climate is generally
                    temperate, the summers being cool, and, except on the loftier parts, the winters
                    not sufficiently cold. The atmosphere in the interior is commonly clear, but on
                    the coast moist and foggy. The agriculture, though ill conducted, produces a
                    sufficiency for the population. The breeding of cattle is the most profitable
                    branch of rural industry; and the province supplies its neighbours with many
                    cows, sheep, goats, horses, mules, and asses. Some silk, flax, and hemp are
                    produced, but in very small quantities. There are scarcely any manufactures
                    except of the domestic kind, or upon a very small scale. The inhabitants at the
                    last correct census, that of 1803, amounted to 470,588; and it is probable they
                    have increased since that period. The province contains five cities, 583 towns,
                    and 1118 villages. The only places of more than 5000 inhabitants are Burgos,
                    Logrofio, and Santander.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Burgos,</hi> a city, the capital of the province of the same
                    name, in Spain. It is situated on a hill, around which the river Arlanzon winds.
                    It is fortified, but its chief defence is the castle, which checked the progress
                    of the British army. It is the see of an archbishop, whose cathedral is large
                    and handsome, though antique. It has, besides, fourteen other churches, and
                    twenty-four religious houses. It is the seat of the military academy and an
