                    was born on the 18th of May 1711, at Ragusa, a sea-port on the coast of the
                    Adriatic, and capital of a small republic of the same name, then under the
                    protection of the Turks and the Venetians. It does not appear that our author
                    gave any tokens of superior genius till he was sent to learn grammar and
                    philosophy in the schools of the Jesuits, who were at that time the principal
                    teachers in Ragusa, and indeed throughout all Italy. Amongst these shrewd
                    observers his docility and obedience were sufficient to mark him out as a person
                    likely to attain future eminence, and consequently to procure him particular
                    attention. In his fifteenth year, after he had gone through the ordinary course
                    of education, and when it was necessary to decide as to his future pursuits,
                    application was made for his admission into the order; and, for the reasons just
                    mentioned, this was readily complied with, and the subject of the present notice
                    sent to Rome in the year 1725. On his arrival in the Eternal City he entered on
                    his noviciate for admission into the order; but here his studies changed their
                    character and direction, although they were still pursued with diligence.
                    Christian morality, with the rules and constitutions of the order, claimed his
                    attention for two years; after which he was instructed in rhetoric, and became
                    well versed in general literature, particularly Latin poetry, which at that time
                    was very much cultivated.</p>
                <p>From the noviciate lie was sent to the Roman college to study mathematics and
                    physics; and it was in these sciences that his genius and abilities shone forth
                    so conspicuously, and procured him the admiration of his superiors<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733323?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3323-0020"/>. In the course
                    of three years he was able to give private lessons in the mathematics; and he
                    was then exempted from the operation of a law, by which the novices were bound
                    to teach Latin and the belles-lettres for five years before they commenced the
                    study of theology. This exemption was in consequence of his great predilection
                    for the mathematics, of which he was soon afterwards made public professor. For
                    this professorship he was eminently qualified, as, besides a thorough knowledge
                    of all the modern productions in the science, he had acquired a elassieal
                    severity of demonstration by studying the works of the ancient geometricians;
                    yet he conjoined withal an obliging accommodation of his own habits to the
                    deficiencies of his pupils, and for their benefit composed elementary treatises
                    on arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and trigonometry. But notwithstanding the
                    arduous duties of his situation, he found time to instruct and enlighten more
                    than boys; for about this period he formed some of those refined and original
                    notions which were destined to grow up into the system that afterwards became so
                    celebrated. The animating spirit of discovery and invention led him to consider
                    every portion of physical science; and indeed so versatile and vigorous was his
                    mind, that we should be at a loss to speeify any one portion which, within a few
                    years, it did not comprehend, elueidate, and advanee. In confirmation of this it
                    will be sufficient to present our readers with an enumeration of the principal
                    subjects to which hc turned his attention, and concerning which he published
                    dissertations while he continued in the professorship. These were, the transit
                    of Mercury over the sun, the spots in the sun, the aurora borealis, the
                    construction of spherical trigonometry, the figure of the earth, a new telescope
                    to determine celestial objects, the ancient arguments for the ťotùnSity of the
                    earth, oseillating cireles; on infinites and infinitely small quantities, the
                    motion of bodies in unresisting spaees, the aberration of the fixed stars, the
                    inequalities in terrestrial gravity; on astronomy, on the limits of eertainty in
                    astronomical observations; on the solid of greatest attraction, the cycloid, the
                    logistic curve lines, the <hi rend="italic">vires vives,</hi> the comets, light,
                    the tides, the rainbow, the calculation of fractions, the centre of gravity, the
                    moon’s atmosphere, the law of eontinuity, lenses and dioptrical telescopes, the
                    objective micrometer, and the divisibility of matter. Some of these arc short,
                    but all of them eon tain curious and valuable matter. It is only by perusing
                    them that we are able to discover the gradual progress of his mind, and to
                    understand the manner in which he arrived at that theory of natural philosophy
                    which is now known by his name.</p>
                <p>About this time a taste for philosophical poetry was very prevalent amongst the
                    learned, and some of Bosco-vieh’s acquaintances had laboured in it with suceess.
                    Of these we may mention Father Noceti, who wrote on the rainbow and the aurora
                    borealis, and Benedict Stay, whose poems on the philosophy of Descartes, and on
                    the more modern philosophy, are considered as excellent examples of Latin
                    composition. Boscovich published the works of both with annotations and
                    supplements, in which a splendid fund of information and learning is
                    displayed.</p>
                <p>By such undertakings his fame was widely diffused, and he beeame an object of
                    general admiration. The learned societies of many countries in Europe conferred
                    on him unsolicited honours, and several foreign princes invited him to their
                    courts. His opinions on various subjects of eivil architecture, topography, and
                    hydrodynamics, were solicited by Pope Benedict XIV., John V. of Portugal, and
                    others. These applications neeessarily required his presence in different states
                    of Europe, where he never failed to enhanee his reputation, and often terminated
                    disputes which, but for his judicious interference, might have had disagreeable
                    consequences.</p>
                <p>He was employed to correct the maps of the papal dominions, and to measure a
                    degree of the meridian passing through them. In this operation he was assisted
                    by an English jesuit named Christopher Maire. An account of their expedition was
                    printed at Rome and Paris, and is interspersed with some curious anecdotes
                    concerning the opinions which the peasants of the Apennines* formed of them, and
                    the operations whieh they had to perform; but it is chiefly valuable on aeeount
                    of the detail which is given of their observations.</p>
                <p>In the year 1757 he was sent to Vienna by the republie of Lucca, to settle some
                    differences which had arisen concerning the draining of a lake, in which the
                    grand duke of Tuscany, the emperor Francis I., and that republic, were
                    concerned; and it was after lie had succeeded in the objeet of his mission to
                    that city that he published there his <hi rend="italic">Theoria Philosophice
                    Naturalis</hi> in 1758.</p>
                <p>Another occasion for his mediating powers soon presented itself, and more nearly
                    interested him, as it concerned his native eity of Ragusa. The British
                    government having suspected that some ships of war had been fitted out in that
                    port for the service of France, and that its neutrality had thus been infringed,
                    this suspicion alarmed the senate of Ragusa, and required speedy removal, more
                    especially as the consequences might have been extremely prejudicial to their
                    commerce. Boscovich, who had often been successful in similar missions for other
                    powers, appeared to them the fittest person to be intrusted with this.
                    Accordingly, having been nominated by his countrymen, he repaired to London,
                    where he effected the objeet of his mission with honour to himself and
                    satisfaction to his native state. He visited the Royal Society, which received
                    him with distinguished marks of respect; and he soon afterwards complimented it
                    with an excellent Latin poem on the solar and lunar eclipses. This was in the
                    year 1760. Boscovich was invited by the Royal Society to be of the party of
                    their members about to proceed to Ameriea in order to observe the transit of
                    Venus over the sun’s disc. But the nature of his embassy, and the necessity of
                    returning home, prevented his accepting the invitation. Soon after his return
                    from this embassy, he was appointed by the senate of Milan to the mathematical
                    chair in the university of Pavia, with the superintendence of the observatory of
                    the royal college of Brera. He continued in this situation for six years, when
                    the empress queen appointed him professor of astronomy and optics in the
                    Palatine schools of Milan, and also requested that he would continue his
                    attention to the observatory. This he expected to prove the most agreeable part
                    of his life. Admired by the learned, beloved by his friends, and having an
                    adequate income, with a sound and vigorous constitution, he promised to himself
                    happy because useful days, in the tranquil cultivation of the sciences. But a
                    cloud long impending now burst over his head, in the edict for the abolition of
                    his order, which took place in the year 1773. No exemption from the ediet could
                    be procured; all who held offices were dismissed; and Boscovich sought refuge in
                    the city of Paris. Thither indeed he was invited by Turgot, through whose means
                    he was made one of the directors of opties for the sea service, and received a
                    pension; but it would seem that his situation proved disagreeable to him; nor is
                    this to be wondered at, considering the peculiar eireumstances which had induced
                    him to take up his residence in the French capital. He remained there, however,
                    for ten years, on the expiry of which he set out for Bassano, in the republic of
                    Veniee, and there published, in five volumes<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193733336?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3336-0021"/> quarto, a
                    collection of the works which he had completed in Paris. The following is a
                    pretty accurate enumeration of their contents: A new instrument for determining
                    the refracting and diverging forces of diaphanous bodies; a demonstration of the
                    falsehood of the Newtonian analogy between light and sound; the algebraic
                    formulae regarding the foci of lenses, and their applications for calculating
                    the sphericity of those which are to be used in achromatic telescopes; the
                    corrections to be made in ocular lenses, and the error of the sphericity of
                    certain glasses; the causes which hinder the exact union of the solar rays by
                    means of the great burning glasses, and the determination of the loss arising
                    from it; the method of determining the different velocities of light passing
                    through different media by means of two dioptric telescopes, one common, the
                    other of a new kind, containing water between the objective glass and the place
                    of the image; a new kind of objective micrometers; the defects and inutility of
                    a dioptric telescope proposed and made at Paris, which gives two images of the
                    same object, the one direct, the other inverse, with two contrary motions of
                    movable objects; masses floating in the atmosphere, as hail of an extraordinary
                    size, seen on the sun with the telescope, and resembling spots; the astronomical
                    refractions, with various methods for determining them; different methods for
                    determining the orbits of comets and of the new planet, with copious
                    applications of these doctrines to other astronomical subjects, and still more
                    generally to geometry and to the science of calculation; the errors,
                    rectifications, and use of quadrants, sextants, astronomical sectors, the
                    meridian line, telescopes called transit instruments, the meridian, and the
                    parallactic machine; the trigonometrical differential formulae, which are of so
                    much use in astronomy; the use of the micrometrical rhombus, extended to any
                    oblique position whatsoever; the error arising from refractions in using the
                    astronomical ring for a sun-dial, and the correction to be made; the appearing
                    and the disappearing of Saturn’s ring; methods of determining the rotation of
                    the sun by means of the spots; the greatest exactness possible in determining
                    the length of a pendulum oscillating every second of mean time by the comparison
                    of terrestrial and celestial gravity; a compend of astronomy for the use of the
                    marine, containing the elements of the heavenly motions, and of the astronomical
                    instruments, to be explained to a prince in the course of one month; a method
                    for determining the altitudes of the poles with the greatest exactness, by means
                    of a gnomon alone, where other instruments are not to be had; the determination
                    of the illuminated edge of the moon to be observed on the meridian; a method of
                    using the retrograde return of Venus to the same longitude, for determining the
                    less certain elements of her orbit; a method for correcting the elements of a
                    comet, of which the longitude of the node is given, and the inclination of the
                    orbit has been nearly found; another method for the same purpose, and for
                    finding the elliptical orbit, when the parabolic one does not agree with
                    observation; a method for correcting the elements of a planet by three
                    observations; the projection of an orbit inclined in the plane of the ecliptic;
                    the projection of an orbit inclined in any other plane; the calculation of the
                    aberration of the stars, arising from the successive propagation of light; and
                    some beautiful theorems belonging to triangles, which are of great use in
                    astronomy, reduced to the most simple demonstrations.</p>
                <p>After the publication of these works, our author quitted Bassano, and went to
                    Rome to visit the companions of his youth. From Rome he proceeded to Milan,
                    where he revised some of his own works, and prepared for publication the two
                    last volumes of Stay’s poems. His death took place on the 13th of February 1787,
                    in the seventysixth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Besides the different works above mentioned, Boscovich wrote several others on
                    various subjects, as on the project of turning the navigation to Rome from
                    Fiumicino to Maccarese; on two torrents in the territory of Perugia; on the
                    bulwarks of the river Ponaro; on the river Sidone in the territory of Placentia;
                    on the bulwarks of the Po; ôn the harbours of Ancona, of Rimini, of Magna Vacca,
                    and Savona; besides some others, almost all of which were printed. For an
