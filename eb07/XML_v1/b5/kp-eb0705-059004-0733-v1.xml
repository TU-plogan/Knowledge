                <p><label type="entry">BROOME, <hi rend="smallcaps">William</hi></label>, the
                    coadjutor of Pope in translating the Odyssey, was born in Cheshire, as is said,
                    of very mean parents. He was educated upon the foundation at Eton, and was
                    captain of the school a whole year, without any vacancy by which he might have
                    obtained a scholarship at King’s College. Being by this delay, which is said to
                    have happened very rarely, superannuated, he was sent to St John’s College by
                    the contribution of his friends, where he obtained a small exhibition. At this
                    college he lived for some time in the same chamber with the well known Ford, by
                    whom Dr Johnson heard him described as a contracted scholar and a mere
                    versifier, unacquainted with life, and unskilful in conversation. His addiction
                    to metre was then such that his companions familiarly called him <hi
                    rend="italic">Poet.</hi> When he had opportunities of mingling with mankind, he
                    cleared himself as Ford likewise owned, from great part of his scholastic rust.
                    He appeared early in the world as a translator of the Iliads into prose, in
                    conjunction with Ozell and Oldisworth. How their several parts were distributed
                    is not known. This is the translation of which Ozell boasted as superior, in
                    Toland’s opinion, to that of Pope. It has long since vanished, Dr Johnson
                    observes, and is now in no danger from the critics. He was introduced to Mr
                    Pope, who was then visiting Sir John Cotton at Madingley, near Cambridge, and
                    gained so much of his esteem that he was employed to make extracts from
                    Eustathius for the notes to the translation of the Iliad; and in the volumes of
                    poetry published by Lintot, commonly called <hi rend="italic">Popes
                    Miscellanies,</hi> many of his early pieces were inserted.</p>
                <p>Pope and Broome were to be yet more closely connected. When the success of the
                    Iliad gave encouragement to a version of the Odyssey, Pope, weary of the toil,
                    called Fenton and Broome to his assistance; and taking only half the work upon
                    himself, divided the other half between his partners, giving four books to
                    Fenton and eight to Broome. Fenton’s books are enumerated in Dr Johnson’s life
                    ofhim. To the lot of Broome fell the second, sixth, eighth, eleventh, twelfth,
                    sixteenth, eighteenth, and twenty-third, together with the burden of writing all
                    the notes. The price at which Pope purchased this assistance was L.300 paid to
                    Fenton and L.500 to Broome, with as many copies as he wanted for his friends,
                    which amounted to L.100 more. The payment made to Fenton is known only by
                    hearsay; Broome’s is very distinctly told by Pope in the notes to the Dunciad.
                    It is evident that, according to Pope’s own estimate, Broome was unkindly
                    treated. If four books could merit L.300, eight, and all the notes, equivalent
                    at least to four, had certainly a right to more than L.600. Broome probably
                    considered himself as injured, and there was for some time more than coldness
                    between him and his employer. He always spoke of Pope as too much a lover of
                    money, and Pope pursued him with avowed hostility; for he not only named him
                    disrespectfully in ⅛ <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> Dunciad, but quoted him more
                    than once in the Bathos, as a proficient in the art of sinking; and in his
                    enumeration of the different kinds of poets distinguished for the profound, he
                    reckons Broome among “the parrots who repeat another’s words in such a hoarse
                    odd tone as makes them seem their own.” It has been said that they were
                    afterwards reconciled; but their peace was probably wit ∙ out friendship. He
                    afterwards published a .Miscellany o Poems, and never rose to very high dignity
