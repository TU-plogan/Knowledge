                <p><label type="entry">BENNET, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry</hi></label>, earl of
                    Arlington, was born of an ancient family in Middlesex. In the beginning of the
                    civil war he was appointed under-secretary to George Lord Digby, secretary of
                    state; he afterwards entered himself as a volunteer for the royal cause, and did
                    his majesty good service, especially at Andover, in Hampshire, where he received
                    several wounds. He left not the king when success abandoned his standards, but
                    attended to his interest in foreign parts. He was made secretary to the duke of
                    York, received the honour of knighthood from Charles II. at Bruges in 1658, and
                    was sent as envoy to the court of Spain. His majesty, upon his return to
                    England, called him home, made him keeper of his privy purse, and principal
                    secretary of state. He had always a peculiar hatred of the lord chancellor Hyde,
                    who, on the other hand, considered him a concealed Papist. In 1670 he was of the
                    council distinguished by the title of the Cabal, and one of those who advised
                    the shutting up of the exchequer. In 1672 he was made earl of Arlington and
                    viscount Thetford, and soon after knight of the garter. In 1673 he was appointed
                    one of the three plenipotentiaries from the court of Great Britain to Cologne,
                    to mediate a peace between the emperor and the king of France. The house of
                    commons this year drew up articles of impeachment against him. In 1674 he was
                    made chamberlain of his majesty’s household, in recompense of his long and
                    faith, ful service, and particularly for having filled the office <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ]</hi> of principal secretary of state during the space of
                    twelve years, to his majesty’s great satisfaction. But afterwards his interest
                    began to decline, while that of the earl of Danby increased; for upon his return
                    from his unsuccessful journey to Holland in 1675, his credit had so much sunk
                    that several persons at court diverted the king with mimicking his person and
                    behaviour; yet he held his office of chamberlain till the day of his death,
                    which took place in 1685. His Letters to Sir William Temple were published after
                    his death.</p>
