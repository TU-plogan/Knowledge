                    denotes a small antique castle, fortified with turrets. Such was the famous
                    Bastile of Paris, which seems to have been the last castle that retained the
                    name. It was commenced in 1369, by order of Charles V., and finished in 1383,
                    under the reign of his successor. Its chief use was for the custody of state
                    prisoners; or, more properly speaking, for the clandestine atrocities of a
                    corrupt and cold-blooded despotism. Nowhere else upon earth had human misery by
                    human means been rendered so lasting, so complete, and in many cases so
                    remediless, as in the Bastile of Paris. This the following case, the particulars
                    of which are given by Μ. Mercier, will serve to evince in a very striking
                    manner.</p>
                <p>Upon the accession of Louis XVI. to the throne, the ministers then in office,
                    anxious to obtain popularity by an act of clemency and justice, began their
                    administration by inspecting the registers of the Bastile, and setting many
                    prisoners at liberty. Amongst these was an old man, who, during forty-seven
                    years, had groaned in confinement between four thick and cold stone walls.
                    Hardened by adversity, which strengthens both the mind and the constitution when
                    they are not overpowered by it, he had resisted the horrors of his long
                    imprisonment with an invincible and manly spirit. His locks, white, thin, and
                    scattered, had almost acquired the rigidity of iron; whilst his body, environed
                    for so long a time by a coffin of stone, had borrowed from it a firm and compact
                    habit. At last the narrow door of his tomb, turning upon its grating hinges,
                    opened not as usual by halves; an unknown voice announced his liberty, and bade
                    the aged prisoner depart. Believing this a dream, he hesitated, but at length
                    rose up and walked forth with trembling steps, amazed at the space he traversed;
                    the stairs of the prison, the halls, the court, seemed to him immense, and
                    almost without bounds. He stopped from time to time, and gazed around like one
                    bewildered; his vision was with difficulty reconciled to the clear light of day;
                    he contemplated the heavens as a new object; his eyes remained fixed, and he
                    could not even weep. Stupified with the newly-acquired power of changing his
                    position, his limbs, like his tongue, refused,’ in spite of his efforts, to
                    perform their office; but at length he got through the formidable gate—that gate
                    which, like the portal of hell in Dante, bore to many the fatal inscription, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lasciate ogni sρeranzα voi ch</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                    >entrate.</hi> When he felt the motion of the carriage prepared to transport him
                    to his former habitation, he screamed out, and uttered some inarticulate sounds;
                    and as he could not bear this new movement, he was obliged to descend from the
                    vehicle. Supported by a friendly arm, he sought out the street where he had
                    formerly resided: he found it, but no trace of his house remained; one of the
                    public edifices occupied the spot where it had stood. He now saw nothing that
                    brought to his recollection either that particular quarter, the city itself, or
                    the objects with which he had formerly been familiar. The houses of his nearest
                    neighbours, which were fresh in his memory, had assumed a new appearance. In
                    vain were his looks directed to all the objects around him; he could discover
                    nothing of which he had even the smallest recollection. Terrified, he stopped
                    and fetched a deep sigh. What did it signify to him that the city was peopled
                    with living creatures? None of them was alive to him; he was unknow n to all the
                    world, and he knew nobody; he wept and regretted his dungeon. At the name of the
                    Bastile, which he often pronounced, claiming it as an asylum, and the fashion of
                    his clothes, which marked a former age, the crowd gathered round him; curiosity,
                    blended with pity, excited their attention. The most aged asked him many
                    questions, but had no remembrance of the circumstances lie recapitulated. At
                    length accident brought in his way an ancient domestic, now a superannuated
                    porter, who, confined to his lodge for fifteen years, had barely sufficient
                    strength to open tĥe gate. But even he did not know the master he had served.
                    From this man, however, the unfortunate victim of tyranny learned that grief and
                    misfortune had brought his wife to the grave thirty years before; that his
                    children had gone abroad to distant climes; and that of all his relations and
                    friends none now remained. This recital was made with the indifference which
                    people discover for events long past and almost forgotten. The miserable man
                    groaned aloud in his desolation. The crowd around offering only unknown features
                    to his view, made him feel the excess of his calamities even more than he would
                    have done in the dreadful solitude he had left. Overcome with sorrow, he
                    presented himself before the minister to whom he owed that liberty which was now
                    a burden <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194996?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4996-0437"/> to him, and bowing low, said, “Restore me again
                    to that prison from which you have taken me; I eannot survive the loss of my
                    nearest relations, of my friends, and, in one word, of a whole generation. Is it
                    possible in the same moment to be informed of this universal destruction, and
                    not to wish for death? This general mortality, whieh to the rest of mankind
                    eomes slowly and by degrees, has to me been instantaneous, the operation of a
                    moment. Whilst secluded from soeiety, I lived with myself only; but here I
                    neither can live with myself nor with this new race, to whom my anguish and
                    despair appear only as a dream. There is nothing terrible in dying; but it is
                    dreadful indeed to be the last.” The minister was melted; he caused the old
                    domestic to attend this unfortunate person, as he only could talk to him of his
                    family. This discourse was the sole eonsolation he reeeived; for he shunned all
                    intercourse with a new race, born sinee he had been exiled from the world; and
                    he passed his time in the midst of Paris in the same solitude as he had done
                    whilst confined in a dungeon for nearly half a eentury. But the chagrin and
                    mortification of meeting no person who could say to him, we were formerly known
                    to eaeh other, soon put an end to his existence.</p>
                <p>The reader may be eurious to know the nature of the offence which had been
                    visited by so terrible a punishment. It consisted in some unguarded expressions
                    respecting Louis XV. These had been reported, very probably exaggerated, by some
                    informer or enemy; a lettre-de-cachet had been issued; and the offender seized,
                    committed to the Bastile, and forgotten.</p>
                <p>At the breaking out of the Freneh revolution, the Bastile was attaeked by the
                    Parisians, and, after a vigorous resistance, taken and razed to the ground. This
                    memorable event occurred on the 14th July 1789. At the time of its capture only
                    seven prisoners were found in it.</p>
