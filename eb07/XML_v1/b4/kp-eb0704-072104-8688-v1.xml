                <p><label type="entry">BOAT</label>, a small open vessel, propelled on the water by
                    oars or sails. The construction, machinery, and even <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193198701?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-8701-0722"/> the names of
                    boats, are very different, according to the various purposes for which they are
                    calculated, and the services on which they are to be employed. Thus they are
                    occasionally slight or strong, sharp or flat-bottomed, open or decked, plain or
                    ornamented; as they may be designed for swiftness or burden, for deep or shallow
                    water, for sailing in a harbour or at sea, and for convenience or pleasure. The
                    largest boat that usually accompanies a ship is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >long-boat,</hi> which is generally furnished with a mast and sails. Long-boats
                    fitted for men of war are occasionally decked, armed, and equipped, for cruising
                    short distances against merchant ships of the enemy, or smugglers, for
                    impressing seamen, and other services. The <hi rend="italic">barges,</hi> which
                    are next in order, are longer, slighter, and narrower. They are employed to
                    carry the principal sea-officers, as admirals and captains of ships of war, and
                    are unfit for the open sea. <hi rend="italic">Pinnaces</hi> exactly resemble
                    barges, only that they are somewhat smaller, and have never more than eight
                    oars; whereas a barge properly never rows less than ten. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >cutters</hi> of a ship are broader, deeper, and shorter, than the barges and
                    pinnaces; they are fitter for sailing, and are commonly employed in carrying
                    stores, provisions, passengers, and the like, to and from the ship. In the
                    structure of this sort of boats the lower edge of every plank in the side
                    overlays the upper edge of the plank below, which is called by ship-wrights
                    clink-work. <hi rend="italic">Yawls</hi> are something less than cutters, nearly
                    of the same form, and used for similar services. They are generally rowed with
                    six oars. The above boats more particularly belong to men of war, as
                    merchant-ships have seldom more than two, a long-boat and yawl; when they have a
                    third, it is generally calculated for the countries to which they trade, and
                    varies in its construction accordingly. Merchant-ships employed in the
                    Mediterranean find it more convenient to use a <hi rend="italic">launch,</hi>
                    which is longer, flatter in the bottom, and better adapted every way to the
                    harbours of that sea, than a long-boat. A <hi rend="italic">wherry</hi> is a
                    light, sharp boat, used in a river or harbour for carrying passengers from place
