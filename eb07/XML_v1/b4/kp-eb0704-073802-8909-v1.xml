                    a celebrated French poet, was born at Paris in the year 1636. After having gone
                    through a course of literature and philosophy, his relations induced him to
                    study the law, and he was admitted advocate at the age of twenty-one. But though
                    he had all the talents necessary for the bar, yet he could not adapt himself to
                    a science which turns upon continual equivocations, and often obliges those who
                    follow it to clothe falsehood in the garb of truth; and, besides, the books of
                    Accursius and of Alciat were little likely to please the disciple of Horace and
                    of Juvenal. He therefore deserted what his biographers call “ľantrc de la
                    chicane,” and determined to study theology; but he soon found that scholastic
                    divinity had its tricks and quirks as well as law. Hc imagined, that in order to
                    allure him more cunningly, chicanery, which he thought to avoid, had only
                    changed her habit; and so renouncing the Sorbonne, he applied himself entirely
                    to the study of the belles lettres, and soon occupied one of the most
                    distinguished places on Parnassus. The public gave his works the reception they
                    deserved; and Louis XIV. who loved to encourage the sciences and polite
                    literature, was not only pleased to have M. Bodeau’s works read to him as they
                    were composed, but settled a yearly pension of 2000 livres upon ĥim, and gave
                    him the privilege of printing all his works. He was afterwards chosen a member
                    of the French academy, and also of the academy of inscriptions. This great man,
                    who was as remarkable for his integrity, his innocence, and diffusive
                    benevolence, as for the keenness of his satire, died of a dropsy in the chest on
                    the 13th of March 1711, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Lutrin</hi> of Bodeau, still considered by some French critics as
                    one of the .best poems to which France has given birth, was first published in
                    1674. But it is with great reason and justice that Voltaire confesses it
                    inferior to the <hi rend="italic">Rape of the Loch.</hi> Few poets, however, can
                    so properly be compared as Pope and Bodeau; and, wherever their writings admit
                    of a parallel being drawn, we may, without any national partiality, adjudge the
                    superiority to the English bard. These two great authors resembled each other as
                    much in.the integrity of their lives, as in the subjects and execution of their
                    compositions. There are two actions recorded of Boileau, which sufficiently
                    prove that the inexorable satirist had a most generous and friendly heart. W hen
                    Patru, the celebrated advocate, who was ruined by his passion for literature,
                    found himself under the painful necessity of selling his extensive library, and
                    had almost agreed to part with it for a moderate sum, Loileau tendered him a
                    higher price, and, after paying the money, added this condition to the purchase,
                    that Patru should retain, during his life, the possession of the books. Another
                    instance of the poet’s generosity is of a yet nobler character. When it was
                    rumoured at court that the king intended to retrench the pension of Corneille,
                    Bodeau hastened to Madame de Montespan, and represented that his sovereign,
                    equitable as he was, could not, without injustice, grant a pension to an author
                    like himself, just ascending Parnassus, and withdraw it from Corneille, who had
                    so long been seated on the summit; he entreated her, for the honour of the king,
                    to prevail on his majesty rather to strike off <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
                    pension, than to withdraw that of a man whose title to that which he enjoyed was
                    incomparably greater; and he declared that he could more easily console himself
                    under the loss of that distinction, than under the affliction of seeing a just
                    reward taken away from such a poet as Corneille. This magnanimous application
                    had the success which it deserved; and it appears the more noble, that the rival
                    of Corneille was the intimate friend of Boileau. The long and unreserved
                    intercourse which subsisted between Boileau and Racine was highly beneficial and
                    honourable to both. The dying farewell of the latter is the most expressive
                    eulogy on the private character of Boileau: “<hi rend="italic">Je regarde comme
                    un bonheur pour moi de mourir avant vous,’'</hi> said the tender Racine, in
                    taking a final leave of his faithful and generous friend. As a satirist Bodeau
                    is inferior to Horace; but in his Epistles he almost equals his illustrious
                    model; whilst, in regularity of plan, felicity of transition, and a firm,
                    sustained elegance of style, his <hi rend="italic">Art Poétique</hi> will stand
                    a comparison with the celebrated <hi rend="italic">Epistle to the Pisos.</hi>
                    His works consist of his <hi rend="italic">Satires;</hi> his <hi rend="italic"

                    on that author; and the best edition of them, perhaps, is that with the notes
                    and commentaries of Μ. Daunou, printed at Paris in 1809, in 3 vols. 8vo; but the
                    edition of 1747 by Lcfevre de Saint-Marc, in 5 vols. 8vo, with cuts, and
