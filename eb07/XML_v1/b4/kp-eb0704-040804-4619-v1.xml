                <p><label type="entry">BARROW, <hi rend="smallcaps">Isaac</hi></label>, an eminent
                    mathematician and divine, was the son of Mr Thomas Barrow, a linen-draper in
                    London, where he was born in 1630. He was at first placed for two or three years
                    at the Charter-house School. There, however, his conduct gave but little hopes
                    of success in the profession of scholar; for he was extremely fond of fighting,
                    and of promoting pugnacity among his school-fellows. But being removed from this
                    establishment, his disposition took a happier turn; and having soon made
                    considerable progress in learning, he was admitted a pensioner of Peter-house,
                    in Cambridge, where he applied himself with great diligence to the study of
                    literature and science, especially of natural philosophy. He afterwards turned
                    his thoughts to the profession of physic, and made some progress in anatomy,
                    botany, and chemistry; after which he studied chronology, geometry, and
                    astronomy. He then travelled into France and Italy, and in a voyage from Leghorn
                    to Smyrna gave proofs of great personal bravery; for the ship having been
                    attacked by an Algerine pirate, Mr Barrow remained upon deck, and fought with
                    the utmost intrepidity, until the pirate, unprepared for the stout resistance
                    made by the ship, sheered off and left her to pursue her voyage unmolested.</p>
                <p>At Smyrna he met with a most kind reception from Mr Bretton, the English consul,
                    upon whose death he afterwards wrote a Latin elegy. From this place he proceeded
                    to Constantinople, where he received similar civilities from Sir Thomas Bendish,
                    the English ambassador, and Sir Jonathan Dawes, with whom he afterwards
                    contracted an intimate friendship. While at Constantinople he read and studied
                    the works of Chrysostom, once bishop of that see, whom he preferred to all the
                    other fathers. He resided· in Turkey somewhat more than a year, after which he
                    proceeded to Venice, and thence returned home through Germany and Holland in
                    1659. Immediately on his return he received episcopal ordination from Bishop
                    Brownrig? and in 1660 he was appointed to the Greek professorship at Cambridge.
                    When he entered upon this office, he intended to have prelected upon the
                    tragedies of Sophocles; but he altered his intention, and made choice of
                    Aristotle s rhetoric. His lectures on this subject, however, having been lent to
                    a friend who never returned them, are irrecoverably lost. In July 1662 he was
                    elected professor of geometry in Gresham College, on the recommendation of <pb

                    Wilkins, master of Trinity College, and afterwards bishop of Chester; and in May
                    1663 he was chosen a fellow of the Royal Society, at the first election made by
                    the council after obtaining their charter. The same year the executors of Mr
                    Lucas, who, according to the will of that individual, had founded a mathematical
                    chair at Cambridge, fixed upon Mr Barrow as the first professor; and although
                    his two professorships were not inconsistent with each other, he chose to resign
                    that of Gresham College, which he did on the 20th May 1664. In 1669 he resigned
                    his mathematical chair to his illustrious friend Mr Isaac Newton, having now
                    determined to renounce the study of mathematics for that of divinity. Upon
                    quitting his professorship, Mr Barrow was only a fellow of Trinity College; but
                    his uncle gave him a small sinecure in Wales, and Dr Seth Ward, bishop of
                    Salisbury, conferred upon him a prebend in that church. In the year 1670 he was
                    created doctor in divinity by mandate; and, upon the promotion of Dr Pearson,
                    master of Trinity College, to the see <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Chester, he was
                    appointed to succeed him by the king’s patent, bearing date the 13th February
                    1672. When the king advanced Barrow to this dignity, he was pleased to say, “he
                    had given it to the best scholar in England.” His majesty did not speak from
                    report, but from his own knowledge; for the doctor being then his chaplain, his
                    majesty frequently conversed with him, and in his humorous way used to call him
                    an “unfair preacher,” as he exhausted every subject he discussed, and left no
                    room for others to comeafter him. In 1675 Dr Barrow was chosen vice-chancellor
                    of the university. His works are very numerous, and such as do honour to the
                    science and literature of the English nation. They are, 1. Euclid’s Elements; 2.
                    Euclid’s Data; 3. Optical Lectures, read in the public school of Cambridge; 4.
                    Thirteen Geometrical Lectures; 5. The Works of Archimedes, the four Books of
                    Apollonius’s Conic Sections, and Theodosius’s Spherics explained in a new
                    Method; 6. A Lecture, in which Archimedes’s Theorems of the Sphere and Cylinder
                    are investigated and briefly demonstrated; 7. Mathematical Lectures, read in the
                    public schools of the university of Cambridge. The above were all written in
                    Latin; and as to his English works, they have been collected, and printed
                    together in four volumes folio. “The name of Dr Barrow,” says Mr Granger, “will
                    ever be illustrious for a strength of mind and a compass of knowledge that did
                    honour to his country. He was unrivalled in mathematical learning, and
                    especially in the sublime geometry; in which he has been excelled only by one
                    man, and that man was his pupil, the great Sir Isaac Newton. The same genius
                    that seemed to be born only to bring hidden truths to light, to rise to the
                    heights or descend to the depths of science, would sometimes amuse itself in the
                    flowery paths of poetry; and he composed verses both in Greek and Latin. He at
                    length gave himself up entirely to divinity; and particularly to the most useful
                    part of it, that which has a tendency to make men wiser and better. He has, in
                    his excellent sermons on the creed, solved every difficulty and removed every
                    obstacle that opposed itself to our faith, and made divine revelation as clear
                    as the demonstrations m his own Euclid. In his sermons he knew not how to leave
                    off writing till he had exhausted his subject; and his admirable discourse on
                    the duty and reward of bounty to the poor took him up three hours and a half in
                    preaching.” This excellent person, who was a bright example of Christian virtue,
                    as well as a prodigy of learning, died on the 4th of May 1677, in the
                    forty-seventh year <hi rend="superscript"> 0</hi> his age; and was interred in
