                <p><label type="entry">BIRCH, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, an eminent
                    historical and biographical writer, was born in London in 1705. His parents wa ’
                    e both of them quakers; and his father, Joseph Birch, was a coffee-mill maker by
                    trade. Thomas, having been put to school, proved indefatigable in his
                    application, and stole many hours from sleep to increase his stock of knowledge.
                    By this unremitting diligence, though he had not the happiness of a university
                    education, he soon, to the surprise of his acquaintance, became qualified to
                    take holy orders in the church of England. In 1728 he married the daughter of
                    the Reverend Mr Cox, to whom he was curate; but his happiness was of short
                    duration, Mrs Birch dying of puerperal fever in less than twelve months after
                    their marriage,—an event which he deplores in a very elegant and pathetic poem,
                    preserved in Nichols’s Collection. In 1732 he was recommended to the friendship
                    and favour of the Lord Chancellor Hardwicke, then attorneygeneral, to whom,'and
                    to the succeeding Earl of Hardwicke, he was indebted for all his preferments.
                    The first proof he experienced of his patron’s regard was the living of Ulting
                    in the county of Essex, in the gift of the crown, to which he was presented in
                    1732. In 1734 he was appointed one of the domestic chaplains to the unfortunate
                    Earl of Kilmarnock, who was beheaded in 1746. Mr Birch was chosen a member of
                    the Royal Society in February 1734-5, and of the Society of Antiquaries in
                    December 1735; and he afterwards became director of the latter, an office which
                    he field till his death. Before this, the Marischal College of Aberdeen had
                    conferred on him, by diploma, the degree of master of arts. In 1743, through the
                    interest of Lord Hardwicke, he was presented by the crown to the sinecure
                    rectory of Landewy Wel-frey, in the county of Pembroke; and in 1743-4 he was
                    preferred, in the same manner, to the rectory of Sidington in St Peter’s, in the
                    county and diocese of Gloucester. There is no evidence of his having taken
                    possession of this living; and indeed it is probable that he quitted it
                    immediately for one more suitable to his inclinations and to his literary
                    engagements, which required his almost constant residence in town; for, on the
                    24th of February 1743-4, he was instituted to the united rectories of St Michael
                    Woodstreet and St Mary Staining, and in 1745-6 to the united rectories of St
                    Margaret Pattens and St Gabriel, Fenchurch-street, by Lord Chancellor Hardwicke,
                    towhose turn it had fallen to present to these livings. In January 1752 he was
                    elected one of the secretaries of the Royal Society, in the room of Dr Cromwell
                    Mortimer, deceased. In January 1753 the Marischal College of Aberdeen created
                    him doctor of divinity; and in that year the same degree was conferred on him by
                    Archbishop Herring. He was one of the trustees of the British Museum, for which
                    honour he was probably indebted to the Earl of Hardwicke, as he also was for his
                    last preferment, the rectory of Dep-den in Essex, to which he was inducted in
                    February 1761. In the latter part of his life he was chaplain to the Princess
                    Amelia. In 1765 he resigned his office of secretary to the Royal Society, and
                    was succeeded by Dr Morton. His health declining about this time, he was ordered
                    to ride for the recovery of it; but being a bad horseman, and going out in
                    January 1766, he was unfortunately thrown from his saddle on the road between
                    London and Hampstead, and died on the spot, in the sixty-first year of his age,
                    and to the great regret of his numerous literary friends. He was buried in St
                    Margaret Pattens. Dr Birch had in his lifetime been very generous to his
                    relations; and none that were nearly allied to him being living at the period of
                    his decease, he bequeathed his library of books and manuscripts, with his
                    picture, painted in 1735, and all his other pictures, and prints not otherwise
                    disposed of by his will, to the British Museum. He likewise left the remainder
                    of his fortune, which amounted to not much more than L.500, to be laid out in
                    government securities, for the purpose of applying the interest to increase the
                    stipend of the three assistant librarians; thus manifesting at his death, as he
                    had done during his whole life, his respect for literature, and his desire to
                    promote useful knowledge. His principal publications were, 1. The General
                    Dictionary, Historical and Critical, including a new translation of Mr Bayle,
                    and interspersed with several thousand new lives. Dr Birch’s associates in this
                    undertaking were the Reverend John Peter Bernard, Mr John Lockman, and Mr George
                    Sale; and the whole was completed in ten volumes folio. 2. Dr Cudworth’s
                    Intellectual System, improved from the Latin edition of Mosheim; his Discourse

                    Life and Writings, 2 vols. 4to, 1743. 3. The Life of the Honourable Robert
                    Boyle, 1744, prefixed to an edition of that excellent philosopher’s works,

                    Society, and not hitherto published, are inserted in their proper order as a
