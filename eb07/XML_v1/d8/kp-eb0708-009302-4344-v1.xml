                <p><label type="entry">DOLCI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Carlo</hi>, or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carlino</hi></label>, a painter of considerable celebrity, was
                    born at Florence in 1616. He was a disciple of Jacopo Vignali, and when only
                    eleven years of age he attempted a whole figure of St John, which received
                    extraordinary approbation. He afterwards painted a portrait of his mother, and
                    displayed a new and delicate style, which brought him into notice, and procured
                    him extensive employment at Florence and other parts of Italy. Dolci appears to
                    have used his pencil chiefly in sacred subjects, and bestowed much labour on his
                    pictures. In his manner of working he was remarkably slow; and it is said of him
                    that his brain was affected by seeing Luca Giordano dispatch more business in
                    four or five hours <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324357?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4357-0094"/> than he could have executed in as many months.
                    His works are consequently not numerous. He generally painted in a small size,
                    although there are a few pictures by him as large as life. He died at Florence
                    in 1686, leaving a daughter, Agnese, who also painted historical pieces, and
                    arrived at some degree of excellence in copying the works of her father.</p>
                <p>Carlo Dolci holds the same rank in the Florentine that Sassoferrato does in the
                    Roman school. Without the possession of much genius or invention, both these
                    artists produced pleasing and highly-finished pictures. The works of Dolci are
                    easily distinguishable by the delicacy of the composition, and by an agreeable
                    tint of colour, improved by j udicious managemen t of the chiaro-oscuro, which
                    give his figures a surprising relief. “His pencil,” says Pilkington, “was
                    tender, his touch inexpressibly neat, and his colouring transparent; though he
                    has often been censured for the excessive labour bestowed on his pictures, and
                    also for giving his carnations more of the appearance of ivory than the look of
                    flesh.” All his best productions are of a devout description, and most
                    frequently represent the patient suffering of Christ, or the sorrows of the
                    Mater Dolorosa. In these the heads are marked with calm, intellectual beauty,
                    and pathetic emotion, and are peculiarly expressive of pure and tranquil
                    devotion. They are full of sensibility, and yet all unstained by earthly
                    passion. There is, we allow, a want of character and deep shadowing in his
                    pictures, but the colouring and general tone accord with the idea of the passion
                    pourtrayed; nothing is turgid or bold, harsh or obtrusive; all is modesty,
                    repose, and placid harmony. The best works of this master are the “St Sebastian
                    ;” the “Four Evangelists,” at Florence; “Christ breaking the Bread,” in the
                    Marquis of Exeter’s collection at Burleigh; and several smaller pictures, which
                    are highly valued, and occupy honourable places in the richest galleries. (z.
