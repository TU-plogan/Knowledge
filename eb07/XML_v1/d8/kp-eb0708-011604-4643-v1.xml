                <p><label type="entry">DORIANS</label>, a people of Greece, who derived their origin
                    from those districts in which the Grecian nation bordered towards the north upon
                    numerous and dissimilar races of barbarians. According to Herodotus, they were
                    from early times one of the chief races of that nation, which, in fact, was
                    composed of Dorians and Ionians; the one of Hellenic and the other of Pelasgic
                    origin, the former a migratory and the latter an aboriginal race. In this
                    definition it is assumed that the Pelasgi were Greeks and spoke the Grecian
                    language in its elder form; an opinion in support of which many arguments might
                    easily be produced. But all the races whose migrations took place at a
                    comparatively late period, such as the Achaeans, Ionians, and Dorians,
                    particularly the last, were not sufficiently numerous or powerful to effect a
                    complete change in the customs of a barbarous population: many districts, as
                    Arcadia and Perrhaebia, remained entirely Pelasgic, without being inhabited by
                    any nation not of Grecian origin: the most ancient names either of Grecian
                    places, or those mentioned in the traditions of the Grecian race, belonged
                    indeed to a different era of the dialect, but not to a different language: and,
                    lastly, the great similarity between the Latin and the Greek can only be
                    explained by supposing the Pelasgic language to have formed the connecting link.
                    The Dorians are mentioned in ancient legends and poems as having been
                    established in one extremity of the great mountain chain of Upper Greece,
                    namely, at the foot of Mount Olympus; but there are, nevertheless, many reasons
                    for supposing that, at a period still earlier than that to which these monuments
                    refer, they dwelt at its other extremity, reaching to the farthest limit of the
                    Grecian nation. Indeed the Doric Hylleans had a tradition that they came
                    originally from those northern districts which bordered on the Illyrians, and
                    were afterwards occupied by that people; a tradition, we may observe, which many
                    facts and circumstances unite to confirm, or at least to render highly probable.
                    Be this as it may, however, the earliest ascertained seat of the Dorians was the
                    district of Mount Olympus. But, either from a restless and wandering
                    disposition, or impelled by the pressure of some northern hordes, they seem to
                    have migrated from this district into Crete, that is, from one end of the
                    Grecian world to the other; thus presenting a striking anomaly in the history of
                    the ancient colonies. The earliest trace of this circumstance is found in the
                    Odyssey, where it is mentioned that the “thrice divided” (τg∕^α∕xis) Dorians
                    formed part of the population of Crete. Though originally inhabiting a
                    mountainous region, they appear, in course of time, to have become, as it were,
                    the Normans of Greece, and to have sought settlements wherever they could find
                    them. But the most important, and the most fertile in consequences, of all the
                    migrations of the Grecian races, and that which continued even to the latest
                    period to exert its influence upon the Greek character, was the expedition of
                    the Dorians into the Peloponnesus. This circumstance is mentioned by Herodotus,
                    who states that, under Deucalion, they dwelt in Phthiotis, and in the time of
                    Dorus, the son of Helen, inhabited the country at the foot of Ossa and Olympus,
                    called Hestiaeotis; <pb break="no" facs="nls:193324656?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-4656-0117"/> that, afterwards, being driven from Hestiaeotis
                    by the Kad-means, they dwelt under Mount Pindus, and were called the Macednian
                    nation; that thence they again migrated to Dryopis, and from Dryopis passed into
                    the Peloponnesus, where they were cŭlled the Doric race. The traditionary name
                    of the expedition in question is “the Return of the descendants of Hercules,”
                    who are admitted to have been of Doric origin; and, in process of time,
                    successive conquests were effected by them in the Peloponnesus, until the whole
                    of that country was at length subdued and occupied by the Dorians. Argos was
                    captured by this people; Sicyon was conquered from Argos, Phlius from Sicyon,
                    and Cleonae from Argus. The Dorians expelled the Ionians from Epidaurus, and
                    afterwards reduced AEgina and Troezen; they appear also to have made themselves
                    masters of Corinth and Megara; and, under Aristodemus, they conquered Laconia,
                    which soon afterwards rose into great importance among the states of Greece. In
                    due time, Doric colonies from Argos, Epidaurus, and Troezen established
                    themselves on the south-west coast of Asia Minor; and other colonies of the same
                    race also settled in different parts of the same country, where, at a very early
                    period, we find them forming a league against the Ionians, whom they had either
                    encroached upon or expelled. In fact, there is nothing so remarkable in the
                    history of this remarkable race as its extraordinary propagation and diffusion.
                    In course of time it spread itself on all sides, from Greece to Asia Minor,
                    Byzantium, Syracuse, and the country which sweeps round the Gulf of Tarentum,
                    including the territory afterwards known by the name of Magna Graecia, with
                    Crotona, Locri, and Lyctus, to say nothing of Chalcis, Solium, Ambracia,
                    Anactorium, Leucadia, Corcyra, Epidamnus, Apollonia, Potidaea, Chalcedon,
                    Trogilus, Thap-sos, Selinus, and other places, which it conquered or colonized.
                    It is remarkable that, wherever any portion of Doric invaders or settlers
                    proceeded, they not only carried along with them, but gave a permanent
                    ascendancy to the peculiarities and characteristics of their race. Their
                    religion, their laws, their literature, their manners, and in short all that
                    distinguished them as a separate people, appear to have taken root wherever they
                    pitched their tents; and it is by the vestiges which still remain of their
                    migrations, settlements, and power, that we are enabled to trace with some
                    degree of certainty events which either took place before the commencement of
                    authentic history <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>, or in regard to which history,
                    tradition, and even fable, are alike silent. The limits of this article,
                    however, preclude our entering into details, which in fact would require volumes
                    for their full development and illustration. We shall therefore confine
                    ourselves to some general remarks on the character of the Dorians, deduced from
                    the masterly analytical investigations of Professor Müller in his <hi
                    rend="italic">History and Antiquities of the Doric Race</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> a work not more distinguished for its almost boundless erudition, than
                    for the critical sagacity and philosophic spirit which is displayed in it
                    throughout.</p>
                <p>And the first peculiarity in the Doric character which we shall notice, is the
                    tendency which it exhibited to produce uniformity and unity. Every individual
                    was destined to remain within those limits which were prescribed by the will of
                    the whole; every one was bound to obey in his own place. All the smaller
                    associations were regulated on the same principle; there was a gradation of
                    power, but never independent equality. The Dorians, also, had little inclination
                    to admit the customs of others, and a strong desire to disconnect themselves
                    from foreigners; their instinct seems to have been to adhere scrupulously to
                    their own national habits, and to preserve that distinct individuality of
                    national character which appears to have given them so decided an ascendency
                    over all the races amongst which they intermingled or settled. They loved
                    independence, and knew well how to maintain and defend it. A calm and steady
                    courage was the natural quality of the Dorians; and though they sometimes
                    yielded to the impetuosity of excitable and enthusiastic enemies, their
                    fortitude and pertinacity commonly secured them the"victory, and almost always
                    prevented defeat from degenerating into disaster. As they were not ready to
                    receive, neither were they prone to communicate, outward impressions; and hence,
                    both in their poetry and prose, the narrative is often concealed by expressions
                    of the feeling, and tinged as it were with the hue and colour of the mind. They
                    endeavoured always to condense and concentrate their thoughts, which was the
                    cause of the great brevity and obscurity of their language; and as their
                    attention was turned to the past rather than the future, they cherished an
                    ardent attachment to the usages and manners of their forefathers, as embodied
                    and preserved in their actual institutions. Hence the Dorians preserved most
                    rigidly, and represented most truly, the customs of the ancient Greeks. They
                    were not a stationary, far less a retrograding people; but the advances which
                    they made were slow, and all their changes imperceptible.</p>
                <p>With the desire to attain uniformity, for which the Dorians were distinguished,
                    there was also combined in their character another remarkable peculiarity;
                    namely, a love for measure and proportion. Their works of art are conspicuously
                    marked by this attention to singleness of effect; and every thing discordant or
                    useless was pruned off with an unsparing hand. Their moral system also
                    prescribed the observance of the proper medium in all things; and it was in this
                    that the temperance which so distinguished them consisted; it was the synonyme,
                    not <hi rend="italic">of</hi> abstinence, but of moderation. One great object of
                    the worship of Apollo, which the Dorians introduced into Greece, was to maintain
                    undisturbed the balance of the mind, and to remove every thing calculated to
                    disquiet the thoughts, inflame the passions, or overcloud the serenity of the
                    soul. The nature of this singular race seems to have required an equal and
                    regular harmony; and for this reason dissonances, even if combined into harmony,
                    were by no means suited to their taste. The national song was doubtless not
                    remarkable for soft or pleasing melody; and the general accent of the language
                    had the tone aζ&gt;d character of command, without any of that delicacy or
                    flexibility which are required in Elysian airs or Lydian measures. But the
                    Dorians were contented with themselves, and with the powers to which they owed
                    their existence and their happiness; in almost every sense, they were a
                    self-concentred race, living in themselves and for themselves; they looked not
                    to future, but to present existence, and they loved their own laws, religion,
                    institutions, manners, customs, literature, and arts, too much to envy those of
                    other nations, or even to desire to imitate them. Man was the chief and almost
                    only object which attracted their attention. This feeling may be detected in
                    their religion, which was always unconnected with the worship of any natural
                    object, and originated solely from their own reflections and conceptions; and to
                    the same source may perhaps be traced their aversion to mechanical and
                    agricultural labour, a feeling which belongs and is indeed natural to minds of a
                    contemplative turn. In a word, the whole Doric race bears the stamp and
                    character of the male sex among nations; the desire of assistance and
                    connection, of novelty and curiosity, the characteristics of the weaker sex,
                    being directly opposed to the nature of the Dorians, which, from first to last,
                    was marked by severe simplicity, inflexible independence, subdued strength, and
                    unquenchable nationality. (See Müller’s <hi rend="italic">History and
