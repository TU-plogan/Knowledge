                <p><label type="entry">DUNSTAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Saint</hi></label>, a famous
                    archbishop of Canterbury. He was descended from a noble family in Wessex, and
                    educated in the abbey of Glastonbury, where he studied so hard that it threw him
                    into a violent fever, which brought him to the very point of death. When the
                    whole family were standing about his bed, dissolved in tears,and expecting every
                    moment to see him expire, an angel came from heaven in a dreadful storm, and
                    gave him a medieine which restored him to perfeet health in a moment. Dunstan
                    immediately started from his bed, and ran with all his speed towards the ehurch
                    to return thanks for his recovery; but the devil met him by the way, surrounded
                    by a great multitude of black dogs, and endeavoured to obstruct his passage.
                    This would have frightened ordinary boys, but it had no effeet whatever upon
                    Dunstan, who, having pronounced a saered name, and brandished his stick, put the
                    devil and all his dogs to flight. The ehureh doors being shut, an angel took him
                    up in his arms, eonveyed him through an opening in the roof, and set him softly
                    down on the floor, where he performed his devotions. After his recovery, he
                    pursued his studies with the greatest ardour, and soon beeame a perfeet master
                    in philosophy, divinity, and music; painting, writing, and sculpture; besides
                    working in gold, silver, brass, iron, and other metals. Whilst still young he
                    entered into holy orders, and was introduced by his uncle Athelm, archbishop of
                    Canterbury, to King Athelstan, who, being charmed with his person and
                    accomplishments, retained him at his court, and employed him in many great
                    affairs. At leisure hours he used to entertain the king and his courtiers with
                    playing on the harp, or some other musical instrument; and now and then, by way
                    of variety, he wrought a miracle, which gained him great admiration. But his old
                    enemy the devil was much offended at this, and prompted some envious courtiers
                    to persuade the king that his favouritewas a magician; a story which that prinee
                    too readily believed. Dunstan, however, having discovered by the king’s
                    countenance that he had lost his favour, resolved to resign rather than be
                    turned out, and accordingly retired from eourt to another uncle, who was Bishop
                    of Winchester. This good prelate prevailed upon his nephew to forsake the world
                    and become a monk; after which he retired to a little eell built against the
                    church wall of Glastonbury. Here he slept, studied, prayed, meditated, and
                    sometimes amused himself with forging several useful things in brass and in
                    iron. One evening as he was working very busily at his forge, the devil, putting
                    on the appearance of a man, thrust his head in at the window of his cell, and
                    asked him to make something or other for him. Dunstan was so intent upon his
                    work that he made no answer, upon which the devil began to swear and to talk
                    obscenely. This betrayed the lurking fiend. But the holy blacksmith was prepared
                    for all casualties; so putting üp a secret ejaculation, he pulled his tongs,
                    which were red hot, out of the fire, and seizing the devil by the nose, squeezed

                    bellow and scold at such a rate that he awakened and terrified all the people
                    for many miles around. Thus far the monkish legend.</p>
                <p>However ridiculous these fictions may seem, they served, in those times of
                    ignorance, to procure Dunstan a reputation which has been confirmed by the
                    authority of several succeeding historians. It appears that this extraordinary
                    person was called to court in 941, by King Edmund, who bestowed upon him the
                    rich abbey of Glastonbury, which for his∙ sake he honoured with many peculiar
                    privilcgcs. Dunstan enjoyed in a very high degree the favour of this prince
                    during his short reign of six years; but he stood much higher in the grace of
                    his brother and successor King Edred, to whom he was confessor, chief confidant,
                    and prime minister. During this period of court favour he employed all his
                    influence in promoting the interest of the monks of the Benedictine order, to
                    which he belonged, and of which he was a most active and zealous patron. Having
                    the treasures of these two princes, especially of the last, at his command, he
                    lavished them away in building and endowing monasteries for these monks, because
                    almost all the old monasteries were in the possession of secular canons; and not
                    contented with this, he persuaded Edred, who was a bigoted valetudinary, to
                    bestow, by his last will, such immense treasures on the churches and
                    monasteries, that the crown was stripped of its most valuable possessions, and
                    left in a state of indigence. This conduct of Dunstan, whilst he was in power,
                    rendered him very odious toEdwy, who succeeded his uncle Edred in 955; and his
                    rude behaviour to the king himself, and his beloved queen Elgiva, raised the
                    resentment of that prince to such a height that he deprived Dunstan of all his
                    preferments, and drove him into exile. The banishment of Dunstan, the great
                    patron, or, as Malmsbury calls him, the prince of monks, was a severe blow to
                    that order, who were in consequence expelled from several monasteries. But their
                    sufferings were not of long continuance; for Edgar, the younger brother of Edwy,
                    having raised a successful rebellion against his brother, and usurped all his
                    dominions on the north side of the Thames, recalled Dunstan, and in 957
                    conferred on him the bishopric of Worcester. From this moment he was the chief
                    confidant and prime minister of King Edgar, who in 959 became sole monarch of
                    England, by the death of his cider brother Eđwy. In the following year Dunstan
                    was raised to the archiépiscopal see of Canterbury; and being thus possessed of
                    the primacy and assured of the royal support and assistance, he prepared to
                    execute the grand design which he had long meditated, of compelling the secular
                    canons to put away their wives and become monks, or, in case of resistance on
                    their part, of driving them out, and introducing Benedictine monks in their
                    stead. With this view he procured the promotion of Oswald to the see of
                    Worcester, and of Ethelwald to that of Winchester, two prelates who were monks
                    themselves, and animated with the most ardent zeal for the advancement of their
                    order; and these three great champions of monachism found means, by their arts
                    and intrigues, in the course of a few years, to fill no fewer than forty-eight
                    monasteries with Benedictines. But on the death of Edgar in 975 they received a
                    check. The sufferings of the persecuted canons had excited much compassion, and
                    many of the nobility, who had been overawed by the power and zeal of the late
                    king, now espoused their cause and promoted their restoration. Eifere duke of
                    Mercia drove the monks by force out of all the monasteries in that extensive
                    province, and brought back the canons, with their wives and children; whilst
                    Elfwin duke of East Anglia, and Brithnot duke of Essex, raised troops to protect
                    the monks in these countries. In order to allay these commotions, several
                    councils were summoned, and Dunstan was so hard pushed by the secular canons and
                    their friends, that he was obliged to practise some of his holy stratagems; but
                    finally, by dint of miracles, he overcame all opposition.</p>
                <p>St Dunstan died in 988, in the sixty-fourth year of his age, having held the
                    bishopric of London, together with the archbishopric of Canterbury, about
                    tw’cnty-seven years. As this prelate was the great restorer arid promoter of the
                    monastic institutions, the grateful monks, who were almost the only historians
                    of those dark ages, have loaded him with the most extravagant praises, and
                    represented him as the greatest wonder-worker and highest favourite of heaven
                    that ever lived.</p>
