                    the period of his birth has not been specified. His father was Alexander

                    his youth, as he himself informs us, he attended David Cunningham, bishop of
                    Aberdeen, and Sir Peter Young, during their embassy to the king of Denmark and
                    to some of the princes of Germany. He returned to Scotland, but after a short
                    residence he again visited the continent; and he now prosecuted.his studies in
                    the university of Heidelberg, where the civil law was ably taught by the elder
                    Gothofredus. It was perhaps in this university that he took the degree of LL.

                    seat of a university, we cannot but suspect the accuracy of the statement. A
                    college, including a principal and four regents, was established there in the
                    year 1561; but it did not obtain the privileges of a university, and had no law
                    faculty, and no professor of law. (Expilly, Dictionnaire Géographique,
                    Historique, et Politique des Gaules et de la France, tom. vi∙ p.
                    354.)</p></note> While he resided at Heidelberg, he appears to have taken
                    private pupils; for he mentions that he there read to some students a synopsis
                    of ethics, which a young man named Werner Becker, a native of Riga, published
                    without his consent or knowledge. This work, which was reprinted in Britain as
                    well as in Germany, bears the title of “Synopsis Moralis Philosophiae, in.
                    libris.” <hi rend="italic">Ex</hi><hi rend="italic">officina</hi><hi

                    Keckermann had too unscrupulously availed himself of his labours, and he
                    specifies a curious instance of this plagiarism. Donaldson afterwards settled in
                    France, where he was appointed principal of the College of Sedan, and at the
                    same time discharged the duties of professor of moral and natural philosophy,
                    and of the Greek language; so that his attainments must have been various, and
                    his labours not inconsiderable. In this protestant seminary he was associated
                    with two of his learned countrymen: Andrew Melville was one of the professors of
                    divinity, and John Smith was one of the professors of philosophy.<note

                    Latin of passages extracted from Diogenes Laertius, is entitled “Synopsis
                    Locorum Communium, in qua Philosophiae Ortus, Progressus, &amp;c. ex Diogene
                    Laertio digeruntur.” Francof. 1612, 8vo. At Sedan he continued to reside for the
                    space of sixteen years, and was then invited to open a college at Charenton,
                    near Paris; but the attempt was immediately resisted, and it seems to have been
                    ultimately frustrated by the jealousy of the papists. In order to occupy himself
                    during the dependance of the legal process, he prepared for the press another
                    learned work: “Synopsis OEconomica, aut <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> 'ore G.

                    another edition speedily followed, Francofurti, 1625, 8vo. Bayle considered this
                    as a book which deserved to be read.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    not been able to collect any information; but it is not improbable that he
                    resumed his station at Sedan, and there ended his days. Elizabeth Goffin,
                    describing herself as the widow of Donaldson, addressed to Sir John Scot a
                    letter dated at Sedan on the 15th of April 1630.<note anchored="true"

                    been Goffin.</p></note> From this letter it appears that he left several
