                <p><label type="entry">DIGGES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Leonard</hi></label>, an eminent
                    mathematician in the sixteenth century, was descended from an ancient family,
                    and born at Digges Court, in the parish of Barham in Kent, but in what year is
                    not known. He was educated at Oxford, where he laid a good foundation of
                    learning; and having retired from thence, he prosecuted his studies, and became
                    an excellent mathematician, a skilful architect, and an expert surveyor of land.
                    He composed several works, as, 1. <hi rend="italic">Tectonicum,</hi> briefly
                    showing the exact Measuring and speedy Reckoning of all manner of Lands,
                    Squares, Timber, Stones, Steeples, &amp;c. 1556, 4to; 2. A Geometrical Practical
                    Treatise, named <hi rend="italic">Pantometria,</hi> in three books, which he
                    left in manuscript,but which after his death was published by his son in 1591,
                    folio; 3. Prognostication Everlasting of right good effect, or Choice Rules to
                    judge the weather by the Sun, Moon, and Stars, &amp;c. in 4to, 1555, 1556, and
                    1564; corrected and augmented by his son, with divers general tables, and many
                    compendious rules, in 4to, 1592. He died about the year 1574.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Digges,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> only son of
                    Leonard Digges, having received a liberal education from his tenderest years,
                    went and studied for a time at Oxford; and by the improvement which he made
                    there, and the subsequent instructions of his learned father, he became one of
                    the best mathematicians of his age. When Queen Elizabeth sent some forces in
                    order to assist the oppressed inhabitants of the Netherlands, Mr Digges was
                    appointed their muster-master-general; by which he became well skilled in
                    military affairs, as his writings afterwards showed. He died in 1595.</p>
                <p>Mr Digges, besides revising, correcting, and enlarging some pieces of his
