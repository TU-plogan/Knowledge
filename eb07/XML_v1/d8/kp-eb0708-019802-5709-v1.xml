                <p><label type="entry">DRESDEN</label>, a city of Germany, the capital of the former
                    electorate, now the kingdom of Saxony. It is a beautiful spot, both as regards
                    the position and the buildings. The river Elbe divides it into two unequal
                    parts, over which is a fine bridge of sixteen arches, 1420 feet in length and
                    thirty-six in breadth, which, though destroyed in the French revolutionary war,
                    has again been restored· It was fortified, but the works now serve the purposes
                    merely of police. There are seven market-places or squares, and about sixty
                    broad streets, with others connecting them together; and the public buildings,
                    which are numerous and beautiful, give to the whole a most magnificent
                    appearance, but especially in the new town, which is of more recent
                    erection.</p>
                <p>There are seventeen Lutheran, two Catholic, and a small Calvinist church; the
                    most remarkable are the Frauen-kirk of the Protestants, and the elegant Catholic
                    church connected with the royal palace. Over the altar of the latter is a
                    painting of the ascension by Mengs, highly valued.</p>
                <p>Dresden has obtained the name of the Athens of the north, from the various
                    collections of the fine arts and of antiquities that are to be seen there. The
                    palace is spacious and noble, and in the repository in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >GGinen</hi><hi rend="italic">Gewölbe</hi> is arranged a collection of
                    antiquities connected with the ancient history of the country, of very great
                    value. The zwenger or barbican is a beautiful circular building. The garden
                    serves the purposes of a promenade, and the apartments are used as the
                    repository of a valuable cabinet of natural history. The picture gallery
                    occupying the four sides of a square building is peculiarly rich in specimens of
                    art of the best and oldest masters, and is said to be the best in Europe at the
                    present time. The Japan palace, in a garden looking on the Elbe, contains the
                    royal library, amounting to more than 150,000 volumes, a collection of
                    porcelain, and many of the finest specimens both of ancient and modern statuary.
                    The chancery house is a fine building, and, besides several paintings, contains
                    some most valuable records of the historical kind. The other public and private
                    houses deserving attention are numerous, and will reward the curious visitor who
                    shall devote his time to their minute examination.</p>
                <p>The institutions for benevolence and for instruction are numerous, appropriate,
                    and well conducted. The surrounding country presents many objects which induce
                    pleasing walks or rides, especially the Plaunesche-grund, where a rapid stream
                    runs between lofty rocks, the palace of Pilnitz on the banks of the Elbe, and
                    the gardens which surround a part of the city.</p>
                <p>There are many manufactures carried on of gold and silver articles, silk goods,
                    cotton and woollen cloth, gloves, hosiery, and other minute commodities. A
                    considerable quantity of wine is made from the vineyards on the sides of the
                    hills overlooking the Elbe. Dresden has suffered in its population by war in
                    1745, 1756, 1811, and especially in 1813. The inhabitants amount to 49,000, of
                    whom 5000 are Catholics, 200 Calvinists, 860 Jews, and forty Hussites.</p>
