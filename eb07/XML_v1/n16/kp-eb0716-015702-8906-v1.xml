                <p><label type="entry">NEW FOREST</label> of Hampshire, in England, is a tract of at
                    least forty miles in compass, which had many populous town and villages, and
                    thirty-six mother churches, until it was destroyed and turned into a forest by
                    William the Conqueror. As this large tract lay many ages exposed to invasions
                    from foreigners, Henry VIII. built some castles in it. It is situated in that
                    part of Hampshire which is bounded on the east by Southampton River, and on the
                    south by the British Channel. It possesses advantages of situation, with respect
                    to the convenience of water carriage and nearness to the dock-yards, superior to
                    every other forest, having in its neighbourhood several ports and places of
                    shelter for shipping timber, amongst which Lymington is at the distance of only
                    two miles, Bewley about half a mile, and Redbridge three or four miles from the
                    forest; and the navigation to Portsmouth, the most considerable dock-yard in the
                    kingdom, is only about thirty miles from the nearest of these places. This is
                    the only forest belonging to the crown of which the origin is known.
                    Doomsday-book contains the most distinct account of its afforestation by William
                    the Conqueror. The contents of every field, farm, or estate, afforested, in
                    hides, carucates, or virgates, by which the extent of land was then computed,
                    together with the names of the hundreds and villages, and of the former
                    proprietors, which are for the most part Saxon; the rent or yearly value of each
                    possession, and the tax which had been paid for it to the crown during the reign
                    of Edward the Confessor, before the inhabitants were expelled, and that part of
                    the country laid waste; are all to be found in that curious and venerable
                    record. Wishing to discover the original extent of the forest, we had extracted
                    all that relates to it in that ancient survey; but the extract is far too
                    voluminous for insertion. The names of many of the places having since that time

                    been changed, it is difficult to ascertain with precision what were then the
                    limits of the forest. The oldest perambulation we have met with is amongst the
                    Pleas of the Forest, in the eighth year of Edward I. preserved in the
                    chapter-house at Westminster. The boundaries there described include all the
                    country from Southampton River on the east to the Avon on the west, following
                    the seacoast as far as the southern boundary between these rivers, and extending
                    northwards as far as North Chadeford, or North Charford, on the west, and to
                    Wade and Ower-bridge on the east; and the greater part, if not the whole, of
                    that extensive district, is mentioned in Doomsday-book as the forest belonging
                    to the crown. Another perambulation was however made in the twenty-ninth of the
                    same king, and leaves out a great part of the country contained in the former.
                    This perambulation, which is preserved in the Tower of London, confines the
                    forest to limits which, as far as can be traced, appear to have been followed in
                    the twenty-second year of Charles II. when the forest was again perambulated. By
                    the <hi rend="italic">Charta</hi><hi rend="italic">de Foresta,</hi> all lands
                    not belonging to the crown which had been afforested by Henry II. Richard I. or
                    King John, were to be disafforested; but as no provision was made for the
                    reduction of the more ancient afforestations, it is easy to account for the
                    great diminution of this forest in the reign of Edward I. who was not a prince
                    likely to submit to any encroachment on his rights. The perambulation of the
                    twenty-second of Charles II. is the last which is found upon record, and
                    contains the actual legal bounds of the forest. According to the perambulation
                    last mentioned, and the plan founded thereon, the forest extends from Godshill
                    on the north-west to the sea on the south-east, about twenty miles, and from
                    Hardley on the east to Ringwood on the west, about fifteen miles, and contains
                    within those limits about 92,365 acres statute measure. The whole of that
                    quantity, however, was not forest land, nor is it now the property of the crown.
                    There are several manors and other considerable freehold estates within the
                    perambulation, belonging to individuals, to the amount of about 24,797 acres;
                    about 625 acres are copyhold or customary lands belonging to his majesty’s manor
                    of Lyndhurst; about 1004 acres are lease-hold under the crown, granted for
                    certain terms of years, and forming part of the demised land revenue, under the
                    management of the surveyor-general of crown lands; about 901 acres are
                    purprestures or encroachments on the forest; about 1193 acres more are enclosed
                    lands held by the master-keepers and groom-keepers, with their respective
                    lodges; and the remainder, being about 63,845 acres, consists of woods and waste
                    lands of the forest. To perpetuate the spot where William Rufus was killed by
                    the glance of an arrow shot at a stag, a triangular stone was erected in
                    1745.</p>
