                <p><label type="entry">NECTARIUM</label>, from <hi rend="italic">nectar,</hi> the
                    fabled drink of the gods, is defined by Linnaeus to be a part of the corolla, or
                    appendage to the petals, appropriated for containing the honey, a species of
                    vegetable salt under a fluid form, which oozes from the plant, and is the
                    principal food of bees and other insects.</p>
                <p>But notwithstanding this definition, which seems to consider the nectarium as
                    necessary a part of the corolla as the petals, it is certain that all flowers
                    are not provided with this appendage, neither indeed is it essential to
                    fructification<pb break="no" facs="nls:194557827?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-7827-0074"/>. There is, besides, a manifest impropriety in
                    terming the nectarium a part of the corolla. Linnaeus might, with equal
                    propriety, have termed it a part or appendage of the stamina, calyx, or pointal,
                    as the appearance in question is confined to no particular part of the flower,
                    but is as various in point of situation as of form. The truth is, the term <hi
                    rend="italic">nectarium</hi> is exceedingly vague, and, if any determinate
                    meaning can be affixed to it, is expressive of all the singularities which are
                    observed in the different parts of flowers.</p>
                <p>The tube or lower part of flowers with one petal Linnaeus considers as a true
                    nectarium, because it is generally found to contain the sweet liquor formerly
                    mentioned. This liquor Pontedera compares to that called <hi rend="italic"
                    >amnios</hi> in pregnant animals, which enters the fertile or impregnated seeds;
                    but that this is not at least its sole use, is evident from the circumstance,
                    that the honey or liquor in question is to be found in flowers where there are
                    either no seeds, or such as, from the want of male organs, cannot be
                    impregnated. Thus the male flowers of nettle and willow, the female flowers of
                    sea-side laurel and black bryony, the male and female flowers of clutia,
                    kiggelaria, and butcher’s broom, all abound with the honey or nectar alluded
                    to.</p>
                <p>Vaillant was of opinion that the nectarium formed an essential part of the
                    corolla; for which reason he distinguished the singular appearances in fennel
                    flower and columbine by the name of <hi rend="italic">petals.</hi> The coloured
                    leaves which are now termed <hi rend="italic">petals</hi> he denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">fiower-cup.</hi> That the nectarium, however, is frequently
                    distinct from the petals, is evident both from the well-known examples just
                    mentioned, and likewise from the flowers of monkshood, hellebore, isopyrum,
                    fennel flower of Crete, barrenwort, grass of Parnassus, chocolate nut,
                    cherleria, and sauva-gesia.</p>
                <p>These general observations being premised, we proceed to take a nearer and more
                    particular view of the principal diversities, both in form and situation, of
                    this striking appendage of the flower. 1. In many flowers the nectarium is
                    shaped like a spur or horn; and that either in flowers of one petal, as
                    valerian, water milfoil <hi rend="italic">{utriculariap</hi> butterwort, and
                    calves-snout; or in such as have more than one, as larkspur, violet, fumitory,
                    balsam, and orchis. 2. In the following plants, the nectarium is properly a part
                    of the corolla, as lying within the substance of the petals: Ranunculus, lily,
                    iris, crown imperial, water-leaf, mousetail, ananas or pine-apple, dog’s-tooth
                    violet, piperidge bush, vallisneria, lιermannia, uvularia, and swertia. 3. The
                    nectarium is frequently placed in a series or row within the petals, though
                    entirely unconnected with their substance. In this situation it often resembles
                    a cup, as in narcissus. A nectarium of this kind is said by Linnaeus to crown
                    the corolla. The following are examples: Daffodil, sea daffodil, campion,
                    viscous campion, swallowwort, stapelia, cynanchum, nepenthes, cherleria,
                    balsamtree, African spiraea, witch-hazel, olax, and passion-flower. 4. In Indian
                    cress, buckler, mustard, Barbadoes cherry, and monotropa, the nectarium is
                    situated upon or makes part of the calyx. 5. The nectarium in bastard
                    flowerfence is seated upon the antherae or tops of the stamina; whence the name
                    <hi rend="italic">adcnanthera,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">glandular
                    anthera</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> which has been given to this
                    genus of plants. In the following it is placed upon the filaments: Bean-caper,
                    bay, fraxinella, marvel of Peru, bell-flower, lead-wort, roella, and commelina.
                    6. In hyacinth, flowering-rush, stock July flower, and rocket, the nectarium is
                    placed upon the seedbud. 7. In honey-flower, orpine, buck-wheat, collinsonia,
                    lathraea, navelwort, mercury, clutia, kiggelaria, sea-side laurel, and African
                    spiraea, it is attached to the common receptacle. Lastly, In ginger, nettle,
                    dyer’s weed, heart-geed, costus, turmeric, grewia, bastard orpine, vanelloe,
                    shew-tree, and willow, the nectarium is of a very singular construction, and
                    cannot properly fall under any of the foregoing heads.</p>
                <p>In discriminating the genera, the nectarium often furnishes an essential
                    character.</p>
                <p>Plants which have the nectarium distinct from the petals, that is, not lodged
                    within their substance, are affirmed by Linnaeus to be generally poisonous. The
                    following are adduced as examples, viz. monkshood, hellebore, columbine,
                    fennel-flower, grass of Parnassus, barren-wort, oleander, marvel of Peru,
                    bean-caper, succulent swallow-wort, fraxinella, and honey-flower.</p>
