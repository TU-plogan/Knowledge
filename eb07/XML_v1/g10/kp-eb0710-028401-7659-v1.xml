                    When the wind blows, but not so hard that a ship may not carry her top-sails
                    a-trip, then they say it is a loom gale. When it blows very strong, they say it
                    is a stiff, strong, or fresh gale. When two ships are near each other at sea,
                    and, there being but little wind blowing, one of them finds more of it than the
                    other, they say that the one ship gales away from the other.</p>

                    minister amongst the Baptists, was born at London in 1680. He studied at Leyden,
                    where he early distinguished himself, and afterwards at Amsterdam, under Dr
                    Limborch. He was chosen minister of the Baptist congregation at Barbican, where
                    his preaching, being chiefly practical, was greatly resorted to by people of all
                    persuasions. Four volumes of his sermons were published after his death, which
                    happened in 1721. His <hi rend="italic">Reflections on Dr Walts History of
                    Infant Baptism</hi> is the best defence of the Baptists ever published; and the
                    reading of that performance induced Mr William Whiston and Dr Foster to become
                    Baptists.</p>

                    continued a stated preacher there until the re-establishment of the church by
                    Charles II. when he chose rather to suffer the penalties of the act of
                    conformity, than to submit to it contrary to his conscience. He was afterwards
                    engaged by Philip Lord Wharton as tutor to his sons, whom he attended to an
                    academy at Caen in Normandy; and when this duty had been fulfilled, he became
                    pastor of a congregation of private conventiclers in Holborn. He died in 1678,

                    divine, born at Scruton, in Yorkshire, in the year 1636, was educated at
                    Cambridge, and at length became professor of the Greek language in that
                    university. He was afterwards chosen head master of St Paul’s school, London,
                    and was employed by the city in writing the elegant inscriptions on the monument
                    erected in memory of the conflagration in 1666. In 1676 he was collated to a
                    prebend in the cathedral of St Paul’s; and was likewise elected a fellow of the
                    Royal Society, to which he presented a Roman urn with its ashes. About the year

                    of Arabian manuscripts; and in the same year he was admitted as Dean of York. He
                    died in that city in 1702, and was interred in the cathedral, where a monument,
                    with a Latin inscription, was erected to his memory. He was a learned divine, an
                    eminent historian, one of the best Greek scholars of his age, and maintained a
                    correspondence with the most learned men abroad as well as at home. He
