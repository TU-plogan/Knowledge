                <p><label type="entry">GORDIANUS</label>, an illustrious Roman senator, who claimed
                    his descent on the father’s side from the Gracchi, and on the mother’s from the
                    Emperor Trajan. He seems to have been one of the richest senators of Rome, but
                    his unambitious spirit, and his devotion to the study ot literature, probably
                    saved him from a violent death and the loss of his property. He was raised to
                    the dignity ol aedile in the reign of Caracalla, and the magnificence of the
                    public shows he exhibited far surpassed any thing which Rome had ever witnessed.
                    He was twice raised to the dignity of consul, by Caracalla <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >a. ð.</hi> 213, and by Alexander <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 229. His long
                    life was spent in the study of letters; nor does he seem to have taken an active
                    part in public affairs till he was named proconsul ol Africa by the senate, an
                    appointment which was highly approved of by Alexander, whose original letter on
                    the subject to the senate is still preserved. <hi rend="italic">(Hist. Aug.</hi>
                    p. 152.) When the tyrant Maximin succeeded to the throne, he appointed a
                    procurator of Africa worthy of himself, who exacted with the utmost severity the
                    taxes he himself had imposed; but being murdered by the people, they proclaimed
                    Gordian and his son emperors, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 237. At first
                    unwilling to accept the honour, he at length yielded to the pressing invitation
                    of the people. The Gordiani erected their court at Carthage, and no sooner did
                    the deputation sent by the emperors to the senate make its appearance, than that
                    body joyfully confirmed their election. Meanwhile Capelianus, governor of
                    Mauritania, marched against Carthage with such rapidity, that they were unable
                    to collect troops in sufficient numbers to op&lt; <pb break="no"

                    younger Gordian fell at the head of a few guards; and his father, whose reign
                    had not exceeded thirty-six days, put an end to his life on the first news of
                    the defeat. Gordian was the author of a poem, in thirty books, on the actions of
                    Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius. <hi rend="italic">(Ħerodian,</hi> vii.; <hi
                    rend="italic">Hist. Aug.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Gordianus,</hi> surnamed the
                    Pius, was grandson of the elder Gordian. When the news of his grandfather’s
                    death reached Rome, the senators elected Maximus and Balbinus emperors, as best
                    fitted to oppose the threatened attack of Maximin; but the people insisted that
                    one of the family of Gordian should also be raised to the empire. This boy was
                    only thirteen years of age; and when Maximus and Balbinus fell in an
                    insurrection of the soldiers, Gordian was left as sole emperor. Having married
                    Fabia Sabina Tranquillina, the daughter of his master of rhetoric, he appointed
                    his father-in law Micitheus prefect of the praetorian guards, and through his
                    assistance emancipated himself from the hands of his mother’s eunuchs. Micitheus
                    proved himself an able minister, and discharged the military duties of his
                    office with vigour and ability. He induced the young emperor to proceed against
                    the Persians, who had invaded Mesopotamia, and during the whole of the
                    expedition Micitheus watched over the safety and discipline of the army.
                    Micitheus, however, died, with strong suspicions of having been poisoned by
                    Philip, his successor in the prefecture. A short time afterwards a sedition
                    broke out among the soldiers, which was fomented by Philip, and Gordian was
                    killed, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 244, near the conflux of the Euphrates
                    with the little river Aboras. (See <hi rend="italic">L’Histoire des quatre
