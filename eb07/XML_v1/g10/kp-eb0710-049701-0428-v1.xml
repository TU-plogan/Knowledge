                <p><label type="entry">GHIZNI</label>, a district of Afghanistan, situated between
                    the thirty-third and thirty-fourth degrees of north latitude, and between the
                    sixty-eighth and sixty-ninth of east longitude. It is a table land, interspersed
                    with a few hills, and possesses a very cold climate. The inhabitants, who are of
                    the Ghiljie tribe, are all shepherds, who raise a number of sheep and lambs. The
                    district is but thinly peopled. The principal towns are Ghizni, Kurrabaugh, and
                    Gurdaiz.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Ghizni,</hi> a celebrated city of Afghanistan, the chief
                    town of the above district, and forming the capital of a powerful empire,
                    reaching from the Tigris to the Ganges, and from the Jaxartes to the Persian
                    Gulf. It is now reduced to about 1500 houses, besides suburbs without the walls.
                    Its situation is on a height, at the foot of which flows a pretty large stream.
                    It is surrounded by stone walls, and contains three bazars of no great breadth,
                    with high houses on each side, and a covered chaursoo or exchange, besides
                    several dark and narrow streets. Ghizni was splendidly adorned by the Ghiznavi
                    princes, especially by Sultan Mahmoud. But most of these splendid buildings have
                    been long levelled with the dust; and only some few remains of the ancient
                    grandeur of the city are to be seen in the neighbourhood, particularly two lofty
                    minarets, which stand at some distance from each other, and are of different
                    heiglUs, the least upwards of a hundred feet high. The tomb of Sultan Mahmoud is
                    also standing, about three miles from the city. It is covered with a cupola, and
                    is a spacious rather than a magnificént building. The doors, which are large,
                    are of sandal wood, and said to have been brought by the sultan, as a trophy,
                    from the famous temple of Somnaut in Guzerat, which he sacked in his last
                    expedition to India. The tombstone is of white marble, on which are sculptured
                    Arabic verses from the Koran; and at its head Ties the plain but mighty wooden
                    mace, with a head of metal so heavy that few men can now use it. There are
                    likewise some thrones or chairs, inlaid with mother of pearl, in the tomb, which
                    are said to have belonged to Mahmoud. There are other ruins of less note, among
                    which may be mentioned the ,tombs of Behtole the wise, and that of Hakeem
                    Sunanee, a poet. But there are no remains of the magnificent palaces of the
                    Gaznaviđe kings, or of the mosques, baths, and caravanserais which once adorned
                    the capital of the East. Of all the antiquities of Ghizni, the most useful is an
                    embankment across a stream, which was built by Mahmoud, and which still supplies
                    water to the fields and gardens round the town. This city was in the year 960
                    taken possession of by Abistagy, a rebel governor of Khorassan, who threw off
                    his allegiance to the Samonavian dynasty of Persia, and founded a new kingdom.
                    He was succeeded by his son-in-law Subactageen, who ascended the throne in 975,
                    and extended hjβ dominions to the banks of the Indus. Mahmoud, who succeeded,
                    invaded India several times, and raised the glory of the Ghiznean empire to its
                    highest pitch; and he first obtained from the κhalif the title of Sultan. He
                    died in the year 1030, and was buried in a magnificent tomb. The kingdom
                    continued to flourish till the year 1116, when a Persian army invaded the
                    country, and took the capital. It was again taken about the year 1150, by
                    Alaaddeen, the prince of Ghore. Irritated by an insult offered to his family by
                    the inhabitants of Ghizni, he gave up the town to be pillaged by his soldiers,
                    who for seven days massacred the inhabitants, and destroyed all the public
                    buildings, sparing only the tombs. From this period may be dated the decline of
                    the city. The royal family fled to Lahore, where, languishing through two weak
                    reigns, the dynasty terminated in the person of Khosroo II. and in the year
                    1189. The travelling distance from Delhi by Cabul is 917 miles; from Cabul
