                <p><label type="entry">HUNNS</label>, a fierce and savage nation, who formerly
                    inhabited that part of Sarmatia bordering on the Palus Maeotis and the Tanais,
                    the ancient boundary between Europe and Asia. Their country, as described by
                    Procopius, lay north of Mount Caucasus, which, extending from the Euxine to the
                    Caspian Seas, separates Asiatic Sarmatia from Colchis, Iberia, and Albania, and
                    occupies the isthmus between the two seas above mentioned. Here they resided,
                    unknown to other nations, and themselves ignorant of other countries, till the
                    year 376. At this time, a hind pursued by the hunters, or, according to some
                    authors, an ox stung by a gad-fly, having passed the marsh, was followed by some
                    Hunns to the other side, where they discovered a country much more agreeable
                    than their own. On their return, having acquainted their countrymen with what
                    they had seen, the whole nation passed the marsh, and having attacked the Alans,
                    who dwelt on the banks of the Tanais, almost exterminated them. They next fell
                    upon the Ostrogoths, w hom they drove out of their country, and forced to retire
                    to the plains between the Borysthenes and the Tanais, now known by the name of
                    Podolia. They next attacked the Visigoths, whom they obliged to shelter
                    themselves in the most mountainous parts of their country; and at last the
                    Gothic nations, finding it impossible to withstand such an inundation of
                    barbarians, obtained leave from the Emperor Valens to settle in Thrace.</p>
                <p>The Hunns thus became in 376 masters of all the country between the Tanais and
                    Danube, where they continued quietly till the year 388, when great numbers of
                    them were taken into the pay of Theodosius I.; but, in the mean time, a party of
                    them, called the Nephthalite or White Hunns, who had continued in Asia, overran
                    all Mesopotamia, and even laid siege to Edessa, where they were repulsed with
                    great slaughter by the Romans. The European Hunns frequently passed the Danube,
                    and committed the greatest ravages in the western empire; sometimes they also
                    fell upon the eastern provinces, where they put all to fire and sword. They were
                    often defeated and repulsed by the Romans; but the empire was now too weak to
                    subdue or prevent them from making excursions; so that they continued to make
                    encroachments, and became every day more formidable than before. In 411, the
                    Hunns, under Attila, threatened the western empire with total destruction. This
                    monarch, having made himself master of all the northern countries from the
                    confines of Persia to the banks of the Rhine, invaded Maesia, Thrace, and
                    Illyricum, and made such progress, that ťħe emperor not thinking himself safe at
                    Constantinople, withdrew into Asia. Attila then broke into Gaul, where he took
                    and destroyed several Cities, and massacred the inhabitants with the greatest
                    cruelty. At last he was driven out with great slaughter by AEtius the Roman
                    general, and Theodoric king of the Goths, and could never afterwards make any
                    great progress. About the year 452 or 453 Attila died, and his kingdom was
                    immediately split into a number of small ones by his numerous children, who
                    waged perpetual war with one another. The Hunns then ceased to be formidable,
                    and became daily less able to cope with the other barbarous nations whom Attila
                    had kept in subjection. Still, however, their dominion was considerable; and in
                    the time of Charles the Great they were masters of Transylvania, Wallachia,
                    Servia, Carniola, Carinthia, and the greater part of Austria, together with
                    Bosnia, Sclavonia, and that part of Hungary which is situated beyond the Danube.
                    In the year 776, whilst Charles was in Saxony, two princes of the Hunns, Caganus
                    and Jugunus, sent ambassadors to him, desiring his friendship and alliance.
                    Charles received them with extraordinary marks of friendship, and readily
                    complied with their request. However, they not long afterwards entered into an
                    alliance with Taffila duke of Bavaria, who had revolted from Charles, and raised
                    great disturbances in Germany. Charles dissembled his resentment till he had
                    entirely reduced Bavaria, when he resolved to revenge himself on the Hunns for
                    the underhand succours they had given to his enemy. Accordingly, he ordered
                    levies to be made throughout his dominions, and having assembled a very numerous
                    army, divided it into two bodies, one of which he commanded himself, and the
                    other he committed to the care of his generals. The two armies entered the
                    kingdom of the Hunns at different places, ravaged their country far and wide,
                    burned their villages, and took all their strongholds. This he continued for
                    eight years, till the people were almost totally extirpated; nor did the Hunns
                    ever afterwards recover the blow, or appear as a distinct nation.</p>
                <p>There were two different nations which went by the name of Hunns; the Nephthalite
                    or White Hunns, and the Sarmatian or Scythian Hunns. The former inhabited a rich
                    country bordering to the north on Persia, and at a great distance from the
                    Sarmatian or Scythian Hunns, with whom they had no intercourse, nor the least
                    resemblance either in their persons or manners. They were a powerful nation, and
                    often served against the Romans in the Persian armies; but in the reign of the
                    Emperor Zeno, being provoked by Perozes king of Persia laying claim to part of
                    their country, they defeated the Persians in two pitched battles, slew their
                    king, overran all Persia, and held it in subjection for the space of two years,
                    obliging Cabades, the son and successor of Perozes, to pay them an annual
                    tribute. These Hunns, called by the writers of those times the White Hunns, did
                    not wander, like the others, from place to place; but, contented with their own
                    country, which supplied them with all necessaries, they lived under a regular
                    government, subject to one prince, and seldom made inroads, unless provoked,
                    either into' the Persian or Roman territories. They lived ac <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193648637?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8637-0734"/> cording to
                    their own laws, and dealt uprightly with one another, as well as with the
                    neighbouring tribes. Each of their great men used to choose twenty or more
                    companions to enjoy with him his wealth, and partake of all his diversions; but,
                    upon his decease, they were all buried with him in the same grave. This custom
                    savours of extreme barbarity; but in every other respect the Nephthalite were a
                    less ferocious race than the Scythian Hunns, who, breaking into the empire,
                    filled most of the provinces of Europe with blood and slaughter.</p>
                <p>The latter were, according to Ammianus Marcellįnus, a savage race, exceeding in
                    cruelty the most barbarous nations. According to Jornandes, they began to
                    practise their cruelty upon their own children the very first day they came into
                    the world, cutting and mangling the cheeks of their males, to prevent the growth
                    of hair, which, contrary to the sentiments of other nations, they must have
                    looked upon as unbecoming and unmanly. They had, perhaps, in this practice
                    another view, which Jornandes seems to insinuate elsewhere, namely, to strike
                    terror into the enemy with their countenances thus deformed and covered with
                    scars. They had no other food but roots and raw meat, being quite unacquainted
                    with the use of fire; they had no houses at all, not even huts; they lived
                    constantly exposed to the air, in the woods and on the mountains, where, from
                    their infancy, they were inured to hunger, thirst, and all manner of hardships;
                    and they had such an aversion to houses, which they called the sepulchres of the
                    living, that, when they migrated into other countries, they could hardly be
                    prevailed upon to come within the walls of any house, not thinking themselves
                    safe when shut up and covered. They used even to eat and sleep on horseback,
                    scarcely ever dismounting; a circumstance which, in all likelihood, induced
                    Zosimus to assert that the Hunns could not walk. They covered their nakedness
                    with goats’ skins, or the skins of a sort of mice sewed together. Day and night
                    were indifferent to them, as to buying, selling, eating, and drinking. They had
                    no law, nor any kind of religion, but complied with their inclinations, whenever
                    these prompted them, without the least restraint, or distinction between good
                    and evil. In war they began the battle with great fury and a hideous noise; but
                    if they met with a vigorous opposition, their fury began to abate after the
                    first onset; and when once put into disorder, they never rallied, but fled in
                    the utmost confusion. They were quite unacquainted with the art of besieging
                    towns; and authors observe, that they seldom or never attacked the enemy’s camp.
                    They were a faithless nation, and thought themselves no longer bound by the most
                    solemn treaties than they found their advantage in observing these. Hence we
                    often find them, upon the least prospect of obtaining more advantageous
                    conditions, breaking into the Roman empire, in defiance of the most solemn oaths
                    and engagements. Several corps of Hunns, after their coming into Europe, served
                    in the Roman armies against the Goths and other nations; nay, they were ready
                    for hire to fight against each other, being blind to every consideration
                    excepting that of interest. For further information on this subject, the reader
                    is referred to the learned and profound work of De Guignes, of which some
                    account is given in the biographical notice of the author. See article <hi
