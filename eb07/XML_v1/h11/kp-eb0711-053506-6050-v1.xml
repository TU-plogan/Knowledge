                    celebrated chemist, born at Batavia on the 8th of January 1652, was the son of a
                    Saxon gentleman employed in the service of the Dutch East India Company. His
                    father intended him for the army, but having afterwards settled at Amsterdam,
                    William prosecuted his studies at that place, whence he removed to Iena, and
                    afterwards to Leipsig, where he studied the law. In 1674 he was received as
                    advocate at Magdeburg, which had been indebted for a new species of celebrity to
                    the physical experiments of Otto Guericke, and there applied himself to the
                    study of experimental philosophy. Some time afterwards he travelled into Italy,
                    and at Padua applied himself to the study of medicine, anatomy, and botany. He
                    afterwards studied at Bologna; and at Rome he learned optics, painting,
                    sculpture, and music. He then travelled into France, England, and Holland; <pb

                    took the degree of doctor of physic at Wirtemberg; visited Germany and the
                    North; explored the mines of Saxony, Bohemia, Hungary, and Sweden; and returned
                    to France, where he acquired the esteem of the learned. He was on the point of
                    returning into Germany, when Colbert being informed of his merit, made him
                    advantageous offers, which induced him to fix his residence at Paris. But soon
                    afterwards he lost his protector, and also incurred the odium oí returning into
                    the bosom of the Roman Catholic church; and this double misfortune was the more
                    sensibly felt that he had never dreamed of securing for himself any independent
                    means of subsistence. Homberg, already well known for his phosphorus, for a
                    pneumatic machine of his own invention more perfect than that of Guericke, for
                    his microscopes, for his discoveries in chemistry, and for the number and
                    variety of his curious observations, was received into the Academy of Sciences
                    in 1691, and had committed to him the laboratory of that body, of which he was
                    one of the principal ornaments. The Duke of Orleans, afterwards regent of the
                    kingdom, at length made him his chemist, settled upon him a pension, gave him a
                    superb laboratory, and in 1704 made him his first physician. Homberg, having
                    lived for thirty-three years in the Catholic faith, died in 1715. His principal
                    works are, 1. Manière de faire le Phosphore brûlant de Kunckel, 1692; 2.
