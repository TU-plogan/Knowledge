                    She was not only a lover of the muses, but a great encourager of polite

                    between him and the constable de Luines. In 1625 he was advanced to the dignity
                    of baron of the kingdom of Ireland, by the title of Lord Herbert of Castle
                    Island; and in 1631 to that of Lord Herbert of Cherbury in Shropshire. After the
                    breaking out of the civil wars, he adhered to the parliament; and in 1644
                    obtained a pension, on account of his having been plundered by the king’s
                    forces. He wrote a History of the Life and Reign of Henry V1H., a treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Veritate,</hi> of considerable celebrity,
                    and several other works. Lord Herbert died at London in 1648. This nobleman,
                    according to Granger, “stands in the first rank of the public ministers,
                    historians, and philosophers of his age. It is hard to say whether his person,
                    his understanding, or his courage, was the most extraordinary; as the fair, the
                    learned, and the brave held him in equal admiration. But the same man was wise
                    and capricious; redressed wrongs, and quarrelled for punctilios; hated bigotry
                    in religion, and was himself a bigot to philosophy. He exposed himself to such
                    dangers as other men of courage would have carefully declined; and called in
                    question the fundamentals of a religion which none had the hardiness to dispute
                    besides himself.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Herbert,</hi><hi rend="italic">William,</hi> Earl of
                    Pembroke, was born at Wilton, in W’iltshire, 1580, and admitted to New College,
                    Oxford, in 1592, where he continued about two years. In 1601 he succeeded to his
                    father’s honoursand estate, and was made a knight of the garter in 1604, and
                    governor of Portsmouth six years afterwards. In 1626 he was elected chancellor
                    of the university of Oxford, and about the same time made lord steward of the
                    king’s household. He died suddenly at his house in London on the 10th of April
                    1630, if we may credit Wood, according to the calculation of his nativity made
                    several years before by Mr Thomas Allen of Gloucester Hall. Concerning this
                    calculation, Clarendon relates, that some considerable persons connected with
                    Lord Pembroke having met at Maidenhead, one of them at supper drank a health to
                    the lord steward; upon which another said, that he believed his lordship was at
                    that time very merry, for he had now outlived the day which it had been
                    prognosticated from his nativity that he would not survive. The next morning,
                    however, they received the news of his death. Whether the noble historian really
                    believed this and other accounts relating to astrology, apparitions,
                    providential interpositions, and other marvels not dreamt of in philosophy,
                    which he has inserted in his history, we do not presume to say; he narrates
                    them, however, as if he did not actually disbelieve them. Lord Pembroke was not
                    only a great favourer of learned men, but was himself learned, and endowed with
                    a considerable share of poetical genius. All that are extant of his productions
                    in this way were published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Poems written by
                    William Earl of Pembroke.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Herbert,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Sir Thomas,</hi> a gentleman of the Pembroke family, was born at
                    York, where his father was an aiderman. William, earl of Pembroke, sent him
                    abroad in 1626; and he spent four years in travelling through Asia and Africa.
                    In 1634 he published, in folio, a Relation of some Years’ Travel into Africa and
                    the Great Asia, especially the Territories of the Persian Monarchy, and some
                    parts of the Oriental Indies and Isles adjacent. On the breaking out of the
                    civil war, he adhered to the parliament; and at Oldenby, on the removal of the
                    king’s servants, by the desire of the parliamentary commissioners, he and James
                    Harrington were retained as grooms of the bedchamber, and attended the king even
                    to the block. At the Restoration he was created a baronet by Charles II. for his
                    faithful services to his father during the last two years of his life. In 1678
                    he wrote <hi rend="italic">Threnodia Carolina,</hi> containing an account of the
                    last two years of the life of Charles I.; and he assisted Sir William Dugdale in
                    compiling the third volume of his <hi rend="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum.</hi>
                    He died at York in 1782, leaving several manuscripts to the public library at
                    Oxford, and others to that of the cathedral at York.</p>
