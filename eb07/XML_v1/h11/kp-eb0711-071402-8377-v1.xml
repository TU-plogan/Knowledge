                <p><label type="entry">HOWE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard, Earl</hi></label>, an
                    English naval commander of distinguished eminence, was born in the year 1725,
                    being the second son of Lord Viscount Howe, by the daughter of Baron Kilmansegg.
                    From his early attachment to the life of a mariner, he quitted the school of
                    Eton at the age of fourteen, and went on board the Severn, commanded by the
                    Honourable Captain Legge, and destined for the South Seas under Commodore Anson.
                    Mr Howe next appeared in the Burford, Captain Lushington commander, who being
                    killed in an expedition against the Caraccas, Commodore Knowles made Mr Howe an
                    acting lieutenant. At the age of twenty he was promoted to the rank of commander
                    in the Baltimore sloop of war, and joined a squadron at that time cruising off
                    the coast of Scotland, where he met with an opportunity of displaying his
                    undaunted courage and intrepidity, by engaging and beating off two French
                    frigates of thirty guns each, with the assistance of another armed ship,
                    notwithstanding that he was severely wounded in the head during the action. This
                    service was immediately and justly rewarded with <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193648390?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8390-0715"/> the rank of
                    post-captain. He was soon afterwards appointed to the rank of captain on board
                    Commodore Knowles’s own ship of eighty guns, with which he returned to England
                    in the year 1748. When hostilities again commenced,*he commanded the Dunkirk of
                    sixty guns, in North America; a ship which constituted part of the squadron
                    under Admiral Boscawen, and with which he captured a French man of war of
                    superior metal, off the coast of Newfoundland, namely, the Alcide of sixty-four
                    guns. In order to annoy the coast of France, he received in the year 1758 the
                    command of a small squadron, with which he effected the destruction, at St Maio,
                    of a number of magazines and ships. When he served on board the Essex, Prince
                    Edward, afterwards Duke of York, sailed with him, at which time he powerfully
                    contributed to the reduction of the town of Cherbourg. In 1758 his elder brother
                    fell in North America, in the service of his king and country; upon which
                    occasion the young commodore succeeded to the family title and estate. In the
                    following year he had a share in the victory gained by Sir Edward Hawke over the
                    French fleet under Admiral Conflans. He afterwards served in the Channel, and
                    was captain of the Amelia, the ship of admiral the Duke of York. On the
                    restoration of peace, he was nominated one of the lords of the admiralty, and
                    some time afterwards treasurer of the navy. He was in the year 1770 raised to
                    the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, and chosen commander-in-chief on the
                    Mediterranean station. In 1775 he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral of
                    the white. In reference to his rapid promotion, Lord Hawke said in the House of
                    Peers, “I advised his majesty to make the promotion. I have tried my Lord Howe
                    on important occasions; he never asked me how he was to execute any service, but
                    always went and performed it.”</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1776, Lord Howe appeared off Massachusetts, as
                    commander-in-chief of his Britannic majesty’s fleet acting in North America, and
                    in the capacity of commissioner for restoring the blessings of an amicable
                    reconciliation. All the provincial governors were made acquainted with his
                    arrival by means of circular letters expressive of the full extent of the
                    authority with which he and his fellow commissioners were invested; but as
                    congress did not deem the conditions which these letters contained to be at all
                    satisfactory, they were ordered to be inserted in all the gazettes for the
                    examination of the people. His powers being thus circumscribed at the very
                    commencement, he could only act in the capacity of naval commander, in which he
                    aided the operations of the land forces with uncommon skill. It was not to be
                    imagined, however, that much glory could redound to his lordship from such an
                    unequal contest, till the junction of France with Americaplaced the contending
                    parties more upon a level. On the arrival of Admiral d’Estaing, in the month of
                    July 1778, off Sandy Hook, Lord Howe was certainly in a very critical situation;
                    but, in consequence of an effort of uncommon skill and dexterity, the French
                    commander deemed it prudent to retire, when he was pursued by Lord Howe to Rhode
                    Island, after obtaining a reinforcement under Admiral Byron. The intentions of
                    the enemy were completely counteracted, and the campaign was finally terminated
                    with honour. Here he resigned his command, and returned to England; but in 1782
                    he was promoted to the rank of admiral of the blue, made a viscount of Great
                    Britain, and chosen commander of the fleet which was sent for the relief of
                    Gibraltar. The combined fleets of France and Spain were about a third superior
                    to that under Lord Howe, who, with thirty-four sail of the line, appeared off
                    Gibraltar in the month of October, being driven into the Mediterranean by
                    contrary winds. Although he was pursued by the combined fleet, he found means to
                    supply the fortress with provisions. He checked the enemy by a partial action,
                    and notwithstanding he offered to give them battle, it was declined on their
                    part; and he had the satisfaction to execute his commission prior to his return
                    home, in spite of the numerous difficulties which he had to encounter.</p>
                <p>On the termination of the war he was nominated first lord of the admiralty, which
                    he both resigned and resumed with the different changes of administration. In
                    the year 1787 he was appointed admiral of the white, and in the following year
                    created an earl of Great Britain. When hostilities were renewed with France in
                    1793, his lordship, at the express desire of his majesty, accepted the command
                    of the Channel fleet; but he had it not in his power to effect any thing
                    decisive till the summer of 1794. On the memorable first of June, with a fleet
                    consisting of twenty-five sail of the line, he gave battle to a French fleet of
                    twenty-six, and gained a most signal victory over the enemy, capturing seven of
                    their ships, one of which was so shattered as to go to the bottom, whilst
                    several others were very much crippled. His lordship had the good fortune not to
                    lose a ship, and comparatively but few men, considering the great loss sustained
                    by the enemy. The gratitude of the nation was suitable to the importance of this
                    naval victory, and it is more than probable that the first of June will never be
                    forgotten. In 1795 he was made general of marines; but the infirmities which are
                    the usual concomitants of <hi rend="italic">age</hi> induced him to resign his
                    naval command in the year 1797, and on his final retreat he was presented with
                    the badge of the Garter. His influence as an officer contributed greatly to
                    stifle a spirit of mutiny and discontent which at this time exhibited alarming
                    symptoms amongst the seamen of his majesty’s fleets. He terminated his brilliant
                    and honourable career on the 5th of August 1799, in the seventy-third year of
                    his age, leaving none but female issue behind him. His lordship’s valour, always
                    cool and steady, was of that nature which enables a commander to make the most
                    of his situation; his judgment was sound and penetrating, which prevented him
                    from being easily imposed upon by external appearances; and his seamanship was
                    of the most consummate and masterly kind.</p>
