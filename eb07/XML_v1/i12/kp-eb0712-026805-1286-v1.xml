                <p><label type="entry">INDRE</label> and LOIRE, a department of the north-west of
                    France, formed out of the ancient district of Touraine. It extends over 2953
                    square miles, or, according to the <hi rend="italic">Royal Almanac,</hi> 612,679
                    hectares. It is divided into three arrondissements, whose subdivisions are 24
                    cantons, and 311 communes, with 274,970 inhabitants. It is generally a level
                    country, consisting of valleys, in which the rivers run, and of plains between,
                    of moderate elevation, which, from their good cultivation and fertility, have
                    been denominated the garden of France. There are, however, some parts of the
                    department which are sandy heaths, and others where the chalk is so slightly
                    covered with soil, as to render it unfit for profitable cultivation. It is well
                    watered by the rivers Loire, Cher, Indre, Vienne, and the Creuse, and their
                    respective tributary brooks, too numerous to be recounted. The climate is
                    temperate like all the middle of France, with a pleasant spring and autumn, hot
                    summer, and short but not severe winter. The forests cover one-ninth of the
                    department, producing fuel and timber. The corn of this division is unequal to
                    the consumption, one-fourth of which must be supplied from the neighbouring
                    provinces. It yields, however, a surplus of each kind of domestic animals, and
                    of their produce, and a most copious <pb break="no"

                    fruits of all kinds, some of which dried, as plums and apples, and others as
                    almonds, filberts, walnuts, and chestnuts, with no preparation, form a
                    considerable branch of commerce. It yields also good flax and hemp, and much
                    honey and wax. The wine is chiefly white, and some of it, as well as of the red,
                    is highly valued, but the greater part is made into brandy for distant markets.
                    The rearing silk worms, which was once a considerable occupation, has been
                    nearly abandoned. There are some mines of iron, whose ores are cleared and
                    worked into the appropriate articles. The manufactures are inconsiderable,
                    consisting of linen and woollen cloth, of some silk goods, paper, liquorice, and
                    liqueurs. The capital of the department is the city of Tours.</p>
