                <p><label type="entry">EPHORI</label>, ancient Doric magistrates, whose power and
                    ιfluence seem to have varied at different times. In Spar-ĭ the college consisted
                    of five, and they entered on their <hi rend="superscript"> n</hi> ∏ual office at
                    the autumnal solstice, the beginning of <hi rend="superscript"> le</hi>
                    Lacedaemonian year. The first of these magistrates ve name to the year, in the
                    same way as the first elect-d consul did at Rome; and they began their official
                    dues by publishing a species of edicts, in which they ap-mted the secret
                    officers or κgυwτo∕. In this edict was ’ŋnd the strange metaphorical expression
                    for subjection nd obedience, “that they must shave the beard and obey ' <hi
                    rend="superscript"> e</hi> laws. They held their daily meetings in an office -t
                    apart for them <hi rend="italic">(&lt;⅛χi∕οv),</hi> where they were also in the
                    <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> nι(of eating together.</p>
                <p>t is supposed by Müller, in his able treatise on the po- <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> ca institutions of the Dorians, that the duties of the pion were
                    originally limited to the superintendence of <hi rend="superscript"> es,</hi>
                    and of the public markets. Aristotle informs us, whilst describing their
                    judicial powers, that they decided civil causes, but that the council presided
                    over all capital crimes. It appears therefore that the court of ephori gave
                    judgment respecting civil duties and property. The Periaeci and Helots, when
                    they were in Sparta, were also under its jurisdiction. But the ephori gradually
                    extended their authority; and it seems to have been the usual course of events
                    in Greece, that the civil courts should enlarge their influence, whilst the
                    power of the criminal courts was continually on the decline.</p>
                <p>The circumstance which seems principally to have extended the jurisdiction of the
                    ephori, was the privilege they enjoyed of instituting an inquiry into the
                    official conduct of all magistrates, excepting that of councillors. We do not
                    mean to say that this scrutiny always took place; but the ephori had it in their
                    power to compel any magistrate to stand his trial, if they had remarked any
                    thing suspicious in his administration. The king was not exempted from this
                    power, but bound to yield as implicit obedience as the lowest officer of the
                    state. Thus we find Cleomenes tried for bribery before the Persian war. But it
                    must not be supposed that the ephori could of themselves punish with death: they
                    were only the accusers before a larger court, which consisted of all the
                    councillors, of the ephori themselves, who seem to have acted both as accusers
                    and judges, of the other king, and probably of several other magistrates, who
                    had all equal votes. The ephori had only the power to impose fines, and to
                    demand immediate payment. Thus Agesilaus was fined for endeavouring to make
                    himself popular; whilst Archidamus was reprimanded for having married a wife of
                    too small stature. Sometimes we find them punishing one man for having
                    introduced money into the state, another for indolence, and a third for the most
                    extraordinary reason, namely, that he was generally ill treated and
                    insulted.</p>
                <p>The ephori appear from very ancient times to have had a right to transact
                    business with the popular assembly in preference to any other magistrates. They
                    could convene the people and put the vote to them. They had great authority in
                    transacting with foreign nations, admitting ambassadors, and dismissing them
                    from the confines of the kingdom. In time of war they were empowered to send
                    troops on whatever day they thought fit, and seem even to have been able to
                    determine the number of men. The army was then entrusted to the king, or some
                    other general, who received from them instructions how to act, and was even
                    restrained in his proceedings by deputies whom the ephori sent to watch over
                    him. The general could be recalled by the scytala, and their first duty was to
                    visit the office of the ephori. It is impossible, however, to believe that the
                    ephori could act by their own authority on such important occasions as these;
                    they could only have been the agents and plenipotentiaries of the popular
                    assembly. It must in fact have been the decrees of the people which they put in
                    execution.</p>
                <p>The office of the ephori was abolished by Cleomenes, but restored under the Roman
                    dominion. (See Müller’s <hi rend="italic">Dorier,</hi> Breslau, 1824, t. ii. p.
