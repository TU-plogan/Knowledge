                <p><label type="entry">EURIPIDES</label>, the son of Mnesarchus, a celebrated tragic
                    poet, was born 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> in the island of Salamis, to
                    which place his parents had been obliged to fly from Athens at the time it was
                    threatened by the invasion of Xerxes. His birth took place on the very day that
                    the battle was fought near the strait Euripus, the prelude to the more decisive
                    engagement in the vicinity of Salamis. To commemorate this event, the embryo
                    poet was called Euripides. As of every illustrious man, there arc some stories
                    told which predicted his future destiny, and, amongst these, an oracle declared
                    that he should be crowned at the Olympic games. His father, misunderstanding its
                    true meaning, trained him for athletic exercises, and it appears that he was
                    victorious at the games celebrated in honour of Theseus and Ceres. But fate had
                    destined him for a higher and a more ennobling occupation; he began to devote
                    himself to the study of eloquence under Prodicus of Chios, and to take lessons
                    from the philosopher Anaxagoras. It is said by some that he was a disciple of
                    Socrates, but we can scarcely credit this statement, as the philosopher was
                    thirteen years younger than the poet. The persecutions which Anaxagoras
                    underwent from the bigotry of the Athenians clearly demonstrated to Euripides
                    the dangerous path which he was pursuing, and induced him to renounce the study
                    ’ of philosophy, and direct his attention to the stage. This took place, it is
                    said, in his eighteenth year, and in .455 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> he
                    succeeded in gaining the third prize. Of all the plays which he wrote, only
                    five, according to Varro, were reckoned worthy of being crowned; but this fact
                    may be explained by the violent spirit of rivalry and jealousy which seems to
                    have prevailed at Athens at this time. In his domestic affairs he was by no
                    means fortunate; both his wives disgraced him by the irregularity of their
                    lives; and from this circumstance probably arose his violent hatred of the sex,
                    the weakness of which he took every opportunity of ridiculing and exposing. His
                    private grief became the butt of the comic writers of the day, and Aristophanes
                    more particularly held him up to the ridicule of the public. It was no doubt in
                    consequence of these incessant attacks that Euripides determined to retire to
                    the court of Archelaus, king of Macedonia, who reigned from 413 to 339 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> and was then the beneficent patron of literature
                    and science. By him he was received with all that respect to which his
                    distinguished talents entitled him, and some say that he was appointed one of
                    his principal ministers. Here be resided till his death (406 <hi

                    story ever exhibited upon the stage. As he was strolling through a wood, a pack
                    of the royal hounds attacked the poet, and tore him in pieces. His remains were
                    removed to Pella by the king, and every honour was shown to his memory. The
                    Athenians <pb break="no" facs="nls:193750510?mode=fullsize"

                    Archelaus refused to gratify those who had neglected the poet in his
                    lifetime.</p>
                <p>It is difficult to convey an exact idea of the character of Euripides as a
                    dramatist to those who have not read the original. His language is raised but
                    little above that of common conversation, yet he possesses the rare art of
                    choosing his words so well, that the most common are ennobled by their happy
                    combination. He has none of the dithryambic boldness of AEschylus, none of the
                    pompous magnificence of Sophocles, yet he touches the hidden springs of human
                    passion with a masterly hand. Still he is full of faults, which the good taste
                    of all ages must condemn. He is too fond of learned digressions, “of wise saws”
                    and philosophical maxims; and the plots of his plays are not always so clear and
                    unembarrassed as they ought to be. Of eighty-four tragedies, of which Barnes has
                    given a list, only nineteen have been preserved. They are, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hecuba, Orestes, Phcenissoe, Medea,</hi><hi rend="italic">Hippolytus,
                    Alcestes,</hi><hi rend="italic">Andromache,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>There are numerous editions of his works. But we believe that of Barnes,
                    Cambridge, 1694, fol. and that of Matthiae, Leipsic, 1813-1829, vol. ix. to be
                    the best.</p>
