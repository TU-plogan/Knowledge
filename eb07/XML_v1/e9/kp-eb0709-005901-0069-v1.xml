                    >insectum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">intersectum,</hi> signifying <hi
                    rend="italic">cut into</hi> or intersected, in allusion to the obvious divisions
                    of head, thorax, and abdomen, of which their general forms consist. The Greek
                    word bears the same signification.</p>

                <p>DEFINITION OF INSECTS—THEIR ORDERS EXPLAINED—AND THEIR STUDY DEFENDED.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom</hi> of this work (see vol.
                    iii. p. 179), we have given a view of the primary divisions of the subjects of
                    zoological science. The third primary division, that of the articulated animals,
                    consists of four great classes:—!. <hi rend="italic">Annelides,</hi> such as
                    serpulae, nereids, leeches, earthworms, &amp;c.; 2. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crustacea,</hi> such as crabs, lobsters, and shrimps; 3. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Arachnides,</hi> such as spiders, scorpions, and mites; and 4. <hi
                    rend="italic">Insecta,</hi> or true insects, such as beetles, butterflies, and
                    moths. The class Insecta of Linnaeus included not only those last named, but
                    also Crustacea and Arachnides, and was thus almost co-extensιve with what we now
                    regard as a primary division under the term <hi rend="italic">Articulata.</hi>
                    We have, however, already discussed those two branches as distinct classes,
                    under their respective titles (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Arachnides</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Crustacea),</hi> and we slιall not repeat the important
                    characters by which they are distinguished from genuine insects.</p>
                <p>The term insect was anciently applied to a much more extended series of beings
                    than are now included under that designation. It seems to have comprised
                    whatever was destitute of an internal skeleton, and exhibited a body composed of
                    articulated parts. In this sense it accords with its application in the writings
                    of Aristotle and Pliny, with certain restrictions however, for these authors
                    were in advance of their successors, in as far as they distinguished the
                    Crustacea from insects. Swammerdam and Ray adopted the definition of the ancient
                    authors, but erred in classing the Vermes or worms with insects, a combination
                    which does not appear for certain to have entered into Aristotle’s views.
                    Linnaeus wisely separated these two classes, but at the same time injudiciously
                    joined the Crustacea with insects, placing them in his order <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aptera,</hi> along with spiders and scolopendrae. Fabricius in that respect
                    followed the same general plan, and included all those living creatures in the
                    same class, notwithstanding the better example shown by Brisson, who had
                    separated all the species possessed of more than six feet, that is, the
                    Crustacea and Arachnides of Lamarck. Since the death of the great Swedish
                    naturalist, our improved knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the
                    invertebrated classes has thrown a clearer light upon the subject, and many
                    modifications have taken place in the arrangement of the insect tribes.</p>
                <p>Insects, properly so called, may be defined as <hi rend="italic">animals without
                    vertebra:, six-footed, with a distinct head furnished with two antenna and a
                    pair of composite immoveable eyes, and breathing through stigmatic openings
                    which lead to interior tracheae.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The above definition excludes those many-footed species
                    called <hi rend="italic">Juli</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scolopendre,</hi>
                    which, though still included by some modern writers among insects, were
                    established as a distinct class by Dr Leach <hi rend="italic">(Edinburgh
                    Encyclopedia,</hi> vol. vnι.; and <hi rend="italic">Linn. Tran,,</hi> vol. ιx.)
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Myriapoda,</hi> and were recognised as such
                    by LatreiUe in his <hi rend="italic">Familie, du Regne</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Animal,</hi> p. 322. Although we did not allude to this class in our exposition
                    above referred to (art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom),</hi> we think that
                    the removal of the two genera lust named from the Insecta is advisable, as it
                    leaves the latter in a state to be more clearly defined, as well as
                    actually-composed of more natural constituent parts or, as MM. Audouιn and Milne
                    Edwards have expressed it, <hi rend="italic">plu,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    moins complètes; mais jamais ils n’acquièrent, après leur sortie de l’oeuf, de

                <p>As we shall have occasion to mention many terms which may not be familiar to the
                    general reader, we deem it advisable, instead of taking his knowledge for
                    granted, to commence with a brief enumeration and explanation of the various <hi
                    rend="italic">orders</hi> in Entomology, so that their names, when subsequently
                    brought forward, may be associated with some definite idea. We shall consider
                    all insects as included under eleven different orders, as follows.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Coleoptera</hi> (from Koλfoj, <hi rend="italic">a
                    sheath,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">πτιaa, wings),</hi> including all those kinds
                    commonly called <hi rend="italic">beetles</hi> Their membranous wings, which are
                    the true organs of flight, are protected by a superior and anterior pair of
                    harder consistence, called elytra. They are all masticators, and are provided
                    with mandibles and maxillae. Plates CCXXI-VII.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Orthoptera</hi> (from ogðof, <hi rend="italic"
                    >straight,</hi> and ¢rr¶a, <hi rend="italic">wings),</hi> including crickets,
                    grasshoppers, locusts, &amp;c. The upper wings are of the consistence of
                    parchment, reticulated, and more or less incumbent. The mouth is provided with
                    mandibles and maxillae. Plate CCXXVIII.</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hemiptera</hi> (from r&gt;&lt;rυ, <hi rend="italic">the
                    half,</hi> and wnp, <hi rend="italic">wings),</hi> including the cimices or
                    bugs, the water scorpions, cicadae or froghoppers, aphides, &amp;c. A portion of
                    their upper wings is frequently membranaceous, or of the same consistence as the
                    inferior pair. The mandibles and maxillae are replaced by a sheath and sucker.
                    Plate CCXXIX.</p>

                    &amp;c. Both pairs of wings are membranous, naked, and finely reticulated. Mouth

                    &amp;c., and characterized likewise by membranous naked wings, which <pb

                    however, present fewer nervures, and are not reticulated, as in the preceding
                    order. The mouth is furnished with mandibles and maxillae, and the abdomen of
                    the female is terminated either by an ovipositor· or sting. Plates CCXXXI-H.</p>
                <p>6. <hi rend="smallcaps">Lepidoptera</hi> (from Xsw/ç, <hi rend="italic">a
                    scale,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">πτίξα,</hi><hi rend="italic">wings),</hi>
                    containing all butterflies and moths, and generally characterized by the
                    farinaceous or scaly aspect of the organs of flight, and the tubular or
                    thread-like extension of the parts of the mouth. Plates CCXXX∏I-V∏.</p>
                <p>7. <hi rend="smallcaps">Stkepsiptera</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">&lt;!τξt⅛ις, a

                    wings),</hi> including a few peculiar and parasitical species belonging to the
                    genera stylops and xenos. This order corresponds to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Rldpiptera</hi> of Latreille, but we adopt Mr Kirby’s denomination, as
                    possessing a prior claim. Plate CCXXXI.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="smallcaps">Diptera</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">δiς, twice</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">double,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">¶nļa, wings),</hi>
                    including the house fly, and other two-winged kinds. The mouth is furnished with
                    a proboscis, and there are two organs called poisers or balancers <hi
                    rend="italic">(halteres)</hi> placed behind the true wings, one on eaeh side.

                <p>9. <hi rend="smallcaps">Suctoria</hi> (so designated from their sucking
                    propensities) is constituted by the genus <hi rend="italic">Pulex</hi> of
                    Linnaeus, and differs from the ensuing apterous orders in undergoing a regular
                    metamorphosis, and possessing what some regard as the rudiments of elytra.<note

                <p>The study of the structure and habits of this numerous and diversified class of
                    beings has long been a favourite occupation with men of science in all the
                    continental countries of Europe, and has assumed of late years in the southern
                    parts of our own island a character of considerable and increasing importance.
                    Works have been recently published in this country which need fear no comparison
                    with the most finished examples of pictorial representation; and when we
                    consider how sparingly the subject of Entomology has been hitherto patronized by
                    the-public, we cannot sufficiently esteem the exertions of those who have thus
                    devoted their time and talents to a pursuit which brings with it no other reward
                    than the delight which every instructed mind necessarily drawş from the
                    contemplation of a favourite subject. Entomology, in truth, still stands in a
                    difficult and somewhat dubious position, and presents itself to many under a far
                    less inviting aspect than its beautiful sister-science of Botany. In connection
                    with the latter study, the very mass of mankind, even the <hi rend="italic"
                    >profanum vulgus,</hi> however ignorant of the technical details, have many
                    early formed, and therefore pleasing associations. Every country-house has its
                    flower parterres, and numerous cottages their glowing borders,—botanic gardens
                    have been formed in the vicinity of most of the larger cities, while nursery
                    grounds are frequent in the neighbourhood even of provincial towns, —to say
                    nothing of the “flower enamelled meads” which each sparkling spring and gorgeous
                    summer calls into fleeting but constantly renewed existence. In addition to the
                    more attainable nature of this popular pursuit, some bota nical knowledge is
                    also regarded as a requisite branch of medical education; and although a tin box
                    and a microscope do not constitute a man of science, still the subject derives
                    advantage from that general though it may be superficial culture. But in
                    Entomology every thing exists in a different order of relation. No “trivial fond
                    regards” come in aid of the impaler of insects; and even the creatures
                    themselves are too often regarded with such abhorrence, that one feels the more
                    inclined to admire how those who endeavour to hand them down to an ungrateful
                    posterity, should themselves be accused of cruelty.</p>
                <p>The time however is surely gone by when an apologetical defence of the study
                    might be required, or in which the works of Omnipotence were regarded as
                    important in proportion either to their magnitude or immediate subservience to
                    the human race ;—and although we desire not to fall into an opposite error by
                    maintaining the greater beauty and excellence of the more minutely elaborated
                    designs of the Creator, we yet feel that they are fully more calculated to
                    awaken our wonder and admiration. It would be easy to say that the richest and
                    most elegant apparel which adorns the human race is the product of a
                    caterpillar; that the blistering medicines so essential to the practice of the
                    sanitory art are compounded from a beetle; that honey and wax, so valuable as
                    articles of domestic economy, are derived from the glad labours of a
                    hymenopterous fly; and that even that splendid and regal dye the “Tyrian purple”
                    of ancient days, supposed to have been obtained from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Purpura</hi><hi rend="italic">patula,</hi> a shell-fish of the Mediterranean,
                    is superseded by the tinctorial uses of the cochineal, a small and obscure
                    insect, which nevertheless the skill of the chemist has rendered indispensable
                    even to the garment of kings. But in truth far higher and more delightful
                    results ensue from these researches, than can ever be named in the “cui bono”
                    catalogue of a mere economist; for whatever tends to elevate the mind of youth
                    above the grosser pleasures of sense, or even occasionally to disconnect our
                    maturer years from the more turbulent occupations and harassing cares which life
                    is heir to, assuredly carries along with it its own reward. We doubt not that a
                    more sedulous and frequent attention to natural history would in active minds
                    pre-occupy the place which is otherwise in after years too often devoted to more
                    perilous courses. Even the pursuits of literature are often vague and
                    objectless, and not unfrequently engender a sickly sentimentalism, or other
                    morbid affection in nowise akin to genius. But the objects which attract the
                    attention of the naturalist are not the melancholy creations of the human
                    intellect, which present so often but a lurid brightness, or a dim eclipse, in
                    which noble thoughts are obscured by the “darkening scales” of vice or folly.
                    They are the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Him</hi> w ho cannot err, and who has
                    doubtless not only peopled the teeming earth and the translucent waters of the
                    “great deep” with all their innumerable and varied wonders, for a wise and
                    beneficent purpose, of which our instruction and amusement form at least ą
                    portion, but has, by the implantation of that strong instinctive love of nature
                    which all ingenuous minds possess, demonstrated his desire that we should
                    ennoble our humanity by magnifying his manifold works, the “wondrous works of
                    him that is perfect in knowledge.”</p>
                <p>While the beautiful simplicity and regular order observable in those phenomena
                    which proceed under the superintendence of omnipotence, commonly called the
                    operations <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746051?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-6051-0061"/> of nature, are well adapted to the comprehension
                    of understandings laying no claim to the highest order, the more complex
                    relations of the subject present a vast field for speculative or theoretical
                    exercise,· sufficient to occupy the faculties of the most powerful minds. It is
                    thus that, in its totality, the subject of natural history holds out to each
                    capacity the allurement of an occupation suited to every gradation of
                    intellectual power; for while in its mysterious interconnection with other
                    branches of natural science, as well as in its own peculiar complexities, it
                    cannot be effectively grasped by mere human understanding, its manifold minor
                    features may be scanned with intelligence by whoever desires so to do.</p>
                <p>If indeed the value of a pursuit is to be estimated by the comparative ease with
                    which it may be followed by persons of the most moderate fortunes, few can rank
                    higher than Entomology. While the specimens sought for by the mineralogist and
                    student of geology are frequently heavy and cumbrous, and not seldom extremely
                    expensive, and while that sad representative of the beauties of the living
                    Flora, called a <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi rend="italic">Siccus,</hi> is
                    but a frail and fleeting memorial of the “days of other years,” presenting, even
                    after a tedious and troublesome process of preservation (by courtesy so called),
                    no trace of their original brightness, the most exquisite examples of
                    entomological beauty, if not too roughly handled at the period of their capture,
                    remain, with the most ordinary attention, for a lifetime in their pristine
                    state,—and what that state actually is, all may satisfy themselves in the course
                    even of the most superficial examination,—</p>
                <p>For nature here</p>
                <p>Wantons as in her prime, and plays at will Her virgin fancies.</p>
                <p>Exceeding in amount of species all the other subjects of zoology,—unrivalled in
                    the dazzling brilliancy of their colours, which combine the clearness and
                    decision of tint possessed by flowers, with the exquisitely varied markings of
                    the feathered race, and the metallic splendour of the mineral kingdom,—surpassed
                    by no other work of creation in the wonderful structure of their parts, and
                    certainly surpassing all in the adaptation of that structure to the perfect
                    fulfilment of those natural though to us still mysterious instincts, which in
                    every age have excited the admiration of mankind,—is it to be wondered at that
                    the study of insects should occupy a prominent place in our pursuit of
                    knowledge? Much more do we wonder that thousands of the best educated, and in
                    other respects most enlightened minds, should still feel averse to a study which
                    unfolds such a world of unseen wonders.</p>
                <p>The subject, too, is literally inexhaustible; and while some who love to
                    methodize, and thereby to circumscribe, the subjects of human knowledge, or who
                    err in their estimate of the perceptive powers of the human mind as applied to
                    other matters of enquiry, may be deterred by the vague boundaries of such a
                    field, a greater number, and with more propriety it is hoped, may be induced to
                    enter it, from the very consideration of such a rich and unreaped harvest. While
                    a fragment of inert matter, which chemical analysis determines to differ in its
                    constituent proportions from other fragments previously examined, is once in a
                    lustre dignified by the name of a new <hi rend="italic">species,</hi> and the
                    name of a Haiiy or a Dolomieu is bestowed on the unconscious mass,—and while,
                    even in the richer domain of British botany, the student of that science,
                    however much he may extend our knowledge of the localities of plants, labours
                    with but a feeble chance of adding to the actual list even of indigenous
                    species, and ha⅜ probably no chance at all of ever refreshing his eyes with the
                    sight of a plant which nobody ever saw before,—it is far otherwise with the
                    innumerable tribes of insect life. The “gilded summer flies” are numerous as
                    leaves in Vallumbrosa. No recess of the forest so obscure but there the “winged
                    messengers” are seen to sport and play; and each summer sunbeam falls not alone
                    on the dewy herbage of the open glades, but lights up the gorgeous hues of those
                    bright creatures which a mystical philosophy has ennobled as the types of the
                    disencumbered human soul, and which even the sombre Dante has named <hi
                    rend="italic">angelical.</hi></p>
                <p>Non v’accorgete voi, ehe noi siam vermi Nati a formar ľangelica farfalla.</p>
                <p>Every pool of water is pregnant with life; each lonely moor or old deserted
                    quarry, which scarcely “feels in its barrenness one touch of spring,” is the
                    chosen abode of thousands of living creatures, of small dimensions it is true,
                    but of singular beauty both of form and structure, and often adorned with
                    hues,</p>
                <p>Which make the rose’s blush of beauty pale, And dim the rich geranium’s scarlet
                    blaze.</p>
                <p>Even the pastoral melancholy of the green mountains is enlivened by the
                    occurrence of many interesting species. One of the most beautiful of European
                    coleopterous insects <hi rend="italic">{Carabus nitens)</hi> occurs among the
                    peat <hi rend="italic">hags,</hi> and other places where heath and turf abound,
                    and where its sparkling coat of gold and green, tinged with a brighter lustre
                    than that of rubies, is singularly contrasted with the blackness of the soil in
                    which it seems imbedded. The desolate and cloud-piercing summits of the highest
                    hills produce several species, which are the more highly prized from their
                    scarcity, and the difficulties with which they are obtained.<note

                    confined to the species of a district. Of course the collector of foreign
                    insects labours under some disadvantage, from the more multifarious nature of
                    his subjects, their larger size, higher price, and more scattered localities.
                    But the home collector, especially of the Coleoptera, is more favourably
                    situated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>A glazed frame
                    or drawer, lined with cork, and capable of containing many hundred species, may

                    may be amply illustrated w ithin the bounds of a cabinet of a few feet square,
                    and the most ordinary attention and regularity suffice for its preservation.
                    Most districts produce species which are comparatively rare in other quarters,
                    and thus by means of interchanges nume-. rous additions may be made from time to
                    time: so that with a moderate share of assiduity and perseverance, a large
                    collection may be amassed with little or no pecuniary outlay. In these and many
                    other pleasant particulars, on which wc need not here dilate, Entomology
                    possesses advantages over all the kindred branches of natural history. Wc shall

                <p>CHAPTER II.</p>
                <p>THE EXTERNAL ANATOMY OF INSECTS.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of the manners of these creatures presents us with few general
                    results, and this is scarcely to be wondered<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=72" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0072-0062"/>
                    at, when we consider with how small a number we have any accurate acquaintance.
                    It may even be doubted whether we are completely informed of the history of any
                    one species within the entire range of Entomology. Of some we know the perfect
                    state, but have never seen the larva; of others the larvae are well known, but
                    the perfect insect remains in obscurity, so that when we consider the numerous
                    changes which these creatures undergo, from their first hatching to their final
                    metamorphosis, we need scarcely wonder that even the most familiar species
                    present points in their history, which it is by no means easy to unravel.</p>
                <p>It is otherwise however with the classification of insects, which, depending
                    mainly on an attentive examination of external characters, is so far independent
                    alike of anatomical investigation and the study of manners, although these, when
                    ascertained, form of course the truest test by which to appreciate the
                    difference between a natural and an artificial system.</p>
                <p>The period is comparatively recent during which the internal structure ofinsects
                    began to be regarded as a subject of interest. Their external characters were
                    the first to attract attention; and as a communicable knowledge of these was
                    necessary for all the practical purposes of classification, as well as to
                    establish the means of mutual understanding among naturalists, it is well that
                    that branch has been rendered so complete and satisfactory. In former times,
                    whatever facts of interest might have been ascertained, were too often but of
                    slight avail, in consequence of our vague knowledge of the species to which they
                    applied. But the most ordinary attention on the part of the anatomist, to the
                    systematic works of modern times, will now suffice to inform him of the place
                    which his subject occupies in the scale of nature; and hence the importance, not
                    seldom overlooked by the physiologist, of even the minutest external characters,
                    when accurately ascertained and clearly described. It has indeed been stated as
                    a truism, that whoever attempts to deduce the real affinities of the animal
                    kingdom from a consideration of the external characters alone, will in most
                    cases mislead both himself and others.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wilson's <hi rend="italic">Illustrations of Zoology,</hi>
                    vol. i. pref. p. 4.</p></note> But it must also be admitted, that comparative
                    anatomists have too frequently an idea that nothing is or can be of importance
                    which extends beyond the sphere of their own exertions. They forget that the
                    general form and covering, and, in short, the whole of the external characters,
                    however they may labour under the misfortune of being obvious to a common
                    observer, are just as much a part of an animal’s organic constitution, as the
                    nerves, viscera, muscles, blood-vessels, and bones, or whatever else is most
                    mysterious and recondite; and that, in fact, without a precise knowledge of the
                    former, the information conveyed by the latter would be uncertain, or of no
                    avail. The chief advantage of the internal structure is, that it is less liable
                    to variation from the influence ot local or accidental circumstances: its chief
                    disadvantage results from the difficulty of its ascertainment, and the
                    contrariety of opinion which exists among physiologists regarding the uses of
                    the organs, even after their conformation has been ascertained. A mere knowledge
                    of external character is perhaps nearly as usefid as an acquaintance, however
                    intimate, with anatomical structure, when nothing is either known or sought for
                    respecting the external appearance, as a necessary guide to the higher knowledge
                    of animal instincts and modes of life, the uses of living creatures in the
                    general economy of nature, their exquisite adaptation to the circumstances under
                    which they are placed, their distribution over the earth’s surface, and other
                    points of philosophical investigation. The mere anatomist may smile at the mere
                    collector of shells and butterflies; and with just as much propriety may the
                    mere naturalist or virtuoso smile in return at him who, knowing, or supposing
                    that he knows, every convolution of a viscus, or ramification of an artery, is
                    yet unable to recognise, amid the perplexιngly multiplied varieties which may be
                    presented to him, the precise animal which has been the subject of so much
                    anxious and careful investigation. But when anatomy and natural history go hand
                    in hand, the obscure labyrinth of nature, so far as human capacity can
                    penetrate, receives its noblest illumination.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the meritorious labours of Swammerdam, Malpighi, Reaumur, and
                    Lyonnet, who were the first greatly to signalise themselves in the difficult
                    field of insect anatomy; in spite of the more recent and scarcely less
                    successfill exertions of Cuvier, Comparettι, Ramdohr, Treviranus, Gaede,
                    Sprengel, Savigny, Marcel de Serres, Geoffroy St Hilaire, Carus, Meckel,
                    Audouin, and Dufour (to make no mention of many others who yet deserve to be
                    held in remembrance),—such is the immense extent and variety of this wonderful
                    class of beings, that we fall infinitely short of possessing any thing like a
                    general or completed knowledge of their structure. In this paucity of
                    well-established facts under which we labour, it would indeed be unphilosophical
                    to attempt the induction of general rules; and all that we shall here attempt
                    shall be to record such observations as seem likely to bear substantially upon
                    the subject, and to have formed an actual advance in our knowledge of the
                    anatomy and physiology of insects.</p>
                <p>The study of the interior structure of these creatures does not at first sight
                    hold out the promise of much that is either interesting or useful. The enormous
                    distance which seems to separate all ιnvertebrated animals from man, and even
                    from the lower mammiferous and other vertebrated tribes, has induced the belief
                    that no practical results can ever spring from such a source. But the
                    philosophical observer, who knows how important is frequently the connection
                    between the greatest and the least of things, and how, like the thread of
                    Ariadne, the tracing of a slender chain may lead to unforeseen conclusions of
                    the highest value, will not despise the lights which a better knowledge even of
                    insect anatomy may be one day destined to throw upon some of the many still
                    obscure points in the physiology of man. The observations of Μ. Dufour and
                    others have already shown us what an admirable simplicity presides in these
                    despised tribes over the exercise of those most important functions, which in
                    red-blooded animals require such a complicated organic structure as to be almost
                    incomprehensible. But as we descend in the scale of nature, we see more clearly
                    the distinction between what is necessary, or merely accessory or superfluous,
                    and thus by degrees we may attain to a knowledge of the essential characters of
                    things.</p>
                <p>Even in its more superficial bearings on natural history, the dissection of
                    insects is necessary to ascertain several disputed points regarding the sexual
                    distinctions of species, and to verify our views of the structure of the organs
                    of the mouth, the antennae, tarsi, and other external parts, on which our
                    establishment of tribes and genera mainly depends. When it is desired to dissect
                    an insect, it ought to be placed on a piece of cork, immersed in pure water; and
                    the various parts, as they float in the liquid, may be fixed in their most
                    appropriate position by means of needles. With a view to prevent deception from
                    any alteration in the relative position of the internal organs, it is desirable
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=73"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0073-0063"/> to fix the insect in its natural horizontal
                    posture, and to • commence the dissection from the dorsal region downwards.</p>
                <p>The following observations on the dissection of the minuter animals may be of
                    service to the student. “The first thing that I have to observe is, that all
                    dissections of small and soft objecte, <hi rend="italic">e.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">g.</hi> worms, zoophytes, insecte, mollusca, &amp;c. where it is
                    desirable to obtain even tolerably accurate results, should be performed <hi
                    rend="italic">under water,</hi> by which the parte are kept floating and
                    separated from each other, and consequently present themselves more distinctly.
                    A very simple contrivance for investigations of this kind may be prepared in the
                    following manner: A mass of tough wax (not too soft) is to be laid upon one or
                    more porcelain saucers or capsules of different sizes, which are then to be put
                    in a warm place until the wax melts so as to cover the surface evenly to the
                    depth of a half or a third of an inch. If the object to be examined be laid upon
                    this surface, it may be fixed by needles in any position that is wished; and,
                    when covered with clear water, developed and dissected by means of suitable
                    instruments. Of these, the best are very delicate forceps; pointed, well made,
                    sharpcutting scissars; and small knives like cataract needles, some round,
                    others with cutting edges, and fixed in slender wooden handles. For separating
                    parte I have also employed small horn probes and fine brushes; whilst for
                    examining them a good magnifying glass is frequently indispensable. If it is
                    wished to preserve a preparation thus made, wax coloured at pleasure, as for the
                    purpose of injections, is to be formed into little tablets about a quarter of an
                    inch thick; one of them is then to be placed upon the saucer or capsule
                    containing the preparation; the latter may then be transferred to it, arranged
                    suitably upon it, fixed there by means of short needles, and both together
                    placed in alcohol. Nor must I forget to mention, that the examination of very
                    delicate organizations may frequently be conducted with greater facility and
                    accuracy, if the object be previously allowed to remain some time in spirit, and
                    thereby to become harder and contracted. This applies particularly to the
                    dissection of nervous organs, and to the examination of very small embryos, of
                    mollusca, and worms. There are various ways of destroying worms, insects,
                    &amp;c. for the purpose of dissecting, without injuring their organization.
                    Mollusca, snails for example, as Swammerdam has remarked, are to be allowed to
                    die in water, because by that means their body swells, and all the parts become
                    more distinctly visible; they may afterw ards be kept in spirit (though not too
                    long) for dissection. Worms, the larger zoophytes (for the smaller must be
                    examined whilst alive), caterpillars, &amp;c. are best destroyed by means of
                    spirit; insects, on the contrary, by being dipped rapidly in boiling water, or
                    in oil of turpentine.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>SECT. I. THE EXTERNAL COVERING OF INSECTS.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of die structure and anatomy of this class may be said to be still
                    in its infancy; for although many important facte have been legitimately
                    generalized, we are still in ignorance of the formation of a thousand species
                    for every one which has been examined. As the harder parts of insects, to which
                    the muscles are attached, are superficial, the class has been described as
                    bearing their ske-etons externally; and a transcendental anatomy has not
                    scrupled to determine the exact analogy which each portion of their covering
                    bears to the bony frame-work of the vertebrated tribes. This comparison has been
                    instituted by Μ. Geoffroy St Hilaire, an eminent physiological naturalist of
                    France, who maintains, with many of his countrymen, that all animals are
                    vertebrated. The doctrine, whatever may be its other merits, is not entitled to
                    the credit of novelty, as an English writer of the name of Willis had, so far
                    back as the year 1692, published his opinion that the external envelope of the
                    body of insects represented the internal articulated column of the vertebrated
                    tribes. Μ. de Blainville, on the other hand, regards the corneous covering of
                    insects rather as analogous to the skin or cutaneous system of the higher
                    classes.</p>
                <p>The hardness of the calcareous or homy envelope of the greater number of insects
                    is owing, in Latreille's opinion, to the consistence of the excretion interposed
                    between the dermis and the epidermis, or what is termed in man the <hi
                    rend="italic">mucous tissue.</hi> This excretion also contains the brilliant and
                    varied colours which add so greatly to the beauty of the class.<note

                    Animal,</hi> t. iv. p. 2.</p></note> According to Μ. Odιer, who has attentively
                    examined the composition of the harder parts of insects, the substance of this
                    envelope is of a peculiar nature. He has named it <hi rend="italic"
                    >chitine.</hi> He observes that the phosphate of hme forms the great proportion
                    of all the salts contained in the teguments of insects, while that ingredient is
                    but trifling in the covering of the Crustacea, although the latter abounds in
                    the carbonate, which is not found in the other class.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mem. de la Soc. d'Hist.
                    Nat.</hi> t. 1. p. 29.</p></note> The facte stated by him militate against the
                    analogies attempted to be established on the subject; and the observations of Μ.
                    Straus go far to demonstrate that those teguments do not form a true skeleton,
                    but really represent the skin of the vertebrated classes. When we use the word
                    skeleton, then, in relation to insects, the reader will understand its
                    application merely to the external covering.</p>
                <p>On analysing the elytra of the cockchafer, Μ. Odier ascertained the existence, l
                    <hi rend="italic">st</hi>, of albumen; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> of an
                    extractive matter, soluble in water; <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> of a
                    brown-coloured animal substance, soluble in potass and insoluble in alcohol; 4
                    <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> of a coloured oil, soluble in alcohol; 5 <hi
                    rend="italic">th,</hi> of three salts, viz. subcarbonate of potass, phosphate of
                    lime, and phosphate of iron; 6 <hi rend="italic">th,</hi> of a peculiar
                    substance which constitutes a fourth part in weight of the elytron. Albumen is
                    so generally distributed among the animal organs that its presence was to be
                    expected. But the oil is deserving of further experimental observation. Robiquet
                    found it of a green colour in cantharides; while, according to Odιer, it is
                    brown in the cockchafer, and red in a species of crioceris. Now as each of these
                    insects is itself of a corresponding hue, it is natural to suppose that the oil
                    is the colouring matter. 1 he peculiar substance which forms so large a
                    proportion of the elytra is named <hi rend="italic">chitine</hi> by Μ. Odιer. If
                    we plunge a coleopterous insect into a solution of potassium, and keep up a
                    pretty high temperature, we shall observe that the so-called skeleton neither
                    dissolves nor changes its form; it merely becomes discoloured during the
                    operation, while all the viscera and interior muscles disappear; and whatever
                    remains of the insect is <hi rend="italic">chitine.</hi> This substance exists
                    in the whole of the envelope, and is also found to occur in the more solid
                    covering of the Crustacea.</p>
                <p>If however we compare the preceding results with those obtained by Μ. Chevreul in
                    the course of his experiments on crustaceous animals, we shall perceive some
                    remarkable distinctions in the constitution of their harder parts. The presence
                    of subcarbonate of potass is a sinking character among insects. It does not
                    occur in the class Crustacea. The phosphate of lime, a sparing ingredient among
                    the latter, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746090?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-6090-0064"/> forms a preponderating part of the salts in the
                    envelope of insects, while the carbonate of lime is absent, although it forms
                    the base of the carapace or covering of crabs and lobsters. It has been stated
                    as a regulating law in animal chemistry, that the bones of the higher orders
                    have more of the phosphate and less of the carbonate of lime in their
                    composition, while the proportions were reversed among the inferior tribes. But
                    the observations of Μ. Odier show the inadequacy of chemical character to serve
                    as a basis on which to found our analogies of organization; for if strictly
                    applied to insects, that class must be removed from the place which they now
                    occupy in our system, and be combined with others of a higher nature, with which
                    in truth they have no’connection.</p>
                <p>The harder and more solid parts of insects are certainly to thém what the
                    internal skeleton is to the vertebrated tribes. They form the support and
                    frame-wörk of the body. It is on this account that the <hi rend="italic">term
                    skeleton,</hi> though not Strictly applicable, has been used, both in ancient
                    and modern times, to designate the <hi rend="italic">corneous external
                    system</hi> of these creatures. This comparatively solid system is itself formed
                    by the union of many parts, which however have received no general name; so
                    that, while in discussing the vertebrated tribes we merely say that their
                    skeleton is formed of bone, all that we advance in regard to insects is, that it
                    is eomposed of pieces. In the higher tribes each individual bone is well known
                    by its own distinctive name; but the insect tribes in that respect have been but
                    obscurely defined. Guided by the light of human anatomy, observers have sought
                    to discover in insects all those parts to which they could apply previously
                    established names; but analogies based upon mere appearance are incapable of
                    great or useful extension; and insects would certainly have been better known
                    had they been studied in the first place individually, and no farfetched
                    comparisons instituted till after a more ample knowledge of actual organization.
                    But instead of this, the best determined functions of the superior animals have
                    been assumed as points of departure, and all the parts of insects which <hi
                    rend="italic">seemed</hi> to fulfil the same purposes have been deter-τninately
                    regarded as analogous. Now it is quite admissible to say, that in insects, as
                    among the vertebrated tribes, there is progression, vision, manducation, &amp;c.
                    because these are the attributes, more or less general, of all living beings;
                    but it has not always been demonstrated that particular and more special
                    functions are always performed by the same or apparently corresponding parts. Μ.
                    Dufour, how- ’ ever, has announced the following results in relation to the
                    ^articulated animals themselves: Isí, that the skeleton of the Crustacea and
                    Arachnides (two important classes already described in this work) does not
                    differ from that of insects except by the mode of growth of the rings of which
                    it is composed; 2&lt;7, that those two classes of animals ∙ and insects
                    themselves do not differ among each other, but by the greater or less extent in
                    the development of the parts of which they are composed. , ∙.∙ «</p>
                <p>í. The same may be asserted in regard to the disparities observable’between the
                    different conditions of insects in the larva,- the chrysalis, and the perfect
                    state. The various forms under which the same species is exhibited, and the
                    singular and sometimes sudden transformations to which at is subjected,
                    are'found to result, when analysed, from the growth of parts. &gt; This has been
                    demonstrated by the writings of Swammerdam and other modern writers on the
                    anatomy of caterpillars, as well as by the beautiful and more recent
                    observations of Savigny on the mouths of Lcpîdop- -tera in the-perfect state,
                    compared with the same parts in their, earliest .condition.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mémoires sur les Animaux
                    sans Vertèbres.</hi></p></note> The observation &lt; is particularly applicable
                    to the solid parts of insects. In the larva each segment exists under a nearly
                    uniform development, while in the perfect state several of these segments have
                    acquired a prodigious increase. This is the cause of the vast difference in
                    their exterior envelope at different periods of their existence. The nymph or
                    chrysalis is in the intermediate condition, and is formed, like the larva, of
                    simple rings, which, however, no longer exhibit an equal degree of uniformity.
                    But the perfect insect is the final term of transformation. Considered in a
                    general way, its covering does not essentially differ from that of the larva;
                    but the three segments next the head have acquired a great increase of bulk, to
                    enable them to support the appendages of legs and wings, which were merely
                    rudimentary, or scarcely existent, in its first condition; and the distinction
                    of head, thorax, and abdomen becoming strongly visible, the entire aspect of the
                    insect has undergone a change.</p>
                <p>It is highly interesting to observe the influence which the decrease or
                    development of one portion of structure exercises upon another; in other words,
                    the constant and intimate relation of the proportion of parts. The maximum of
                    increase in the metathorax is always in relation to the rudimentary state of the
                    mesothorax, while, on the contrary, the development of the latter produces or
                    accompanies the decrease of the former. Thus also the parts of the mouth, as
                    demonstrated by Μ. Savigny, are sometimes free, and capable of varied movement,
                    for the purposes of mastication; while in several tribes they are brought close
                    together, lengthened, and as it were amalgamated in the form of trunk or sucker;
                    and so the segments of the thorax, in the different orders, more or less
                    disunited among themselves, support the wings, the balancers, the elytra,
                    according to the various kinds. From these and similar considerations have been
                    deduced the conclusion that the increase of one portion exercises over the
                    neighbouring portions a peculiar influence, which explains whatever differences
                    may be remarked in the individuals of each order, family, and genus. And this
                    general consequence, which results from numerous observations, necessarily
                    includes and accounts for that incoherent series of anomalies so puzzling to the
                    superficial inquirer, but which are only regarded as such, because the labourers
                    in the field of anatomy have but seldom taken into their consideration the
                    totality of the articulated animals, and have more seldom still thought fit to
                    occupy themselves in a careful comparative analysis of the parts which enter
                    into the composition of • the external skeleton of these despised tribes.</p>
                <p>We shall here briefly consider the essential characters of the so-called skeleton
                    among the articulated tribes. It is composed of segments, which are themselves
                    formed by a determinate number of pieces; but their most obvious character is,
                    that they are provided with a pair of feet, and with two openings to the
                    respiratory organs. But along with such segments as present these parts, we may
                    usually observe many others which are not so provided, or at least in which the
                    feet are wanting; and they may either differ in their siże and proportions, or
                    closely resemblé each other in those respects. In the latter case, the most
                    simple form is exhibited; and if we ascertain the Composition of a single
                    segment, and their amount, we have a knowledge of the entire animal. This
                    simplicity of form, however, is -not often observable; for it more frequently
                    happens that the same individual présents great disparity in the size and
                    composition of its segřnėnts, and in the appendages with Which they are
                    furnished. w; « -</p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-6103-0065"/>, according to Μ. Dufour, one of the most simple
                    forms of the articulated classes, in as far as they present the greatest
                    uniformity of character in the parts of which they are composed. Even in them,
                    however, we may observe, at the anterior portion, some pairs of feet, which are
                    rudimentary, and crowded together towards the heħd; so that it would be possible
                    to figûre an animal still more uniformly composed, by supposing that the fect
                    thus thrown together had been developed uniformly with the appendages of the
                    ensuing segments. We should then have had to recognise merely a head, and a
                    certain number of rings, all of a like nature. But it might be possible still
                    further to reduce and simplify the proposition, by regarding the head itself as
                    an assemblage or union of segments, bearing appendages merely analogous to the
                    feet. Thus, to realize the supposition of a skeleton uniformly constructed
                    throughout all its parts, nothing more would be necessary than to give to the
                    segments of the head a development equal to that of the others, and to restore
                    to its appendages (the feet) their essential usage, that of locomotion, instead
                    of the secondary usage to which they had been subjected. This view has been
                    presented in order to exhibit what has been regarded as the fundamental plan of
                    insect formation; for it is in truth the corresponding or unequal increase of
                    the segments, the union or division of the pieces of which they are composed,
                    the maximum of development in some, the rudimentary condition of others, that
                    form the agreements or differences of character in the entire series of
                    articulated animals.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Ann. des Sciences Nat.</hi> t. i. p. 115.</p></note> If the
                    development is uniform, or nearly so, in each segment, we have the condition of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Annelides,</hi> of <hi rend="italic">worms,</hi> and of
                    the <hi rend="italic">larvae</hi> of insects. If, on the contrary, this
                    equilibrium is destroyed, and the maximum of increase takes place in the first,
                    second, and third segments ensuing the head, we have the form and character of a

                <p>The importance of studying the skeleton of insects is greater than even among the
                    higher classes, because, being essential, it forms a genuine basis, and being at
                    the same time external, it offers to the eye of the zoologist a ready mode of
                    determination.</p>
                <p>While engaged in the consideration of the various organs of insects, a numerous
                    list of disparities in structure might no doubt be collected, and the term <hi
                    rend="italic">anomaly,</hi> according to its frequent but by no means
                    philosophical application, brought into constant use. That fatal word, however,
                    has been too often substituted in place of an explicit interpretation of
                    phenomena not in any way difficult of solution, certain general principles being
                    kept in view. Of these, one of the most importance is, that all the differences
                    exhibited by insects, and all the so-ealled anomalous organs which they present,
                    are the result of a greater or less development of certain parts existing
                    generally throughout the entire class.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hid.</hi> p. 102.</p></note> The
                    contrariety of opinion among naturalists regarding the existence or proportion
                    of certain parts of structure, has arisen partly from a discordance in the use
                    of terms, and partly from the organs themselves not being submitted to a careful
                    analytical investigation. It is thus, for example, that the names of <hi
                    rend="italic">sternum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scutellum,</hi> in place of
                    being bestowed on portions of which the contours have been precisely determined,
                    have only been applied when these portions happened to exhibit certain
                    accidental and conventional characters. By this means we read in almost every
                    page of classification, that one insect possesses a scutellum and that another
                    does not; or that a particular genus is characterized by its existence, and
                    another by its absence; while the fact is, that these partsexist in all insects,
                    although the names in their usual application have been bestowed only upon
                    peculiar and not very important variations in <hi rend="italic"

                <p>SECT. II. THE EXTERNAL CHARACTERS OF THE PRINCIPAL</p>
                <p>SEGMENTS OF AN INSECT’S BODY, VIZ. THE HEAD, THORAX, AND ABDOMEN.</p>
                <p>The form of the external covering of insects, even of the same species, differs
                    greatly according to the existing condition of the individual. The segments of
                    which the bodies of larvae are composed are generally of a uniform size when
                    compared with each other, and the singular phenomena presented by metamorphosis
                    consist chiefly in the greater development assumed by certain segments than by
                    others. The nymph (called chrysalis among the Lepidoptera) exhibits the
                    intermediate or transitionary state. Its segments are unequally developed, and
                    this inequality is greatly increased on the assumption of the final state, in
                    which certain segments are prodigiously enlarged, while others suffer a
                    corresponding diminution. In the imago, or complete condition, the three
                    segments next the head undergo the most notable alteration; for, besides their
                    increase of bulk, they become furnished with wings and articulated legs, which
                    had previously existed in a very rudimentary condition. In that state also the
                    relative proportions of the segments are so changed that the identity of several
                    becomes difficult to recognise, and the most obvious divisions henceforth
                    consist of <hi rend="italic">head, thorax,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >abdomen.</hi> These parts are severally characterized by peculiar attributes,
                    the nature of which we shall now endeavour to explain.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">head</hi> is by far the most complicated portion, and it is
                    necessary that its structure should be well understood, as it furnishes the most
                    important characters on which modern genera are founded or made known. The parts
                    most deserving of attention are the <hi rend="italic">mouth, antennoe,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">eyes.</hi></p>
                <p>The organs of the mouth present in their different combinations a great variety
                    of form among the articulated classes. In relation to all such animals as are
                    provided with a head, more particularly the vertebrated tribes, the term mouth
                    is never of ambiguous application, but refers to those parts which are placed
                    exteriorly at the entrance of the intestinal canal, and effect the process of
                    mastication; but in regard to the acephalous or nearly headless tribes, sueh as
                    annelides, worms, and the radiated animals, its application is less definite and
                    precise. Among the great series of living beings included by Linnaeus in the
                    class of insects, all of which are furnished with a head, the parts of the mouth
                    are no longer doubtful. It has been remarked, however, that the sucker of the
                    larvae. in the last family of the dipterous order being entirely interior when
                    not in use <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> presents a singular approximation in
                    that particular to the intestinal worms.</p>
                <p>It will be readily conceived that the mouth of insects must be adapted to the
                    particular manners of life peculiar to each natural group, and must therefore
                    vary in accordance with their instinctive habits. It was thus that even the
                    earliest naturalists perceived and expressed the distinction between insects
                    provided with teeth or cutting jaws, and those furnished with trunks or suckers.
                    The use of the microscope in modern times, and the deep desire which prevailed
                    towards the conclusion of the seventeenth and commencement of the eighteenth
                    centuries, to illustrate the mysteries of animal organization, produced much
                    more detailed and exact accounts of the parts of the mouth in insects than were
                    previously possessed. The works of Leeuwenhoeck<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=76" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0076-0066"/>,
                    Swammerdam, and Réaumur are mines of information; while Scopoh and Degeer still
                    further generalized the observations of these illustrious naturalists. Scopoli,
                    we believe, was the first to apply the knowledge of these parts in
                    characterizing the genera of the hymenopterous and dipterous orders; but it is
                    to a celebrated disciple of Linnaeus, John Christian Fabncius, that we owe the
                    first general theory of the parts of manducation, and its application to
                    entomology in general.</p>
                <p>The alimentary substances sought for by insects are either comparatively hard and
                    solid, or of a more soft and fluid nature. Thence we find upon examination
                    numerous tribes of insects provided with a mouth so constructed as to tear and
                    masticate the substances on which it is designed to act; while many others are
                    characterized by a tube-hke mouth, or one resembling a delicate tongue extended
                    when m action, and spirally rolled upon itself when in repose. Hence the great
                    primary distinctions among the orders of insects, and their recognised division
                    into masticators <hi rend="italic">(mandιbulata)</hi> and suckers (<hi
                    rend="italic">haustellata),</hi> the former living on solid substances, the
                    latter on such as are fluid. Whatever may be the structure of the mouth in
                    insects, it is to one or other of those types of form that each must be
                    referred. We are indebted to the beautiful researches of Savigny (1814) for the
                    first accurate analysis and elucidation of these parts, and of their
                    relationship throughout the articulated tribes. Latreille, however, had
                    previously instituted a slighter comparison between the mouths of the suctorial
                    and mandibulated tribes, as Lamarck has admitted in his report on Savigny’s
                    work.</p>
                <p>Savigny divides insects formerly so named into two groups, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hexapodes,</hi> or such as have six feet, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >apιropodes,</hi> or such as possess a greater number. The mouth of the latter
                    forms two proper types distinct from those of the former; but it is with the
                    polymorphous hexapodes, or such as undergo transformations, that is, insects
                    properly so called, that we are now concerned. We shall first consider the parts
                    of the mouth in the masticating tribes. They are essentially as follows: The <hi
                    rend="italic">labrum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">mandibles,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">maxilla·,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">palpi,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">labium,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">mentum,</hi> the two
                    latter, according to the views of different observers, sometimes passing under
                    one and the same name. The reader may here consult Plate CCXX. fig. 1, <hi
                    rend="italic">a, b, c, d.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">a</hi>the labrum, surmounted by its broad

                    with its two palpi and broad basal portion or mentum.</p></note></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">labrum</hi> or upper hp (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a)</hi>
                    is a flattened somewhat deflexed portion, consisting of a single piece,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the female of a small, bee
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">∕Ialictι,,</hi> it is said to be furnished with a
                    slender appendage.</p></note> placed on the upper side of or above the mouth,
                    and capable of moving upwards and downwards, or vertically. It is variable in
                    form, but is usually somewhat square, often wider than long, and frequently
                    notched or bifid. It is of a horny consistence, sometimes coriaceous, or even
                    approaching to what may be named membranous in certain tribes, and is attached
                    to the anterior portion of the head by a very short articulation.</p>
                <p>The mandibles or upper jaws <hi rend="italic">(mandibula,</hi> fig. 1, <hi
                    rend="italic">bb)</hi> are two strong horny pieces, generally of a triangular
                    form, more or less curved, convex externally, concave on their inner surfaces,
                    and frequently toothed or serrated on their interior edge. They are placed on
                    each side of the mouth by insertion on the sides of the head, immediately
                    beneath the labrum or upper lip, which usually covers their base. They are each
                    composed of a single piece of a hard consistence, and may be said to correspond
                    to the jaws of the vertebrated tribes, the process of mastication being
                    principally performed by them. They differ, however, m this respect, that their
                    motion, instead of being vertical, is horizontal, or from within outwards, and
                    <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> They vary greatly both in their actual size
                    and relative dimensions, being small and slender in the glow-worm <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lampyris),</hi> and very large, projecting, and antler-like in
                    the stag beetle <hi rend="italic">{Lucanus cervus),</hi> the specieswhich we
                    have selected for our engraved illustration. These internal surfaces are
                    frequently parallel, but their dentations are not always the same in each, the
                    projections of the one being however frequently so arranged as to enter the
                    concavities of the other in order to admit of their closer union. But this is
                    not seldom prevented by the curvature of the tips; and in several instances,
                    where the mouth is wide, and the mandibles rather remote from each other at the
                    base, the blades cross each other a little beyond the centre. The dentations of
                    the mandibles, though sometimes called teeth, are merely projecting parts,
                    although in the orthopterous tribes a coriaceous lamina seems in some respect to
                    distinguish them from the body of the mandible to which they are attached, thus
                    exhibiting an approach to that mode of fixture called <hi rend="italic"
                    >gomphosis,</hi> in which one bone is fixed within another, as in the teeth of
                    the higher tribes. The mandibles are more variable in their forms than the
                    maxillae, and may occasionally be observed to differ (as in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Lucanus)</hi> even in the sexes of the same species.</p>
                <p>Immediately beneath the mandibles are situated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >maxillae</hi> or under jaws (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">cc),</hi> which are
                    likewise placed on each side of the mouth, and take their origin from the
                    inferior and internal part of that cavity, near the origin of the under lip.
                    Like that of the preceding parts, their action is horizontal, but their texture
                    is less rigid, approaching to membranous, their colour usually paler, and their
                    internal edges toothed, or finely fringed with hairs. The different portions of
                    the maxillae have received different names, such as the <hi rend="italic">cardo
                    or</hi> hinge, the <hi rend="italic">stipes</hi> or stalk, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">lobus</hi> or lobe (one or more) w hich forms the terminal
                    portion. The last named is the most important portion, as it acts upon the food
                    when preparing for deglutition, and when armed with teeth its substance is as
                    hard as that of the mandibles. “This part,” says Mr Kirby, “is either simple,
                    consisting only of <hi rend="italic">one</hi> lobe, as you will find to be the
                    case with the <hi rend="italic">Hymenoptera, Dynastidoe, Nemognatha,</hi> and
                    several other beetles; or it is compound, consisting of two lobes. In the former
                    case, the lobe is sometimes very-long, as in the bee tribes, and at others very
                    short, as in hister, &amp;c. The bilobed maxillae present several different
                    types of form. Nearest to those with one lobe are those whose lower lobe is
                    attached longitudinally to the inner side of the stalk of the organ, above which
                    it scarcely rises. Of this description is the maxilla in the common dung beetle
                    <hi rend="italic">{Geotrupes</hi><hi rend="italic">stercorarius),</hi> and rove

                    kind of formation is where the lower lobe is only a little shorter than the

                    tetradactyla,</hi> Macleay). A third is where the upper lobe covers the lower as
                    a shield; as you will find in the <hi rend="italic">Orthoptères</hi> order, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">Lιbellulιna,</hi> and almost in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meloe.</hi> A fourth form is where the upper lobe somewhat resembles the

                    the upper lobe not only consists of two joints, but is cylindrical, and assumes
                    the aspect of a feeler or palpus. This is the common character of almost all the

                <p>Most of the predaceous beetles have the inner lobe of the maxillae armed with a
                    terminal claw, which, among the Ci-cmdehdae, is articulated and moveable, but
                    hxed in the other carabideous kinds. The maxillae are chiefly serviceable in
                    holding the food, and preventing its falling from the mouth during the action of
                    the mandibles, although in certain cases they no doubt also act their part in
                    comminution. They are more fixed in their forms than the mandibles, and are of
                    more essential service to the naturalist for the purposes of classification.
                    Fabricius, indeed, has deduced the principal diagnostic of ten out of the
                    thirteen orders (or classes, as he terms them), of which his system is composed,
                    from these important parts.</p>
                <p>We shall now briefly notice certain appendages of the maxillae, the existence of
                    which forms another distinction between them and the mandibles or upper jaws,
                    which are never so provided. Towards the middle of the outer edge of the
                    maxillae are attached two slender articulated filiform processes, known under
                    the name of palpi (see the figure above referred to); the longer pair being the
                    external, the others the internal palpi. Both are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >maxillary,</hi> to distinguish them from the <hi rend="italic">labial</hi>
                    palpi, afterwards mentioned. According to the view expressed by Mr Kirby in the
                    preceding quotation, the reader will perceive that each maxilla may be regarded
                    as properly possessing only one palpus, although in certain tribes the upper
                    lobe being jointed and <hi rend="italic">palpiform,</hi> has occasioned its
                    being regarded as one of these organs. The palpi are distinctly articulated, or
                    composed of several jointed parts, and are capable of rapid and extended motion.
                    They derive their name from a Greek word, which signifies to feel, and are
                    supposed to constitute one of the principal organs of touch. Their uses, however
                    in the insect economy have been variously interpreted. Bonsdorf regarded them as
                    the organs of smell; while Knock, agreeing in that opinion so far as regards the
                    <hi rend="italic">maxillary</hi> palpi, conceives that those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">labium</hi> exercise the faculty of <hi rend="italic">taste.</hi>
                    Cuvier and Kirby favour touch as their true function, and this view is confirmed
                    by the constant use which numerous species make of these organs while walking,
                    by applying them perpetually to the surface of whatever objects they pass over.
                    That they perform that function is rendered extremely probable by their
                    structure, which is beautifully adapted, by its peculiar pliancy, to the
                    examination of the substances with which they come in contact. They are in some
                    respects analogous to the articulated extremities which form the principal seat
                    of the sense of touch in vertebrated animals. It has also been noticed that
                    several aquatic beetles, while swimming, bend back their antennae, and stretch
                    forward their palpi, as if to explore their way through the ambiguous and weedy
                    waters. As accessory to the maxillae, they are no doubt also employed in the
                    selection of the most suitable alimentary portions of whatever substances have
                    been previously seized upon by the more powerful parts of the mouth. In many
                    insects there is only a single palpus to each of the maxillae.</p>
                <p>As the mouth is covered above by the <hi rend="italic">labrum,</hi> or upper lip,
                    so it is closed below by the under lip, or <hi rend="italic">labium</hi> (fig.
                    1, <hi rend="italic">d</hi>). The latter differs in its structure from the
                    labrum, being more complex than that organ, and composed as it were of two
                    portions joined together. It varies in its form, is usually notched in front,
                    and frequently furnished with a triangular tooth in the centre, which is
                    sometimes bifid. Mr Kirby defines the labium as a moveable organ, often
                    biarticulate, which, terminating the surface anteriorly, covers the mouth from
                    beneath, and is situate between the maxillae. It includes the mentum and labial
                    palpi. The more uncovered portion of the labium, or that which projects from the
                    basal portion, is now named <hi rend="italic">languette</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">ligula</hi> by Latreille, in consonance with the nomenclature of
                    Fabricius. The <hi rend="italic">mentum,</hi> or chin, is the lower joint of the
                    labium when the latter is jointed; in other cases its base.</p>
                <p>Some contrariety of opinion seems to exist in the nomenclature of these parts. Mr
                    Macleay bestows the name of <hi rend="italic">mentum</hi> on the middle piece of
                    the lower apparatus of the mouth. Its anterior portion, to which the palpi are
                    so frequently attached, he calls the <hi rend="italic">labium,</hi> while the
                    basal part of the mentum is designated the <hi rend="italic">stipes.</hi> In
                    this view the labium of Macleay corresponds to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ligula,</hi> or rather tongue, of Kirby, while the mentum of the latter is
                    analogous to the stipes of the former; for it appears that the term mentum is
                    only applied by the author of the <hi rend="italic">Introduction to
                    Entomology</hi> to the lower division of the labium, when that organ (as in <hi
                    rend="italic">Hydrous pιceus)</hi> appears to consist of two joints or pieces.
                    When there is no apparent division, or the only separation consists in a
                    transverse elevated line (as in some lamellicorn beetles), or an obtuse angle
                    formed by the meeting of the two parts, then the entire piece (the <hi
                    rend="italic">mentum</hi> merging in it) is regarded by Mr Kirby as the <hi
                    rend="italic">labium.</hi></p>
                <p>Among the greater proportion of masticating insects there is placed anteriorly at
                    each side of the ligula a small supporting piece or article, which takes its
                    rise a little above the pharynx, and is terminated by a projecting appendage.
                    These parts were named <hi rend="italic">paraglossoe</hi> by liliger; and Μ.
                    Latreille regards them as the true representatives of the tongue of the higher
                    tribes. The labial palpi (Fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">d),</hi> are inserted on
                    each side of the ligula, and are usually longer than the internal and shorter
                    than the external maxillary palpi. These palpi have never more than four
                    articulations, in which they also differ from the external maxillary, which
                    range from four to six. They are called labial palpi, because in many cases they
                    derive their origm from the labium strictly so called; but in reference to Mr
                    Kirby’s nomenclature of the parts, they might with equal propriety be
                    denominated lingual palpi, since they not unfrequently emerge from what that
                    excellent observer considers as the tongue. Among the predaceous Coleoptera,
                    indeed, their source seems common to both these parts, as their base on its
                    upper side is attached to the labium, on its under to the hgula or tongue.</p>
                <p>In some insects, such as the Orthoptera and dragon-flies, the membranous portion
                    with which the anterior or internal face of the ligula is furnished, is thick
                    and dilated near the centre, in the form of a little tongue, and is often
                    divided near the middle by a groove. This portion, in the opinion of Latreille,
                    probably occupies the place of the <hi rend="italic">paraglossa;</hi> for these
                    latter, in the instances referred to, are wanting, or not to be recognised.</p>
                <p>These are the principal parts of the mouth among the masticating insects. At the
                    anterior root of the ligula, and a little lower than the middle of the interior
                    space which intervenes between the mandibles, is placed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pharynx.</hi> In many Hymnenoptera this orifice of the oesophagus opens and
                    shuts by means of an appendage, previously noticed by Reaumur in humble bees,
                    and taken by Latreille for the labrum, in his observations on the structure of
                    wasps. Savigny has since paid particular attention <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193746142?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6142-0068"/> to it, and has
                    named it the <hi rend="italic">epipharynx</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >epiglossa.</hi> La-treilie conceives it would be more simple to call it the <hi
                    rend="italic">sublabrum,</hi> because ,it is inserted beneath the anterior and
                    superior margin of the head, immediately after the origin of the labrum. It, is.
                    formed of∣ two. flattened portions, entirely or in great pärt membranous,
                    applied the one upon the other, and of a triangular form. The upper portion is
                    the most advanced. .This epipharynx, instead of being peculiar, as some have
                    supposed, to tlje Hymenoptera, may be safely regarded aS existing.in the other
                    masticating insects, particularly the Coleoptera, among which it· seems
                    represented under a mödified form of structure by the membrane which clothes the
                    corresponding portion of the head., <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> i ∙ . , &gt; </p>
                <p>Although the hymenopterous tribes differ from the other mandibulatech orders, by
                    the prolongation of the maxillae and,labium, and the valvular aspect of the
                    formër, yet the parts of the møuth do not present any essential distinction. A
                    remarkable characteristic of these orders, however, consists, as Savigny informs
                    us, in the absence of the mentum properly so called. They also exhibit this
                    disagreement from the other masticators, in as far as their maxillae embracing!
                    longitudinally the. sides of the labium, these parts unite, together só as to
                    form a tubular body or trunk <hi rend="italic">(promuscis),</hi> serving for
                    suction. As their aliments consist of softîsh śubstances, or of neçtaroüs
                    juices, which, passing between <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> the maxillae and the
                    labium, by means of the successive pressure&lt;of the former parts upon the
                    latter, eventually arrive at the pharynx, they may in truth be regarded as
                    semi-suctorial. Even the Rhinchophori among the Cołe-optera, and: the Panorpati
                    in the neuropterous order, are furnished with, an apparent trunk or prolongation
                    of the muzzle.. <hi rend="italic">(prorostr&gt;ιm)</hi>; but that peculiarity is
                    nothing mörë than an extension of the anterior portion of the head; and the
                    organs: tì£ manducation, placed at its extremity, though of diminished size, in
                    no way differ in structure from those of the other groups of their respective
                    orders. We may add, that the labium or lower lip in the hymenopterous tribes is
                    generally .moveable at its base, as may be observed in the corresponding tribes
                    of the suctorial insects.</p>
                <p>In the suctorial or haustellated orders, properly so called, the organs of the
                    mouth appear at first sight to differ entirely from those above described. The
                    parts which are regarded aš analogous to the maxillae, and frequently even those
                    which represent the mandibles, are fixed and immoveable, either entirely so, or
                    towards their base, and (in regard to the maxillae) as far as the origin of the
                    palpi.’ When the terminal portion is moveable, it is long, narrow, linear,
                    sometimes in the form of a thread or bristle, sometimes resembling a dart or
                    lancet, and fitted for piercing. The pharynx is the central point: around which
                    these portions arrange themselves after the tubιflar form. Sometimes the lower
                    lip, united with the inferior portion of the maxillae, and fixed like it, closes
                    the cavity of the mouth, and the maxillae then constitute a kind of spiral
                    tongue. In other Cases it iŝ~greatly prolonged, and assumes the form of an,
                    arţiçuļated tube, or of an elbowed trunk, usually terminated by two lips
                    susceptible of dilatation. In either of the latter'states it serves as a sheath
                    to certain portions of a scaly structure and piercing nature, in the form of a
                    bristle or lanċet, arid representing the other parts’of the mouth. . Spmetįmes
                    this, sheath (as in <hi rend="italic">Pulex)</hi> is bivalvular, but it more
                    frequently consists of a single piece laterally folded so as to form a tube open
                    on the upper surface. In this longitudinal canal or gutter, the preceding parts
                    are lodged, and compose by their general union the sucker, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >haustellum.</hi> In some instances the palpi have disappeared, in others only
                    two are visible. When there are four of these parts, two of them, the maxillary,
                    are extremely small, or almost imperceptible. Sometimes, as among the pupiparous
                    Dipt era, the lower lip is either nonexistent or rudimentary, and the palpi
                    become the sheath of the sucker. Though we make frequent use of the latter
                    terra, it may be remembered that its application is not strictly correct, as it
                    is not by suction, or the production of a vacuum, that the alimentary juices
                    mount towards the pharynx, but rather by the continuous pressure of the parts
                    upon each other.</p>

                    consist of a labrum and of two extremely small mandibles; of a trunk spirally
                    rolled, improperly regarded as a tongue, and presenting interiorly and
                    throughout its entire length three canals, of which, however, the central alone
                    serves for the influx of the alimentary juices, and formed of two linear or
                    filiform bodies, surrounding the pharynx at their origin immediately beneath the
                    labrum. They represent, under peculiar forms and proportions, the terminal parts
                    of the maxillae, united, hollowed into deep gutters on their internal side, and
                    bearing each a palpus, usually very small and tuberculiform. There is also a
                    labium or lower lip, of a nearly triangular form, immoveable, united, as
                    formerly mentioned, to the inferior part of the maxillae, which supports the
                    filiform or trunk-like portion, and bearing two triarticulate palpi, covered
                    with scales or hairs, and placed on each side of the trunk, for which they form
                    a kind of sheath. The intermediate canal of the trunk is produced, according to
                    the detailed description given by Réaumur, by the union of the gutters of the
                    internal face of the filiform or extended portions.</p>

                    coriaceous, divided into three or four articulations, rolled up at the edges so
                    as to form a conical or cylindrical tube, always directed inferiorly while
                    inactive, and presenting along the centre of its upper or anterior surface a
                    kind of canal produced by the opening left between the rolled-up margins,—a
                    sucker composed of four slender, capillary, corneous, flexible, and elastic
                    threads, disposed in pairs, but combined together, with the two inferior
                    portions united in onc at a short distance from their origin,—a small piece in
                    the form of a triangular ligula, usually toothed at the extremity, rather
                    coriaceous or almost membranous than of a scaly texture, and covering from
                    behind or from the sides of the tubular body the base of the sucker, and
                    inclosed along with it in the groove of the general sheath,—another piece of the
                    same consistence with the preceding, Corresponding by its insertion, and the
                    position which it occupies, to the labrum or upper lip, covering from above the

                    appear at the external sides, their summits with reflected spiculae, and their
                    roots near the pharynx flask-shaped. The tongue (in the interior of the figure)
                    is trifid at the apex, underneath which the maxilae arise, and exceed the
                    mandibulae in length. The labium, or central anterior portion, exhibits the
                    groove for the reception of the other parts, and the oval raised marks towards
                    the narrow end are the (supposed) vestiges of palpi.</p></note> The single

                    to cover, at least among the Cicadae, the base of another more elongated and
                    pointed portion, which has been viewed as corresponding to the epipharynx.<note

                    the origin of the sucker, and placed immediately behind the pharynx, represents,
                    according to Savigny, the tongue or hypopharynx. The two superior filaments of
                    the sucker, or those which are exterior, replace, or rather represent, the
                    mandibles, while the two others may be regarded as maxillae. Finally, the
                    tubular sheath assimilates to the labium or lower hp, even in regard to its
                    articulations. Sometimes the sheath is bifid, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Thrips</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> sometimes it is divided into two plates, as
                    in <hi rend="italic">Pulex.</hi> The first of these genera is stated by
                    Latreille to be the only one in which he has discovered palpi. He thinks that
                    the parts taken for such by Savigny in <hi rend="italic">Nepa Neptunia</hi> (see
                    Plate CCXX. fig. 6, as described in die preceding note), are more probably the
                    rudiments of an articulation of the sheath. Germar indeed admits four palpi as
                    characteristic of a new hemipterous genus of the family of Cicadanae, named <hi

                    The union of the different parts forms what is usually in that order called the
                    trunk or <hi rend="italic">proboscis.</hi> We can here also distinguish the
                    component parts of sheath and sucker. The former in dipterous insects is
                    divisible into three principal portions; 1st, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >support,</hi> distinguished from the following by an angular elbow, and
                    frequently by a small geniculated article; <hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">stalk; 3dly,</hi> the summit, formed by two lips, sometimes
                    membranous, large, vesicular, dilatable, striated, exhibiting through the
                    microscope a great number of tracheal ramifications; sometimes coriaceous, and
                    either small and slightly distinct from the stalk, or slender, elongated, and
                    forming a more obvious article, almost as long as die preceding division (as in
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Myσpa).</hi> The support is remarkable in this, that it
                    results from the prolongation of the cutaneous membrane of the anterior and
                    superior portion of the head, or the epistoma, united with the parts
                    representing the labrum, to die mandibles, the maxillae, and the inferior
                    portion of die labium, as far as the mentum inclusive. This character
                    particularly distinguishes the present tribes from those of the hemipterous
                    order. In other respects the sheath may be said to be constructed on the same
                    plan.</p>
                <p>The centre of the superior face of the stalk also presents a groove or gutter for
                    the reception of the sucker. The number of pieces in the sucker varies according
                    to an arithmetical progression of three terms, of which die difference is always
                    two—2, 4, 6; but in all cases there are always two portions which are not
                    paired, the one superior, representing the labrum; the other inferior, placed
                    behind the pharynx, and the analogue of the tongue or hypopharynx. Among the
                    Diptera, as well as in the suctorial tribe <hi rend="italic">(Pulex),</hi> the
                    latter portion is always scaly and piercing, and contributes, in common with the
                    others, to the purposes of nutrition. It is otherwise with the Hemiptera, and
                    this distinction forms a new character of separation between that order and the
                    insects now under consideration. The parts representing the maxillae always
                    exist, and are frequently accompanied each by a palpus; but these maxillae are
                    soldered to the support, and are indistinct, except where their apical portion
                    becomes moveable and elongated, and presents the form of a seta or homy lancet.
                    This always takes place when the sucker consists of from four to six pieces. In
                    the latter case two of them represent the mandibles; in the other, or where the
                    sucker is composed of only four setae, these are wanting, or merely rudimentary.
                    Sometimes also the labrum, almost always vaulted and large, seems to offer the
                    vestiges of another piece, which, under a fuller development, might no doubt be
                    regarded as the epipharynx. Sometimes the support is very short, and in this
                    case the pieces of the sucker leave the cavity of the mouth, and the maxillary
                    palpi are inserted on the sides. The Hippoboscae, or pupiparous Diptera, differ
                    from all the rest in the absence of the sheath; for the palpi, under the form of
                    two coriaceous elongated blades, perform its functions, and advancing in a
                    parallel direction, cover and protect the sucker.</p>
                <p>In accordance with the observations of Latreille, as well as with those of
                    Savigny, Leclerc de Laval, and Professor Nitzsch, regarding the structure of the
                    mouth in such of the hexapod insects as undergo no metamorphosis <hi
                    rend="italic">(hexapodes</hi><hi rend="italic">homotenes),</hi> the general plan
                    of organization seems in these to be the same as among the polymorphous orders.
                    In <hi rend="italic">Pediculus,</hi> properly so called, the only known
                    suctorial species of that division, the trunk <hi rend="italic">(rostellum)</hi>
                    consists of a small inarticulate tube, inclosing a sucker, and withdrawing
                    itself at pleasure within a muzzle-shaped advancement of the anterior portion of
                    the head. But the organization of these parasitical species requires a renewed
                    and more careful examination. The genus <hi rend="italic">Ricinus,</hi> although
                    furnished with mandibles, maxillae, and an inferior hp, has these parte greatly
                    concentrated, after the manner of the Suctoria; and the labrum seems to perform
                    the office of a cupping glass, a character unique and unexampled in this class
                    of animals, and one which, in combination with certain other features, indicates
                    a peculiar type<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>These are the principal modifications exhibited in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=80" xml:id="kp-eb0709-0080-0070"/>
                    structure of the mouth by hexapod or true insects. In the opinion of Marcel de
                    Serres, the parts named palpi (the antennulae of some authors) enjoy, at least
                    in the Orthoptera, a peculiar property, that of being the organ of the sense of
                    smell. Lamarck again looks upon the palpi as exercising the faculty of taβte.
                    Latreille regards these opinions as ill-founded, so far as concerns a great
                    number of insects, such as those in which the palpi are non-existent,
                    undeveloped, or extremely minute; but he views them in a more favourable light
                    in reference to certain other species. Thus, among the Coleoptera of the
                    sub-family of <hi rend="italic">Xylotrogi,</hi> tlιe maxillary palpi of the
                    males are lacinated or pectinated like some antennae. In many other kinds the
                    last article of the palpi is greatly dilated, and terminated by a pulpy
                    substance.</p>
                <p>We have not hitherto attended to the singular order Strepsιptera of kιrby
                    (Rhιpιptera, Lat.), the characters of which were first given in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Linnaan Transactions.</hi> If we regard the insects of this order
                    as possessed of genuine mandibles, we must of course include them among the
                    masticating tribes; but as in many of the preceding orders, in which the parts
                    of the mouth are feebly developed, the mandibles are observed to have become
                    obliterated, there is reason to suspect that the parts regarded as such in
                    Strepsιptera are rather maxillary, in which case the structure would approach
                    that of the lepidopterous kinds.</p>
                <p>We have entered into the preceding details in consequence of the great importance
                    which is now attached to the study of the parts of manducation. Latreille indeed
                    seems to be of opinion, that whenever it is possible to characterize genera by
                    more obvious organs, the minuter parts should not be had recourse to; and he
                    deems the principles of the Fabncιan system liable to abuse, especially when
                    Claιrvιlles example is departed from of employing only the mandibles and palpi.
                    But the truth is, that the use of the compound microscope is scarcely ever
                    required in these examinations; and it cannot be denied that a knowledge of such
                    essential parts is indispensable in the formation of natural generic groups. The
                    general physiognomy is frequently deceptive, and we can rectify our views only
                    by recurring to influential organs. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Sphex
                    spirifer,</hi> and some analogous species which differ from their congeners in
                    the mode of providing for their young, and which therefore form a good natural
                    group, are also distinguished by an alteration in the structure of the mouth,
                    but could scarcely be separated from the primitive genus by characters drawn
                    from any other parts.</p>
                <p>Besides the parts of the mouth, the head of insects presents some other component
                    portions which have received particular names. What Mr Kirby calls the nose is
                    that upper and anterior portion to which the labrum is attached, and which
                    corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">clypeus</hi> of Fabricius. (See Plate CCXX.
                    fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> upper portion.) The latter term was originally
                    applied metaphorically to the expanded or shield-like covering of the head of
                    the Scarabaeidae, and the expression was not inapt; but when it came to be used
                    as a general term in relation to the structure of all other kinds, it lost its
                    propriety of application. Hence the term <hi rend="italic">nasus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">nose</hi> has been substituted, as well as that of <hi
                    rend="italic">epistoma,</hi> which signifies the <hi rend="italic">part above
                    the mouth.</hi> Between the nose and the labrum we find in many species the
                    nostril piece or <hi rend="italic">rhιnanum</hi> of Kirby. It is very obvious in
                    a New Holland beetle, <hi rend="italic">Anaplognaihus vιrιd</hi><hi rend="italic

                    bounded laterally by the eyes, anteriorly by the nose or after-nose and the
                    cheeks, and posteriorly by the vertex. The <hi rend="italic">vertex</hi> is the
                    crown of the head, and is bounded laterally by the hinder part of the eyes and
                    the temples, and posteriorly by the occiput, when that part exists. It is the
                    ordinary region of the stemma-tιc eyes, although these peculiar organs are
                    sometimes found to occur likewise upon the frons. The <hi rend="italic"

                    posteriorly with the vertex, or slopes downwards from it. It is bounded
                    laterally by the temples, and posteriorly by the orifice of the head, or by the
                    neck itself. The cheeks. <hi rend="italic">gena,</hi> according to Kirby,
                    usually surround the anterior part of the eyes, lying between them and the

                    >tempora,</hi> form a continuation of the cheeks to the posterior limit of the
                    head, forming its sides and posterior angles.`<note anchored="true"

                <p>The next appendages of the head to which we have to direct the reader’s attention
                    are the <hi rend="italic">antenna.</hi> These are moveable articulated organs,
                    never exceeding two in number in genuine insects, although their form, and the
                    amount of articulated portions, are extremely various. Their primary use in the
                    animal economy has not yet been ascertained; at least a great diversity of
                    opinion is maintained on the subject. In numerous tribes they seem to exercise a
                    faculty analogous to that of touch, being employed in exploring the depth of
                    crevices, and in ascertaining by contact the nature of any opposing obstacle;
                    while, on the other hand, their extreme shortness in most Diptera, and in many
                    of the neuropterous and hemipterous tribes, does not accord with that usage.
                    Although of considerable importance in our systematic arrangement of insects,
                    the development of the antennae does not seem subjected to any general or
                    conformable rules, and is therefore of less value than that of several other
                    parts of structure. For example, we frequently find a considerable difference to
                    exist in the form of the antennae among species in other respects intimately
                    allied; and even between the sexes of the same species a great disparity in size
                    and structure is observable. Where a difference exists, those of the male are
                    generally more developed than those of the female.</p>
                <p>The antennae of insects are usually composed of small cylindrical articulations,
                    containing nervous threads, muscles, tracheae, and cellular tissue. Various
                    terms are in use to express their form, consistence, and mode of insertion. They
                    are <hi rend="italic">regular</hi> when the articulations follow a gradual and
                    progressive order in the modifications which they undergo; <hi rend="italic"

                    >plumose,</hi> when thickly branched on either side, like a feather. Many other
                    terms are in use to express the modifications of these important organs, most of
                    which, however, are of a sufficiently familiar derivation to explain
                    themselves.</p>
                <p>The antennae of the coleopterous order usually consist of ten or eleven distinct
                    articulations. The latter number is the most frequent, although several genera
                    present much fewer joints, as for example <hi rend="italic">Paussus,</hi> in
                    which there are only two. Others again have many more, such as a species of
                    Prionus, of which the antennae of the female have nineteen joints, of the male
                    twenty. In some orthopterous kinds these articulations amount to a hundred and
                    fifty. The antennae are inserted on the front of the head, anterior to and
                    rather beneath the region of the eyes. Their particular position varies, but
                    they are always either in the space between the eyes, or that below them. As
                    their various forms, as characteristic of particular groups of species, will be
                    afterwards described in the systematic part of the present treatise, we shall
                    not here enter into further details of structure. The uses of these singular
                    organs are variously viewed by naturalists, and there seems even yet to be more
                    hypothetical reasoning on the subject than precise induction from facts. Some
                    regard them as the seat of smell, others of hearing, a greater number as the
                    organs of the sense of touch. The indurated nature of the outer covering in most
                    insects would certainly lead us, <hi rend="italic">a priori,</hi> to expect a
                    special provision for the reception of the last-named sense. It is, however,
                    extremely difficult, in the present state of our knowledge, to come to any
                    general conclusion oh the subject. We shall state the prevailing opinions when
                    we come to treat of the senses of insects; and under that head we shall likewise
                    explain the structure of the eyes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">thorax</hi> forms the second principal portion of an
                    insect’s body. It is itself divisible into three parts, and its component
                    segments vary greatly in their relative proportions in the different tribes; the
                    division which is merely rudimentary in one particular group, being sometimes
                    highly developed in another. These parts are named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prothorax,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">mesothorax,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">metathorax.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">prothorax</hi> (from <hi rend="subscript"> ff</hi> jo, <hi
                    rend="italic">before,</hi> and to <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> αξ, <hi
                    rend="italic">thorax·)</hi> is the antenor segment, and corresponds to the <hi
                    rend="italic">corselet</hi> or collar of Μ. Latreille; the second segment is
                    named <hi rend="italic">mesothorax</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">μιβος,
                    middle)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the third is known as the <hi
                    rend="italic">metathorax</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">μοτ</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> a</hi><hi rend="italic">, after.)</hi> Each segment may likewise be
                    distinguished in reference to its inferior, its lateral, and its superior
                    portions; and the whole united constitute the <hi rend="italic">thorax,</hi>
                    commonly so called. But although the general name of thorax is applied to the
                    parts just named, yet the posterior two, that is, the mesothorax and the
                    metathorax, are the most dependent on each other, and are always intimately
                    united; while the prothorax, as exemplified in the Coleoptera, is often
                    comparatively free and distinguishable. It is this last-mentioned segment which
                    bears the anterior pair of feet, and it considerably exceeds the others in
                    extent. In the coleopterous order, indeed, it is the only part that is visible
                    on the upper surface, the other segments, with the exception of the scutellum,
                    being connected beneatlι it and the elytra. The mesothorax and metathorax unite
                    strictly with the base of the abdomen, and serve as the points of attachment to
                    the other pairs of feet. Of the mesothorax or central portion, the most obvious
                    characters consist in its serving as a support to the second pair of feet, and
                    to the elytra or first pair of wings. Its form, size, and consistence are
                    extremely various. Slightly developed in the Coleoptera and Orthoptera, it is
                    larger in the Hemiptera, the Neuroptera, and more especially in the Hymenoptera,
                    the Lepidoptera, and the Diptera. Its excessive increase is always associated
                    with a condition more or less rudimentary of the other segments. Thus, in the
                    three orders last named, the prothorax and metathorax are very restricted;
                    while, on the contrary, they are large in the Coleoptera, among which it is
                    observable that the mesothorax is always compressed and narrow. The metathorax
                    serves as the point of attachment to the third pair of feet, and to the second
                    or membranous pair of wings.</p>
                <p>We have said that each segment may be described in relation to its inferior, its
                    lateral, and its superior parts. A piece named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sternum</hi> constitutes the whole of what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >inferior</hi> portion. This is not, as too often supposed, an occasional
                    projection, merely characteristic of certain tribes. It occurs in all insects,
                    and forms a distinct character, though more or less defined and perspicuous,
                    according to the genus. It may be regarded as generally composed of three
                    distinct pieces, resembling in this respect the human sternum, which anatomists
                    describe as consisting originally of three bones. Each of these pieces,
                    according to Mr Kirby, is appropriated to a pair of legs, and each of them has
                    been called the <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> thus, in
                    Elater the <hi rend="italic">prosternunt,</hi> in the Cetoniadae the <hi
                    rend="italic">mesosternum,</hi> and in Hydrophilus the <hi rend="italic"
                    >metasternum,</hi> have alike been distinguished by the name. Each of the
                    ordinary <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi> portions of the thorax is formed of two
                    principal pieces, which, in combination with the sternum, is by some named the
                    <hi rend="italic">pectus</hi> or breast. The anterior piece rests upon the
                    sternum, and is hence called <hi rend="italic">epιsternum</hi> (from <hi
                    rend="italic">tsr!, upon).</hi> 1 he posterior lateral portion, called the <hi
                    rend="italic">epimera,</hi> is connected with the preceding; it also adheres to
                    the superior portion, and rests in certain cases on the sternum; but it bears a
                    constant relation to the haunches of the segment to which it belongs, and to
                    these it articulates by means of a little piece afterwards mentioned by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">trochantim.</hi> It derives its name from ιw∕, and ^o <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi>, <hi rend="italic">thigh.</hi> Lastly, there exists on
                    these same lateral parts a third piece, in general slightly developed, and
                    sometimes imperceptible. It bears relation to the wing and episternum, always
                    supports itself on the latter, is sometimes prolonged inferiorly along its
                    anterior margin, or, becoming free, passes in advance of the wing, or even
                    places itself above it. It bears the name of <hi rend="italic">paraptera,</hi>
                    from wαjα, <hi rend="italic">near to,</hi> and wr⅛ov, <hi rend="italic"
                    >icing.</hi> Three other portions of some importance may likewise be considered
                    as belonging to the general <hi rend="italic">pectus.</hi></p>

                <p>Isř, Above the sternum, on its internal face, that is, within the body of the
                    insect, there exists a piece sometimes remarkable for its size. It is placed on
                    the median line, and generally takes its rise from the posterior extremity of
                    the sternum. It assumes various secondary forms, and is generally divided into
                    two branches. Cuvier named it the Y-formed portion, on account of his having
                    observed it assume the shape of that letter. It is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >entothorax</hi> by Μ. Audouin, from <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∣∣</hi><hi rend="italic">rος, within,</hi> because it is always placed in the
                    interior of that organ. It occurs in each segment of the thorax, and seems to be
                    in some measure a dependent on the sternum. Its uses are supposed to be the
                    protection of the nervous system, and its isolation in many cases from the
                    digestive apparatus and the dorsal vessel. The entothorax exists not only in the
                    thorax, but in the head, in which case it is named <hi rend="italic"
                    >entocephalus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it has even been noticed in the first

                    named <hi rend="italic">triangle écailleux</hi> by Réaumur may safely be
                    regarded as its analogue. In this last condition it is denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">entogaster.</hi><hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> On the anterior edge of
                    the epistcrnum, sometimes of the sternum, and even on the superior part of the
                    body, a stigmatic opening is observable, surrounded by a small piece, of which
                    the texture is frequently corneous. This is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >peritrema,</hi> so called from <hi rend="italic">¶ig, round about,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">τοημa, a hole.</hi> It is not always perceptible, both on account
                    of its being sometimes too closely connected with the neighbouring pieces, and
                    because the stigmatic opening is itself sometimes obliterated. But when visible,
                    it is necessary that it should be distinguished, as its position is of
                    importance, and becomes a useful auxiliary in the comparison of parts and in the
                    determination of analogies.</p>
                <p>3d, Lastly, it has been already stated in relation to the epimera, that it is
                    connected with the rotule by means of a small articulation, of which the
                    existence was first made known by Μ. Audouin. This is not an essential part of
                    the thorax; but as it accompanies the epimera, and is associated with the parts
                    of the leg, all of which have received particular denominations, its first
                    describer has thought proper to bestow upon it a name. He calls it <hi
                    rend="italic">trochαηtin,</hi> in distinction to <hi rend="italic"
                    >trochanter,</hi> or that portion of the leg which is associated with the rotule
                    and the thigh. The trochantin is sometimes concealed in the interior of the
                    thorax, and is sometimes visible externally, according as the rotule is itself
                    more or less prolonged in its internal portion. The ascertainment of this piece,
                    according to Μ. Audouin, admits of a direct comparison between the limbs of
                    insects and those of the Crustacea. Hitherto there were only five parts in the
                    former (the tarsi being regarded as one), while there were six in the latter.
                    But the trochantin completes the number six likewise among the insect
                    tribes.</p>
                <p>We have now detailed the structure of the chest or pectus of insects; so that
                    whoever desires to view one of these creatures anatomically, should, after
                    dividing the thorax into three segments, seek to ascertain, on the inferior and
                    middle portion of each, the existence of a sternum, and on the flank or lateral
                    portion, an episternum, a paraptcra, and epimera. He will also study the
                    structure of the entothorax, of the peritrema, and of the trochantin. Sometimes,
                    however, the union of one or more of these parts with another is so intimate
                    that they cannot be isolated or distinguished; but when we elsewhere, in such
                    numerous cases, perceive that the pectus is formed of a certain number of
                    elementary parts, it is more rational to believe that in all instances these
                    same elements are made use of, than to suppose the frequent requirement of
                    new.</p>
                <p>We shall next discuss the superior portion of the thorax of insects. In the
                    coleopterous tribes the prothorax, as before mentioned, constitutes the
                    principal portion, and its upper part may be called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thoracic shield.</hi> The only other part sufficiently distinguished prior to
                    the time of Μ., Audouin, was the <hi rend="italic">scutellum</hi> or escutcheon.
                    It is highly developed in the Scutellerae, and rudimentary in most of the
                    Hymenoptera, Diptera, Lepidoptera, and some other orders. Its apparent position
                    between the wings has occasioned its being regarded too exclusively as a kind of
                    <hi rend="italic">point d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">appui</hi> in flight. It is
                    usually of a triangular form in the Coleoptera, and projects backwards from the
                    mesothorax, with its point interposed between the elytra and the wings. The
                    scutellum was adopted by Geoffroy as the basis of his arrangement of the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Scaraboeus.</hi> It is, however, by no means a well-chosen
                    characteristic of the greater divisions in entomology; for the accurate
                    distinction is not, as is usually supposed, whether the scutellum does or does
                    not exist in a lamellicorn insect, but whether it is or is not apparent.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Iloroe
                    Eìitomologiccc,</hi> part i. p. 9.</p></note> It occurs very obviously among
                    many of the coleopterous tribes, but is most conspicuously developed in that
                    genus of the hemipterous order called <hi rend="italic">Scιιtellera,</hi> of
                    which <hi rend="italic">Cimex lineatus</hi> may serve as an example. Naturalists
                    have erred in regarding this portion as characteristic of the mesothorax alone.
                    It is often greatly developed in the posterior segment. Numerous and varied
                    researches have led Μ. Audouin to conclude that this superior portion of the
                    thorax is composed of four principal pieces, frequently isolated, sometimes
                    intimately united, usually distinct. He has deduced the following nomenclature
                    from their relative position in regard to each other. The anterior portion is
                    named the <hi rend="italic">praescutum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is
                    sometimes very large, and is usually concealed in whole or in part in the
                    interior of the thorax. The second piece is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scutum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it is an important element, often strongly
                    developed, and always articulates with the wings when these exist. To the next
                    piece the original term <hi rend="italic">scutellum</hi> is applied; it consists
                    of the projecting angular point, generally so denominated by entomologists. The
                    fourth and last piece is called the <hi rend="italic">postscutellum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> it is almost always entirely concealed within the thorax,
                    sometimes united to the internal face of the scutellum, and confounded with it,
                    sometimes free, and not adhering to the other portions, except by its lateral
                    extremities. These are the parts which constitute the superior portion of the
                    thorax, and to which the general term <hi rend="italic">tergum</hi> may bc
                    applied. Thus we may speak of the tergum of the prothorax, of the mesothorax, or
                    of the metathorax; but when the word tergum alone is used, we are then
                    understood to signify the union of the superior parts, that is, the entire space
                    comprised between the head and the first segment of the abdomen.</p>
                <p>We comc now to the <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> itself, an important portion in
                    the animal economy. Anatomists iň general appear to have advanced from the study
                    of the human frame to that of animals, or at least to have applied to the parts
                    of the latter the same terms which they had previously bestowed upon the former.
                    In so doing, however, they have been guided rather by the analogy of form than
                    of function, and hence the vague nature of many terms, as applied to the
                    inferior orders, and which, however correct in their original signification,
                    become either obscure, or altogether inapplicable in regard to other
                    classes.</p>
                <p>The abdomen, among insects, is that part of the body which is attached to the
                    posterior extremity of the thorax, composed of five or six rings or segments,
                    unprovided with locomotive organs, and always containing within it a portion of
                    the digestive canal. If, as many suppose, its existence depends upon that of the
                    thorax, then the entire class °f Annelides or red-blooded worms may be said to
                    be deprived of it, as the thorax itself does not exist in that class.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746207?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6207-0073"/>
                <p>The term body is then made use of to designate generally the whole of the animal.
                    Although the abdomen cannot well exist without the thorax, the converse does not
                    appear to hold good, for the latter in many species seems to constitute the
                    whole body. Many of the <hi rend="italic">Ñyriapoda,</hi> such as Iulus and
                    Scolopendra, are examples of this; for they are composed of a series of
                    segments, all furnished with feet except the last, which has therefore by some
                    been regarded as the abdomen.</p>
                <p>But among genuine insects, that is, the hexapod or six-footcd kinds, the abdomen
                    is obviously developed, and, especially among the winged tribes, is very
                    distinguishable from the thorax. Among the apterous species the distinction is
                    less perceptible; and the same may be said of most insects in the larva state.
                    Among the hymenopterous kinds, such as wasps, bees, &amp;c. it appears as if it
                    were pediculated or attached to the posterior part of the thorax by means of a
                    slender stalk; but minuter and more accurate observation demonstrates that this
                    neck-like restriction actually takes place on the second segment of the abdomen,
                    the first of which is much more spacious, but so closely attached to the thorax
                    by its anterior edges as to become undistinguishable. In the coleopterous order
                    the abdomen is usually convex, and of a harder consistence beneath, where it is
                    exposed; but it is soft, and either flattish or concave above, where it is
                    covered by the folded wings and elytra. On both sides of its segments there is a
                    small roundish opening called the <hi rend="italic">stigma,</hi> which serves
                    for the introduction of air for the purposes of respiration, and of which we
                    shall treat in detail when we come to the consideration of that function.</p>
                <p>It has been noted that if an insect is naturally more habituated to walking than
                    flying, the breast or lower portion of the thorax is expanded, and is furnished
                    λvith more powerful muscles than the back; whereas, if flight is the more
                    frequent mode of locomotion, an increase is observable in the dorsal muscles.
                    The locomotive organs are of course the wings and legs, on which we shall now
                    bestow a brief consideration.</p>
                <p>SECT. III.—ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION IN INSECTS.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">The Wings.</hi></p>
                <p>These organs exist, effectively, in insects only in the perfect state; for the
                    larvae do not offer externally any trace of them, and when apparent in the nymph
                    or intermediate condition, they are merely rudimentary. No insect has more than
                    four wings, many have only a single pair, and others are entirely destitute of
                    these parts. When four in number they may be regarded as <hi rend="italic"
                    >anterior</hi> or <hi rend="italic">superior,</hi> and as <hi rend="italic"
                    >posterior</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    we likewise talk of the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> or of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >second pair</hi> of wings. The coleopterous order presents some peculiarities
                    in relation to these organs. The anterior pair (in all cases, as already
                    mentioned, united to the mesothorax) consist of a hard or horny substance
                    similar to the envelope of the thorax, and are called <hi rend="italic"
                    >elytra.</hi> When closed, their junction usually forms a straight central line
                    called the <hi rend="italic">suture,</hi> which is rather apparent than real in
                    certain species in which the inferior wings are wanting, and the elytra form a
                    single undivided piece. They are convex above and concave below, are fixed to
                    the mesothorax, and cover and protect the genuine wings, which are of a much
                    more delicate structure. These latter derive their origin from the mçtathorax,
                    and are the <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> actual organs of flight. They are
                    membranous and transparent, and when unemployed are transversely folded beneath
                    their horny covering. We shall here describe the structure of wings, and explain
                    the terms made use of to express the principal modifications which they undergo
                    in their various degrees of development in the different orders.</p>
                <p>The wing of an insect consists of two thin flexible membranous transparent plates
                    or leaves, the one superimposed upon the other, and variously intersected by
                    darker lines of a horny consistence, usually known by the name of nervures.
                    These nervures, which at first sight appear like superficial threads, of which
                    the larger follow the longitudinal direction of the wing, are interposed between
                    its membranes, and present two faces, of which the upper, frequently rounded and
                    very horny, adheres closely to the corresponding leaf, and the under, of less
                    firm consistence, and of a flatter form, may by skilful dissection be removed
                    from that portion of the wing by which itis covered. In the opinion of Μ.
                    Audouin, these threads are in fact so many tubes, which diminish in diameter as
                    they approach the summit of the wing, and each of which contains, throughout its
                    entire extent, a spirally rolled vessel, by some regarded as a genuine trachea.
                    These tracheae receive air from the interior of the body, and their formation,
                    according to Swammerdam, whose views have more recently been confirmed and
                    adopted by Jurine and Chabrier, is to strengthen the wing by distending it
                    during the action of flight. They are said to experience no sensible dilatation
                    during their progress, whereas the corneous tubes which contain them present in
                    that respect some curious modifications,—for they sometimes spread out suddenly,
                    in such a way as to exhibit, for a short space, a comparatively broad diameter.
                    The colouring matter being then disseminated over a wider surface, assumes so
                    pale an aspect that the nervure which leads into one,of those little expansions
                    appears as it were interrupted. Hence the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >bulles</hi><hi rend="italic">chair,</hi> or air-bubbles, bestowed upon the
                    latter by the French entomologists. They occur most frequently in the cubital
                    nervures of many Hymenoptera, and their chief use is supposed to be to
                    facilitate the formation of certain foldings of the wing during the periods of
                    repose. The largest of the nervures arise from the base of the wing, that is,
                    from the point of its insertion in the thorax. A most skilful observer, the late
                    Μ. Jurine of Geneva, has described the wings of hymenopterous insects with great
                    accuracy, in a memoir to which we shall make more special allusion when we come
                    to treat of that particular order.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The general character in respect to form and aspect of the wings of insects has
                    received a great variety of names. They are sometimes <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The margins or edges of the wings have likewise received a considerable variety
                    of designations, according to the peculiar characters whieh they exhibit. They

                <p>These details, we doubt not, like all the other technicalities of a complex
                    branch of science, must seem irksome to the general reader. Nevertheless, as
                    they frequently form important and sometimes indispensable elements of
                    knowledge, we must continue their enumeration. The wings, in fact, have
                    furnished the characters from which the names and definitions of the orders in
                    entomology have been derived, and a knowledge of their forms and functions is
                    required during almost every step of our progress. A transcendental anatomy has
                    no doubt thrown its ambiguous light <hi rend="italic">ficus a non lucendd)</hi>
                    upon these and other portions of animal economy; and the wings, whieh in former
                    times were thought sufficiently defined when merely named as the organs of
                    flight, are now regarded by some as legs, and by others as lungs. We still see,
                    however, that they earry the ercaturcs through the air, and we shall therefore
                    rest satisfied by viewing them in accordance with our accustomed
                    associations.</p>
                <p>Among the more remarkable of the modifications experienced by the upper wings, is
                    that corneous condition in which they are known under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">elytra.</hi> These are particularly eharaeteristic of the
                    coleopterous order, and derive their name from sλuτgov, a sheath or covering,
                    because they protect the membranaceous wings. They are attached by thcir base,
                    by means of several small pieces, to the mesothorax. The opposite extremities
                    are called the points or summits, and the margins are known as anterior or
                    external, posterior, and interior,—the last named, when the parts are elosed,
                    and meeting over the baek, forming what is called the dorsal suture. As to their
                    proportions, they are <hi rend="italic">elongated,</hi> when they exceed the
                    abdomen; <hi rend="italic">abbreviated,</hi> when shorter than that organ; and
                    various other terms of obvious application are made use of to express their
                    different degrees.</p>
                <p>The elytra differ in their consistence, being sometimes almost <hi rend="italic"
                    >membranous,</hi> or scarcely firmer than the under wings; or they are <hi
                    rend="italic">coriaceous,</hi> or of the texture of leather; <hi rend="italic"
                    >semi-coriaceous,</hi> when, as among many Hcmiptera, the elytra are composed of
                    two parts of different texture; <hi rend="italic">pergameneous,</hi> or like
                    parchment; <hi rend="italic">flexible,</hi> when, yielding to a slight
                    impression, they yet return again immediately to thcir original shape; or <hi
                    rend="italic">soft,</hi> when they yield to the same impression, but retain the
                    alteration of form for a longer time. As to form, many of the terms already
                    enumerated in relation to the w ings in general, apply equally to the elytra.
                    They are also <hi rend="italic">gibbous,</hi> when greatly rounded or
                    hemispherical; <hi rend="italic">dilated,</hi> when more flatly expanded; <hi
                    rend="italic">attenuated,</hi> when they diminish in breadth from the base to
                    the apex. The surface of these parts presents many characters of great
                    importance in the discrimination of species, and even in the formation of
                    sections or subdivisions of genera. They are said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >chagrined,</hi> when covered by minute <hi rend="italic">raised</hi> spots; <hi
                    rend="italic">punctated,</hi> when these spots are distinct and <hi

                    rend="italic">verrucose</hi> or <hi rend="italic">warty,</hi> when they are
                    large, cicatrised, and resembling warts; <hi rend="italic">striated,</hi> when
                    marked with regular longitudinal lines; <hi rend="italic">striato-punctate,</hi>
                    when in each stria there are depressed points; <hi rend="italic"
                    >punctato-striate,</hi> when the striae are themselves formed by a consecutive
                    series of these impressed points; <hi rend="italic">sulcated</hi> or furrowed,

                    >reticulated,</hi> when these lines are disposed with greater regularity, in a
                    kind of network; <hi rend="italic">creηated,</hi> when the lines are rather
                    regularly undulated; <hi rend="italic">glabrous,</hi> when the elytra are
                    smooth, or destitute of raised points or other irregularities of surface; <hi
                    rend="italic">tomentose</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cottony,</hi> when covered by
                    a whitish down; <hi rend="italic">pilose,</hi> when hairy, —also <hi

                <p>The elytra are said to be <hi rend="italic">margined</hi> when their edges are
                    raised, or otherwise distinguished from the general and more central surface;
                    <hi rend="italic">sinuated,</hi> when there are sloping notches on their
                    outline; <hi rend="italic">serrated,</hi> when furnished with little sharp
                    projections like the teeth of a saw; <hi rend="italic">dentated,</hi> when these
                    arc sharp and more distant. They are likewise said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >mucronated</hi> when the apex is provided with a sharpish point; <hi
                    rend="italic">bideηtated,</hi> when there are a couple of distinct projections;
                    <hi rend="italic">obtuse,</hi> when the summits are blunt or <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193746233?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6233-0075"/> rounded; <hi
                    rend="italic">truncated,</hi> when they seem as if a portion had been
                    severed.</p>
                <p>We have already mentioned, that in many of the hemipterous order the anterior
                    wings are <hi rend="italic">semi∙elytrous,</hi> that is, comparatively solid in
                    one part of their extent, and membranous in the other. In fact, the order
                    derives its name from that character, as already mentioned in our introductory
                    definitions. In the orthopterous order the anterior wings, though much more
                    membranaceous than those of beetles, yet approach the nature of elytra, and
                    serve as a protection to the under pair, which are more delicate. Among
                    neuropterous insects both pairs of wings are alike in their general character of
                    texture and reticulation, and the same may be said of the hymenopterous order.
                    Those of the Lepidoptera are also similar to each other in their substance and
                    covering. With a few exceptions, in which the wings are clear or diaphanous, in
                    the last-named gorgeous group they are thickly coated with minute scales of
                    various colours, which when removed exhibit the membranous structure of the
                    parts. They present several other peculiarities, which we shall notice when we
                    treat of the generalities of the greater divisions of which the order is
                    composed.</p>
                <p>The wings, regarded throughout the entire series of hexapod insects, are thus
                    extremely varied in their form, consistence, development, and efficiency. The
                    distinctions, both of form and texture, show themselves, as it were, by
                    gradation, and present no striking disparity among species otherwise nearly
                    allied. But the uses, and degrees of development, of these organs, vary greatly
                    not only among species of the same genus, but even between the sexes of the same
                    species; for while the males of several kinds are efficiently winged, the
                    females are entirely apterous. When the anterior wings, as in the Coleoptera,
                    are <hi rend="italic">elytrous</hi> (if we may use the expression), they
                    scarcely serve for the purposes of flight. In the neuropterous and hymenopterous
                    orders both pairs are equally efficient, while in the dipterous or two-winged
                    tribes the inferior wings have disappeared. In some cases, as among the female
                    ants, the wings fall off immediately after the sexual union.</p>
                <p>The development of the wings always bears a relation to that of the superior arc
                    of the thorax by which they are supported. It has been already noted, that if an
                    insect is more habituated to walking than flying, the breast or lower portion of
                    the thorax is extended, and is furnished with more powerful muscles than the
                    back; whereas if flight is the means of locomotion, an increase of power is
                    observable in the dorsal muscles.</p>
                <p>One of the laws laid down by Μ. Straus Dnrckheim as regulating organic structure
                    is the following :—that when one organ governs another, or several others, these
                    follow the march of the dominating organ; and that when the latter
                    disap]&gt;ears, those which were subordinate to it immediately assume their
                    primitive form. This law may be exemplified by the influence of the wings upon
                    the thorax. In proportion as the two pairs of wings change in form and size, the
                    two segments of the thorax which support them follow the same progression, and
                    become more and more united to each other; but no sooner do the wings disappear
                    in the Aphaniptera (Pulex), than the two segments of the thorax regain their
                    primitive form, and separating from one another, present the same appearance as
                    in Lepisma. The wings being first introduced amongst the Coleoptera, and the
                    thorax of these as yet differing but little from that of the Thysanura, it can
                    easily return to the form it possessed previously to its undergoing any
                    modification, f It thence follows, that in such species as are deprived of
                    wings, the thorax returns more or less to its primitive form. This is
                    particularly remarkable in the females of many species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lampyris,</hi> w hich possess neither wings nor elytra; and this return is
                    moreover occasioned in the Coleoptera without wings by another cause, which acts
                    in this case on that part of the body; it is the diminution of the solidity of
                    the integuments in those parts which are covered by the elytra.</p>
                <p>In the other order of insects, according to the views of the last-named author,
                    the two segments which bear the wings having already experienced a very
                    "considerable change of form, it would require a very powerful cause to bring
                    them back to their primitive form; for this reason the return does not take
                    place in <hi rend="italic">Cimcx cellularius,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >For-micoe, &amp;c.</hi> amongst which the imperfection (if it may be so called)
                    is only specific. In the Aphaniptera, on the contrary, which we may in some
                    respects consider as wingless Diptcra, the transformation of the thorax takes
                    ∣&gt;lace in consequence of a complete absence of the wings, brought about by
                    the degradation which these organs have éxpe-rienced in passing through the
                    whole of the class Insecta∙ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi></p>

                    endeavoured to explain the laws which regulate the different changes of
                    structure in passing from one group to another. The most general law in the
                    organization of animals which he has recognised is, that all the systems of
                    organs are subjected to a constant variation of form, and even of function,
                    while passing from one family to another. The first more special or particular
                    law which he evolves from the subdivision of the former is the following: That
                    the organs at one extremity of the scale always exercise a very evident
                    function; whilst at the other extremity they are constantly rudimentary and
                    without function, and at last entirely disappear. Hc here distinguishes two
                    kinds of cases. In the first, the organs present themselves at the head of the
                    scale developed to the highest degree of which they are susceptible, and
                    decrease insensibly, until they arrive at the other extremity of the scale.
                    Thus, for example, the posterior w ings of insects are “introduced suddenly”
                    into the organization of that class at the highest point bf perfection in the
                    Coleoptera, where <hi rend="italic">they</hi> alone serve for flight. In the
                    Orthoptera and Hemiptera they already begin to divide their function with the
                    elytra, and go on diminishing gradually until they exišt merely as rudiments in
                    the Dιptera, where they are represented by the halteres.<note anchored="true"

                    two-winged insects. They are usually regarded as the rudiments of the second or
                    posterior pair of wings,.— halteres rudimenta alarum posticarum,” as Fabricius
                    has expressed it in his <hi rend="italic">Entomologia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophica.</hi> This opinion, however, is believed by others, and we think
                    with reason, to be founded rather on the position which these organs bear in
                    relation to the anterior wmgs, than on their connection with the metathorax and
                    its different parts. Tatreille, a great authority in such matters, maintains
                    that the balancers do not correspond to or represent the second pair of wings,
                    but are rather vesicular appendages connected with two posterior tracheae of the
                    thorax, and analogous in some measure to the processes which accompany the
                    respiratory organs of the Aphro <pb corresp="kp-eb0709-6259-0077"
                    xml:id="pbn776"/> dites, or those of the aquatic larvae of Ephemerae and the
                    genus Gyrinus. He founds his opinion chiefly on this, that the inferior wings
                    always take their origin from the lateral and anterior summits of the third
                    thoracic segment, at a very short distance from the superior wings, and always
                    in advance of the two posterior stigmata of the thorax, whilst the balancers are
                    inserted lower down at the internal extremity of these air-conduits, or close by
                    them. (See Latreille’s observations in the 7th and 8th volume of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mémoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle.)</hi></p></note> Finally,
                    they entirely disappear in the Aphaniptera. In the second instances, the organs
                    do not appear at the head of the scale in their most perfect state of
                    development, and only acquire it by degrees. Such is the case with the elytra,
                    or first pair of wings, which follow a course exactly contrary to that of the
                    inferior wings. They only appear at first as organs slightly accessory to
                    flight, in which state they remain nearly throughout the whole Coleoptera. In
                    the Orthoptera and Hemiptera they begin already to take a very active part in
                    <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129559&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=86"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-0086-0076"/> flight, but still preserve their primitive use.
                    In the Neuroptera, particularly the Libelluhna, they attain the development of
                    the inferior wings, from which they differ but very slightly. From this point
                    they continue to surpass them, until in the Diptera they become the sole organs
                    of flight, and of course have there attained their highest degree of perfection.
                    Arrived at this culminating point, they suddenly diminish in Hippobosca, and
                    entirely disappear in Pulex.</p>

                    tribes, and may be regarded as appendages of the anterior wings, the sole pair
                    in that particular order. Their attachment to the scutellum and the
                    postscutellum of the mesothorax is sufficient evidence that they are not the
                    rudiments of a posterior pair; for these, if they existed, would derive their
                    origin from the metathorax. They usually consist of two concavo-convex pieces,
                    intermediate as it were between the wing and the poisers, and folded the one
                    upon the other, like the parts of a bivalve shell when the insect is at rest,
                    but stretched or extended during flight. Their special uses are not yet
                    known.</p>
                <p>The poisers or balancers (Λα/ter«) have been sufficiently described in the
                    preceding note. Audoum regards them as the rudiments of the second pair of
                    wings, of which the extreme tenuity in the Dιptera accords in his opinion with
                    the evanescence of the metathorax.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    been satisfactorily determined. Dr Derham and others have thought that, like the
                    pole of a rope-dancer, they keep the body steady in flight; while some connect
                    them with the noises produced by insects, and maintain that they act upon the
                    membrane of the winglet, as a drumstick acts upon its proper organ, thus
                    producing sound. Shelter’s opinion is probably more correct, that they are
                    connected with the function of respiration.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Having now endeavoured to explain the structure of the wings or organs of flight,
                    we shall next request the reader’s attention to those other organs of motion,
                    the legs of insects. With the exception of the Myπapoda (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Centipedes,</hi> &amp;c.), which, with Latreille and Dr Leach, we shall form,
                    as already noted, a separate class, the number of legs in insects is precisely
                    six. They are composed of the following parts: ls⅛ The <hi rend="italic"
                    >coxa</hi> or haunch, which is the first joint, or that which plays in the
                    socket (see Plate CCXX. fig. 2, a); <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">trochanter</hi> or second joint, to the side of which the thigh is
                    attached, and by means of which it inosculates with the coxa (Ibid, <hi
                    rend="italic">b)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> 3⅛ the <hi rend="italic"
                    >femur</hi> or thigh, which is long, and usually compressed (c); 4√Λ, the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia</hi> or shank, generally the longest joint of the leg, and
                    frequently notched on its edges, and terminated by spur-hke appendages (&lt;Z);
                    <hi rend="italic">bth,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">tarsus,</hi> composed of
                    articulate portions, varying from three to five among the Coleoptera and the
                    majority of insects (e). The last articulation of the tarsus bears the <hi
                    rend="italic">ungues</hi> or claws (∕). Μ. Audouin and some other French
                    naturalists seem to use the <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> term haunch <hi
                    rend="italic">(hanche)</hi> as a collective designation, including an internal
                    portion formerly noticed, called <hi rend="italic">trochantιn,</hi> along with
                    the <hi rend="italic">rotule</hi> (our coxa), and the trochanter. In accordance
                    with this view, the parts of the leg in insects may be said to amount to six
                    pieces, instead of the five which we have just enumerated. These terms apply
                    strictly to the intermediate and hind legs. The anterior pair are by some
                    writers regarded as <hi rend="italic">brachia</hi> or arms. The first joint of
                    the brachium, answering to the coxa of the legs, is named <hi rend="italic"
                    >clavicula,</hi> or the clavicle, by Mr Kirby; its second joint, answering to
                    the trochanter of the other limbs, is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scapula</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the third and elongated joint,
                    corresponding to the femur, is designated the <hi rend="italic">humerus;</hi>
                    while the articulations of the tarsus are known as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >manus</hi> or hand. However, the majority of authors seem not to express any
                    distinction between the parts of the fore legs and those of the intermediate and
                    hind ones. The anterior pair, we may observe, are in some cases convertible into
                    organs of prehension, and their tarsi are frequently dilated in the male sex.
                    The number of articulations of the tarsi varies in the different tribes, and is
                    not always the same in the different pairs of legs in the same insect. Their
                    amount on each limb has been assumed as a basis for the formation of the great
                    sectional divisions of the coleopterous order, as originally proposed by Μ.
                    Geoffroy, and so generally adopted by the continental naturalists. The
                    character, though arbitrarily chosen, and not seldom artificial in its results,
                    has proved upon the whole more compatible with a natural arrangement than
                    usually happens on the selection of a single and uninfluential organ. We shall
                    enter into further details in relation to this matter in our introduction to the
                    coleopterous order, and shall merely observe in the mean time, that pentamerous
                    species, or those of which all the tarsi are furnished with <hi rend="italic"
                    >five</hi> articulations, are the most abundant,—more than one halt of the
                    coleopterous kinds being referable to that section.</p>

                <p>The nervous system of animals in general, it has been remarked, is one of the
                    most wonderful and mysterious works of the Creator. Its pulpy substance is the
                    visible medium by which the governing principle (To <hi rend="italic">'
                    Hγιμονι×oν)</hi> transmits its commands to the various organs of the body, which
                    instantaneously obey the impulsive mandate; yet tins appears to be but the
                    conductor of some higher principle, or <pb corresp="pbn776"
                    facs="nls:193746259?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6259-0077"/> more ethereal
                    essence (language is ransacked in vain tor an appropriate term), which can be
                    more immediately acted upon by tlιc mind and will. But this supposed principle,
                    by whatever fond or fantastical name it may be known, whether as a nervous <hi
                    rend="italic">fluid</hi> or a nervous <hi rend="italic">power,</hi> has never
                    been detected by the most subtile physiologist, and is known only by its
                    effects. It is, however, undoubtedly the centre from which all power and
                    function flow; and during the absence of worthier substitutes we need not
                    challenge the vague abstractions of some metaphysical inquirers.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of insects consists of a homogeneous pulp, usually disposed in
                    twelve successive ganglions, connected by a double cord. We first observe a
                    double or biIobed mass, which, as it is placed in the head, may be called the
                    brain. It is surrounded by strong muscles, and from its anterior portion nerves
                    arc distributed to the eyes, antennae, and mouth. Posteriorly two delicate
                    recurrent nerves proceed towards the dorsal vessel, and inferiorly two larger
                    nerves, after having formed by their branching a kind of ring, which embraces
                    the oesophagus, unite in tlιe form of a ganglion beneath the last-named organ.
                    From the posterior part of this latter ganglion a pair of nervous cords proceed
                    for a space, and then by their union produce a second inferior ganglion, from
                    which the nervous cords again branch off posteriorly, and so uniting and
                    ramifying from space to space, they extend through the different segments of the
                    thorax and abdomen. The number of these ganglia varies; sometimes they
                    correspond to the divisions of the body, while in many instances they are of
                    smaller amount. In the larva of the rhinoceros-beetle, for example, the whole
                    spinal cord (so called from its supposed analogy to the part known by that name
                    among the vertebrate kinds) presents the appearance of a single ganglion,
                    divided merely by transverse furrows,—while in that of a dragon-fly, six have
                    been observed in the thorax, and seven in the abdomen. In the great water-beetle
                    <hi rend="italic">(Hydrous</hi><hi rend="italic">piceus)</hi> the head exhibits
                    one ganglion, the thorax six, and the abdomen only two. In the honey-bee there
                    are three ganglia in the thorax, and four in the abdomen. When we examine these
                    knots attentively, we may perceive that, in addition to the double and
                    longitudinal nervous cord by which they are connected, they throw off laterally
                    on either side small nervous trunks, which divide into branches, and finally
                    ramify over the muscles, the intestinal canal, the tracheae, and other parts.
                    This nervous system differs considerably in the larva and perfect insect. In the
                    latter the ganglia are usually less numerous, and the posterior appear formed by
                    the close approximation of several others.</p>
                <p>The principal ganglia of the nervous system of insects are frequently thus
                    disposed. The position of the upper or cervical ganglion has been already
                    mentioned. The others rest beneath the intestines, ranging along the inferior
                    face of the body. There are three in what may be called the chest; that is, one
                    in the prothorax, which sends nerves to the anterior legs; one in the
                    mesothorax, which supplies the elytra or the upper wings, and the middle legs;
                    and one in the metathorax, which distributes its filaments to the second pair of
                    wings and the last pair of legs. The other ganglia belong to the abdomen.
                    Insects are characterized by the ganglionic distribution of the nervous system,
                    in common with the Crustacea and Arachnides on the one hand, and with the Vermes
                    or worms on the other. But in insects the ganglia arc larger and less numerous
                    than in the still lower tribes, which gives a more decided character of
                    centricity to their nervous system. Indeed the highest manifestation of this
                    character is usually presented only as the ultimate result of several
                    metamorphoses; so that while the larva exhibits a closer agreement with the
                    nervous system of worms, that of the imago or perfect insect assumes a higher
                    development. It does not however appear that the brain or upper ganglion of
                    insects acts in the capacity of a <hi rend="italic">sensorium</hi><hi

                    quadrupeds and birds; for many insects will live for a considerable time, and
                    even exercise their faculties of flight, after the loss of parts which among the
                    other class we justly regard as of vital importance. The tenacity of life in

                    of their heads, and replaced upon a horse, they will be perceived to run
                    backwards and forwards and sideways, with apparently the same ease as prior to
                    their decapitation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The ganglions themselves frequently exhibit a bilebed structure, which appears to

                    invertebrate animals, corresponds to the eccentric portion of that system among
                    the higher classes, that is, to the intervertebral ganglia and their
                    radiations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The relation
                    which the nervous system of invertebrate animals bears to that of the
                    vertebrated tribes has, however, given rise to many conflicting opinions. “Among
                    the various suggestions on this point, are that of Ackermann ami Reil, who
                    viewed, the nervous system of Articulata as corresponding to the sympathetic
                    system ot vertebral animals ;—of XV alther, who compared it in the Mollusca to
                    the par vagum, and in the Articulata to the spinal marrow;—the most generally
                    received opinion, however, is that supported by the authority of Meckel, Cuvier,
                    Blumenbach, Gall, and Spurzheirn, who compare it in the Articulata to the
                    cerebrospinal cord of vertebral animals. The latter gentlemen, in particular,
                    have furnished a strong proof of the correctness of this idea, by demonstrating
                    that the spinal cord of the superior animals actually consists of a series of
                    ganglia with intermediate contιactions,—a structure most fully developed in the
                    Articulata. Rudolphi <hi rend="italic">(Physiologic,</hi> b. ii. s. 8, 1823)
                    adopts the .same opinion, and notices the fact, that in Mollusca, Crustacea,
                    Insects, &amp;c. we find nerves of sense arising from the cerebral
                    ganglia,—which by no means accords with the character of the sympathetic
                    system.” (See Note to Carus’s <hi rend="italic">Comparative Anatomy,</hi> by
                    Gore, vol. i. p. 69∙) W. Weber <hi rend="italic">(Anatomia</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    appears to have been the first to suggest that the ganglia on the knotted spinal
                    cord o. articulated animals correspond to the intervertebral ganglia of the
                    spinal nerves of the higher classes, rather than to the segments of which their
                    spinal marrow is composed.</p></note> In the primitive state of larva he deems
                    the nervous system to consist of two distinct portions, a right and a left; and
                    he maintains that the formation of the nervous system in all animals proceeds
                    from the circumference to the centre, and not, as usually supposed, from the
                    centre to the circumference. We know well, from the observations of Carus and
                    Tiedeman, that the organs of the inferior animals repeat, as it were, the forms
                    which present themselves only in the <hi rend="italic">embryo</hi> condition of
                    the higher tribes. Μ. de Serres endeavours to show that it is by the progress of
                    successive developments that the portions of the nervous cord in insects
                    approach each other,—that they first join around the oesophagus, then at the
                    opposite extremity towards the inferior ganglions, and lastly in the central
                    parts. He thus admits three distinct embryo states in the condition of the
                    larvae; first, that in which the two portions of the nervous system are entirely
                    isolated and distinct; secondly, that in which the oesophagian ganglia are alone
                    united; and, thirdly, that in which the opposite extremities are joined
                    together. By means of this distinctive view, the French physiologist connects
                    the nervous system of insects with that of the Mollusca, the latter presenting
                    the embryo con-ditĩon<pb break="no" facs="nls:193746272?mode=fullsize"

                    distinguished by a characteristic which is only temporary among the articulated
                    tribes. This may probably be regarded as an additional argument in favour or
                    what we shall afterwards endeavour to maintain,—the general superiority in the
                    scale of organization of the annulose classes over the molluscous kinds. We
                    shall conclude by observing, that besides the general protection afforded by the
                    external envelope of insects to their nervous system, it is specially protected
                    by the Y-shapcd portion formerly described.</p>
                <p>As the nerves constitute the principal media of sensation in all animals, we
                    shall here give a short sketch of the different senses of the insect class.</p>
                <p>Of the senses in general, as they exist in man and the higher beings,
                    physiologists and metaphysicians alike enumerate the following <hi rend="italic"
                    >five·,</hi> viz. <hi rend="italic">touch, taste, smell, hearing,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">sight.</hi> All of these, we doubt not, exist in the class now
                    under consideration, although we are not in every ease acquainted with the
                    special organ by which each particular function is exercised.</p>
                <p>The sense of <hi rend="italic">touch</hi> is usually regarded as affording
                    animals, and man especially, a more intimate and assured communication with the
                    external world than those of either sight or hearing, in as far as no
                    intermediate substance comes between us and the subjects of perception. The
                    perfection of the sense depends on the quality of the skin, the extent and
                    nature of its surface, the number of its nerves, its freedom from insensible
                    parts, and the delicacy of those appendages which are more particularly destined
                    to the examination of bodies. As touch is the most important of all the senses,
                    it may naturally be inferred to be finely developed in the human race; and we
                    know that, of all the vertebratcd animals, man in that respect is one of the
                    most highly organized. But among the invertebrate kinds the sense of touch
                    improves in proportion as the others degenerate’; and those which have no other
                    sense possess it so exquisitely that some of them seem even to <hi rend="italic"
                    >feel the light.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Leçons</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Λnαtοιn⅛</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Compacte,</hi> sect. 14.</p></note></p>
                <p>Among insects the sense of touch varies remarkably according to the condition in
                    which they happen to exist for the time,—their exterior surface, in which the
                    function exists, or at least through which it must be manifested, being itself
                    subject to great variation, even among individuals of the same species. When
                    soft, as in the larva state, the skin is extremely delicate in its perceptions,
                    and capable of transmitting the most lively sensations; while in the imago or
                    perfect condition, more espeeially among the Coleoptera, its harder consistence
                    renders it chiefly serviceable as a protecting covering. In this case the feet,
                    palpi, and, as many suppose, the antennae, seem the principal organs of the
                    sense of touch.</p>
                <p>The sense of <hi rend="italic">taste,</hi> which some regard as an exalted
                    modification of the perception of touch, is very obvious among insects. We scc
                    many species, while searching after food, reject or only partially consume
                    whatever is disagreeable or unexpected, while they gloat over a more favourite
                    morsel. The organ in which the sense is placed is not, however, so easily
                    determined. Some regard the palpi, and others the pharynx, as its principal
                    seat. That portion of the labium which the French naturalists name the languette
                    or ligula, has also been regarded as exercising the sense of taste. It is
                    certain that distinct nerves are distributed to that quarter, as represented by
                    Lyonnet in his great work on the caterpillar of the cossus.</p>
                <p>1 he sense of <hi rend="italic">smell</hi> is exquisitely developed in the insect
                    tribes. No sooner has an animal fallen, from age or sickness, even on the
                    loneliest and most barren moor, wlrere perhaps no vestige of insect life was
                    previously perceptible, than troops of flies and carcass-eating beetles assemble
                    from every quarter, led by the emanation of the tainted air.</p>
                <p>It was in truth the influence of the sense of smell that in ancient times no
                    doubt gave rise to so many erroneous ideas regarding the origin of insect life.
                    Every animal body in a state of decay being seen to present a crowd of small
                    larvae or worms, these were regarded as the <hi rend="italic">produce</hi> of
                    corruption, whereas they resulted naturally, and according to the usual course,
                    from eggs previously deposited by parent flies or beetles, which had been
                    attracted by the putrid effluvia. It is not two hundred years since Redi proved
                    for the first time, by conclusive experiments, that this was true. It is also
                    known that bees will discover and hover around a box containing honey, though
                    their prized treasure is screened from sight; and both flies and beetles are so
                    affected by the perceptions of this sense, that even their peculiar and all but
                    unerring instincts are occasionally deceived by its influence. They will deposit
                    their eggs on plants which are characterized by a foetid smell (for example, on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Phallus</hi><hi rend="italic">impudicus),</hi> misled by
                    the resemblance of their flesh-like odour, which the experience of the sense of
                    sight cannot rectify.</p>
                <p>The scent of many flowers is cadaverous, and is thus the means of assembling
                    around their deceptive petals numerous insects which feed on putrid matter. It
                    is thus that the spathes of the <hi rend="italic">Arum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dracunculus,</hi> and the corolla of the <hi rend="italic">Stapelia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">variegata,</hi> are frequently found covered by Silphae,
                    flesh-flies, and other species, which not only attempt to feed upon them, but
                    also deposit their eggs in what they conceive to be a fitting station. But the
                    seat of this indispensable faculty is likewise still involved in obscurity. On a
                    subject so difficult of solution, and which can only be solved by a consummate
                    knowledge of anatomical structure, viewed in relation to the uses of physiology,
                    it would not become us to offer an opinion, or do more than report the
                    sentiments of those who are ncccssarily more experienced than ourselves. Many
                    agree with Dumeril in maintaining that in insects the sense of smell is
                    effected, as among the higher animals, through media in very intimate connection
                    with the process of respiration; in other words, that either the <hi
                    rend="italic">tracheoe</hi> or stigmatic openings are the seat of its exercise.
                    Others again suppose, that for the exercise of so important a function, a more
                    special and concentrated organ is required; and proceeding upon the analogical
                    relation of mere position, they regard the antennae as its seat. These receive
                    the first pair of nerves, and so far correspond to the olfactory organs of the
                    higher animals, which are likewise connected with the brain by means of the
                    first pair. The question is one which is extremely difficult of detcrmination,
                    especially in reference to the singular experiments of Huber on bees, which <hi
                    rend="italic">go</hi> far to prove that the sense of smell, at least in these
                    hymenopterous species, is placed in the cavity of the mouth.</p>
                <p>Christian maintained that insects exercised the sense of smell in relation to
                    distant objects through their antcnnae, and in regard to near ones by means of
                    their palpi; while Compareţti imagines that in the different tribes of insects
                    different instruments are subservient to that end. Cuvier, at least in his
                    earlier works (and we are not aware of any recorded change in his sentiments)
                    favoured the opinion aheady alluded to regarding the respiratory organs. “As the
                    organ of smell,” he observes, “in all animals which respire air, is situated at
                    the entrance of the organs of respiration, the most probable conjecture that has
                    been proposed<pb break="no" facs="nls:193746285?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-6285-0079"/> respecting its seat in insects, is that of
                    Baster, since revived by several naturalists, who placed it in the mouths of the
                    tracheae or air-tubes. In addition to the reasons hitherto stated in support of
                    this opinion, we may observe that the internal membrane of the tracheae appears
                    very well calculated to perform this office, being soft and moistened, and that
                    the insects in which the tracheae enlarge, and form numerous or considerable
                    vesicles, are those which seem to possess the most perfect sense of smell. Such
                    are the Scarabaei, flies, bees, &amp;c. The antennae, which other anatomists
                    have supposed to be the seat of smell in nsects, do not appear to us to possess
                    any of the conditions for that organ.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>Huber’s experiments, undertaken with a view to ascertain the seat of smell in
                    bees, consisted in presenting successively to all parts of their bodies a hair
                    pencil dipt in oil of turpentine, an article which they particularly abominate.
                    When made to approximate the head, trunk, or abdomen, it produced no particular
                    effect, and the υdour appeared to be equally disregarded by the antennae and
                    proboscis. But when he brought the point of a fine hair pencil saturated in the
                    oil almost into contact with the cavity of the mouth, above the insertion of the
                    proboscis, the bee started back in an instant, quitted its food, clapped its
                    wings, and would have taken immediate flight had not the pencil been removed. A
                    repetition of the experiment produced the same signs of discomposure; and
                    similar results, but more prompt and sure, follov∙ed the use of oil of marjoram.
                    The indefatigable Genevese observer then stopt up the mouths of several bees
                    with paste, which soon became ccmparatively hard and dry. Irrthis state they
                    were quite insensible to those odours which had previously produced such painful
                    effects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Mr Kirby maintains an opinion different from any we have yet alluded to, though
                    more allied to the last than to the others. As the nose of an insect evidently
                    corresponds with the part so named in the Mammalia, not only in its situation,
                    but frequently in its form, and as a constant connection may be observed to
                    obtain between the senses of smell and taste, he felt convinced in the first
                    place that the argument from analogy was wholly in favour of the nose, or
                    anterior portion of the head formerly mentioned under that name. The common
                    burying beetle <hi rend="italic">(Necrophorus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vespillo'}</hi> is an insect remarkable for its extreme accuracy and acuteness
                    of smell. While examining the nose of this nsect, Mr Kirby observed in the
                    middle of its anterior part a subtrapezoidal space, as it were cut out and
                    filled with a paler piece of a softer and more membranous texture. On dividing
                    the head horizontally, he perceived beneath the nose, and partly under the space
                    just mentioned, which he calls the <hi rend="italic">rhinarium</hi> or nostril
                    piece, a pair of circular pulpy cushions, covered by a membrane transversely
                    striated with beautifully fine lines. These are what our learned author regards
                    as the organs of smell, and he noted that they remained distinctly visible in a

                    >Hearing</hi> is perceptibly acute in some insects, and of more doubtful
                    existence in others. The frequent and various sounds to which many species give
                    utterance have been adduced in proof of their being endowed with this·
                    perception; for we cannot but suppose that the shrill voice of the grasshopper,
                    and the evening song of the cricket, are subservient to some essential end,
                    which they cannot well be if unheard by their blythe companions. The small
                    wood-devouring beetle called the death-tick <hi rend="italic">(Aηobium),</hi>
                    answers its neighbour’s call as regularly as a cock crows a response to its
                    pugnacious rival; and Derham, when he kept these insects in captivity, by
                    imitating their tiny call, could make them click when he pleased. What, is
                    called the voice in insects is usually produced by the friction of certain hard
                    and horny parts of the limbs upon some other portion of the body of a like
                    consistence. In others it is effected by a rapid vibration of the wings; and a
                    few beetles seem to give utterance to a shrill and sometimes plaintive cry by
                    rubbing the terminal segments of the abdomen against the curved points of the
                    elytra. This power of voice, as we call it for want of a better name, is often
                    possessed by the males alone; and as it is used as a call of love in spring and
                    summer (most obviously so among the C cadae), we infer the sense of hearing in
                    the females of that family, and consequently in the class of insects.</p>
                <p>Brunelli kept some large green grasshoppers <hi rend="italic">(AErida
                    vi-τidissim(i)</hi> in confinement. They used to sing all day in a closet, but
                    ceased when any one gave a rap upon the door. He learned by degrees to imitate
                    their chirping call. At first a few of the boldest would answer him, and then
                    gradually the whole band would strike in and sing with all their might. On one
                    occasion he inclosed a male in his garden, and gave the female her liberty; but
                    no sooner did the husband begin to solace his captivity with a song than his
                    quondam partner recognised the accustomed voice, and flew towards him without
                    delay.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lehmann, <hi

                    the following curious observation. “Since there is nothing in the constitution
                    of the atmosphere to prevent vibrations much more frequent than any of which we
                    are conscious, we may imagine that animals like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grylli,</hi> whose powers appear to commence nearly where ours terminate, may
                    have the faculty of hearing still sharper sounds, which at present we do not
                    know to exist; and that there may be other insects, hearing nothing in common
                    with us, but endued with a power of exciting, and a sense that perceives,
                    vibrations indeed of the same nature as those which constitute our ordinary
                    sounds, but so remote that the animals who perceive them may be said to possess
                    another sense, agreeing with ours solely in the medium by which it is excited,
                    and possibly wholly unaffected by those slower vibrations of which we are
                    sensible.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>The precise position, however, of the organ of hearing in insects has not been
                    determined with precision. In the Crustacea it is found at the base of the large
                    antennae; and Latreille has satisfied himself of its existence in a similar
                    situation in an orthopterous insect called <hi rend="italic">Gryllus
                    lineola.</hi> Mr Kirby is of opinion that the <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> use
                    of the antennae is to exercise a function analogous to that of hearing, and Mr
                    Rennie entertains a similar sentiment.</p>
                <p>The sense of <hi rend="italic">sight</hi> is too obvious in this class to require
                    demonstration. The eyes of insects are, however, of a very different nature and
                    construction from the exquisitely formed visual organs of the higher tribes.
                    They consist of two kinds, the <hi rend="italic">composite</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">simple.</hi> T ∣e latter, known under a certain form likewise by

                <p>The composite eyes generally form, as it were, the lateral portions of the head.
                    They are either entire, notched, or even occasionally so completely divided by a
                    little corneous stalk, as to exhibit (for example in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gyrinus)</hi> the appearance of a pair on either side. In other respects theiι
                    forms are extremely variable—their surfaces more 01 less convex. These compound
                    eyes are composed externally of a hard and transparent membrane (softer in the
                    dipterous tribes), which presents an infinity of small hexagonal surfaces,
                    disposed with the most exquisite regularity. This peculiar structure prevails
                    equally on the concave or inteι-nal, as on the convex or external surface. The
                    structure and composition of the eyes of insects have been carefully studied and
                    explained by Leeuwenhoeck, Swammerdam, Cuvier, and more lately and laboriously
                    by Marcel de Serres. We shall here avail ourselves of the <hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">st,</hi> a cornea (convex in proportion to the carnivorous habits
                    of the species), transparent, hard, thickişh, generally encased in a groove of
                    the head, and exhibiting many thousand regularly disposed, hexagonal facettes,
                    each of which is in itself a perfeet eye. These are sometimes so numerous that
                    not fewer than 34,650 lenses have been counted in the head of a butterfly, and
                    the coleopterous genus <hi rend="italic">Dynastes</hi> of Macleay is supposed to
                    be still more wonderfully and exuberantly supplied. 2√, An opaque, slightly
                    liquid matter, variously coloured, frequently deep violet or black, but
                    sometimes red or green, tenaciously adherent to the inner face of the cornea,
                    and distinct from the deep-black varnish of the choroid. It is by no means rare
                    to observe various colours united in the same eye, which then appears
                    beautifully mottled, as in many species of the orthopterous, neuropterous, and
                    dipterous orders. These tints, however brilliant in the living state, speedily
                    vanish after death. They are always owing to this peculiar coating of the
                    cornea. <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> A true choroid, covered by a dark varnish,
                    which may be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">pigmentum nigrum.</hi> The
                    lynx-eyed Swammerdam failed to distinguish this coating from that of the cornea;
                    but, in the opinion of Marcel de Serres, it is really different. The choroid and
                    its pigment do not always exist in insects. They are wanting in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Blattae,</hi> and in all the lucifugous or light shunning species,
                    such as those of the genera <hi rend="italic">Plops,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Tenebrio,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pedinus.</hi> In these cases, it has been
                    remarked that the covering of the cornea is much deeper than usual. The choroid
                    membrane is fixed by its circumference to all the margin of the cornea, of which
                    it follows the contour, and is intimately connected with the tracheae, which are
                    there so numerous, <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> Air vessels which play an
                    important part. They take their rise from larger trunks which are situated in
                    the head, and form around the eyc a circular trachea, which sends forth an
                    infinity of branches, producing by bifurcation a number of isosceles triangles.
                    These triangles, of which the base is outwards, are placed around the optic
                    cone, and receive, in each angular interval which separates their summits, a
                    nervous filament, which traverses the choroid, and reaches the external surface
                    of the covering of the cornea. Ί he assemblage of tracheae and nervous threads
                    forms at the circumference of the eye a peculiar kind of network, of which the
                    aspect is beautiful to look upon. The tracheae themselves are so abundant on the
                    choιoid, that that membrane appears to be composed of them; and it may also be
                    noted, that in those genera in which the choroid is wanting, the circular
                    trachea is likewise absent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    a principal branch which, after proceeding immediately from the brain <hi

                    cir- <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> cular trachea, or traverses the fibres of
                    the abductor muscle of the mandibles. This branch soon augments in volume, and
                    forms a kind of cone more or less extended, of which the base is towards the
                    transparent cornea. Numerous nérves proceed from that base, mingle with the
                    tracheae of the choroid, traverse both that membrane and its pigment, penetrate
                    the lining of the cornea, and finally terminate each on a facette of the
                    transparent cornea, so that the nervous filaments are thus immediately in
                    contact with the light, which reaches them after having traversed only tlιe
                    last-named organ. This disposition of the nervous threads, which thus constitute
                    as many small retinae as there are facettes in the cornea of the eye, is very
                    distinguishable in <hi rend="italic">Libellula, Truxalis,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Gryllus.</hi> The eyes of insects, then, contain no humours
                    properly so called,— neither vitreous nor crystalline,—and vision is
                    consequently much more simple with them than with the vertebrated tribes, in
                    which the nerves are placed deeper in the eye, and do not receive the rays of
                    light till these have passed through media of different densities.</p>
                <p>The simple or <hi rend="italic">stemmatic eyes</hi> of insects are usually three
                    in number, and are placed on the crown of the head, between the genuine organs
                    of sight, from which their structure differs. In spite of their extreme
                    minuteness, Marcel de Serres has succeeded in detecting the following component
                    parts. ∙1sr, A transparent cornea, formed by an external membrane, hard, convex
                    externally, and smooth, that is, exhibiting no appearance of facettes. 2r∕, Of a
                    variously-coloured matter, which lines the internal faee of the cornea, but
                    which is perhaps not essentially distinct from the varnish of the choroid. It
                    varies in colour, being almost always black in Hymenoptera, usually whitish in
                    Orthoptera, and, in many caterpillars, yellow, red, or green. <hi rend="italic"
                    >3d,</hi> A kind of choroid, rather thick, more extended on the surface than the
                    cornea itself, sometimes of a black colour, more frequently red, and
                    occasionally of a peculiar whitish hue. <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> Tracheae,
                    which do not derive their origin from a circular air vessel, and do not, as it
                    were, constitute the choroid, but appear to be distributed over its surface. <hi
                    rend="italic">5th,</hi> Nerves proceeding either directly from the brain or
                    upper ganglion, or from another more considerable nerve or common trunk,
                    according as these simple eyes are separate from each other, as in perfect
                    insects, or closely approached, as among larvae. In their passage towards the
                    eyes they are attached to the neighbouring parts by tracheae or air vesicles,
                    and do not appear to present any swelling; they pass between the motive muscles
                    of the different parts of the head, traverse the choroid and its varnish, and
                    expand upon the internal face of the cornea, where they are surrounded by the
                    layer of pigment belonging to that membrane. Thus, on examining the simple or
                    stemmatic eyes of insects, and proceeding írom the circumference to the centre,
                    we meet with a transparent cornea,—a pigment, which lines its inner face,—∙ the
                    termination of the optic nerves,—the pigment of the choroid, when distinct from
                    that of the cornea,—and the choroid itself, which frequently rests upon a large
                    trachea. The principal character of these simple eyes consists in this, that
                    each is a single organ, whereas the composite eyes, as the name implies, are
                    formed by the union of many. 1he one kind is most characteristic of the larva
                    state, the other of the perfect insect; but several orders, even in the
                    last-mentioned condition, possess both organs.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746311?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6311-0081"/>
                <p>Thus, with few exceptions, the Orthoptera, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Neuroptera,
                    and Diptera, possess both simple and compound eyes. Dr Carus however states that
                    the stemmata do not exist either in beetles or butterflies; a most erroneous
                    opinion in regard to the latter, in which tlιey exist universally, although not
                    always detected; and incorrect as to the former, in several of which they have

                <p>Although neither Linnaeus nor Fabricius, those great masters in the science, gave
                    any explanation of the uses of the stemmata, there can be no doubt that
                    Swammerdam and Réaumur were correct in regarding them as genuine eyes.<note

                    objects close at hand. Blumenbach is also of opinion that the polyhedral eyes
                    are for viewing distant objects, and the simple ones for such as are near.<note

                    measure confirmed by the fact, that while most insects in the perfect state have
                    large compound eyes, caterpillars and other larvae have usually small myopic
                    ones. On the other hand, the Mole cricket (<hi rend="italic">Grfilοtalpa),</hi>
                    a truly subterranean species, is furnished with both kinds. Réaumur’s
                    experiments on the visual organs of bees are extremely important in relation to
                    our present subject. He smeared the compound eyes with paint, when the insects,
                    instead of directing their flight towards the hive, ascended in the air till

                    and placing his patients near their hive, they winged their way on all sides
                    among the surrounding flowers, but neither ascended into the air, nor flew’ far
                    from home. From thcsc experiments it has been supposed that the compound eyes
                    are for horizontal sight, and the stemmatic for vertical.<note anchored="true"

                    IN INSECTS.</p>
                <p>Though insects respire air, they do not receive it, like the majority of
                    vertebrated animals, through nostrils or other orifices in the head, but by
                    means of numerous small openings along the sides of the body, and which lead not
                    to lungs, but to a system of air vessels ramified <hi rend="italic">ad
                    infinitum</hi> through every part of the body. The respiratory organs of this
                    class are composed of <hi rend="italic">stigmata, tracheae,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">bronchiae.</hi> The first, called also spiracles or breathing
                    pores, consist of small perforations of various forms, placed along the lateral
                    portions of the body, and generally incased externally in a small corneous ring,
                    though sometimes pierced in the membrane which separates the dorsal from the
                    ventral surface. These stigmatic openings occur both on the thorax and abdomen,
                    and lead inwards to the tracheae. Their number varies according to the species,
                    and even in the same species according to the temporary condition of the
                    individual. They are wanting on the second and third segments of the body ot the
                    larva; and as it is from these segments that the wings are developed, Μ. de
                    Blainville has been induced, probably by that circumstance, to regard the organs
                    of flight as reversed and expanded tracheae. The existence, however, of
                    stigmatic openings on the thorax of the perfect insect simultaneously with the
                    wings, militates against this theory; for if these parts were convertible, would
                    they not be likewise each exclusive of the other?</p>
                <p>Parallel with the sides of the body of most insects, and extending its whole
                    length, run two cylindrical tubes, which communicate with the spiracles, and
                    give issue, at points opposite to those organs, to other tubes, the
                    ramifications of which are distributed over all the membranes, penetrate the
                    muscles, and pervade even the legs and wings. They also envelope the dorsal
                    vessel and digestive organs, and demonstrate that the ultimate aim of
                    respiration is assimilation, or the increase and reproduction of organic
                    molecules, by the decomposition of food. The first of these tubes are called the
                    tracheae, the latter the bronchiae. This structure, however, cannot be regarded
                    as universal, as in many of the lamellicorn beetles the bronchiae spring
                    directly from the spiracles, the interior mouth of which is lined by a membrane
                    from which they proceed.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p><hi rend="italic">Introd, to Ent.</hi> vol. iv. p. 61.</p></note> But a
                    volume would scarcely suffice to describe the beautifully varied features of the
                    respiratory system in insects. Among those tribes especially which pass their
                    early stages under water, the changes in form and position in these organs
                    cannot be sufficiently admired. Several common species of gnat, the larvae of
                    which abound during the summer season in all our ponds and marshes, will afford
                    a familiar illustration. When one of these is examined, a singular tunnel-shaped
                    organ, terminating in a radiated point like a star, will be perceived, forming
                    an angle with the penultimate segment of the body. In the interior of this organ
                    is a tube, which conveys the air to the tracheae, and communicates with the
                    atmosphere by means of several perforations in the centre of the star. The
                    diverging rays of the star suspend the animal at the surface of the water, with
                    its head downwards, till it wishes to descend. It has no sooner assumed the pupa
                    state, than the respiratory tail disappears, and the insect (still an inhabitant
                    of the water) then breathes through two projecting horns, each resembling a
                    little cornucopia, which proceed from the upper part of the trunk. Ere long the
                    skin of the pupa bursts asunder, and the perfect gnat, or winged insect, makes
                    its appearance, with neither caudal nor thoracic appendages, but breathing by
                    means of numerous lateral pores (the stigmata above mentioned), after the usual
                    manner. The <hi rend="italic">rat-tailed worm</hi> in this respect is still more
                    extraordinary. In the larva state it breathes through a tail formcd of
                    retractile tubes, like a telescope, and capable of being extended many times the
                    length of the body. This also terminates in a star-like process, which, when
                    viewed in a strong light, forms a perceptible dimple on the surface of the
                    water; and as the body of the insect lies in the mud below, the tail is
                    contracted or extended according to the varying depth of its stagnant
                    habitation. On assuming the pupa state, in which it is no longer an aquatic
                    animal, the respiratory tail is cast off, and its function performed by four
                    horns, which spring from the upper part of the thorax. It afterwards becomes one
                    of those bee-like flies so remarkable for the rapid vibratory movement of their
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746324?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6324-0082"/>
                    wings, by which, during calm sunshine, they are often seen suspended in the air
                    like hawks, without any perceptible motion. In this last stage respiration is
                    carried on by spiracles or breathing-pores.</p>

                <p>SYSTEM, OF INSECTS.</p>
                <p>W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> e shall next endeavour to explain the
                    construction and physiological uses of the organ known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">dorsal vessel. .</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> use of the heart of animals is the elaboration
                    of the nutritive fluid by which the general system is strengthened and
                    sustained; its <hi rend="italic">secondary</hi> use is to effect the circulation
                    of that fluid, a process by which important changes are produced in its nature
                    or attributes. The dorsal vessel, which corresponds to the heart in insects,
                    certainly effects the primary purpose; its performance of the secondary one is,
                    as we shall see, a matter of greater dubiety.</p>
                <p>When an insect is dissected with due precaution from its inferior surface, and we
                    remove the nervous system, which first presents itself, and then the intestines
                    and other viscera, we shall observe running along the back, a peculiar vessel,
                    of which the most obvious powers are those of contraction and dilatation. It is
                    of a cylindrical form, narrowed at either end, and extends from the head to the
                    anal extremity. This constitutes the <hi rend="italic">heart,</hi> frequently so
                    called, of the class of insects. A closer examination shows that it is composed
                    of two membranes, one internal and muscular, the other external and cellular,
                    and pervaded by a close interlacement of tracheae or air-vessels. When opened,
                    its interior presents a transparent coagulable liquid, which dries rapidly, and
                    then exhibits the aspect of gum, of a colour seldom deeply defined, but
                    sometimes greenish, orange yellow, or sombre brown. Masses of fat frequently
                    surround this vessel, and partake of the tint by which it is pervaded. If, as
                    Marcel de Serres has noted, the <hi rend="italic">dorsal vessel</hi> (for so
                    this organ is often named) were a genuine heart, or centre of a circulating
                    system, it would be necessarily open at one or other of its extremities, and
                    would present vascular ramifications in certain points of its extent. But,
                    according to the minute and laborious investigations of the last-named author,
                    no such openings arc observable. The same view was taken by Swammerdam; and
                    Lyonnet, so unrivalled in his examination of the structure of insects, was
                    foiled in his attempts to demonstrate -the ramifications of the dorsal vessel.
                    Comparctti no doubt took another view of the subject; and if the assurance of
                    his readers was equal to his own, less suspicion would exist of the possibility
                    of his having mistaken biliary for sanguineous vessels.</p>
                <p>Anatomists, however, are greatly divided in opinion regarding the essential
                    nature of this organ. It has been dissected and injected by Mareel de Serres in
                    a variety of species; but in none could he discover its divisions or
                    ramifications. Even when he removed it entirely from the insect, no drop of the
                    liquid which it contained was observed to escape, which he thinks it must have
                    done on the cutting away of open vessels during dissection, had - these existed.
                    The <hi rend="italic">beating</hi> of this dorsal vessel was not explicable,
                    otherwise than by the contraction of its tissue, or the movement of the fluid
                    which it contained; and such movement was not itself conceivable except in the
                    case of circulation, which the alleged closure and non-division of the organ
                    forbade us to suppose. Its contractions also appeared irregular, and scarcely
                    ever isochronic; that is, the same number of pulsations, if they may be so
                    called, did not take place in an equal time. They varied singularly in different
                    species. Thirty-six per minute were counted in the caterpillar of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Pavonia Major,</hi> eighty-two at least in grasshoppers, and a
                    hundred and forty in one of the ground bees. While endeavouring to discover the
                    cause of these contractions, Marcel de Serres came to the conclusion that they
                    bore a relation, 1≠ to the quantity of adipose tissue by which they were
                    surrounded; 2√Zy, to the energy of the muscular fibres which were inserted on
                    the vessel, and were the means of fixing it to the rings of the abdomen; 3√Zy,
                    to the number of tracheae or air conduits by which it was supplied. He was not
                    of opinion that the nerves exercised any strongly marked influence on these
                    contractions, although we know that special nerves arc directed to the dorsal
                    vessel. The fact, however, which he deemed the most clearly established, was the
                    influential action of the muscles. When any of these were removed, the
                    pulsations became less frequent,—on a farther removal they still diminished; and
                    when the muscles were almost all withdrawn, the pulsations ceased. The
                    appropriate function of this disputed organ, according to the last-named author,
                    is the secretion of fat. Baron Cuvier also denies to it the character of a
                    genuine heart.</p>
                <p>Meckel and Herold, on the other hand, regard the dorsal vessel as a heart, and
                    they conceive that the use of its movement is to agitate the fluid contained in
                    the cavity of the insect’s body; but they do not admit the existence of
                    posterior or anterior openings for the reception or rejection of that fluid. It
                    is long since Lyonnet informed us that it contained a gummy matter of an orange
                    colour; and some recent observations have led Latreille to admit the existence
                    of certain very minute accessory vessels. In addition, however, to the fact that
                    this circulation must be extremely partial, insects would still greatly differ
                    in that respect from the Crustacea, inasmuch as the blood does not return to the
                    heart. Herold is of opinion that the triangular muscles of the dorsal vessel
                    serve for its dilatation, while the systole movements are effected by the
                    muscular fibres, which form the proper tunic. Straus is also of opinion that the
                    dorsal vessel is the true heart in the class of inseets, and that it serves, as
                    in the higher animals, as the motive organ of the blood, which, however, instead
                    of being contained in vessels, permeates in the general cavity of the body.
                    According to his views, it terminates anteriorly by a single unramified artery,
                    which conveys the blood to the head, where it pours it out, and from whence it
                    returns again to the abdomen, to re-enter the dorsal vessel. He thus limits the
                    circulating system of insects to a single artery without branches (there are not
                    any veins); and he combats the sentiments of Herold regarding the muscular
                    nature of the wings of the heart, which, he maintains, are only simple fibrous
                    ligaments, by which it is maintained in its proper place. The heart itself, that
                    is, the abdominal portion of the vessel, he describes as divided interiorly into
                    eight successive chambers (as in the common cockchafer, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Melolonthα vulgaris),</hi> separated from each other by two convergent
                    valvules, which permit the transmission of the blood or circulating fluid from
                    behind forwards, and from one chamber to another, up to the artery which
                    conducts it to the head, but prevent its retrograde motion. Towards the lateral
                    and anterior portion of each chamber arc two transverse fissures, which
                    communicate with tlιe abdominal cavity, and through which the blood contained in
                    the latter enters the heart. Each of these apertures is provided internally with
                    a little semicircular valve, which presses on it during the systole of the
                    organ. When the posterior chamber dilates, the fluid contained in the abdominal
                    cavity penetrates into it by the transverse fissures, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >auriculo-veηtriculaires</hi> by Μ. Straus. When the chamber contracts, the
                    blood, unable to return into the abdominal cavity, forces the ŵZer-ventricular
                    valve, and passes into the second chamber, which dilates to receive it, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193746337?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6337-0083"/>
                    along with an additional quantity which enters by the true •
                    auriculo-ventricular openings. The second chamber then contracts in a similar
                    manner, and forces the fluid into the third, which at the same time also
                    receives a supply from the lateral openings; and thus the blood is forced from
                    one chamber to another by successive contractions, till it reaches the artery.
                    These are said to constitute the movements so distinctly perceptible through the
                    dorsal skin of many caterpillars.</p>
                <p>Mr Bowerbank has recently published some observations on the circulation of the
                    blood in insects.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Entomological Magazine,</hi> No. III. p∙ 239.</p></note> The
                    instance detailed was that of the larva of an Ephemera <hi rend="italic"
                    >{E.</hi><hi rend="italic">marginata).</hi> In fixing the insect for examination
                    (under water), especial care must be taken not to compress the body, which
                    impedes or interrupts the circulation of the lateral vessels, and that of the
                    tail, legs, and antennae. When the larva is fixed, with its dorsal aspect
                    towards the observer, a truly beautiful sight is said to present itself. The
                    blood, abounding in flattened oat-shaped particles, will be seen circulating in
                    every part of the body, not in a continuous stream, but at regular points, in
                    accordance with the pulsations of the great dorsal vessel. The latter, which is
                    of great comparative magnitude, extends nearly the whole length of the body, and
                    is furnished at regular intervals with double valves, nearly equal in amount to
                    the segments of the body. Both above and below each of these sets of valves
                    there is a pair of irregular-looking appendages, which are probably nervous
                    ganglions, auxiliary to the motions of the vessel, but so extremely translucent
                    as to be scarcely definable in their form, even through the medium of the
                    highest power which we can apply. The action of the valves is singularly
                    interesting. While in their greatest state of collapse, the point of the lower
                    valve is seen closely compressed within the upper one. At the commencement of
                    the expansion of the artery, the blood is seen flowing in from the lateral
                    aperture, and at the same time the stream in the artery commences its ascent.
                    When it has nearly attained its greatest state of expansion, the sides of the
                    lower valve are forced upwards by the increased flow of the blood from the
                    section below the valve, the lateral openings are closed, and the main current
                    of the blood is projected through the two valves. The structure of the upper
                    valve appears to consist of a duplication inwards and upwards of the inner coat
                    of the artery; that of the under, of a contraction and projection of the like
                    parts of a portion of the artery beneath, so as to come within the grasp of the
                    lower part of the valve above it. The exterior portion or continuation of the
                    artery is perceptible in the form of an exceedingly fine and transparent
                    membrane. The so-called blood does not appear to be confined within any specific
                    vessels prior to its entering the lateral openings just mentioned, because, as
                    soon as they expand, the particles are seen converging towards them. The whole
                    of the fluid received throughout the course of the dorsal vessel is conveyed to
                    the extremity of the anterior part of the body, where the vessel makes a curve
                    inwards, and is lost to view. To all appearance the main current of the blood is
                    now discharged into the cavity of the body, as it is seen pursuing its course
                    downwards in a wide-spreading stream on each side, and beneath the dorsal
                    vessel. As it descends, portions are again absorbed by the valves of the large
                    vessel, while at the same time smaller vessels pass down each side of the body,
                    and convey another portion of blood to the lower extremity. These lesser vessels
                    have perceptible boundaries, and are certainly not portions of the great
                    abdominal cavity. They communicate at each junction of the segments of the body
                    with that cavity, as a part of the fluid they convey is discharged at those
                    points, to supply the place of what is absorbed by the valves of the dorsal
                    vessel, into the lower end of which they empty their contents. In the caudal
                    extremity the ascending and descending vessels are seen, like vein and artery,
                    to accompany each other, and at the same moment that the fluid passes up the one
                    with the usual pulsatory motion, it descends the other. There is, however, no
                    perceptible pulsation of these minuter vessels themselves, and the motion of
                    their fluids therefore results from the action of the great dorsal heart.</p>
                <p>“Next to the larvae of the Ephemera marginata,” Mr Bowerbank observes, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ii</hi> the larvae of Agrion afford the best view of the
                    blood and its circulation. In all the species of these larvae I have yet
                    examined, I have found it as nearly similar as possible in appearance to that
                    which we observe in the Ephemera, and in some instances it has afforded even
                    more satisfactory results. The head of this larva is much more transparent than
                    that of the larva of the Ephemera; we therefore have a better view of the
                    circulation of the blood in the head of this insect than can possibly be
                    obtained in the other. In this object the blood is seen rushing like a beautiful
                    intermittent fountain towards the mouth, and dividing right and left into two
                    jets, a portion of each of which flows within a given boundary past the back of
                    the eye, whilst the remainder winds its way through other channels, deep in the
                    side of the head, and returns again into the body. The antennae of this insect
                    also afford another beautiful instance of the circulation being carried forward
                    within well-defined vessels. They are each composed of six joints, up four of
                    which the blood is seen to take its course; and turning round the extremity of
                    the fourth joint, it returns by a distinct vessel into the head. In the leg,
                    likewise, the circulating fluid and its vessels are clearly and distinctly to be
                    traced, even to the very extremity of the tarsus, where, as in the antennae, the
                    particles of the blood are seen to descend on the one side of the leg, and,
                    turning the extreme point, to return up the contrary side to the one by which
                    they come down. I regret much that I have not yet had an opportunity of
                    examining the Ephemera in its perfect state; but in two species of Culex, one of
                    which was first observed and brought to me by my friend Mr Tulley, I have seen
                    the great dorsal vessel performing its functions in a manner similar in every
                    respect to its appearance in the larvae of Ephemera, Agrion, &amp;c. &amp;c.;
                    but, from the body of the fly being more opaque than that of the larvae, and
                    nearly covered with its striated scales, neither the valves nor the particles of
                    the blood could be detected. On another occasion, after having carefully cleared
                    the wings of Phlogophora meticulosa of their coloured scales, both Mr Samouelle
                    and myself clearly saw a fluid pass down the side of one of the principal ribs
                    of the wing. We may therefore, I think, fairly conclude, that the circulation is
                    carried forward in the perfect insect as well as in the larva, although,
                    perhaps, not with so much vigour as when young and growing.”<note

                <p>The writer whose observations we have just quoted, inclines to the opinion that a
                    much greater portion of the circulation than we can clearly define is carried on
                    within special vessels, as the blood may be frequently seen flowing in curved
                    and other lines, as if confined within very narrow limits. These streams,
                    however, are generally so deeply seated amidst the muscles and intestines as
                    totally to prevent their boundaries from being clearly seen. The blood itself is
                    in fact a perfectly colourless and transparent fluid, rendered visible only by
                    its containing a number of oat-shaped particles; and even the great dorsal
                    vessel cannot<pb break="no" facs="nls:193746350?mode=fullsize"

                    great power, and, under the most favourable circumstances, exhibits defined
                    limits with certainty only when in motion. A singular coincidence is observable
                    between the flattened particles of the blood of insects, and the circular double
                    concave plates in that of man, namely, that the former, in common with the
                    latter, assume a globular form immediately on coming into contact with
                    water.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The reader will be able to judge, from the preceding notices, of the diversified
                    opinions still entertained regarding the circulation of the blood in insects. We
                    shall conclude with a short account of Dr Carus’s observations, which many
                    consider as the first of a satisfactory and conclusive nature on the subject. Mr
                    Spence, the accomplished coadjutor of Mr Kirby, having had the advantage, at a
                    pretty recent period, of witnessing some of the most striking facts on which the
                    Dresden physician rests his views, transmitted an account of them to an English
                    periodical. “The first insect,” he observes, “to which Dr Carus directed my
                    attention was the larva of <hi rend="italic">Ephemera</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vulgata</hi> (or an allied species), in which, near to the branchiae, and
                    parallel with each side of the body, was very distinctly visible a constant
                    current, towards the tail, of oblong globules, swimming in a transparent fluid,
                    propelled with a regular pulsating motion; and in cutting the body of the larva
                    across, near the tail, these globules were most plainly seen pushed out of the
                    divided vessels in a distinct mass, which increased at each pulsation. I cannot
                    express the pleasure which it gave me to see thus clearly this ocular
                    demonstration of one of the most important physiological discoveries of modern
                    times; and my gratification was heightened by the next object which Dr Carus
                    placed before his microscope, viz. a specimen of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Semblis</hi><hi rend="italic">viridis,</hi> in which precisely the same
                    phenomena, but if possible more clearly, were seen in the nervures of the wings,
                    and in the antennae, in both which the constant current of globules was most
                    apparent; and in the former, the sudden turning of these globules at the apex of
                    the wing, out of the exterior nervure, into a central one, with which it joins
                    and forms an acute angle, was equally curious and striking. On cutting off the
                    end of the antennae, precisely the same emission of globules (which soon assume
                    a greenish tint) took place as in the former case, forming a mass which was
                    increased with a sudden gush at each pulsation.”<note anchored="true"

                    movements, without affecting the transparency of the medium.</p>
                <p>SECT. IV OF THE ADIPOSE TISSUE OF INSECTS.</p>
                <p>Insects are abundantly supplied with an adipose substance or fatty matter, which
                    may be mentioned in this place with the more propriety, as many consider it a
                    secretion from the dorsal vessel. It is spread over the viscera and in the
                    splanchnic cavities; and although its aspect varies, it seems to consist
                    essentially of membranous woofs, in some cases divided in shreds, in others
                    spread over the intestines and against the sides of the abdomen, and containing
                    pouches filled with a homogeneous pulpy matter, sometimes in an oily condition,
                    and offering all the characters of grease. Much more of it is observable among
                    larvae than in perfect insects, and this observation leads us to a knowledge of
                    its use. It is particularly plentiful just before an insect is about to undergo
                    its metamorphosis; and as it almost entirely disappears on the completion of
                    those signal changes, we naturally conclude that it has served in the production
                    or development of the newly acquired organs. This is rendered the more probable
                    when we consider that, during the intermediate or nympha state, the insect
                    abstains from food, and is therefore necessarily dependent on some internal
                    reservoir. It is analogous, in fact, to the store of fat which is known to
                    pervade the system of hybernating animals before they consign themselves to
                    their winter sleep.</p>
                <p>In regard to the nutrition of insects, our opinions must be in a measure
                    regulated by the sentiments which we may adopt as to the functional uses of the
                    dorsal vessel. We need scarcely observe, that in all the higher animals, and in
                    most of the invertebrated tribes, nutrition is effected through the medium of
                    the blood, which, propelled by the heart, circulates through, the entire system,
                    and reaches every organ, after having been submitted to the action of the air in
                    lungs or gills. Cuvier thinks it is carried on among insects by imbibition. The
                    alimentary canal elaborates a fluid which transudes through its coats, and flows
                    into the cavity of the body. There the various organs, such as the muscles, the
                    nerves, and many secreting vessels, absorb from that fluid nutriment, whatever
                    molecules are best adapted to their purposes. Those who look upon the dorsal
                    vessel as a true heart, which dispenses a circulating fluid to the remotest
                    ramifications of the wings and tarsi, will place less confidence in this
                    particular view. However, it is certain that the secreting vessels are
                    characterized by a structure entirely appropriate to the functions which we have
                    just assigned them, their surface being obviously furnished with numerous pores
                    or small absorbent mouths.</p>
                <p>SECT. V THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM OF INSECTS.</p>
                <p>The digestive system in insects naturally forms the next subject of
                    consideration. The earliest, most general, and perhaps the only indispensable
                    function of animal life, is that of nutrition. But its materials are so
                    different, and their modes of reception so various, that the exercise of this
                    function by no means necessitates the existence of a mouth, a stomach, or an
                    alimentary canal; for an increase of parts may be effected even through the
                    medium of imponderable or elastic fluids, and by imperceptible and superficial
                    pores.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vol. iii.f tJj
                    <hi rend="subscript"> s wor</hi> J <hi rend="subscript"> fj</hi> p.
                    ļß3.</p></note> The digestive organs of insects are however in general rather
                    complicated, and a great variety of parts are brought into action. The more
                    external portions, or those of the mouth, have been already described. We shall
                    therefore at present confine our observations to the different portions of the
                    <hi rend="italic">intestinal canal,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">biliary</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">salivary vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>It is natural to suppose that, in a class so extensive and varied as that with
                    which we are now engaged, a corresponding diversity must exist in the form,
                    development, and number of the parts which constitute the intestinal canal. It
                    is always, however, so far tubular, and open at either end; but in some it is
                    straight and of the length of the body; in others it is bent and longer than the
                    body; while in many it is tortuous, or twisted on itself in numerous
                    convolutions, and consequently of great extent. In general, its ength
                    corresponds in a certain measure with the nature <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193746363?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6363-0085"/> of the
                    aliments; such insects as feed on vegetable matters having a longer, and such as
                    feed on animal substances a shorter canal. In some it is of equal diameter
                    throughout; in others the breadth of special portions varies; and there are many
                    dilatations and restrictions, known by various names. It even differs greatly in
                    the same species, according as the individual exists in the larva or imago
                    state.</p>
                <p>The texture of the intestinal canal in insects is not the same in all parts of
                    its extent; but on a careful examination it is found to exhibit throughout three
                    tunics, more or less distinctly marked. Of these, the first is external, with a
                    membranous aspect; the second is of course intermediate and muscular, with its
                    fibres diversely directed; the third is internal and mucous. In its more
                    complicated state it exhibits the following parts: 1s⅛ a <hi rend="italic"
                    >pharynx</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> an <hi

                    may be considered in subdivision as the small intestines, the great intestine or
                    caecum, and the rectum. The following may be regarded as the usual process of
                    transmission. The mouth, having seized and chewed the food, transmits it to the
                    pharynx, into which salivary vessels sometimes open. It then passes into the
                    oesophagus (of which the muscular nature occasionally produces by its action a
                    peculiar impression), and is next transmitted to the crop, which converts it
                    into a homogeneous pulp. This is introduced into the gizzard, of which the
                    sides, being armed with teeth, complete its trituration. In the form of a kind
                    of paste it is now received by the chylific ventricle, where it undergoes the
                    action of the bile, is converted into chyle, and thus supplies the nutritive
                    fluid, which, passing through the coats of the ventricle, spreads over the
                    splanchnic cavity, and pervades the whole of the organs. The residue is received
                    by the small intestine, then by the great intestine, in which it remains for
                    some time, and finally by the rectum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pharynx,</hi> which is sometimes rather difficult to
                    distinguish as a distinct feature, is placed at the bottom of the mouth, and may
                    be regarded as an anterior dilatation of the oesophagus. Two pieces, very
                    apparent in certain Hymenoptera, called the <hi rend="italic">epipharynx</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">hypopharynx,</hi> seem to restrict and protect its
                    entrance.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">oesophagus</hi> is a conduit varying in length, which
                    traverses the prothorax, and sometimes extends beyond it; but it is occasionally
                    so short as scarcely to pass beyond the region of the head. Its structure is
                    musculo-membranous, and it opens into the crop, or, if that part is wanting,
                    into the gizzard, or, if the latter is also absent, into the chylific ventricle.
                    It is around the origin of the oesophagus that the nervous system, as formerly
                    described, constitutes a ring, by sending forth two branches which unite on the
                    inferior face of the body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">crop,</hi> which is by some called the stomach, is
                    essentially nothing more than a dilatation of the oesophagus. It is often
                    difficult to detect, is sometimes entirely wanting, and may be observed to vary
                    greatly even in two individuals of the same species. Exteriorly it does not
                    differ much from the gizzard, but its interior never presents those corneous
                    pieces which in the latter serve the purposes of trituration. Its position bears
                    some analogy to that of the crop of birds, from which circumstance it has
                    probably derived its name. Its texture is simply membranous, or slightly
                    muscular when its development is considerable, and in that case it is not rare
                    to observe certain folds or fleshy columns and deeper lines, which give it
                    something of a ribbed appearance. These folds, prolonged in the interior,
                    frequently constitute a kind of valve. It is in this crop that bees contain
                    their honey prior to their disgorging it, and it likewise serves as the
                    reservoir of that black and often fetid fluid which many insects allow to flow
                    from their mouths when they are seized. The form of the crop differs in the
                    various species; and even in individuals of the same species, according to its
                    state of repletion or vacuity, it assumes an ovoid, rounded, or pear-shaped
                    appearance. In some orders of insects it is greatly developed, and very
                    muscular; and in certain cases, instead of lying in the same direction with the
                    intestinal canal, it forms with it an angle more or less acute, thus
                    constituting a lateral pouch varying in extent and form.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">gizzard</hi> follows the crop. Its existence is not
                    constant, and its essential character consists in its singular internal
                    structure, which is furnished with moveable portions of a horny texture,
                    provided with ridges or bristles pointed in all directions, in the form of combs
                    or brushes. The principal portions are more or less numerous, and form by their
                    union a kind of valvule at the orifice of the chylific ventricle, into which
                    they permit nothing to enter but what has been previously reduced to a state of
                    tenuity. This very singular triturating machine, as we may call it, exists among
                    both the herbivorous and carnivorous kinds. It recalls to mind the aspect of the
                    stomach among the crustaceous tribes. Externally it greatly resembles the crop,
                    and indeed can scarcely be distinguished from it otherwise than by its internal
                    structure.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">chylific ventricle,</hi> which corresponds to the part
                    named <hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi> by Marcel de Serres, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >stomach</hi> by Ramdhor, is a very constant organ among insects, although its
                    form and character are extremely various. It is here that the pulpy food, mixed
                    with specially elaborated fluids, is converted into chyle. One of its most
                    constant characters is the insertion on a kind of circular pad more or less
                    developed, of at least one extremity of the biliary vessels. Its texture is soft
                    and delicate, and capable of varying its capacity by extension. Its form is
                    generally cylindrical, although it sometimes undergoes dilatations and
                    restrictions in its course. In some rare instances, detailed by Μ. Dufour, it is
                    bilobed or bifurcated at its commencement, the preceding part of the alimentary
                    canal being inserted in the angle of the furcation. It presents several other
                    occasional and very curious characters, but it is in general straight, and but
                    rarely exhibits a limited number of convolutions. It is not garnished interiorly
                    w ith triturating organs, either muscular or corneous; but it is furnished with
                    a valvule at the point of union with the intestine. One of its most curious
                    characters consists in its being sometimes villous on the surface, that is,
                    covered by a quantity of little tubes, named <hi rend="italic">villosities</hi>
                    by Cuvier, and <hi rend="italic">papillae</hi> by Dufour. These are a species of
                    tubes or purses, somewhat resembling the fingers of a glove, and opening into
                    the ventricle. Their functional uses are differently construed by physiologists.
                    Cuvier inclines to think that they draw from the abdominal cavity a gastric
                    fluid, which they pour into the ventricle to aid digestion. Marcel de Serres
                    partakes of the same opinion, and regards these papillae as the superior hepatic
                    vessels. Dufour, however, does not consider them as analogous to the biliary
                    vessels, but as culs-de-sac, which receive the alimentary fluid, and, after its
                    conversion into chyle, transmit it to the abdominal cavity. That able anatomist
                    has recognised in their interior a brownish matter, quite analogous to what is
                    contained in the ventricle itself. They do not differ greatly as to form, but a
                    great variation occurs in regard to number and disposition. Sometimes they exist
                    in great numbers throughout the whole extent of the ventricle, sometimes they
                    are fewer in number, and confined to a limited portion. Insects belonging to the
                    orthopterous order have but few of these papillae, but they are greatly
                    developed, and inserted on the anterior part. In other instances the papillae
                    are entirely absent; and the ventricle is then smooth, or occasionally exhibits
                    depressed lines, which divide it transversely into so many little bands. The
                    presence of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746376?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-6376-0086"/> these papillae cannot be regarded as a constant
                    character in any group, for we find them absent or present in different insects
                    of the same family, without any known or assignable cause. They occur
                    indiscriminately among carnivorous and herbivorous species; but it is among the
                    coleopterous tribes that they show themselves most frequently, and under the
                    most characteristic forms.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">intestines</hi> constitute an extended portion of the
                    canal. They receive the alimentary matters after they have been digested in the
                    chylific ventricle, and extract by their action whatever nutriment remains.
                    Their absorbent powers, however, as alimentary organs, are probably confined
                    chiefly to their upper portion. They consist of a <hi rend="italic">small
                    intestine,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">great intestine,</hi> and a <hi
                    rend="italic">rectum.</hi> The small intestine of course proceeds from the
                    ventricle, and is in general narrow, with an equal diameter throughout, although
                    it is sometimes swollen or pursed in the course of its extent. It is of various
                    length, and makes numerous circumvolutions in the interior of the abdomen, after
                    which it borders with the great intestine. The latter, called also the <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum,</hi> consists of a swelling or enlargement, usually ovoid
                    and smooth, but not unfrequently also covered by plaits and little muscular
                    rib-like bands, more or less projecting. It is dilatable, and in some cases is
                    swollen beyond measure, especially among certain aquatic tribes, such as the <hi
                    rend="italic">Dytisci.</hi> In these, as detected by the skilful eye of Μ.
                    Dufour, the caecum is no longer placed in the direction of the intestinal canal,
                    but is thrown to one side, and furnished with a vermicular appendix, spirally
                    twisted. It becomes inflated with air at the will of the insect, and thus seems
                    to act the part of a swimming bladder. Other modifications of this organ have
                    likewise been observed, into the detail of which we shall not here enter. The
                    rectum is a muscular tube, in general of no great extent.</p>
                <p>We shall next devote a few lines to the <hi rend="italic">l&gt;iliary
                    vessels.</hi> That peculiar fluid called bile seems equally indispensable to the
                    digestion of insects as to that of the higher animals, but the organ which
                    secretes it is very different. In the former class it has no longer the
                    appearance of a gland, but consists of more or less numerous vessels, of
                    variable length, fixed for the most part by a single extremity, but not
                    unfrequently by both ends, to the intestinal canal, and floating as it were in
                    the abdominal cavity. These vessels are often rolled on themselves, and
                    interlaced by numerous tracheae and slender nervous filaments. They are never
                    wanting in insects, and they exist equally in the larva state as in the perfect
                    condition. They are delicate tubes, composed of a thin and pellucid membrane, on
                    which certain transverse foldings produce a somewhat varicose appearance. They
                    contain a liquid, sometimes limpid and colourless, but usually varying from
                    yellow to brown. It is bitter, and exhibits all the characteristics of bile. The
                    vessels themselves vary in amount from two, four, six, to an almost countless
                    number. Their mode of insertion exhibits some remarkable variations, which
                    however may be reduced to two great divisions: <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> where
                    the insertion takes place upon the ventricle alone; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi>
                    where it takes place upon the caecum likewise. The first of these divisions
                    offers two classes; sometimes the vessels are inserted only by one extremity,
                    while the other is free or floating; sometimes they are fixed by both ends, and
                    form so many arches. In the latter case they are few in number, and each arch
                    may be regarded either as a vessel strongly curved towards the two points of
                    insertion, or may be looked upon as composed of two vessels exactly anastomosed
                    at their extrçmities. A coleopterous insect belonging to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">ĴDoriacia,</hi> described by Μ. Dufour, was observed to possess a
                    ventricle provided at once with arched vessels and with such as were free at
                    their extremity. Such a combination connects, as it were, the characters which
                    principally distinguish the first great division.. The second great division
                    above alluded to never presents us with any vessels that are free or unattached
                    at one extremity. They form a complete arch from the ventricle to the caecum,
                    and scarcely present any particular character, except that their number is
                    always restricted. The insertions on the ventricle are always more distinct than
                    those on the caecum; the latter being rarely isolated, but usually uniting into
                    a smaller number of common branches, and sometimes into one.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">salivary vessels</hi> consist of floating tubes, which open
                    about the pharynx, and furnish a liquid to assist in deglutition. They are
                    sometimes wanting or imperceptible, and are more general, as well as more highly
                    developed, among the suctorial than the masticating tribes. The receptacles
                    which supply the silk used by spinning caterpillars, are by many regarded as
                    analogous to salivary glands, as are likewise the organs which furnish the
                    venomous fluid in the mouths of Scolopendrae.<note anchored="true"

                <p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
                <p>THE METAMORPHOSES OF INSECTS.</p>
                <p>As frequent reference is made, in the course of this treatise, to the
                    metamorphoses of insects, we shall here endeavour to explain in what these
                    essentially consist. “Were a naturalist,” observe Messrs Kirby and Spence, “to
                    announce to the world the discovery of an animal, which for the first five years
                    of its life existed in the form of a serpent; w hich then penetrating into the
                    earth, and weaving a shroud of pure silk of the finest texture, contracted
                    itself within this covering into a body w ithout external mouth or limbs, and
                    resembling more than any thing else an Egyptian mummy; and which, lastly, after
                    remaining in this state without food and without motion for three years longer,
                    should at the end of that period burst its silken casements, struggle through
                    its earthy covering, and start into day a winged bird,—what think you would be
                    the sensation excited by this strange piece of intelligence ?” Yet the
                    difference which exists between the sometimes repulsive aspect of a creeping
                    caterpillar, and the consummate beauty of the gorgeous butterfly to which it
                    gives existence, is as remarkable as any supposable change from one form of
                    animal life to another.</p>
                <p>Although the ancients appear to have been aware that many insects, such as
                    butterflies, bees, and beetles, proceeded from eggs, and underwent those changes
                    which w¢ name metamorphosis; yet, very shortly before the time ol Redi,
                    Swammerdam, Malpighi, and Leeuwenhoeck, to whoιr we ow e so much of our present
                    knowledge, Mouffet, w hc has been called the father of entomology, mistook the
                    aquatic larvae of Libellulae for creatures entirely distinct fron the perfect
                    insects, and named them <hi rend="italic">Water Locusts!</hi> The error was
                    excusable, and has no doubt often been repeatec in corresponding cases; for how
                    many are ignorant, ever at the present day, that the slender red-coloured
                    wriggling worm, which is so often seen in collections of rain water <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193746389?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6389-0087"/> is
                    the larva state of a clear-winged and elegantly formed fly, furnished with
                    feathered antennae and long slender limbs, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chironomus</hi><hi rend="italic">plumosus</hi><hi rend="italic">?</hi> How
                    entirely dissimilar is the hairy caterpillar, which we frequently observe
                    crossing our foot-path in country lanes, from the richly attired tiger-moth
                    which it eventually becomes? Many examples of a similar nature will probably
                    occur even to the least instructed reader.</p>
                <p>The word metamorphosis seems to have passed originally from a mythological
                    meaning to a term in natural science. We had deemed it an ancient phrase, till

                    change and progressive improvement of the mind. The word metamorphosis, as
                    applied to insects, is in fact synonymous with the more familiar term <hi
                    rend="italic">transformation,</hi> although, speaking strictly in relation to
                    physiology, the changes indicated by these expressions should rather be regarded
                    as a series of developments.</p>
                <p>All insects proceed from eggs either previously deposited by the female parent,
                    or, as in the case of the so-called viviporous (strictly ovo-viviporous) kinds,
                    hatched within the body of the mother. Their first active condition is that of
                    larva, which, according to the views of Swammerdam, contains within itself the
                    germ of the future perfect insect, and those various envelopes, each of which,
                    successively developed, becomes external and apparent by the casting off of that
                    by which it was preceded.</p>
                <p>Thus a caterpillar may be viewed, not as a simple, but a compound creature,
                    containing within it the germ of the future butterfly, inclosed in what will
                    become the case of the pupa, which is itself included in several more envelopes
                    or skins,* each of which becomes external in its turn. As the larva (so called
                    from the very circumstance of its containing the <hi rend="italic">imago,</hi>
                    or perfect insect, shut up as it were in a <hi rend="italic">masK)</hi>
                    increases in dimensions, the various parts expand, and are thrown off, until at
                    length the completed and more beautiful form is displayed in all its lustre.
                    Swammerdam, in fact, discovered, by careful dissection, not only the skins of
                    the larva and pupa incased within each other, but within these again the very
                    butterfly itself, with its organs all complete, though nearly in a fluid
                    state.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Hill’s <hi

                <p>Of the same fact, Mr Kirby states, any one may convince himself, without the
                    skill of the great Dutch observer, merely by plunging into vinegar or spirit of
                    wine a caterpillar about to assume the pupa state, and allowing it to remain
                    there for a few days till it gains consistency of parts; or by boiling it for a
                    few minutes in water. A very rough dissection will then enable the student to
                    detect the future butterfly,—the wings being rolled up into a sort of cord, and
                    lodged between the first and second segments, the antennae and trunk coiled up
                    in front of the head, and the legs, though very dissimilar in form, actually
                    sheathed in those of the caterpillar. Malpighi, moreover, discovered the eggs of
                    the future moth in the chrysalis of a silkworm only a few days old;<note

                <p>According, however, to the more recent doctrines promulgated by Dr Herold, the
                    successive skins of the caterpillar, the case of the pupa, and the members of
                    the perfect insect (except the sexual distinctions, which he perceived even in
                    the newly excluded larvae), do not preexist as germs, but are formed
                    successively from the <hi rend="italic">rete</hi><hi rend="italic">mucosum,</hi>
                    which itself is formed anew upon every change of skin, from what he denominates

                    canal into the general cavity of the body, where being oxygenated by the
                    air-vessels, it performs the nutritive functions of blood.<note anchored="true"

                    convenient application where the mysterious workings of nature are but dimly
                    seen or vaguely understood. But whatever may be the mode or principle of
                    development, we know that insects exist in the four following states,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">egg,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">larva,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pupa,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">imago</hi> or perfect condition.</p>
                <p>The first stage of <hi rend="italic">life,</hi> properly so called, is that of
                    larva, in which existence is usually more prolonged than in any other, and in
                    which the insect does nothing but eat voraciously, and increase rapidly, with
                    intervals of repose occasioned by repletion. In this state it is entirely
                    sterile. In the course, and towards the termination, of the larva state, that
                    peculiar internal secretion the caul, epiploon, or fatty matter, formerly
                    mentioned, is observed to increase, and the insect then assumes the pupa state,
                    which is usually one of inaction and apparent torpidity. Ere long the skin of
                    the pupa bursts asunder, or the wings and members become sufficiently developed
                    for active exercise, and the insect assumes the perfect state, as exemplified in
                    bees, beetles, and butterflies, all of which proceed from a wormlike larva. In
                    this condition they are usually less voracious, their principal object and
                    occupation being the preservation or continuance of their kind.</p>
                <p>All insects, however, do not pass through these transformations. Most of the
                    apterous kinds issue from the egg in a form very similar to that which they
                    maintain throughout their after lives; from which circumstance Linnaeus and
                    others have bestowed the name of <hi rend="italic">complete pupae</hi> on their
                    intermediate state, when such is recognisable. Even those that are subjected to
                    the signal changes above de-scrjbed, differ considerably in the nature and
                    degree of metamorphosis to which they are subjected. Many of the winged kinds
                    experience no other change than the accession of the organs of flight. Their
                    larvae resemble the perfect insect, with the exception of the want of wings.
                    Their pupae, known as <hi rend="italic">semi-complete,</hi> merely differ from
                    the larvae by exhibiting the rudiments of those organs the eventual development
                    of which produces the completion of the perfect insect. Such are the grasshopper
                    and locust tribes, in which the pupae continue to exercise their locomotive
                    powers and ordinary vital functions. Those insects which undergo a more entire
                    metamorphosis are changed from larvae into motionless and inert pupae, and this
                    mode of transformation presents different gradations. The pupae, or nymphs as
                    they are often called, of the Coleoptera and several other orders, exhibit their
                    external members in close approximation to the body, butjfree or uncovered by
                    any general envelope; we name them <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi> But among
                    the Lepidoptera, such as butterflies and moths, an elastic but firm and
                    sufficiently solid skin or integument is moulded over the entire body and its
                    various members, and only shows the form and outline of the latter visibly
                    impressed upon its surface. These were called <hi rend="italic">pupae
                    obtectae</hi> by Linnaeus. Dipterous flies, again, are covered in the pupa state
                    by small simple cases, or egg-like shells, usually regarded as the skin of the
                    larva, through which the form and proportions of the parts are in no way
                    discernible. These were termed <hi rend="italic">pupae coarctatae</hi> by the
                    great Swedish naturalist.</p>
                <p>When, however, we make use of the term <hi rend="italic">metamor<pb break="no"

                    is apt to result from the application of the words complete, semi-complete, and
                    other adjective phrases,—for the less complete the pupa, the more complete the
                    metamorphosis. Some contusion, we think, has arisen from this circumstance,—at
                    least we have ourselves been occasionally puzzled by the contrariety of opinion
                    expressed upon the subject even by the “master spirits” of entomology. Thus,
                    Latreιlle observes, “Les Coléoptères subissent une metamorphose complete,"<note

                    >Introduction to Entomology,</hi> vol. iv. p. 369.</p></note> and the same form
                    of expression is used by Mr Macleay.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Horae Ent.</hi> p. 440. The confusion
                    above referred to may perhaps have arisen from certain adjective phrases having
                    been at times apphed indifferently, either to the state of pupa or the phenomena
                    of transformation, which in most cases causes a contradiction in terms. In
                    Orthoptera, of which the pupa is semi-complete, the metamorphosis may bear the
                    same designation; but in the other orders the double application of any of the
                    adjective terms leads to inaccurate ideas. Thus, in Coleoptera, the pupoe are s
                    <hi rend="italic">emi-comρlctc</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but there is surely
                    a total transformation, that is, a <hi rend="italic">complete</hi>
                    metamorphosis, when we compare together the larva and the perfect insect. So
                    also in Lepidoptera, the pupa is obtected; in Diptera, coarctate; and
                    consequently the-metamorphosis must be <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> in both.
                    Now Mr Kirby makes use of the phrase “metamorphosis obtected” in regard to the
                    former, and “metamorphosis coarctate” in relation to the latter,—terms which we
                    have been in the practice of applying to the pupa state of these orders, but not
                    to the general transformations. The same admirable author, in defining apterous
                    insects, states the metamorphosis to he <hi rend="italic">complete.</hi> We
                    would rather say that they undergo no metamorphosis at all,—for which very
                    reason, each particular state, or rather period, of the insect, is itself
                    complete from youth to age. The less complete the pupa, the more complete the
                    metamorphosis, and <hi rend="italic">vice</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >versa.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>However this may be, our entire range of natural knowledge presents us with
                    nothing comparable in singularity or beauty with the phenomena of metamorphosis.
                    No wonder that the mystical sages of Egypt, and the refined philosophers of
                    Greece, were so entranced or delighted with what they saw and fancied, as to
                    found upon these changes many of the fondest fables which now pervade our
                    classical literature. “Psyche,’ says Dr Nares, “means in Greek the human soul;
                    and it means also a butterfly, of which apparently strange double sense the
                    undoubted reason is, that a butterfly was a very ancient symbol of the soul.
                    From the prevalence of this symbol, and the consequent coincidence of the names,
                    it happened that the Greek sculptors frequently represented Psyche as subject to
                    Cupid in the shape of a butterfly; and that even when she appears in their works
                    under the human form, we find her decorated with the light and filmy wings of
                    that gay insect.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    butterfly and the resurrection of the body, or second life of the human soul,
                    was not so close as had been imagined, is yet of opinion that the process is so

                    state of seeming death, when it is wound up in a kind of shroud and incased in a
                    coffin, and is most commonly buried under the earth (though sometimes its
                    sepulchre is in the water, and at others in various substances in the air); and,

                    shall live and love to the ages of eternity?</p>
                <p>“But although the analogy between the different stateβ of insects and those of
                    the body of man is only general, yet it is much more complete with respect to
                    his soul. He first appears in this frail body—a child of earth, a crawling worm,
                    his soul being in a course of training and preparation for a more perfect and
                    glorious existence. When it has finished this course it casts off this vile
                    body, and goes into a hidden state of being in Hades, where it rests from its
                    works, and is prepared for its final consummation. The time for this being
                    arrived, it comes forth clothed with a glorious body, not like its former though
                    germinating from it, for though ‘ it was sown an animal body, it shall be raised
                    a spiritual body,’ endowed with augmented powers, faculties, and privileges,
                    commensurate to its new and happy state. And here the parallel holds perfectly
                    between the insect and the man. The butterfly, the representative of the soul,

                    and if it be not destroyed by the ichneumons and other enemies to which it is
                    exposed, symbolical of the vices that destroy the spiritual life of the soul, it
                    will come to its state of repose in the <hi rend="italic">pupa,</hi> which is
                    its Hades; and at length, when it assumes the <hi rend="italic">imago,</hi>

                <p>Swammerdam, to whom we owe the earliest philosophical examination of the subject,
                    divides the phenomena of metamorphosis into four classes. In the first, in which
                    the changes are the least varied or remarkable, he includes apterous insects
                    commonly so called, most of which we now name Myτiapoda, and the metamorphosis
                    of which consists in gaining additional segments and pairs of feet; also
                    Arachnides and Crustacea, which are for the most part characterized by simple
                    renewals of their envelope. In the second class he places such insects as are
                    bom with six feet, but have their wings concealed or inclosed m a sheath during
                    a rudimentary period, such as Orthoptera, Hemiptera, and many Neuroptera. In the
                    third class are included those insects which exhibit three distinct conditions;
                    they compose two subdivisions. The first comprises those insects of which the
                    second state, called nymph or semi-nymph, exhibits either the appearance of feet
                    and wings, or the reality of these organs. They are not reduced to that state of
                    utter lethargy or apparent death which some present, and they include the
                    remainder of the Neuroptera, the Hymenoptera, and the Coleoptera. The other
                    subdivision contains the Lepidoptera, of which the larv¢e, commonly called
                    caterpillars, are subject to several preparatory changes of their coat, and are
                    finally converted into chrysalids, through the coriaceous skin of which the
                    interior parts are perceptible, but which externally exhibit neither wings nor
                    legs, nor any other members.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746415?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6415-0089"/>
                <p>Finally, in the fourth class are included all those insects which on their
                    exclusion from the egg exist as vermiform apodal larvae, are provided at most
                    with six feet, and are converted into nymphs without a change of envelope, so
                    that their skin merely hardens over the intermediate stace of the insect, which
                    ere long issues winged. Such are the dipterous tribes.</p>
                <p>These views and combinations have been somewhat modified in later years, by
                    Réaumur, Linnaeus, Fabricius, Huber, Dutrochet, Savigny, Marcel de Serres,
                    Latreille, and others who have devoted themselves to the investigation of
                    metamorphoses. Those phenomena have consequently been classed as incomplete or
                    partial by which the aspect of the insect is merely modified, and as complete or
                    total by which it is entirely changed. In all, the interior changes may be said
                    to command the exterior, that is, the latter are consequent on the former. In
                    numerous species, not less than three of the principal organic systems, viz. the
                    <hi rend="italic">nervous,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">nutritive,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">respiratory,</hi> undergo important modifications, and we may
                    easily conceive how strongly the instinctive habits of the individual must be
                    thereby affected. The alterations in the nervous system especially, are singular
                    in their nature and effects. The number of ganglia of the spinal cord is usually
                    greater in the larva than the perfect insect, although the great single ganglion
                    of the rhinoceros-beetle (<hi rend="italic">Oryctes ηαsicomis),</hi> in its
                    early state, compared with the four ganglia of its subsequent condition, offers
                    an exception to the general rule. But in the larva of the stag-bcetlc <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lucanus cervus)</hi> we observe eight ganglia, besides a
                    recurrent nervc, while the perfect insect possesses only four; and among
                    caterpillars in general the same restriction takes place in the number of their
                    ganglionic knots as they attain the perfect state.</p>
                <p>Among beings in which the parts representing the brain and other organs of
                    sensation of the higher tribes undergo so many variations even in the same
                    individual, we may well suppose that whatever ideas they are capable of
                    conceiving at one period of their existence, may differ essentially from those
                    with which they arc impressed at another. We shall not here involve ourselves in
                    the discussion of the difficult and dissimilar theories of instinct, nor enter
                    into any exposition of the mechanical, the intellectual, or the supernatural
                    character of that surprising manifestation, which, uríder whatever aspect it may
                    be viewed, whether as differing in kind or only in degree from reason, cannot be
                    otherwise regarded than as a most beautiful illustration of divine benevolence.
                    But we may ask, by what peculiar memory or mode of recollection does the
                    brilliant butterfly, which seeks its sustenance in the nectarous juices of
                    flowers, rifling their sweets with its tubular <hi rend="italic"
                    >proboscis,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> by what means does it remember that its
                    progeny, while in the larva state, must be sustained by a far different diet,
                    and that they exercise their <hi rend="italic">jaws</hi> on cabbage-lcaves, and
                    other vegetation of the coarser kind ř Μ. Virey, who denies all intellect to
                    insects, and views their various actions as resulting mechanically from the
                    peculiar disposition or character of their nervous system, has endeavoured to
                    illustrate the subject by the following parallel. He compares an insect to one
                    of those portable organs, of which the cylinder has different airs noted on its
                    surface, and which performs one or another tune in proportion as the cylinder is
                    made to recede or advance. So likewise the nervous system, or series of ganglia
                    along the double medullary cord, of the creatures now under consideration, being
                    differently constituted in the larva and the perfect insect, ought to produce
                    different actions in the two cases, though respectively appropriate to the
                    nature of each. Art in the one instance, and nature in the other, has impressed
                    certain dispositions, or notes of action, fixed in a determinate series, equally
                    in the musical organ, and the ganglionic system of caterpillars. Hence the one
                    gives utterance to a certain air, while the other acts according to a certain
                    sequence of operations. Pull out a notch of the barrel organ, and you have
                    another tune; await the transformation of the caterpillar to a butterfly, and
                    you have (with a change in the <hi rend="italic">notching</hi> of its nervous
                    system) another scries of instinctive operations. In both, the relations of
                    cause and effect are the same, and each is merely the mechanical playing of an
                    instrument!<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Nοηυ. Did. d'Hist. Nat.</hi> xvi. 313.</p></note> Now, to prove
                    this position, as has been elsewhere remarked, Μ. Virey ought at least to have
                    shown, that whenever a change takes place in the instincts of insects in their
                    different states of larva and ima-ago, a corresponding change also takes place
                    in the structure of the nervous cord.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Iηtrοd. to Ent.</hi> iv. 27∙</p></note>
                    But this is by no means the case. In three entire orders, namely, Orthoptera,
                    Hcmiptera, and Neuroptera, the structure of that cord remains unchanged, and yet
                    we know that thousands of the species which compose these orders acquire
                    instinctive habits in their perfect state, altogether dissimilar to those by
                    which they w ere characterized in their earlier condition. Even were it
                    otherwise, our query would still require to be answered, by what mechanical
                    impulsion is the completed butterfly, a gay and gorgeous honey-sucker, induced
                    to play a tune (we speak in harmony with Μ. Virey’s views) so completely in
                    accordance, not with its ow n refined tastes, but with the future welfare of the
                    crawling caterpillars of which it is the parent? Why does it deposit its eggs,
                    not on the odorous blossoms and bright consummate flowers in which it takes so
                    much delight, and amid the varied petals of which it rejoices to expand to the
                    sunshine its own still more brilliant wings, but on the rank leaves of the
                    cabbage and cauliflower, or the dingy foliage of the nettle? These questions,
                    and many others of a similar nature, are perhaps more easily proponed than
                    answered. When we consider, indeed, how frequently inaccurate is our knowledge
                    even of our own individual feelings, and how much more incompetent wc are to
                    judge of what passes in the minds of others of our own species, need we wonder
                    that the sentient principles of the lower animals should, in relation to human
                    intelligence, be still shrouded in dim eclipse, if not in total darkness.. It is
                    far more probable, however, that the alterations in the nervous cord have no
                    necessary connection with the changes of instinct, but are more closely
                    concerned with those other not less remarkable mutations in the organs of sense
                    and motion, which occur betw∙cen the larva and imago states of several orders.
                    “In a common caterpillar, the form of the body, the legs, the eyes, and other
                    organs of the senses, all strikingly differ from those of the imago; whereas,
                    with the exception of the acquisition of new wings, a perfect locust differs
                    little from its larva; so that we may reasonably expect a corresponding change,
                    such as we find it in the structure of the nervous cord of the lepidopterous
                    insect, not called for in that of the neuropterous (orthopterous ?) species, in
                    which accordingly it does not take place.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi> vol. iv. p. 28.</p></note></p>
                <p>Metamorphosis frequently induces no less remarkable changes in the <hi
                    rend="italic">system of nutrition</hi> of insects, followed of course by
                    corresponding alterations in their instinctive appetites and modes of life. In
                    such as undergo an incomplete metamorphosis, the parts of the mouth, and the
                    form of the alimentary canal, experience no essential alteration; but among
                    those tribes in which the change of external aspect is complete in each
                    successive stage, these import- <pb break="no"

                    assume another character, and admirably illustrate the multitude of means
                    employed by nature to vary her innumerable products, even although the general
                    laws by which these are regulated, and from which, under the great and
                    never-slumbering eye of Omnipotence, theymore immediately result, are themselves
                    so few in number. The shorter the alimentary canal becomes, the more carnivorous
                    are the tendencies of the individual. This finally exemplifies the great
                    physiological truth previously deduced from the difference between the structure
                    of the alimentary system in herbivorous and carnivorous animals of the higher
                    classes,—between the short canal of the bloodthirsty tiger, and the lengthened
                    convolutions of the gentler ruminating tribes. Here, however, the disparity
                    exists, not as among animals of entirely différent attributes, but in the same
                    individual at different periods of its existence. The young of many aquatic
                    beetles of the family of <hi rend="italic">Helophoridoe</hi> are carnivorous in
                    thcir larva state, and become herbivorous on assuming their final
                    transformation. A like singularity is manifested by many dipterous flies, which,
                    born and bred amid the putrid moisture of animal remains, no sooner become
                    winged insects, than they seek a purer diet in the nectarous juices of fruits
                    and flowers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Eηtοmοlοgiα Edlηcηsis,</hi> p. 207∙</p></note> Analogous changes
                    take place even in those species which do not entirely alter the nature of their
                    diet. A voracious caterpillar, which, by means of its robust maxillae, rapidly
                    gnaws and consumes a quantity of the most coriaceous leaves, to the amount
                    sometimes of triple its own weight in a single day, and presents the beau-ideal
                    of an eating machine, has its intestine greatly dilated, and pursed like a
                    colon. The larvae both of wasps and bees have a stomach so vast, that it
                    occupies almost the entire of their interior, although in the perfect state of
                    each it becomes greatly restricted. Thus in the bee that great laboratory
                    consists of little more than two unequal honey pouches; and among butterflies,
                    of which the trunk or sucker corresponds to the previous jaws, the stomach is
                    much less than in caterpillars. This, we may observe, reverses the rule which
                    applies to the great ruminating animals among the vertebrated tribes, where we
                    find a single stomach in the foetus state, and which in the adult is multiplied
                    to four. It is the opinion of some naturalists that larvae in general, having
                    larger intestines, tend more towards a herbivorous diet than perfect insects, in
                    which these organs are shorter, and which are consequently supposed to assume a
                    more carnivorous habit ;—“so rare, is it,” observes Μ. Bory St Vincent, “to
                    perceive the manners of living creatures not tcnding to mutual destruction as
                    their powers are developed.” An enlightened mind, however, naturally delights in
                    the perception and extrication of general rules; and these, we fear, are not
                    seldom fancied without being either perceived or deduced. In opposition to the
                    presumed law, we have already mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Helophoridoe,</hi>
                    which reverse the rule; and to these we could add many more. The glowworm in its
                    larva state is greedy of animal jiιices, and feeds chiefly on minute testacea,
                    while, in its completed state, it is entirely herbivorous. A large aquatic
                    beetle, the <hi rend="italic">Hydrous</hi><hi rend="italic">piceus,</hi> is so
                    ferocious and blood-thirsty in the form of larva, as to bear in France the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">ver-assassin</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in its after
                    condition, through the medium of metamorphosis, the intestine becomes elongated,
                    and the disposition of the insect is softened and subdued, so that it then
                    prefers a vegetable to an animal diet. In fact the great aim and object of an
                    insect in the perfect condition is rather the continuance of its kind than the
                    sustenance of itself; although, as the one process cannot be well accom-plisħed
                    without the other, it no doubt, even in its most high and palmy state, casts,
                    like its betters, an occasional eye on the “flesh-pots of Egypt.</p>
                <p>The changes in the <hi rend="italic">respiratory system</hi> of insects produced
                    by metamorphosis, are not less extraordinary than those to which we have just
                    alluded. But as we have already mentioned some of the more remarkable of these
                    in our observations on the <hi rend="italic">organs of respiration,</hi> we
                    shall not further dilate upon that portion of the subject.</p>
                <p>Metamorphosis in insects has been described as the maximum state of a general law
                    of nature, by which the whole organization of the animal being is gradually
                    developed and made fit for reproduction. Without the study of this phenomenon,
                    we cannot acquire a knowledge of the most important circumstances in the lives
                    of such animals as are guided entirely by instinct; and just as an acquaintance
                    with the whole life of an insect necessarily induces a truer knowledge of its
                    actual nature, than a mere description of one of its forms,—so, in the same
                    proportion, it has been said, ought metamorphosis to outweigh every other
                    principle of arrangement. When we trace the natural history of a dragon-fly <hi
                    rend="italic">{Libellula)</hi> from the time that the egg is first dropped into
                    the bosom of the uncertain waters, till, on some bright sunny morning in “the
                    leafy month of June,” the gauzy-winged insect in the perfect state is seen to
                    rise from its moist abode, and, hawking for flies, to hover like a bird of prey
                    along the placid shores of some familiar pool, we can scarcely conceive a clear
                    idea of the truth, except by supposing one animal to have been so inclosed
                    within another, that the imago is in a great measure distinct from the repulsive
                    larva, and is only opened to our view by its desiccation or death. Hence, as Mr
                    Macleay observes, a system unconnected with metamorphosis may be regarded as
                    taking no more notice of half the number of true insects than if they did not
                    exist, “It is the defect both of the artificial system in Entomology, and of the
                    sexual system in Botany, that they become useless, except when the objects of
                    the respective sciences are before us in one particular state, which is often
                    the most transitory of their life. Unless this condition be fulfilled, such
                    systems lose their sole and peculiar merit of being dictionaries by which
                    natural objects may be named. There are thousands of organized beings, to the
                    history and knowledge of which the disciple of Linnaeus and Fabricius has no
                    clue whatever, although perhaps they are in that state of their existence which
                    most directly affects the interests of man. Plants not in flower, and insects
                    not in their declared state, constitute an ocean of difficulties, in which the
                    most skilled in the Linnaean nomenclature will founder, unless he have other
                    beacons than such momentary considerations as are afforded by the number of
                    stamina, or the form of the antennae.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>We shall conclude our observations on the singular subject of metamorphosis, by
                    another quotation from the last-named author, which, with what has been already
                    stated, will, it is hoped, suffice to instruct the reader regarding what we
                    consider the most extraordinary phenomena observable within the range of the
                    animal kingdom. “It was perfectly in unison with the innate propensity of the
                    human mind towards the marvellous, that the change of a caterpillar into a
                    butterfly, when first noticed, should have been considered by the ancients as a
                    true transformation, irreconcilable with the ordinary course of nature. Even on
                    the mystery being in a great degree cleared up by the discoveries of Libavius,
                    Redi, Malpighi, and Swammerdam,. the phenomenon continued to be termed
                    metamorphosis; and perhaps it is even still a little owing to such circumstances
                    that a natural process, neglected in other <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193746441?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6441-0091"/> branches of
                    zoology, has always excited so much curiosity among entomologists.
                    Metamorphosis, however, has been taken of late in a very general point of view,
                    and rendered synonymous with that species of organic decomposition which, by
                    means of continual shedding of the external envelopes, or even of the various
                    integuments which may compose those envelopes, occasions that extraordinary
                    characteristic of a living body, namely, that it never remains in a constant
                    state, or identically the same, but is continually assimilating new particles of
                    matter, as it throws off the old. And since no metamorphosis can take place
                    except in consequence of these integuments being shed, perhaps it may not be
                    altogether improper to survey the subject in this light. What I mean is, that we
                    ought to regard the metamorphosis or change of form which certain animals
                    undergo at various periods of their life, as an attendant upon, if not a variety
                    of, the <hi rend="italic">ecdysis,</hi> or moulting, to which all organized
                    beings are subject. There is, however, a great distinction to be made between
                    the <hi rend="italic">ecdysis</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Annulosa,</hi> for in the former we observe little more than
                    that the animal has quitted a sheath in which it was inclosed; whereas in the
                    latter the change is nothing else than if the skeleton were shed; for this name
                    is surely deserved by those hard and solid parts which in so many cases afford
                    support to the muscles. It is clear that such a process must occasion a crisis
                    in the life of an annulose animal, incomparably more decisive in its effects
                    than whąt can be produced among the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> by merely
                    being set free from an integument. All the marvellous, however, of <hi
                    rend="italic">ecdysis,</hi> was with the earlier naturalists comprehended in the
                    change of form; and consequently the shedding of the envelope only excited
                    attention where it regarded a few of the <hi rend="italic">Annulosa.</hi> Hence
                    it was a great discovery of Linnaeus, that every annulose animal ought to be
                    considered as subject to metamorphosis. It may indeed have led to his more
                    artificial notion of every externally articulated being having a nympha state;
                    but even this helped Fabricius to give, although with a faulty nomenclature, a
                    much more convenient division of metamorphosis than he could otherwise have
                    devised.</p>
                <p>“Ecdysis, by which term is signified generally every change in the identity of
                    the envelope of a living body, may either be complete or incomplete. If it be
                    incomplete, or, which is the same, if the integuments scale off piece by piece,
                    we have that mode of change which is peculiar to the most perfect of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and to the least perfect of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annulosa.</hi></p>
                <p>“Complete ecdysis is the shedding of the whole external envelope at once, of
                    which we have examples among the vcrtebrated as well as annulose animals. It is
                    of three sorts; first, where the external envelope is shed without producing any
                    essential change of form, except in as much as may relate to the increased size.
                    In those larvae of insects which become inactive in their pupa state, such a
                    process may always be distinguished from the true metamorphosis; but in apterous
                    Hexapods having active nymphae, they are necessarily confounded. It is also
                    visible in reptiles and spiders, where such appendages of the trunk as have been
                    lost may be reproduced by continued moulting. When the various envelopes are all
                    cast as it were in one mould, it is to be expected that the proper form of the
                    animal should, re-appear as these continue to be thrown off. The return
                    therefore of a spider or crab, after having lost a limb, to its original form,
                    may be in some measure understood as depending on the manner in which such
                    animals shed their envelope; but that the limbs thus shot forth should be
                    furnished with muscles and nerves, is, I conceive, what cannot be accounted for,
                    except by referring to that polype nature of the cellular substance, which is
                    perhaps, in the opinion of some persons, the foundation of all ecdysis. If
                    perfect hexapod insects cannot reproduce their members, this inability may
                    probably proceed from a cause which appears to have produced the same effect
                    among <hi rend="italic">Mammalia</hi> and birds, to wit, that these animals in
                    their perfect and final form are all subject, if to any, at least to a very
                    imperfect ecdysis.</p>
                <p>“The second sort of complete ecdysis is that where the under envelope has been
                    cast in a somewhat different mould from the upper, so that in the course of the
                    moulting certain new parts become gradually developed without the general form
                    being in any material degree altered. This is observable in every annulose
                    class, as well as in Humboldt’s Axotl among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata,</hi> and is the first species of change which merits the name of
                    metamorphosis. It includes the <hi rend="italic">Metamorphosis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inchoata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Metamorphosis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dimidiata</hi> of Latreille, and is the same with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Metamorphose</hi><hi rend="italic">partielle</hi> of Lamarck.</p>
                <p>“The third sort of complete ecdysis is that wherein, by some two or three
                    moultings, generally the last which the animal has to undergo, the form is
                    entirely changed, as well as the number of appendageβ more or lęss increased.
                    This is clearly a true metamorphosis, and includes the other two sorts of
                    complete ecdysis; for we have here combined a total casting of the integuments,
                    a development of additional appendages, such as feet or wings, and finally an
                    entire change of form. Such a combination may be witnessed, among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> in frogs, and, among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anηulosa,</hi> in certain hexapod insects. Hencc, in confining ourselves to
                    plain and open ecdysis, there will be no great error in stating that the most
                    imperfect takes place in the highest <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> and the
                    lowest <hi rend="italic">Annulosa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the most
                    complete ecdysis is that which is seen to prevail in the highest <hi
                    rend="italic">Annulosa</hi> and some of the lowest <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>“In strict accuracy, however, it appears that we ought to acknowledge the
                    existence of complete ecdysis throughout the circle of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata.</hi> Nay, some physiologists have attributed insect metamorphosis
                    itself to a shedding of an envelope analogous to that which contains the foetus
                    of the more perfect <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata.</hi> As every embryo, whether
                    animal or vegetable, is enclosed in a tunic more or less solid, which is its
                    chorion, so, proceeding with the analogy, they conceive that there must be some
                    condition for every animal, similar to the state of the foetus of the more
                    perfect animals when surrounded by the amnios; and this state in batrachian
                    reptiles and hexapod insects they hold to be the larva. The only danger of this
                    reasoning is, that while we find the birth of an animal to be attended with
                    complete ecdysis, we may be apt to imagine that every complete ecdysis betokens
                    a true birth. " It would, however, be truly absurd to consider the casting of
                    their shell by <hi rend="italic">Crustacea,</hi> or the periodical moulting of
                    the serpent, in this light; yet no one can doubt the fact of both these being
                    cases of complete ecdysis, only differing from that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lepidoptera,</hi> because in the former animals the external envelope is always
                    of the same form as that of which it is to take the place. The truth perhaps is,
                    that we ought only to allow two states to every animal, a perfect and an
                    imperfect state. Then, by the reflection that no animal out of the circle of <hi
                    rend="italic">AErita</hi> can ever arrive at its perfect state except by means
                    of metamorphosis, and that when perfect it can never again be subject to this
                    change of form, though it may still moult or shed its external envelope, we may
                    be able, if not to comprehend the cause, at least to know the effect, of some of
                    the most puzzling phenomena in nature. The true criterion of animal as well as
                    vegetable perfection is the ability to continue the species; hence some of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">Annulosa,</hi>
                    gaining this faculty before they have arrived at their proper type of form,
                    metamorphosis ceases, and they preserve the shape of larvae.</p>

                <p>“But if a complete ecdysis may sometimes create a total change in the external
                    appearance of the animal, the fact, however astonishing, is nothing in
                    comparison of the internal metamorphosis which accompanies it, and of which as
                    yet no philosopher has been able to give any satisfactory explanation. The
                    generalization indeed by which we have reduced the moulting of a bird’s feathers
                    and the metamorphosis of a butterfly to one principle, may appear to be strained
                    beyond its proper limits; yet if we contemplate the regular gradation from one
                    to the other, how truly, for instance, the inactive pupa of a beetle corresponds
                    with the agile nympha of a <hi rend="italic">Gryllus,</hi> how this ecdysis in
                    an apterous <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi> corresponds with the sloughing of a
                    spider, and this again with the annual renovation of the serpent, we must be
                    sensible that, however dissimilar the extremes may be, all these changes are
                    modifications of one principle. But what particularly deserves remark is, that
                    these extremes should often be visible in neighbouring groups; nay, in the same
                    order; that, in short, metamorphosis should differ so much in degree even where
                    the animals are near in affinity. An orthopterous insect may preserve the same
                    form and habits from the instant it quits the egg up to the period of its death,
                    the only qualities obtained by ecdysis being an augmentation of size and an
                    aptitude to continue the species. But if we turn to the order of <hi
                    rend="italic">Coleoptera,</hi> which is contiguous in affinity, it is truly
                    wonderful that, by metamorphosis, not only the form, but the nervous and
                    digestive systems, may be altered, and the organs connected with these primary
                    functions may all be of a construction different from that which they originally
                    possessed.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J7or. <hi

                <p>The reader has now been made acquainted in a general way (and as precisely as the
                    limits of our present article may admit) with the most characteristic features
                    in the structure of the insect tribes, from which he may form some opinion of
                    their real nature. Their relative position in the magnificent range of created
                    things is a subject deserving of a deeper and more extended examination than we
                    can here bestow upon it; but as we are unwilling to leave such an interesting
                    matter of philösophical consideration entirely unregarded, we shall here enter
                    into it in the only way compatible with our prescribed limits.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER V.</p>
                <p>OF THE RELATIVE P0SITI0N OF THE CLASS OF INSECTS IN THE ANIMAL KINGDOM.</p>
                <p>A great diversity of opinion has existed from the earliest ages regarding the
                    natural affinities of the different kinds and classes of animated beings to each
                    other, and a consequent contrariety has prevailed in our systems oí
                    classification, which are of course indications of the relation of groups,
                    unless where, for mere convenience, a professedly artificial basis or
                    arrangement, deduced from one or two obvious though unimportant characters, may
                    have been adopted. The majority of naturalists, both ancient and modern, have
                    proceeded upon the idea that all natural objects were <hi rend="italic"
                    >concatenated,</hi> or formed a continuous <hi rend="italic">chain</hi> or
                    linear series, and that whatever hiatus might seem to exist arose either from
                    some great convulsion which had swallowed or swept away the desired links, or
                    from these links bein&lt;&gt; still to be discovered in one or other of those
                    regions of the earth’s surface which still remain to be explored. Hence the
                    dictum of Linnaeus—natura saltus non facit, “When the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Almighty Creator,”</hi> says Mr Kirby, “willed to brin° <hi rend="superscript">
                    f</hi> into existence this mundane system, he formed it according to a
                    preconcerted plan, with all its parts beautifully linked together and mutually
                    corresponding. All things were ordered in <hi rend="italic">measure,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">number,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">weight.</hi><note

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>.</p></note> and calculated in the highest
                    degree to answer the purpose of its <hi rend="smallcaps">Great

                    to Ent. iv. 356.</p></note> Observation and analogy alike combine to prove that
                    there is a regular approximation to each other in the works of God, and that
                    they are related to each other in a variety of ways both naturally and
                    analogically; but it need not be supposed that, in the magnificent plan of the
                    creation, there is no disparity in the relative position of the most nearly
                    related kinds, and no greater interval in one place than another. There is in
                    truth a great variation in the combinations of living beings, though no violent
                    break or sudden interval; in other words, “some continuous species or groups
                    have more characters in common than others.” But in considering the various
                    groups of living creatures, we must ever bear in mind our own ignorance of their
                    actual amount, and the thousands of unknown forms which in all the pride of life
                    may be daily unfolding their exquisite forms and gorgeous colours amid those far
                    deserts where man has never trod, and which for that very reason he regards as
                    <hi rend="italic">solitudes,</hi> though assuredly teeming with all the
                    inexplicable wonders of creation. Let not therefore a <hi rend="italic"
                    >hiatus</hi> be confounded with a <hi rend="italic">sαltus,</hi> the former
                    being merely one of the many blanks in the superficial map of knowledge drawn by
                    man, the latter an absent link in that resplendent chain, to us too often “dark
                    with excessive light,” which in one way or other connects together in divinest
                    harmony the beautiful works of the Creator. That the series of beings, however,
                    was not only continuous, but <hi rend="italic">undeviating,</hi> and ascended in
                    a direct line from the lowest to the highest, was maintained, among many others,
                    by the excellent and ingenious Bonnet, and has generally prevailed till very
                    recent times.</p>
                <p>Now the principle which mainly characterizes the views so mildly advocated by Mr
                    Macleay, and entertained, we believe, about the same period, although without
                    communication, by Agardh, Fries, and other continental naturalists, is
                    this,—that although the natural arrangement of objects is indeed in a continuous
                    series, that series in its progression forms various convolutions, each of which
                    may be represented by a <hi rend="italic">circle</hi> or series returning into
                    itself. He maintains that absolute divisions do not exist in nature, and that a
                    single plan pervades the universe, a plan founded on the principle of series of

                <p>If it were true that the descending scale, as so long supposed, in the perfection
                    of organization, was regular from man to the infusorial tribes, then the lowest
                    of one form of life would naturally lead to the highest of the next ensuing, and
                    the most simply organized of the vertebrated classes would connect most nearly
                    with the most complex of the invertebrated kinds. But this, as we shall
                    afterwards see, is not the case.</p>

                    classification, are accustomed to consider the insect tribes as inferior in the
                    great range of organization to the molluscous animals which inhabit shells,
                    there can be no doubt that they are superior in many of their vital functions.
                    Their powers of locomotion, whether as winged, aquatic, or terrestrial
                    creatures, are finely developed, and their perceptive faculties are much more
                    acute. The symmetrical perfection of their forms, and the articulation of the
                    limbs, in the insect class, seem also in some measure to connect them with the
                    vertebrated tribes. Indeed, even of the latter, many seem far inferior to
                    insects, not only, as Mr Macleay has observed, in the possession of those
                    faculties by which wc are accustomed to estimate the rank of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Vertebrata</hi> among themselves, but also in the complication of
                    their general structure. These and other considerations afford powerful
                    arguments in favour of the <hi rend="italic">circular</hi> system; for it
                    appears necessary, first, that certain affinities of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mollusca</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> and which are obvious
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Cephalopoda</hi> or cuttle-fish, should not be
                    disturbed by any intervening division; and, secondly, that the annulose animals
                    themselves, such as insects, Crustacea, and Arachnides, should not be far
                    separated from <hi rend="italic">GastrobrancJrus</hi> and other genera of
                    cyclostomous fishes; above all, that they should not be made subordinate in rank
                    to such simply organized creatures as compose the greatest part of the Mollusca.
                    “Nov/ these conditions will all be fulfilled if the chain of nature be viewed as
                    returning into itself; whereas they will be completely violated if we account it

                    chiefly owing to the perfection of the circulating system in molluscous animals
                    that they have obtained their present rank; for, in regard to the nervous
                    system, which would have been a truer test, although such tribes as possess a
                    distinct head, and are furnished with tentacula and other organs of sense, have
                    undoubtedly a true brain, yet oysters and many more <hi rend="italic"
                    >acephalous</hi> kinds can lay no other claim to the possession of that organ
                    than what is derived from the analogy which its position in these Testacea is
                    supposed to bear to that of the brain in the gasteropoda. It is a strong fact,
                    however, that so skilful an interpreter of nature as Baron Cuvier should have
                    been determined by that analogy, and should have acceded to. the acephalous
                    Mollusca the possession of a brain, and a general construction, which, upon the
                    whole, he regards as making a nearer approach to that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Vertebrata</hi> than is effected by any annulose animal. Yct in spite of this
                    it would be difficult to contend that an <hi rend="italic">Ascidia</hi> is in

                    competition, either as respects intelligence or complication of mechanism, with
                    the delightful emblem of industry.</p>
                <p>When we call in the aid of anatomy to determine the relative importance which
                    different material beings bear in the scale of the creation, we must consider
                    the beauty of the general mechanism and (speaking humanly) the difficulty of the
                    workmanship, and not any “fancied and often forced resemblance to the human

                    in truth a great error to regard the works of the creation as referable to the
                    human structure, as a standard of perfection; for although the frame of man,
                    when taken as a whole, ought doubtless to be regarded with wonder and admiration
                    as a most complicated yet complete machine, there is at the same time as little
                    doubt that we scarcely possess a single sense or bodily power in which we are
                    not excelled by some irrational beings. Different animals have in fact been
                    constructed on different plans, and man may without impropriety be regarded as
                    upon the whole the most admirably constructed creature of all those which have
                    been organized upon the same general plan with himself, hut with the others he
                    cannot be compared.</p>
                <p>In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Kingdom</hi> of this work we have
                    already shown the importance of the nervous system in the formation of the
                    greater divisions of living creatures, and we there exhibited the relative
                    positions occupied by the different classes of animals in the works of the most
                    distinguished systematic writers. Lamarck divides the animal kingdom into two
                    great branches,—the one containing all those living beings of which the skeleton
                    is <hi rend="italic">internal,</hi> and constructed upon a böny and articulated
                    column, hence called <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    the other consisting of those innumerous kinds of which the skeleton is either
                    wanting, or its supposed analogue is for the most part <hi rend="italic"
                    >external,</hi> and includes the muscles; these are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ln-vertebrata.</hi> This grand distinction is strongly marked throughout the
                    great mass of each division, but it begins to disappear wherever the provinces
                    approach each other. Thus among the turtles or chelonian reptiles, the vertebral
                    column is converted to a row of square osseous plates, which run along the back,
                    and unite with eight pair of expanded ribs, which are anchylosed together by
                    real sutures, and combine to form in fact the <hi rend="italic">external</hi>
                    carapace or shell. In like manner the vertebral column almost disappears among
                    the cyclostomous fishes, while, on the other hand, the Cephalopoda, or
                    cuttle-fish, though belonging to the invertebrate division, exhibit the
                    commencement of an internal skeleton. Μ. Virey, as we have shown in the article
                    above referred to, divided the animal kingdom into <hi rend="italic">three</hi>
                    great branches, according to the different character <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    their nervous system. Baron Cuvier, proceeding upon the consideration of the
                    same important basis, includes all animals within <hi rend="italic">four</hi>
                    primary divisions; while Mr Macleay, according to his peculiar views, perceiving
                    <hi rend="italic">five</hi> great sub-kingdoms in the magnificent <hi
                    rend="italic">circle</hi> of living things, has assumed that number of
                    divisions. We shall here present a sketch of his system, so far as relates to
                    the primary forms, the majority of which agree with those of his predecessors,
                    although their relative position, and circular sequence, if we may so call it,
                    differ.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    occasional exposition of its peculiar and prevailing doctrines cannot prove

                <p>1.sZ, There is a great tribe of beings which possess one principal centre to
                    their nervous system, the great trunk of which, with the said centre, is
                    contained in a bony articulated case, which forms the axis of the whole body,
                    and constitutes the vertebrae and skull of these creatures, which are therefore
                    named <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata.</hi></p>
                <p>2√, In another form of animals the skeleton is as it were external, so as to
                    envelope the whole body, and is divided by transverse folds into a certain
                    number of rings, to the internal surface of which the muscles are always
                    attached. Their nervous system consists of two long strings of medullary matter,
                    passing through the whole of the body, and united to each other, at small
                    distances, into several knots or ganglia. These ganglia may be said to perform
                    for the parts which surround them the function of so many brains, and for a
                    certain period are even sufficient for nervous<pb break="no"

                    after the animal has been cut in pieces. All the beings so constructed are named
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Annulosa.</hi></p>
                <p>3rf, In a third prevailing form there is no articulated skeleton either external
                    or internal, the muscles being attached solely to the skin, which is itself in
                    general soft, though often protected by a calcareous or stony crust, termed the
                    shell. These animals, remarkable, like plants, for the variety of modes in which
                    the sexes are combined, have their nervous system composed of several masses or
                    ganglions united together by nervous threads.. The constituents of this group
                    are almost all aquatic, and are named <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca.</hi></p>
                <p>4zΛ, A fourth form of animal life exhibits to our view the organs of locomotion
                    and sensation arranged in a circular disposition round a centre, so as to give a
                    sort of radiated aspect to the whole body. They are composed of a more or less
                    gelatinous substance, of which the fibres are indistinct. The nervous system of
                    these imperfect beings is but little known. M. Tiedemann, in a work crowned by
                    the French Institute <hi rend="italic">(Mémoire sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatomie</hi><hi rend="italic">des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Asteries),</hi> conceives that the whitish threads which proceed
                    in a radiant direction from around the mouth, and which extend themselves
                    through the entire length of the arms of these animals, form a kind of nervous
                    system, which, from the pulpy nature of the medullary matter, seems to
                    correspond with the gelatinous composition of the animals themselves. They are
                    all aquatic, and are named <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiata.</hi></p>
                <p>5zΛ, Thus far these groups agree in number and constitution with the four primary
                    divisions established by Baron Cuvier,—the <hi rend="italic">Aηnulose</hi>
                    division corresponding with the <hi rend="italic">Animalia Articulata</hi> of
                    the French naturalist, except that it excludes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annelides,</hi> or red-blooded worms, and includes certain radiated species
                    (commonly so called), such as the intestinal group denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >Intestinaux Cavitaires</hi> by the French, or <hi rend="italic">Entozoa
                    Nematoidea</hi> of Rudolphi. But, according to Mr Macleay’s views, there still
                    remains a <hi rend="italic">fifth</hi> form of animal life to be considered,—a
                    group of beings which cannot in the present state of knowledge be better
                    described than as masses of a transparent, homogeneous, mobile, and sensible
                    pulp. There may, however, be observed in this translucent mass innumerable
                    minute granulations, which may be regarded as the nervous molecules dispersed
                    over, or as it were confounded with, the substance of these animals, so as to
                    endow the whole with sensibility, or something which the author calls such,
                    probably for want of a better name. This final division is named <hi

                    rend="italic">Algae.</hi> Their gemmiparous generation is allied only to the
                    very simplest mode of the reproductive system among other animal tribes, but is
                    by no means unfrequent among plants. The method by which they are more or less
                    sustained by the absorption of their external pores, and the attractive
                    influence exercised on them by light, are likewise features only elsewhere to be
                    observed among the vegetable tribes. When a polype is cut in pieces, each of
                    these continues to live, and in time assumes the original form, so that every
                    point of such an animal body may be regarded as possessing an independent life,
                    like that of the lower plants. Lamarck accounts for this peculiarity by
                    regarding their alimentary canal as constituting a second absorbing surface, in
                    no way different from the absorbent external surface of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Agastria,</hi> or infusorial tribes, so that any portion separated from their
                    bodies may live for a time, like the Infusoria, until they have obtained the
                    second or internal absorbent surface.</p>
                <p>“On considering,” says Mr Macleay, “the gelatinous composition of these animals,
                    the dispersion of the nervous molecules through their substance, and the
                    absolute certainty that they are devoid of every sense, except perhaps those of
                    taste and touch, we are led to connect them with the <hi rend="italic"

                    has nevertheless these ganglions dispersed, with little if any arrangement,
                    throughout the whole mass of their body,— and whose senses, so far at least as
                    we are certain of their existence, seem to be confined to those of taste and
                    touch, with the exception of a few animals of the division which possess the
                    organs of sight, and still fewer which possess those of hearing.</p>

                    distinct system of circulation, and peculiar organs for respiration, digestion,
                    and secretion, are even visible in these animals, which connect them in a
                    remarkable manner with a still more perfectly organized family—the <hi

                <p>“These, however, by their red blood, their muscular heart, their jaws acting
                    vertically, their distinct organs for sight, hearing, smell, and taste, their
                    sexes constantly distinct, their vertebral column, and extreme concentration of
                    the nervous system, are sufficiently insulated from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mollusca,</hi> as well as from all other material beings. The group is
                    therefore perfectly distinct and natural; yet if we attempt to define it by any
                    of the above-mentioned various properties, little examination is requisite to
                    convince us that the characteristic thus chosen either disappears in the least

                    respiration and of manducation, the absolute want of the sense of sight, the
                    general habits and external form of these singular fishes, all prove to us that

                    distinct from that generally adopted; but it will be seen that it is not only
                    conformable to nature, but that it removes many of the discrepancies which shock
                    the naturalist in the common systems. For instance, there is an acephalous
                    animal of the division <hi rend="italic">Mollusca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ascidia</hi><hi rend="italic">mammillaris,</hi> Linn.) which exists without
                    any visible organs of sense except that of taste, whose substance is little
                    better than a homogeneous gelatinous pulp, whose inert nature seems to deprive
                    it of any power like that of voluntary motion; a being which is consequently
                    reduced to fix itself to solid bodies, or to be the sport of winds and waves,
                    whose principal sign of life consists in the absorption and spouting forth of
                    water, and whose animal properties, in short, are all comprised in its
                    irritability, its circulation, and respiration. Yet because these two last
                    qualities appear in this animal, whose existence is little better than
                    vegetative, to bear some resemblance to the circulation and respiration in some
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Vertebrata,</hi> we find it placed in the common
                    systems before the bee, which astonishes us by its industry and social
                    qualities; before the ant, which excites our admiration by its frugality and
                    courage; and before the other numberless insects, which by their manners and
                    stratagems have often made the naturalist hesitate as to the point where he
                    would draw the line, and separate instinct from reason.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>Mr Kirby seems equally inclined to accord a step of precedence to the insect and
                    other annulose or articulated tribes over the Mollusca, or at least to maintain
                    that the latter should not be interposed between the former and the vertebrated
                    tribes. “If you inquire,” says he, “into the rank of each of these sub-kingdoms,
                    of course you will assign the principal station to the <hi rend="italic"

                    and over which he immediately presides. If we form the scale according to the
                    nervous system of each province, that in which the organ of sensation and
                    intellect is most concentrated will stand first; and in proportion as this organ

                    be convinced that a heart and circulation alone, unaccompanied by a more
                    concentrated nervous system and more perfect structure, cannot place an animal
                    above those which in every other respect so obviously excel them. With regard to
                    <hi rend="italic">insects</hi> particularly, we may further ask— who that
                    considers how man employs his powers and organs even in his most degraded state,
                    or that contemplates the wonderful works that he is enabled to accomplish when
                    his faculties receive their due cultivation and direction, can avoid regarding
                    him as superior to the rest of the animal creation? And what unsophisticated
                    mind, not entangled in the trammels of system, when it surveys the industry, the
                    various proceedings, and almost miraculous works that have been laid before
                    you,—the waxen palaces of the bee,—the paper cottages of the wasp and hornet,
                    —the crowded metropolis of the white ants,—the arts, the manufactures, and
                    stratagems of other insects,—the associations and labours for the common good of
                    those that are gregarious ;—will not at once conclude that they must be a
                    superior race to the slug, the snail, and others, which live only to eat and
                    propagate their kind? Or who, that considers the wonderful structure of the
                    animals whose cause I advocate,—the analogy that exists between their organs of
                    manducation, of motion, and of sensation, and between various other parts of it,
                    with those of the higher animals,—the acuteness of their senses, their wonderful
                    strength of muscle, and powers of locomotion,—but will think them superior to
                    the headless and almost inanimate oyster or muscle, or the conglomerate <hi

                    again, that observes, that in proportion as pedate animals approach to the human

                    occurs; while spiders and <hi rend="italic">Crustacea,</hi> if they lose a leg,
                    have the power of reproducing it; and the <hi rend="italic">Mollusca,</hi> if

                    are separate, as in the Vertebrates, must be more perfect, and of a higher
                    grade?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Macleay, <hi

                <p>Whoever regards the different classes of the animal kingdom with an observant and
                    discriminating eye, will not fail to perceive that the knowledge of any organ in
                    one particular division of nature is insufficient to enable us to judge of its
                    importance; for such are the changes in the organization of animals, that a
                    system of organs which performs the most important functions in the first
                    division, may either not exist in the next, or be found in a secondary
                    condition, and subordinate to some other system which has acquired the
                    preponderance. In truth, the anatomy of the higher classes having been first
                    profoundly, or at least laboriously studied, before the requisite attention had
                    been bestowed on the structure of Invertebrates, all those organs and functional
                    actions which were invariably more or less sustained and apparent in these first
                    divisions, have been regarded as fundamental, and for this reason alone an equal
                    importance in our systems of classification has been attributed to them
                    throughout the whole animal kingdom. From this course of proceeding, as noticed
                    by Μ. Straus, approximations have resulted which break the natural relationship
                    of many divisions. For example, in the first great division of animals,
                    respiration and circulation being in fact two functions to which all the rest
                    are more or less subordinate, it has been imagined that we ought to regard them
                    as essential in the whole series of animals, and employ them as the sole basis
                    of classification. Among the Vertebrata these functions indeed afford the
                    firmest foundation for a natural distribution; but amongst other classes, on the
                    contrary, in which they are only secondary, their adoption has led to the <pb

                    gravest errors and most palpable contradictions; for it not unfrequently happens
                    that one family of Invertebrata which respires by branchiae, cannot be separated
                    (keep· ing numerous natural affinities in view) from another fa- ' mily in which
                    the respiration is pulmonary or tracheal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    principle of creation being to combine vaιiety in the means with uniformity in
                    the effect, we find that among molluscous animals the circulation <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the blood varies in its manner <hi rend="italic">ad
                    infinitum·,</hi> and has thus led to the most artificial arrangements. Yet few
                    animals in existence have the organs of circulation more complicated than some
                    of the Cephalopoda. Among the annulose animals, also, in which the nature of the
                    nervous system is so uniformly accordant, circulation varies from an extremely
                    perfect to an evanescent state. A mode of nutrition and respiration takes place
                    so entirely different from that exhibited by the vertebrated and molluscous
                    tribes, that they never can be regarded as modifications of the same system. As,
                    then, the general plan of construction of these animals is so different, Mr
                    Macleay regards it as necessary to suppose that the new and dissimilar system of
                    respiration is that which more peculiarly characterizes the annulose group, or,
                    in the author’s words, “is that to which the structure of the animals forming
                    the group tends.” And what makes this supposition the more probable is, that the
                    Annelides, or red-blooded worms, which, of all the articulated tribes, are
                    placed by Cuvier the nearest to the vertebrated classes, are nevertheless
                    imperfectly organized, and of as dull perceptions as any of the annulose
                    division. This could hardly be the case were the Annulosa to be considered with
                    propriety as modifications of the vertebrated structure, while, on the other
                    hand, those annulose classes which respire by tracheae, and coincide in nothing
                    with a vertebrated animal, are, nevertheless, the most active and industrious of
                    their group, although their activity and industry are of a nature entirely
                    different from what is observable among the vertebrated tribes. Now it is
                    difficult, if not impossible, to account for all this, unless we regard every
                    vertebrated creature to have been constructed by the great Creator with
                    reference to one type, and everyannulose with reference to another; and as the
                    former is more imperfect in proportion as it approaches the annulose structure,
                    so the latter also becomes more imperfect in proportion as it obtains a distinct
                    system of circulation and other characteristics of the vertebrated tribes.</p>
                <p>It thus follows that the animals which connect them ought to be extremely
                    imperfect in their organization; and this conclusion is well supported by the
                    sluggish Annelides, in which organs of sense are barely perceptible, and organs
                    of motion by no means so perfect as among the larvae of insects.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"/> Μ. Straus also maintains the
                    opinion that it is the less perfect species of any one great group which
                    approach most closely to the group which precedes or follows them, and that it
                    hence results, that in any division, the species which offer the most elevated
                    organization may be more perfect than such as are placed at the lower confines
                    of a higher division. He admits that a more natural passage exists from the
                    Vertebrata to the Annu]osa, than from the former to the Mollusca; but this
                    connection he considers is by the lowest in the scale of organization of each of
                    these, groups. As soon as the Vertebrata reach the most simple form compatible
                    with their mode of organic life,the great Author of nature commences from that
                    point a new group, that named <hi rend="italic">Annulos</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> α</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> by successively introducing a new
                    series of organs altogether different from those he has abandoned, and by
                    considerably modifying those he has retained. The genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ammo-caetes</hi> (and perhaps also that of <hi rend="italic">Myxine)</hi> form
                    this point among the Vertebrata, while <hi rend="italic">Gordius wA</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Hirudo</hi> compose the corresponding link among the annulose
                    tribes. On either side these animals find their place at the lowest point of the
                    descending scale, formed by each of these two series; and, compared with each
                    other, the two genera of fishes just named, and the abranchial <hi rend="italic"
                    >Annelides,</hi> present some remarkable resemblances in the few organs which
                    they possess.</p>
                <p>The opinion that insects and other annulose animals are more nearly connected
                    with the Vertebrata than are the Mollusca, is regarded as true by Μ. Straus
                    Durckheim, both in regard to the modes of organization according to which these
                    three divisions are formed, and in relation to the degree in which their
                    faculties are developed. The Vertebrata, he observes, are characterized by an
                    articulated body, of which the two lateral,halves are symmetrical, and are
                    sustained by an internal skeleton, the central portion of which is composed of a
                    series of parts, to which the other osseous parts are attached. In the Annulosa
                    the symmetry of the two sides of the body is still greater than in the
                    Vertebrata; the body is likewise articulated, and formed by a series of central
                    parts, to which the others are attached, although they have no internal
                    skeleton. The nervous system in both consists principally of a spinal marrow,
                    from which arise most of the nerves of the body; but there is this difference in
                    the Vertebrata,—the spinal marrow is dorsal, whereas it is ventral among the
                    annulose tribes. The muscular system is also as fully developed in the one as in
                    the other, and offers nearly the same distinct forms. The Mollusca, on the
                    contrary, exhibit characters totally at variance with those now mentioned; for,
                    on the one hand, their body no longer exhibits a perfect parity of parts, nor is
                    it in any degree articulated; on the other, the nervous system is not
                    longitudinal, nor its situation constant, while its mass is greatly decreased.
                    The muscular system is also in general much less perfect, and, considered in
                    detail, the muscles are less distinct, and only form, throughout the greater
                    part of the body, a mass of fibres so interlaced as to be incapable of
                    separation, thus conducting us to <hi rend="italic">Entozoa,</hi> of which the
                    body is only a continuous <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> without distinct
                    muscles. According to the author last named, the character which eminently
                    distinguishes the Mollusca from the two other divisions is, that in these the
                    organs of <hi rend="italic">animal,</hi> in the Mollusca those of <hi
                    rend="italic">vegetable</hi> life, are the most predominant; from whence it
                    follows that the latter are totally devoid of industry, and of that higher mode
                    of perception approaching to <hi rend="italic">intelligence,</hi> which insects
                    possess in a degree surpassing all other invertebrated tribes.</p>
                <p>Having entered into the preceding investigation with the view of illustrating the
                    true position of the annulose division in relation to the other sub-kingdoms of
                    animal life, we shall now, in more direct reference to the proper subjects of
                    our present dissertation, that is, the hexapod or six-footed insects, exhibit,
                    by means of the following diagram, the views entertained by Mr Macleay regarding
                    the natural affinities observable among the annulose tribes themselves. The
                    reader will perceive that the circles of <hi rend="italic">Mandibulatα</hi> and

                <p>Our next subject of consideration is onc which has not previously formed a part
                    of any of our encyclopaedias of knowledge.</p>
                <p>CHAPTER VI.</p>
                <p>THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF INSECTS.</p>
                <p>This topic has indeed been much less attended to as a matter of philosophical
                    investigation than it deserves. When we take an extended view of the general
                    distribution of animals and plants, we find that they are usually disposed over
                    the earth’s surface in bands or parallel zones, corresponding in a great measure
                    with the peculiarities of temperature and climate which are appropriate to the
                    nature of each. When the temperature of a particular latitude becomes colder, as
                    on mountains or highly elevated plains,—or warmer, as on plains by the sea
                    shore, or in low lying sheltered valleys,—we find, in the former case, that the
                    species approximate in their nature and characters to those of a more northern,
                    in the latter to those of a more southern parallel. Of course the zones of
                    vegetable and of animal life do not correspond at all strictly with the <hi
                    rend="italic">latitudinal</hi> lines of our geographical system. Humboldt has
                    indeed shown, that within 15° or 20° from the equator, the mean annual
                    temperature is nearly the same in all longitudes of equal elevation, or is at
                    least but slightly varied by local circumstances. In other words, the isothermal
                    lines are more regularly parallel with those of the equator. But in temperate
                    and northern countries the same uniformity of temperature in each portion of the
                    same parallel is not observable; all western coasts, and districts of continents
                    and of considerable islands, being of a higher temperature than those of the
                    same latitudes along the eastern shores. The mean temperature of the North Cape,
                    under the seventy-first degree of north latitude, does not exceed, indeed
                    corresponds with, that of Labrador, which is 14° further south; and that of the
                    west of Ireland, in the fifty-fourth degree, agrees with the forty-third
                    parallel in the United States.</p>
                <p>In relation to zoological geography, 'indeed, there are several other minor
                    circumstances which tend to change or counterbalance the more usual results, and
                    consequently to derange such calculations as might very reasonably be formed
                    upon a knowledge of latitudinal and longitudinal position, and of the height of
                    a country above the level of the sea. The nature of the soil and surface, the
                    different degrees of dryness and humidity, and the consequent character of the
                    climate and vegetation, the comparative extent of land and water, the extent and
                    continuity of forests, marshes, and sandy deserts, the direction of mountain
                    ranges, and the form and position of lakes ;—these and several other
                    circumstances must be taken into consideration, and will be found materially to
                    affect the distribution of animal life over the surface of the earth.</p>
                <p>It does not appear that the climates of insects, or those peculiarities of
                    temperature and other physical attributes under which certain groups or species
                    appear to predominate, have been as yet studied in connection with our imperfect
                    knowledge of isothermal lines. Humboldt, indeed, has remarked, that the
                    geographical stations of the gnats and some other insects of South America did
                    not appear to depend solely on the <hi rend="italic">heat</hi> of the climate,
                    the excess of humidity, or the thickness of the forests, but on local and
                    unappreciable circumstances.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Personal Narrative,</hi> vol. v. p.
                    88.</p></note> It is evident, however, that the characteristic stations of
                    insects are mainly dependent on the degree of temperature, so influential on the
                    development and distribution of all the other varied forms of animal life. An
                    increase of caloric seldom fails to produce a corresponding increase and
                    alteration in the number and character of entomological forms; and when we
                    travel from the hyperborean regions towards the sunny south, we find that the
                    tiny multitudes accumulate in all the warmer portions of the temperate zone,
                    till they swarm between the tropics. Otho Fabricius resided six years in
                    Greenland, and during that period he collected only sixty-three species of the
                    insect class, properly so called. In the still higher latitude of Winter
                    Harbour, where Sir Edward Parry sojourned, only six species were collected from
                    the beginning of September till the August following. Mr Kirby has stated that
                    in Greenland every order of insect has its representatives, except Orthoptera
                    and Hemiptera; but in Melville Island, besides these deficiencies, neither
                    coleopterous nor neuropterous species exist, or at least were observable; and
                    even the mosquito, that shrill tyrant of the Lapland plains, appeared to have
                    ceased from troubling along those hyperborean shores. The most northern locality
                    of any insect yet ascertained is that of the <hi rend="italic">Aphis
                    borealis,</hi> taken in latitude 82° 26' 44", about one hundred miles from the
                    nearest known land.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>This
                    species was found in the boat during the last day of Sir E. Parry’s attempt to
                    reach the north pole over the ice. There was no vestige of vegetation around the
                    adventurous party’; and we think it more probable that the forlorn insect had
                    been carried, <hi rend="italic">nolens</hi><hi rend="italic">volens,</hi> from a
                    somewhat more southern quarter.</p></note> It is probable, however, that the
                    distribution of many northern species is still unknown. It was formerly supposed
                    that in Iceland there were none, and that even in Norway there were very few,
                    their absence from those countries being attributed to excess of cold. This
                    opinion, however, was contradicted by Horrebow, so far as Iceland was concerned;
                    and Olafsen and Povalsen, during their sojourn there, collected 200 different
                    species in one small valley. It must indeed be borne in mind, that insects can
                    escape the extreme of cold, not only, as Mr Macleay observes, by passing certain
                    periods in the <hi rend="italic">pupa</hi> or torpid state, but also by being
                    while in that condition usually buried in the earth, where they are greatly
                    protected from the rigours of the winter season. “What they chiefly require<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193746532?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6532-0098"/> is
                    the presence of heat during some period of their existence; and the greater,
                    within certain limits, is the heat, the more active will be their vital
                    principle. On the American continent the extremes of heat and cold in the course
                    of the year are, as is well known, incompaιa-bly greater than in places of the
                    same latitude in Europe. We may therefore readily eoneeive how particular
                    families of insects will inhabit a wider range of latitude in the former country
                    than in the latter. W e see also how insects may swarm ijι the very coldest
                    climates, such as Lapland and Spitzbergen, where the short summer ean boast of
                    extraordinary rises in the thermometer; because the energy of the vital
                    principle in such animals is, within certain limits, proportionate to the degree
                    of warmth to which they may be subjected, and escapes in a manner the severe
                    action of cold.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Hor. Εnt.</hi> p. 45.</p></note> It is on these principles that Mr
                    Macleay accounts for what certainly at first seems an extraordinary circumstance
                    in the geography of insects; namely, that their tropical structure extends much
                    farther north in America than in Europe; that is, in a manner directly the
                    reverse of that which has been noted by botanists to occur in the vegetable
                    kingdom. For example, the <hi rend="italic">Chamcerops</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >humilis,</hi> a species of palm, occurs along the southern shore of France, in
                    latitude 44°; while on the eastern coasts of North America the hardiest of the
                    family, <hi rend="italic">C. palmetto,</hi> does not advance beyond the 34°. But
                    if we examine <hi rend="italic">Copris</hi><hi rend="italic">carnifex,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cetoηia</hi><hi rend="italic">nitida,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    from the neighbourhood of New York, and compare them with species of the same
                    families from Brazil, we shall find their difference of structure infinitely
                    less than that which would result from a comparison of the entomological
                    productions of the environs of Madrid with those of the banks of the Congo.<note

                    >Ibid.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>A slight consideration of the subject suffices to show that certain differences
                    in the relative intensities of summer and of winter must exercise a strongly
                    modifying power on the influence, of mean annual temperature, even in countries
                    where that temperature is one and the same. “Several fruits, as the olive and
                    grape, as well as the different kinds of corn and other annuals, depend more on
                    the heat of summer than of the whole year; while others, impatient of cold, and
                    not requiring great heat, have their range more influenced by the temperature of
                    winter. Now, it is almost an universal rule, that of two places whose mean
                    temperature is the same, that nearest the sea, and more particularly a western
                    sea, has a temperate summer and a milder winter. Hence the inland situation is
                    better adapted to the growth of corn and fruits, the maritime one to the
                    preservation of tender plants. In Europe, the northern boundary of the vine and
                    olive rises as we go eastward, though in so doing we encounter a lower mean
                    annual temperature. The <hi rend="italic">Arbutus Unedο, Sibthorpia Europ&lt;xa,
                    Erica</hi><hi rend="italic">ciliaris,</hi> &amp;c. rise in a westerly

                    vegetation requires the absence of extreme cold rather than the presence of
                    extreme heat, will probably extend itself in a tropical form more towards the
                    poles on a dry continent than on a moist or marshy one. Tropical plants,
                    therefore, will thrive better in Thibet and other inland parts of northern Asia,
                    than they would do if transported to positions of the same latitude in Ameriça;
                    for in the latter country the extremes of heat and eold are too distant from
                    eaeh other, f hus the vegetation of Canada does not correspond either in its

                <p>Mr Macleay admits, that although in his opinion the insect tribes suffer less in
                    cold climates than plants, for] the reasons which we have already stated, it
                    does not therefore follow that the prevalence <hi rend="italic">of</hi> eold has
                    no effect in relation to the destruction, or rather we should say the
                    prevention, of insect life. In truth the diminution of the number of species
                    becomes very conspicuous as we advance towards the poles. But this the learned
                    author of the <hi rend="italic">Horae Entomologicae</hi> supposes to be owing
                    rather to the short continuance of the summer warmth than to the lowness of its
                    existing degree. In accordance with this view we certainly find that many
                    insects, such as gnats, mosquitoes, &amp;c. which pass their larva state in
                    water,—thus avoiding the external cold, and whose existence in the perfect state
                    being naturally ephemeral, must therefore suffer little from the shortness of
                    summer,—are nowhere more troublesome than among the moors and marshes of the
                    north. On the other hand, the number of <hi rend="italic">coleopterous</hi>
                    species, which, being naturally longer lived, require a greater eontinuanee of
                    warmth, is sensibly diminished amid those dreary wastes.</p>
                <p>It is natural to suppose that if certain plants are peculiar to certain climates,
                    so also insects, the greater proportion of which not only feed on plants, but
                    are each according to its kind almost restricted to particular species, must in
                    like manner be characteristic of special localities. Whether this restriction in
                    diet holds good in relation to the carnivorous kinds, that is, whether one kind
                    of carcass is not as good as another, is a point which has not yet attracted the
                    consideration of the naturalist. Such as feed on living animals (the <hi
                    rend="italic">thalcrophαgous</hi> Carnivora) are probably more restricted in
                    their parasitical attachments. But the coprophagous or dung beetles, and such as
                    prey on dead animals (the <hi rend="italic">saprophagous</hi> Carnivora), may be
                    supposed to be less regular in the limits of their localities, occurring
                    wherever their favourite food happens (not seldom accidentally) to have been
                    deposited. In sueh cases, of course, less advantage results to the entomologist
                    from local references, as the appearance of an insect in the place cited may
                    have been entirely accidental, and incapable of affording any great probability
                    of its recurrence; yet even the saprophagous beetles are no doubt regulated by
                    temperature and elevation, and it is likely that a dead body by the sea shore
                    will exhibit different species from a similar nidus exposed on a mountain
                    summit.</p>
                <p>The geographical distribution of insects in general is, in truth, a subject of
                    too difficult and complex a nature to admit of being worthily treated within our
                    present limits. We shall, however, notice a few facts which, though presented in
                    a somewhat desultory manner, we trust will not be found entirely devoid of
                    interest.</p>
                <p>We may observe, in the first place, that there are two aspects under which the
                    subject of zoological geography may be viewed. We may either proceed upon the
                    consideration of the divisions laid down by politico-geographieal
                    writers,—divisions which arc no doubt sufficiently arbitrary in relation to the
                    physical qualities of countries,—and describe or indicate the species and genera
                    which we have ascertained to characterize such divisions, —or we may take into
                    view the Systematic arrangements of naturalists, and by tracing and pointing out
                    the different localities of the various tribes, genera, and species which we
                    find there arranged, thus arrive by another route at the conclusions sought for.
                    We shall here, even <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746545?mode=fullsize"

                    in some measure, both these processes; and while we indicate the varied
                    localities of certain species, we shall also give an occasional sketch of the
                    equally varied entomological productions of particular portions of the earth’s
                    surface.</p>

                    their metropolis or centre of dominion in the temperate zone, and more
                    especially within the British islands; for while Dcjean, in the last edition of
                    his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi> (1833), gives only 789 species as his total
                    amount both of European and exotic kinds, Mr Stephens enumerates above 750 as
                    indigenous to Britain. This apparent excess may, however, partly arise from the
                    great attention which has been paid in this country to the collection of the
                    minuter sorts, which are frequently neglected in foreign lands for the sake of

                    in Scandinavia, are unknown in Britain, may be inferred from some of our
                    preceding observations: in a torpid state, or under the form of larvae, they are
                    capable of enduring the utmost rigour of a Swedish winter; but when revived by
                    the returning spring, the cool and variable summers of our “sea-girt isle” would
                    prove insuflicient for the full development of their vital functions.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Mcloe</hi> seems almost peculiar to Europe; and
                    Britain, which possesses nine species, has been regarded as one of its most
                    characteristic countries. The entomological characters of the southern shores of
                    Europe strongly exhibit their geographical approach to the African continent.
                    The <hi rend="italic">Ateuchus</hi><hi rend="italic">sacer</hi> (the renowned
                    species sculptured of old by the Egyptians on their sacred monuments), and

                    tribes of those more exclusively African forms which have their centre of
                    dominion in the burning deserts. Along the Mediterranean shores the
                    entomological traveller may study the habits of many curious insects of the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Onitis, Cebrio, Pirnelia, Brachycerus, Brentus,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Scarites,</hi> and may also enrich his collection by the
                    capture of many beautiful butterflies, and other lepidopterous insects, which
                    are more truly characteristic of Northern Africa. Spain especially exhibits many
                    features of African zoology. We shall not here talk of the caméléons, the
                    scorpions, and other species belonging to the separate classes of reptiles and
                    Arachnides; but the European entomologist will there discover for the first time
                    several species of the genera <hi rend="italic">Erodius, Sepidium,
                    Brachinus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pimclia.</hi> It is however only after
                    crossing the Mediterranean, and traversing the African shores, whether north of
                    the Atlas, or eastward towards the coasts of the Red Sea, that our eyes are
                    delighted with the hitherto unknown forms <hi rend="italic">of Aηthia,
                    Graphipterus, Siagona,</hi> and numerous other species unknown to the colder and
                    moister shores of Europe.</p>
                <p>But no sooner do we leave the Mediterranean coasts of Africa, and enter upon the
                    more weary and disastrous pilgrimage of the great deserts, the apparently
                    limitless expanse of which so soon greets the eye of the yet undaunted
                    traveller, than almost all vestiges of European life, whether human or brute,
                    disappear; and Nubia, Ethiopia, Senegal, and a great part of Guinea, exhibit
                    entomological forms, cognate in character when compared among themselves, but
                    separated in every sense of the words “<hi rend="italic">longo intervallo'</hi>
                    from those of Europe. As we proceed farther southwards, where the chariot of the
                    “Great Apollo” rolls on with a still fiercer and more fiery lustre, and the
                    beams of a vertical sun induce even the tawny Moor and the woolly-headed negro
                    to avoid his scorching and sometimes fatal rays, we discover many extraordinary
                    forms of insect life, called into existence through the instrumentality of that
                    bright effulgence which the pale-faced European has so often sought to withstand
                    in vain. From the burning regions of Guinea, and the parched shores of the
                    Congo, we derive the finest of those magnificent coleopterous insects named
                    generically <hi rend="italic">Goliathus</hi> by Lamarck. The western and
                    equinoctial parts of Africa also yield us the species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Petalochei-rus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Enceladus,</hi> while the Cape of

                <p>Both Madagascar and St Helena present a few insects which, to a certain extent,
                    demonstrate the African complexion of those islands; but the latter especially
                    is also allied, by its entomological features, to some of the southwestern
                    countries of Asia. According to Latreille, Africa furnishes no species of the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Passalus,</hi> although it is elsewhere widely
                    distributed over America and the East Indies. The genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Graphypterus, Eurichora,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pneu-mora,</hi> are
                    probably peculiar to z∖frica. Among the hemipterous insects of Africa may be
                    mentioned the <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi><hi rend="italic">precaria,</hi> an
                    object of superstitious veneration among the Hottentots, who hold in the highest
                    respect the person on whom the insect happens to alight. Locusts are of common
                    occurrence in many parts of Africa, where, as “a great people and a strong,”
                    they still produce their days of “darkness and of gloominess,” their days “of
                    clouds and of thick darkness,” so magnificently described by the Prophet Joel.
                    One of the most formidable of the insect tribes of this continent is the <hi
                    rend="italic">Termes</hi><hi rend="italic">bellicosus,</hi> or <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193746558?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6558-0100"/> white ant. It
                    dwells in congregated troops, consisting of labourers, soldiers, and sovereigns.
                    The habitations are of a conical form, built of mud and clay, from ten to twelve
                    feet high, and divided in the interior by thin partitions into a variety of
                    cells. Indeed, Jobson, in his <hi rend="italic">History of Guinea,</hi> alleges
                    that they are often twenty feet high; and he adds, that he frequently found them
                    extremely serviceable in screening himself and his companions while engaged in
                    the pursuit of antelopes and other game. The queen-mother of this species
                    becomes of so enormous a size in the pregnant state, that her abdomen exceeds,
                    by two thousand times, the bulk of the rest of her body; and when the ova are
                    fully formed, she obtrudes them at the rate of sixty in a minute, or 72,000 in
                    twenty-four hours. Madeira and the Canary Islands are decidedly African in their
                    productions,—the insects, especially, exhibiting a strong relationship to those
                    of Barbary and the adjacent districts.</p>
                <p>Latreille, while considering the geographical distribution of insects, has well
                    observed, that where the empire of Flora terminates, there the domain of zoology
                    likewise comes to an end. Animals which feed on vegetables cannot support
                    themselves in a region entirely sterile, and such as are carnivorous are thus
                    themselves indirectly deprived of sustenance in consequence of the want of
                    vegetation. Those countries of which the vegetable productions are the most
                    gorgeous and abundant, are likewise the most productive of insect life. Both
                    effects spring from a temperature high and continuously sustained, from moderate
                    moisture, and a varied soil. The more closely, on the contrary, we approach the
                    other extreme, where clouds and darkness obscure the sky, and the ground is so
                    often covered with a pure but unproductive garment of snow, and the lifeless
                    solitude of the mountain valleys is defended by the icy battlements of the
                    enduring glaciers,—the more we shall perceive a diminution in the amount of
                    organic, and more especially of insect life. If, instead of travelling
                    northwards to the polar plains, we ascend some majestic mountain even of a
                    tropical range, the same phenomena are observable. Although its base should be
                    laved by the glittering waters of an equatorial sea, and its sloping sides
                    should bear the arborescent ferns and plumy palm trees of the warmest
                    climes,—still, should the mountain belong to the highest class, like those of
                    Cayambé or Chimborazo, long before the traveller has approached its barren
                    summit, he will perceive the most striking symptoms of that sterility which we
                    are apt to associate only with the polar regions. The <hi rend="superscript">
                    ii</hi> bright consummate flowers” of the lower plains have disappeared,— the
                    parrots in their gay attire no longer adorn the stunted trees,—and the insect
                    tribes, so fantastic in their forms, and of such surpassing lustre, have
                    gradually decreased in size and number, and at last present, in common with the
                    vegetable kingdom, an aspect and character much more allied to those of northern
                    climes. Finally, unless it may be that some giant condor, or other bird of
                    loftiest flight, is seen floating in the thin air of those extremest heights,
                    there is nothing to remind the adventurous traveller that he is actually within
                    the <hi rend="italic">burning</hi> tropics; for all his perceptions and*
                    sensations might be identical were he suddenly transported to the summit of

                <p>It is thus that, on the Central Alps of Europe, we meet with many species

                    Many other butterflies which, in the northern provinces of France, occur not far
                    from warm and low-lying sheltered stations, are found in the southern
                    departments and in Italy on alpine or sub-alpine situations. The same may be
                    said of <hi rend="italic">Carabus auratus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    extent of which might be supposed to preclude any great disparity in the
                    entomological productions of its geographical divisions, there is an obvious
                    difference between its southern and northern quarters. The colder and more
                    cloudy clime of Scotland is poor in Lepidoptera of the finer kinds. Here no
                    purple emperor, “proud of cerulean dyes,” floats over the far-stretching

                    interesting, however, to observe the analogy which exists between the insects,
                    more especially the Coleoptera of Scotland and of Sweden. Several of the rarest,
                    species lately discovered in the northern quarters of the island, such as <hi

                    characteristic of the north-western division of the continent of Europe.</p>
                <p>From these and similar observations, those who have viewed the science of
                    entomology with a philosophic eye have endeavoured, in common with geographers,
                    to divide the surface of the earth into different climatic regions. But while
                    the latter have assumed as a basis the progressive differences in the longest
                    continuance of the natural day, the former proceed upon a knowledge of the mean
                    temperature of countries. Fabricius, in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophia</hi><hi rend="italic">Entomologica,</hi> divides climate in general
                    into eight subclimates, or restricted stations, viz. the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Indian,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Southern,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mediterranean,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Northern,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eastern,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Western,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alpine.</hi> But it is easy, as Μ. Latreille has remarked, to perceive, by the
                    enumeration of the particular countries which arc referred to each of these
                    divisions, that the divisions themselves arc by no means established on a fixed
                    foundation; and that the suppression of several would be necessary were the
                    principle on which they are established followed out with rigour. The subclimate
                    which he names <hi rend="italic">Mediterranean</hi> comprises the countries
                    adjacent to the Mediterranean Sea, with Media and Armenia. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Northern</hi> extends from Paris to Lapland. 1he <hi rend="italic">Eastern</hi>
                    consists of the north of Asia, of Siberia, and of the cold or mountainous
                    portion of Syria. The <hi rend="italic">ĩĩ estern</hi> contains Canada, the
                    United States, Japan, and ιina. From these it will be seen that this arrangement
                    is in many respects extremely arbitrary; for several of the above-named
                    districts, although placed under separate climates, have a mean temperature
                    identically the same. Moreover, many countries in which the mean temperature is
                    the same, are characterized and distinguished <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193746571?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6571-0101"/> by a great
                    disparity in the nature of their animal produc- tions.</p>
                <p>Μ. Latreille has taken another view of this interesting subject, more in
                    conformity with the dictum of' Linnaeus, regarding the characters of genera, the
                    spirit of which may be also here applied. “Let the insects point out the
                    climate, and not the climate the insects.” He takes into consideration all those
                    genera which seem to be appropriated exclusively to certain determinate spaces
                    on the surface of our earth. It is true that the groundwork of this method is
                    much more restricted than that from which Humboldt and other writers on
                    botanical geography have deduced their observations on the distribution of
                    plants; for our knowledge of the precise localities of foreign insects is by no
                    means ample.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The second
                    edition of Comte Dejean’s <hi rend="italic">Catalogue</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Coléoptères</hi> now exhibits a very interesting picture of the distribution of
                    that order. We shall refer to it more particularly when we come to treat of the
                    coleopterous tribes.</p></note> The great French entomologist rather upbraids
                    the majority of scientific travellers with their negligence in these
                    particulars; for it is not the locality alone, but the physical character of the
                    climate, the mineralogical qualities of the soil, the vicinity of wood and
                    water, and the height above the level of the sea, which ought to be noted in
                    connection with the occurrence of particular species. We have already noticed
                    the fondness of <hi rend="italic">Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic">Cleopatra</hi>
                    and other insects for a calcareous soil. The <hi rend="italic">Pimelia
                    bicaudata,</hi> so common in the neighbourhood of Marseilles, scarcely ever
                    occurs at a distance from the sea. If the interior parts of Barbary, Syria, and
                    Egypt, present us with species of the same genus, this entomological relation no
                    doubt results from the soil of these countries being impregnated with saline
                    particles, and abounding in plants of the genus <hi rend="italic">Salsola.</hi>
                    The insects which occur in the countries which border the Mediterranean, the
                    Black, and the Caspian Seas, exhibit many analogies.</p>
                <p>The following propositions result from Μ. Latreille’s researches in
                    Entomology.</p>
                <p>lsζ The totality or a great proportion of the insects which’ occur in countries
                    of which the qualities of the soil and temperature are analogous, are
                    nevertheless of different species, if these countries, though placed under the
                    same parallel, are widely distant from each other. All the insects brought from
                    the most eastern parts of Asia, for example China, are distinct from those of
                    Europe and of Africa, whatever may be the latitude, elevation, or mean
                    temperature of these Asiatic countries.</p>
                <p>2&lt;7, The generality of insects still differ specifically in countries agreeing
                    in the characters of their soil and temperature, but separated, independently of
                    mere latitudinal difference, by great natural barriers, such as chains of lofty
                    mountains, vast sandy deserts, or the waters of an intervening ocean. Thus the
                    species of New Holland or of America are easily recognised among those of the
                    various countries of the ancient world; and even the insects of Grenada and
                    Peru, though at no great distance from those of Guiana, are in a great measure
                    different, owing no doubt to the interposition of the vast chain of the
                    Cordilleras. When we pass from Piedmont into France by the Col de Tende, wc
                    perceive a marked difference of species, even in that short journey. These
                    rules, however, like most others, however general, are subject to several
                    individual exceptions. Several species of insect are distributed over such a
                    vast extent of territory as entitles them to be regarded as genuine
                    cosmopolites. Thus the painted lady-butterfly (<hi rend="italic">Vanessa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Cardui)</hi> is found over great portions of Europe, Asia, Africa,
                    and America, and is as] familiarly known in the central islands of the vast
                    Pacific Ocean, as in the flower-gardens of England.<note anchored="true"

                    France. We have already mentioned the great extent of territory occupied by
                    several aquatic beetles; and these and other examples which might be adduced
                    remind us of M. Latreille’s next proposition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> Many <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> of insects, and
                    particularly such as feed on vegetables, are spread over numerous points of the
                    principal divisions of our globe.</p>
                <p>4Z∕i, Other genera are exclusively proper to a certain extent of country, whether
                    of the ancient continents or the new. According to Latreille, no species of the
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Anthia, Graphipterus, Erodius, Pimelia,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Scaurus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Cossyphus, Mylabris, Erachycerus,
                    Nemoptera, Apis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Anthophora,</hi> occur in America;
                    and many genera of the family <hi rend="italic">Scarabeidae</hi> are likewise
                    there unknown. But the western world, on the other hand, produces several genera
                    which we do not meet with elsewhere,—such as <hi rend="italic">Agra,</hi><hi

                    several genera peculiar to Africa. <hi rend="italic">Colliuris</hi> is

                    New Holland.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">ĩ&gt;th,</hi> Many species in their natal countries effect
                    particular localities. Several alpine butterflies are never observed at any
                    considerable distance from the region of perpetual snow, while other species
                    prefer the warmer air of low-lying sheltered meads at no great height above the
                    level of the sea.</p>

                    and the breadth of which is measurable by a portion of a circle parallel to the
                    equator. The species proper to one of these zones disappear gradually, and give
                    place in the same manner to those of the zone following; so that from space to
                    space the dominating species, or even the totality, have undergone a
                    change.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    to that series of horizons which the traveller discovers in proportion as he
                    removes from his first point of departure.</p>
                <p>Sweden presents us with many insects peculiar to that country, some of which are
                    confined to its more northern provinces, such as Lapland. But its southern
                    portions, •for example Scania, produce, though still in limited numbers, many
                    German insects. France, as far as the 45th or 44th degree, supplies the
                    entomologist with many of the species which occur in the last-named countries;
                    but the Rhine and its eastern mountains form a kind of frontier line, which many
                    others do not appear to pass. The first of the species characteristic of the

                    still more obvious at Fontainebleau and the environs of Orleans, where, in
                    addition to the above-named species, we may perceive <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phasma</hi><hi rend="italic">Possii, Mantis</hi><hi rend="italic">pagana,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Sphinx celerio-</hi> But these are but the forerunners of
                    such as are native to southern countries properly so called. The culture of the
                    olive, the spontaneous growth of the Arbutus, the pomegranate, and of lavender,
                    are botanical symptoms which cherish in the mind of an instructed entomologist
                    the hopes of a rich increase. This change is very obvious in France, when,
                    journeying from Paris to Marseilles, we reach the territory of Montélimart. The
                    eastern provinces of Spain, those sunny regions where the orange and the
                    palm-tree are luxuriant without the aid of man, produce more abundantly the
                    rarer southern insects of France, intermingled with species hitherto unperceived
                    in Europe.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge of the insects of the south-east of Europe is by no means ample.
                    Latreille informs us that the <hi rend="italic">Papilio Chrysippus</hi> of
                    Linnaeus, common in Egypt and the East Indies, makes its first appearance as a
                    European species in the kingdom of Naples. The greater proportion, however, of
                    the Egyptian species are entirely unknown in Europe, although they pertain, in
                    numerous instances, to the same natural families as our own. The southern parts
                    of that land of pyramids produce many magnificent species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Copris,</hi> such as <hi rend="italic">C. Midas,</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>Similar successions of species take place from east to west, and reciprocally.
                    Most of the insects which ocçur in Normandy and Brittany likewise inhabit the
                    southern parts of England. The northerly departments of France, situated on the
                    banks of the Rhine, have in many respects a community of species with the
                    neighbouring provinces of Germany; while, again, several species of the Levant,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Cantharis orientalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Mylabris

                    Lepidoptera, appear to have journeyed far westward from their ancestral homes,
                    and fixed their abode in the Austrian territory. The collections formed by
                    Olivier in Asia Minor, Syria, and Persia, prove that the insects of those
                    countries, though nearly related to those of the south of Europe, are not
                    specifically the same; and a likejuđgment, with some exceptions, may be
                    entertained of the species of Southern Russia and the Crimea. The entomological
                    productions of the coast of Coromandel, of Bengal, of the south of China, and
                    even of Thibet, possess many characters in common; but they are entirely
                    distinct from those of Europe. In the regions just named we discover no species

                <p>The great Asiatic division of our globe, when considered in its entomological and
                    other zoological relations., may indeed be partitioned into several different
                    departments.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Siberian or most northern portion, in consequence ofl the severity of its winter
                    season, possesses, even in its southern districts, many attributes of the arctic
                    regions; while its inland valleys, and the upper basins of its numer. ous and
                    far-flowing rivers, are enriched, during a brilliant though short-lived summer,
                    with many of the more gorgeous forms of insect life. Another vast and
                    imperfectly known region of Asia is bounded to the north by Siberia, and to the
                    south by those highly elevated table-lands which terminate among the Himalaya
                    Mountains. This division still presents several features which prove its
                    assimilation in some respects to the characters which distinguish animal life in
                    Europe; for although it is undoubtedly characterized by numerous peculiar forms
                    of existence, yet many of its genera and species are either the genuine types of
                    groups which occur in countries with which we are familiar, or pertain to groups
                    which are themselves well exemplified by European insects. But we now speak
                    rather in relation to the higher animals than the insect tribes; for, in truth,
                    of the Entomology of Central Asia we have as yet a most inadequate idea. Among
                    the Himalaya Mountains, and other southern portions of this division, we begin
                    to discover many genera of birds which occur in the lower lands of Hindustan and
                    the peninsular projection of Malacca; and if the entomological kingdom is at all
                    regulated by corresponding rules, we may infer that some of the southern insects
                    also make their way up those stupendous valleys. The same circumstance» indeed
                    occurs, we mean the like transition of species, in all the great geographical
                    sections of the groups of animal life. “Each extensive division is characterized
                    by several peculiar forms, and yet at the same time nourishes many species which
                    are common alike to it and to other regions; and it is only under some peculiar
                    circumstances of local situation, that either the zoological or botanical
                    products undergo a sudden change in character and condition. As the adventurous
                    and observant traveller advances on his journey, a few species are continually
                    perceived to decrease in number, and then to disappear, while their places are
                    supplied by others, which, at first but thinly scattered, gradually acquire an
                    accession of numbers, till they too have reached their full amount or centre of
                    dominion; but the change being only partial from place to place, the difference
                    is no more suddenly perceptible than that in the horizon by which the traveller
                    is surrounded, and a portion of which in his onward progress becomes insensibly,
                    from the circumference, the very centre of the field of vision.”<note

                    than the European forms of animal life almost entirely disappear, and are
                    succeeded by others of a richer and more varied character of form and aspect,
                    some of which, however, extend to the parallel latitudes of the African
                    continent. The Asiatic Islands again present us with another picture, and this
                    latter change may be said to commence at the southern extremity of the Isthmus
                    of Malacca. Java and Sumatra, in Mr Swainson’s opinion, will probably be found
                    to be the metropolis or central region of this range, which still produces
                    several of the forms of Northern India; while in New Guinea and New Ireland, the
                    Asiatic forms properly so called begin to disappear, and are replaced by many
                    singular and interesting species, which exhibit the commencement of what may be
                    termed the Australian kingdom. <hi rend="italic">Papilio</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    resemblance to Africa. Nevertheless the species are distinct, and many of them
                    present no analogy whatever to those of the continent. The Isles of France and
                    Bourbon likewise manifest traces of the same family resemblance; but, on a
                    general view, they show a closer connection with the East Indian species. Their
                    ascertained number is, however, extremely limited.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Although the Entomology of New Holland may be said, like that of all other vast
                    tracts of country, to exhibit a special type, it is yet composed, in some of its
                    principal portions, of species analogous to those of the Moluccas and the
                    south-east of India. This great fifth continent, as it has been called, is,
                    however, less rich in insects than many other foreign countries, its soil being
                    drier, and not so well wooded. The genus <hi rend="italic">Mylabris,</hi> so
                    abundant in the south of Europe, in Africa, and Asia, does not appear to pass
                    beyond Timor. In that respect, then, New Holland agrees with America, as well as
                    in the possession of <hi rend="italic">Pαssαlus,</hi> a genus of which the
                    species have been more particularly noted as inhabitants of the new world.
                    Several generic groups of the latter region present a closer resemblance to
                    those of the east of Asia, than to such as are characteristic of the ancient
                    world. The insects of New Zealand, of New Caledonia, and the circumjacent islcs,
                    show an obvious relation to those of New Holland; and the same may be said of
                    such as occur in the archipelagos of the Great Southern Ocean. These islands,
                    composed in great measure of aggregations of polypiferous rocks, form a chain
                    which unites them in a westerly direction to the preceding regions, and from
                    which many of their natural productions may have been received in the long
                    course of ages. This natural communication could not have taken place with the
                    ncw world, and thus many of these islands, although rather American than
                    otherwise, according to their geographical position, may be regarded as Asiatic
                    in regard to their animal and vegetable products.</p>
                <p>The new world has also been observed to present progressive changes in the
                    succession of its species, in connection with every considerable difference in
                    the latitude and longitude. M. Bose collected in Carolina many species which
                    were unknown in Pennsylvania, and were still more foreign to New York; and the
                    researches of Abbot in illustration of the Lepidoptera of Georgia demonstrate
                    the existence in that province of certain species which have their central
                    station in the Antilles. The banks of the far-stretching Missouri, about twenty
                    degrees to the west of Philadelphia, produce many peculiar species. The
                    Entomology of the Antilles presents a strong contrast to that of the United
                    States. Trinidad, under the tenth degree of north latitude, presents us with
                    truly equatorial species, such as the splendid butterflies called Teucer and
                    Menelaus, which do not occur in St Domingo. Brazil, so gorgeous in its insect
                    tribes, possesses species in common with Cayenne, but it also produces many
                    others peculiar to itself. Latreille differs from Mr Macleay in his opinion
                    regarding the comparative extension, in a northerly direction, of the southern
                    species in the new and old world. He states that the southern species of the
                    western hemisphere do not attain to so high a latitude as they do on the ancient
                    continents. Here, he thinks, they begin to appear between the forty-eighth and
                    forty-ninth degrees of north latitude; there, not until we gain the forty-third
                    degree.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    Kirby has remarked, that although the winters in Canada, within the same

                    or of Germany, yet the summers are intensely hot; so that though tropical <hi

                    peculiarities in the physical constitution of America,—its well watered surface,
                    its lofty mountains, its majestic forests, and humid atmosphere,— we shall
                    easily understand how many genera of the ancient continent, dwelling by
                    preference in dry, warm, and sandy situations, for example <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anthia, Pimelia, Erodius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brachycerus,</hi> should
                    not occur in the comparatively rich, moist, and shaded soils of the new world.
                    Thus also the carnivorous Coleoptera in America are proportionally of smaller
                    amount than in the old continent, although no Quarter of the globe is more
                    productive of large and splendid species among the phytophagous or
                    vegetable-eating tribes of insects. However, the south of China and the Moluccas
                    still maintain a certain superiority in the production of such splendid examples
                    of the lepidopterous order as <hi rend="italic">Papilio Priamus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Bombyx Atlas,</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> which the dimensions
                    surpass those of the American species. A fact noted by Latreille is worthy of
                    remembrance, viz. that Europe, Africa, and Western Asia, arc extremely
                    unproductive of the genus <hi rend="italic">Phasma,</hi> or the spectre insect,
                    and that such of the species as do occur are extremely small, while tlιc
                    Moluccas and South America produce many of remarkable size, Ί ne atmospheric
                    humidity of the new world, its narrow and elongated form, the nature of its
                    soil, and the vast extent of ocean by which it is environed, arc sufficient
                    reasons for the disagreement observable between its productions and those of
                    corresponding latitudes in our own hemisphere. The new world, in fact, bears in
                    many respects the same relation to the old that Britain does to a great portion
                    of Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>We have already alluded to the classification of climáte given by Fabricius, and
                    to certain circumstances which have been supposed to render the adoption of that
                    classification unadvisable. Latreille has viewed the same subject under a better
                    aspect. He considers the northern extremities of Greenland and of Spitzbergen,
                    under the eighty-first degree of northern latitude, as the points where
                    vegetation terminates. But to obviate all difficulty, and with a view to
                    establish a duodecimal division, which is not only convenient in itself, but
                    also in frequent accordance with the actual observation of geographical groups,
                    he raises this supposed limit of vegetation three degrees higher, that is, to
                    the eighty-fourth degree. If we then divide into successive spaces of twelve
                    degrees, a meridian commencing from the western parts or Spitzbergen, or those
                    nearest to Greenland, we shall have a suite of latitudes corresponding
                    successively to the limits of the countries already alluded to in relation to
                    their zoological productions. He continues these sections duodeeimally or by
                    twelve degrees, beyond the equator, and towards the antarctic pole, and stops
                    about the sixtieth degree of southern latitude, under the parallel of Sandwich
                    Land, regarded in that direction as the <hi rend="italic">ne</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">plus ultra</hi> of geographical discovery.</p>
                <p>It appears that a difference in latitude of twelve degrees always produces a very
                    sensible change in the mass of insect species; and that if that space is
                    doubled, the alteration is almost total; as, for example, between the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193746610?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6610-0104"/>
                    north of Sweden and the north of Spain. An analogous change takes place in
                    relation to the <hi rend="italic">longitude,</hi> but more slowly, and after a
                    traverse of a greater distance; since the mean temperature, but for causes of a
                    particular and local nature, is not widely different under the same parallel. In
                    proportion as we approach the pole, the extent occupied by particular races
                    embraces a greater number of geographical divisions.</p>
                <p>The insects of America, even those of its northern provinces, at least as far as
                    Canada, may be said to differ specifically from those of Europe; but the species
                    of Greenland may rather be regarded as European. The last-named country, so far
                    as the entomological geography of the ancient continent is concerned, is assumed
                    by Latreille as the point of departure for his first meridian. In any view it
                    may be regarded as intermediate between the two hemispheres. The Canaries, the
                    Cape de Verd Islands, and Madeira, are African, judging from their entomological
                    productions. The meridian above named will thus follow a middle line between
                    these islands and the most eastern cape of South America, that of St Roque, near
                    Rio Grande, in Brazil. It will pass by the western isles, or archipelago of the
                    Azores, and by the island of Ascension, and will abut to the westward of
                    Sandwich Land. Its longitude will be thirty-four degrees to the west of the
                    meridian of Paris. According to Latreille’s observations on the insects
                    collected by Olivier in Persia, their general relationship to those of the south
                    of Europe and the north of Africa, and the essential differences which they
                    present when compared with the entomological productions of the East Indies, it
                    may be inferred that the most signal changes in the species take place in a
                    southerly direction towards the frontier lines of Persia and Hindustan, and in a
                    northerly direction at a short distance from the eastern slopes of the Uralian
                    Mountains and Lake Aral, a little beyond the sixtieth meridian east of Paris. We
                    may fix this limit approximately at sixty-two degrees, somewhat to the west of
                    the Obi, and of Balk and Candahar, for the sake of affording the means of
                    continuing a duodecimal division; for if we add 62 to 34, the difference between
                    the first meridian and that of Paris, we have the number 96, a quantity
                    susceptible of being divided, without fractions, into eight parts, each equal to
                    the thirtieth portion of the circle. We thus separate the ancient continent into
                    two great bands, of which one is western and the other eastern; and if we assign
                    to the latter the same extent in longitude as the former, that is, ninety-six
                    degrees, it will terminate 158 degrees of eastern longitude from the meridian of
                    Paris. Departing from Kamtchatka, it will pass by the Carolinas, and from thence
                    between New Holland and New Zealand. If augmented by one fourth, or by
                    twenty-four degrees, this eastern band would be bounded by the 182d meridian
                    east of Paris, and passing at a short distance from East Cape, over Behring’s
                    Straits, would stretch beyond the Friendly Islands, and form, without any
                    material error in relation to our entomological views, a line of demarcation
                    between Asia and America. The remaining 144 degrees complete the equatorial
                    circle, and compose the extent in longitude of that great zone proper to the
                    insects of America. It may also be divided, and under the same denominations of
                    eastern and western, into two equal portions, each of seventy-two degrees. Thus
                    the entire circle of the equator may be regarded as divisible into four arcs, of
                    which the values are, 72, 72, 96, and 120, or in the proportion of six
                    thirtieths, eight thirtieths, and ten thirtieths. I he extent in longitude of
                    the ancient continent will comprise 216 degrees, and that of the new 144.</p>
                <p>The lesser zones or climates are denominated <hi rend="italic">arctic</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">antarctic</hi> by Μ. Latreille, according to their position on
                    this or the other side of the equator. The climate included between the 84th and
                    72d degrees of north latitude is named the <hi rend="italic">polar</hi> climate.
                    Then follow as far as the equator, and always in divisions of twelve degrees,
                    the following climates, viz. the <hi rend="italic">sub-polar,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">superior,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">intermediate, the
                    super-tropical,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">tropical,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">equatorial;</hi> and as each hemisphere is partitioned into two
                    great divisions, the climates of each are distinguished by the name of western
                    and eastern. The antarctic climates consist of only three in number, as we know
                    little of what exists amid those chilly regions beyond the 60th degree of south
                    latitude, and thus in that direction both the polar and sub-polar climates may
                    be suppressed. We shall illustrate these views by a few applications to the
                    northern and western kingdoms of Europe, the best known portions of the old
                    world.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">polar</hi> climate presents us with the insects of the
                    greater part of Greenland, and with those of Iceland and of Spitzbergen. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">sub-polar</hi> climate we shall find those of Norway, of the
                    north of Sweden, and of Russia in Europe. These two of course contain the
                    insects of the coldest climates of the earth. We may regard as belonging to the
                    <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> climate the species of Great Britain, of the
                    south of Sweden, of the north of France as far as the inferior course of the
                    Loire, of Prussia, of Germany Proper, and of the south of Russia as far as the
                    Crimea exclusive. The <hi rend="italic">intermediate</hi> climate, at equal
                    distances from those of the equator and the pole, will comprehend all the
                    species of the south of Europe, and of a portion of the west σf Asia. Those of
                    the north of Africa, and as far as the equator, may be classed under the
                    climates called <hi rend="italic">super-tropical, tropical,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">equatorial.</hi> These western climates may be divided into two
                    equal parts, each consisting of forty-eight degrees, by a meridian which,
                    passing fourteen degrees to the east of Paris, in the vicinity of Vienna, would
                    leave to the east the most southern part of Italy, Turkey in Europe, Egypt,
                    &amp;c. Now it has been already remarked, that many of the insects of the
                    environs of Vienna are also known to occur in the Levant, and that those of the
                    kingdom of Naples, of Egypt, and of the south-east of Europe, appear to differ
                    in many respects from the southern and western species of that division of the
                    globe. We can here, then, effect the formation of sub-climates. If we divide the
                    eastern portion, of which the extent in longitude is 120 degrees, into four
                    equal sections of thirty degrees, by meridians, we shall have sub-climates, of
                    which the boundaries seem very accordant with nature. Thus the first would
                    comprehend Hindustan, Thibet, Little Bucharia, &amp;c. while the second would
                    detach almost all the Philippine Islands, China Proper, and the regions of the
                    north as far as a short way beyond the river Lena. Corea, Japan, and the
                    countries of the Manchous and Tongouses, &amp;c. would form the third
                    subdivision. The fourth would present Kamtchatka, and the other countries which
                    terminate the north-east of~Asia. America may likewise be subdivided after a
                    similar manner.</p>
                <p>It must, however, be borne in mind that nature, in her distribution of the
                    localities proper to the various races of animals, often swerves from her more
                    regular and accustomed courses, and that the <hi rend="italic">lines of
                    habitation</hi> form numerous curves and sinuosities, not unfrequently crossed
                    or interrupted by others of a somewhat different nature. We must, therefore, in
                    considering such views as the preceding, make abstraction of particular
                    modifications which alter or derange our theoretical views. Latreille’s is but
                    an unfinished sketch of a highly interesting geographical map of Entomology, in
                    which he has endeavoured, as well as he could, to mark out various boundaries,
                    and to divide them according to certain principles in harmony with his <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193746623?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-6623-0105"/>
                    actual observations, so far as these have been hitherto carried. The
                    geographical distribution of living beings presents a wide field for
                    speculation, although the modes by which that distribution has been effected
                    will probably in many cases remain for ever concealed from human knowledge.
                    Their gradual extension by natural means, from a single centre of creation,
                    scarcely falls within the sphere of credibility; and thus the creation of
                    various groups of species over different points of the earth’s surface, and in
                    accordance with the climate and physical character of different countries,—or
                    the removal and dispersion, by supernatural agency, of the greater proportion of
                    existing species from an original centre,—seem the two points, one or other of
                    which remains to be illustrated by whoever is curious in such bewildering
                    speculations. “A glance at the innumerable and far-spread legions which compose
                    the busy world of insect life renders the subject still more complex and
                    confounding. A discovery ship, under the guidance of brave men, surmounts with
                    difficulty the terrors of the ocean; and, after being months on the trackless
                    main, and some thousand miles from any of the great continents of the earth, she
                    arrives at last and accidentally at some hitherto unknown island of small
                    dimensions, a mere speck in the vast world of waters by which it is surrounded.
                    She probably finds the ‘ Lord of the Creation’ there unknown; but though untrod
                    by human footsteps, how busy is that lonely spot with all the other forms of
                    active life I Even man himself is represented not unaptly by the sagacious and
                    imitative monkeys, which eagerly employ so many vain expedients to drive from
                    their shores what they no doubt regard as merely a stronger species of their
                    race. ‘ Birds of gayest plume’ stand fearlessly before the unsympathizing
                    naturalist; and at every step of the botanical collector the most gorgeous
                    butterflies are wafted from the blossoms of unknown flowers, and beautify the ‘
                    living air’ with their many splendid hues. Yet how frail are such gaudy wings,
                    and how vainly would they now serve as the means of transport from that solitary
                    spot, where all the present generations have had their birth! In what manner,
                    then, did they become its denizens, or by what means were they transported to a
                    point almost imperceptible in comparison with the immeasurable extent of the
                    circumjacent ocean?”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In the opinion of Humboldt, the causes of the distribution of species, whether in
                    the vegetable or in the animal kingdom, are among the number of mysteries to
                    which natural science cannot attain. This science, or at least that branch of it
                    which takes cognizance of zoological geography, is not ocćupied in the
                    investigation of the origin of beings, but of the laws in accordance with which
                    they are now distributed over the surface of the earth. It enters into the
                    examination of things as they are, the co-ex-istencc of vegetable and animal
                    forms in each latitude, at different heights, and at different degrees of
                    temperature; it studies the relations under which particular organizations are
                    more vigorously developed, multiplied, or modified; but it approaches not
                    problems the solution of which is impossible, since they touch the origin or
                    first existence of the germs of life. “We may add,” says that enlightened
                    naturalist, “that the attempts which have been made to explain the distribution
                    of various species over the globe, by the sole influence of climate, date at a
                    period when physical geography was still in its infancy; when, recurring
                    incessantly to pretended contrasts between the two worlds, it was imagined that
                    the whole of Africa and of America resembled the deserts of Egypt and the
                    marshes of Cayenne. At present, when men judge of the state of things, not from
                    one type arbitrarily chosen, but from positive knowledge, it is ascertained that
                    the two continents, in their immense extent, contain countries that are
                    altogether analogous, and that there are regions of America as barren and
                    burning as the interior of Africa.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    organized bodies can no more be solved as a problem in physical science than the
                    mystery of their original creation; and that “the task of the philosopher is
                    fulfilled when he has indicated the laws in accordance with which nature has
                    distributed the forms of animal and vegetable life.”<note anchored="true"

                <p>In regard to those exquisite tribes which form the more immediate subjects of our
                    present observations, it is known that the increasing intensity and continuance
                    of heat exert a powerful influence on the size, structure, and external
                    adornment of the species. The nearer, in general, that we advance towards
                    equinoctial countries, the more remarkable do we find these creatures, for their
                    largeness of dimension, their singularity of form, and their depth as well as
                    splendour of colour. An accurate knowledge of the distribution of insects is of
                    the highest interest to the geologist and geographer as well as to the
                    entomologist, and may be the means of determining, in doubtful or disputed
                    cases, the natural and what may be called the original limits of countries; as,
                    for example, in the case of islands situated at nearly equal distances between
                    two distant continents. But we cannot here pursue the subject under a more
                    extended form.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In

                <p>Having thus cursorily considered the geographical dis tribution of insects, we
                    may now devote a brief space to their <hi rend="italic">local</hi> distribution,
                    or favourite haunts, according to their kind, in any given district. The surface
                    of a country, it has been observed, consists either of mountains, hills, and
                    valleys, or of plains. In either case it may be bare and exposed, or diversified
                    by forests, groves, or copses; and it may also be dry and sandy, or rich and
                    well watered by lakes and rivers. Such parts as are uncovered are greatly varied
                    by the hand both of art and nature, and present heaths or grassy downs, marshes,
                    meadows, or tillage land, each of which is characterized by a difference of soil
                    as well as of vegetable surface. In each the careful entomologist will discover
                    peculiar kinds of insects. “As mountains and hills have usually their own Flora,
                    the insects appropriated to alpine plants can only be met with where their
                    pabulum is found. Here also those northern insects that are impatient of a warm
                    climate will take their station if they migrate to the southward. The predacious
                    beetles likewise sometimes frequent a mountainous district. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carabus</hi><hi rend="italic">glαbratus</hi> was first taken by Professor
                    Hooker on Ingleborough; and probably, if the Welsh and Scotch mountains were
                    duly investigated by an entomologist, many novelties would reward his toils. The
                    valleys and plains, especially those of a sunny exposition, abound in insects.
                    When the heat of the atmosphere indisposes you for motion, you will find it no
                    unprofitable or unpleasant employment, lying on the grass, to search for minute
                    beetles, which you will there find coursing about amongst the tufts and roots of
                    the herbage. Thus you may procure many of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pselaphidoe,</hi> which you would not otherwise meet with. Even when the grass
                    is grown up, insects are fond of alighting upon <pb break="no"

                    and thence drop or run to the ground. Should circumstances ever carry you abroad
                    to the steppes or grassy plains of Tartary, or to Hungary, you will find there
                    two or three species of the singular genus <hi rend="italic">Lethrus,</hi> which
                    burrows in the soil. Every hole is inhabited by a male and female ;—from it they
                    issue to attack the plants or vines; and having cut out the heart of a plant, go
                    backwards like a crab with the prize to their burrow. At the time of pairing,
                    sometimes violent battles, encouraged by the female, take place between the male
                    and a stranger of that sex desirous of admission, which cease only with the
                    death or flight of the stranger. The vicinity and borders of <hi rend="italic"
                    >woods</hi> generally abound in insects of every order, and, if you proceed as
                    hereafter directed, will furnish you with numerous prizes, especially of
                    Lepidoptera. Here alone you can meet with the purple emperor butterfly <hi

                    their moist abodes, and wing their way over the adjacent country. When
                    surprised, after their nocturnal adventures, by the rising sun, they will plunge
                    intowhatever water is nearest at hand, and thus rain barrels and washing tubs
                    are sometimes not looked into in vain. Chance often throws into the hands of an
                    entomologist what he has long sedulously sought for without success; and an open
                    window and a lighted candle will sometimes procure what a traverse through the

                    pool,” and afterwards examining these productions at leisure in a basin of
                    water, many valuable insects of the minuter kinds may be procured. Although the
                    <hi rend="italic">Gyrinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Viola</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aquatica</hi> is said to inhabit salt water, that element may be regarded as
                    decidedly adverse to insect life. Brackish water, however, produces several
                    peculiar species, such as <hi rend="italic">Hy-droena marina,</hi> and the
                    large-eyed Cimicidae. According to Latreillc, the genus Pimelia occurs only in
                    soils impregnated with saline particles, or where the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Salsola</hi> abounds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Heaths,</hi> though in a general view unproductive of insect
                    life, yield some very beautiful species, such as <hi rend="italic">Carabus
                    nitens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">αη∙ensis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cicindela</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvatica.</hi> In regard to <hi rend="italic"
                    >soils,</hi> such as are light, according to Mr Kirby, are most prolific in
                    insects. Warm sandy banks are frequented by <hi rend="italic">Cicindela
                    campestris,</hi><hi rend="italic">Opatrum</hi><hi rend="italic">sabulosum,
                    Helops quis-quilius,</hi> &amp;c.; and chalk is extremely attractive. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Licini, Papilio Cleopatra,</hi> several species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Dasytes,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Lamiae,</hi> seem to delight
                    in the latter substance. Many others are found in chalk-pits, which Mr Kirby
                    does not think should be regarded actually as chalk insects; but rather that
                    they simply fall into the pits, and then become more discernible in consequence
                    of the stronger contrast of colour. By watching in one of these pits during a
                    warm day, vast numbers of insects may be taken. Of all soils <hi rend="italic"
                    >clay</hi> offers the fewest inducements to the entomologist.<note

                <p>Old trees, felled timber, and planks which have lain long upon the ground, should
                    be carefully examined by the collector, as on the under sides of the latter, as
                    well as beneath stones, many species seek repose and shelter. Thorn and other
                    fences, whether dead or living, are very productive; and gates,posts, and wooden
                    rails, ought in nowise to be neglected. Although the <hi rend="italic">sea</hi>
                    itself, according to the authority last quoted, produces no true insects, yet
                    many and varied tribes are known to haunt its shores. On the sand hills of the
                    Norfolk coast Mr Kirby found <hi rend="italic">AEgialia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >globosa</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cicindela hybrida.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rynchcemιs</hi><hi rend="italic">horridus</hi> likewise inhabits thistles
                    growing near the sea. Fuci and other marine rejectamenta, which border the
                    margins of friths and estuaries, produce peculiar species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cercyon,</hi> some <hi rend="italic">Aphodii,</hi> and many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Staphylinidae.</hi> That singular insect <hi rend="italic">Oxytelus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tricornis</hi> has been captured in a situation like that now
                    indicated. The inundations of rivers in spring, summer, and autumn, sweep
                    innumerable insects from their hiding places; and when the waters begin to
                    subside, the examination of the floating grasses, broken twigs, and various
                    debris which line the indented shores, will afford an ample field for the
                    investigations of the entomologist. To him indeed the most barren scene, whether
                    of dreary moor or desolate mountain, can never be devoid of interest,—for the
                    more untrodden the path the stronger and more rational are his hopes of becoming
                    possessed of some of those treasures which are everywhere scattered over the
                    wilderness of nature,— hitherto unperceived perhaps by human eye, but
                    nevertheless performing an essential part in the great and solemn mystery of
                    creation.</p>
                <p>The geological relations of insects do not appear to have attracted the notice of
                    naturalists,—we mean their more direct connection with rocks, independent of
                    that intermediate relationship which results from the dependence of particular
                    plants on certain soils, and the known alliance of many tribes of insects with
                    peculiar forms of vegetable life. Mr Wailes always found the larvae of <hi
                    rend="italic">Enicο-ceri</hi> on rough slimy stones, and he found it as great a
                    waste of time to look for them on a smooth limestone, as to turn up a fragment
                    of basaltic rock (whinstone) in search of geodephagous insects. The repugnance
                    of beetles to basalt he had previously noticed. The subjacent rock of the wild
                    district of Teesdale is almost exclusively composed of the basalt of the great
                    whin-sill, the formation of which is regarded as a knotty point by geologists.
                    Of course the loose and superficial stones of the country are its fragments, and
                    among these scarcely a beetle is to be found, except a few which are
                    superlatively common elsewhere, though <hi rend="italic">inter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rariores</hi> in the district referred to. “So far,” says Mr
                    Wailes, “as my observations, whether confined to single stones, or extended over
                    a whole district, go, any place having limestone, particularly the magnesian,
                    for its subjacent stratum, will afford abundance of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Geodephaga,</hi> as well as most other Coleoptera, whilst they will be found
                    very thinly scattered over a basaltic region. It is strange to notice the almost
                    uniform absence of these insects on turning up a whin which has accidentally
                    found its way into a heap of other stones, though every one of the latter may
                    have one or more tenants under it. Must we-not look to the comparative dryness
                    of the limestone and humidity of the whin for an explanation? We can readily
                    account for the great predominance ot the land <hi rend="italic">testacea</hi>
                    on a limestone district; but lime docs not enter into the composition <hi

                <p>Insects may also be viewed in relation to their seasons of appearance, or the
                    most appropriate periods for the collection of the different kinds. Such as
                    gather honey and the pollen of plants are among the first to proclaim the
                    approach of spring; and their appearance maybe dated from the blossoming of
                    certain trees and flowers of common occurrence. Other plants, likewise
                    accompanied <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746649?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-6649-0107"/> by peculiar insects, blossom later; and thus we
                    may trace a mutual relationship between the two kingdoms throughout the
                    sparkling spring, the leafy summer, and the melancholy autumn,—till relentless
                    winter sets his seal upon insect life, and either renders it entirely torpid, or
                    sheds occasionally a feeble ray on some forlorn company of gnats, whose dances,
                    now no lçnger “choral,” exhibit but a sad representative of that more genial
                    season when the <hi rend="superscript"> u</hi> ∙ living air” was filled with
                    their not unjoyful murmurs. With these and a few other exceptions, the earliest
                    insect season commences with the flowering of the sallow <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Salix capreα</hi> of Linnaeus, <hi rend="italic">Saugh</hi> of the Scottish
                    schoolboy), which is accompanied by the golden flowers of the crocus, and the
                    beautiful green of the expanding gooseberries. “Then is your time,” says Mr
                    Kirby, “to collect many species of wild bees and <hi rend="italic">Dipterα,</hi>
                    not afterwards to be met with; and various other insects now begin to emerge
                    from the pupa. Another and later season is marked by the general blossoming of
                    the buttercup <hi rend="italic">(Ranunculus bulbosus),</hi> accompanied by the
                    marsh-marygold (<hi rend="italic">Caltha palustris'),</hi> and ladies’ smock
                    (<hi rend="italic">Cardamine</hi><hi rend="italic">pratensis),</hi> when you may
                    hunt the pastures, meadows, and marshes with success, and take some insects that
                    do not show themselves later. The coprophagous insects are now abundant. Amongst
                    others, <hi rend="italic">Aphodius testudina-τius,</hi> a perfectly <hi
                    rend="italic">vernal</hi> species, is now only to be taken, and usually flying.
                    A <hi rend="italic">third</hi> insect season indicated by Flora, and a very
                    prolific one, commences with the blossoming of the hawthorn, when you must
                    desert the meads for the inclosures. At this time all nature begins to put on
                    her gayest attire, and all her insect tribes are now on the alert, and fill the
                    air. They are almost universally attracted by the sweet and lovely blossoms of
                    the plant just named; so that, by examining them, you may entrap some of every
                    order, and many that during the year will appear no more. Even many of the
                    saprophagous insects will sip nectar from the flowers. The umbelliferous plants
                    proclaim the fourth season of insects, particularly the wild carrot and parsnip.
                    You will scarcely ever fail to find, if the weather is genial, <hi rend="italic"
                    >hymenopterous</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dipterous</hi> insects of various
                    genera, especially such as have a <hi rend="italic">short</hi> tongue, engaged
                    in collecting the honey from those plants. Here you may take some of the rarer
                    <hi rend="italic">Chrysidoe, Crabronidae, Cereerides,</hi> &amp;c. and
                    occasionally even <hi rend="italic">Coleοp-teτa.</hi> The last insect season may
                    be dated from the general flowering of the thistle tribe. When these are in
                    blossom is the best time of all to collect the humble-bees <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Bombas'),</hi> the leaf-cutter bees <hi rend="italic">(Megachile),</hi> and
                    many other <hi rend="italic">Apiariae,</hi> Lat. which alone, by their long
                    tongues, can imbibe the honey and collect the pollen of these flowers. The male
                    humble-bees frequent them to the last, and often seem as if they were
                    intoxicated with their sweets.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    expounded at the commencement of this article.</p>

                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The derivation or etymology of the different
                    orders has already been given in our introductory observations,—see pages 59 and
                    60 of this volume. Our present order corresponds to the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Eleutherata</hi> of Fabricius.</p></note></p>
                <p>Coleopterous insects have usually four wings, the two superior of which, called
                    elytra, resemble horizontal, somewhat convex scales, which meet in a straight
                    line along their inner margins, where they form what is called the dorsal
                    suture. The inferior wings, which are the true organs of flight, are
                    membranaceous, transparent, transversely folded, and covered and protected by
                    the elytra or wing-cases. They are all masticating insects, provided with
                    mandibles and maxillae.</p>
                <p>Of all the insect tribes these are the most numerous, the best known, and the
                    most generally interesting. Their singular and varied forms, their brilliant
                    colouring, the great size of many species, and that solid consistence which
                    renders their collection and preservation comparatively easy, have long secured
                    for them the devoted attention of the entomologist. Some advantages also result
                    to their study and classification from the clearly defined and articulate forms
                    of their external organs. The name and principal characters of the order were
                    bestowed and defined by Aristotle, and have been adopted by almost all
                    succeeding writers on the subject. Other characters have no doubt been added to
                    his ancient definition of <hi rend="italic">wings in a sheath,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> such as the transverse folding of these organs, and the
                    straightness of the suture by which the elytra are united; and several
                    exceptions to the supposed universal attributes of the order have been
                    discovered,— such as the female glow-worm, which has neither wings nor sheaths,
                    and the genus <hi rend="italic">Meloe,</hi> and many <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carabi,</hi> which, though furnished with sheaths or elytra, are entirely
                    destitute of true or membranaceous wings. So also, in the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Buprestis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Molorchus,</hi> and others, we
                    may discover exceptions to the transverse folding of the last-named organs; and
                    the exact fitting or junction of the elytra, forming the dorsal suture, ceases
                    to hold in the genus <hi rend="italic">Meloe,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> so
                    that none of these characters can be regarded as universal; but as they are very
                    generally prevalent, and a few exceptions do not invalidate a rule, it is
                    advisable that they should be retained for the purposes of definition.</p>
                <p>Coleopterous insects, like others, are composed of three principal portions,
                    head, thorax, and abdomen. The <hi rend="italic">head</hi> varies greatly both
                    in size and form, according to the different tribes. In the great section of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Geodephaga,</hi> or ground-beetles, it is usually of a
                    somewhat triangular form; in many of the short elytra’d tribes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Brαchelytra</hi> it is orbicular; while among the weevils (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Curculionides)</hi> it is prolonged into a pointed rostrum or beak. The hinder
                    part is frequently contracted into a short neck, and is inserted into a cavity
                    of the thorax, in which it moves as in a socket. The head bears two <hi
                    rend="italic">antennoe,</hi> of which the form and structure differ not only in
                    the different genera, but even in the sexcs of the same species. They usually,
                    however, consist of ten or eleven distinct articulations, the latter number
                    being the more frequent. They are inserted in the front of the head, anterior
                    to, and rather beneath, the region of the. eyes. Their various forms, as
                    characteristic of particular groups, will be afterwards described. The <hi
                    rend="italic">eyes</hi> of Coleoptera, in the perfect state, are two in number,
                    and composite. In certain Staphylinidae, two small yellowish points have been
                    observed, which some naturalists have regarded as analogous to the simple or
                    stemmatic eyes; but the sentiments of Latreille are adverse to that opinion. The
                    actual eyes are either entire, notched, or even occasionally so completely
                    intersected by a little corneous stalk, as to exhibit (as in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Gyrinus)</hi> the appearance of a pair on either side. The <hi
                    rend="italic">mouth</hi> consists of a <hi rend="italic">labrum,</hi> two <hi
                    rend="italic">mandibles,</hi> two <hi rend="italic">maxillae,</hi> each
                    furnished with one or two articulated <hi rend="italic">palpi,</hi> and a <pb

                    palpi. The mandibles are usually of a corneous consistence, but they are
                    membranaceous and of small size, in such as take little apparent nourishment, or
                    feed on the juices of flowers, or on excrementitial or putrescent animal fluids.
                    The maxillae are of a softer texture than the mandibles. When there are a pair
                    of palpi on each maxilla, the exterior ones never consist of more than four
                    joints; those of the labium have usually three articulations.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">thorax</hi> of the Coleoptera, like that of other hexapod
                    insects, is likewise divisible into three principal portions, each of which is
                    characterized by a particular degree of development. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesothorax</hi> is very narrow, whilst the corselet <hi rend="italic">or
                    prothorax,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">metathorax,</hi> exhibit a
                    considerable bulk. This is an important feature in the structure of the skeleton
                    or tegument of the coleopterous order. The prothorax is always free in its
                    movements, while the two other portions are united together, and nearly
                    immoveable. The component parts or the mesothorax are in fact rudimentary, and
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">scutellum</hi> are soldered together. But the
                    elements of the latter portion, that is, the <hi rend="italic">praescutum,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">scutum,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">scutellum,</hi>
                    commonly so called, and the <hi rend="italic">postscutellum,</hi> still exist,
                    and their joinings are quite perceptible in certain genera. The prothorax
                    supports only the first pair of legs, while the mesothorax bears the second pair
                    and the elytra. The second pair of wings and the third pair of legs are attached
                    to the metathorax.</p>
                <p>The elytra and wings take their origin from the lateral and superior margins of
                    that portion of the body to which they are attached. The elytra are usually of a
                    very firm or almost crustaceous consistence, opake, and without reticulations.
                    The true wings are large, veined, and concealed beneath the elytra. The latter
                    always exist (with the exception of the females of a few species), but many
                    species are apterous, so far as concerns the existence of the membranaceous
                    wings. In general the elytra equal the body in length, but they are sometimes,
                    as among the Staphylinidae, much shorter. They are usually free, and extended
                    during the act of flight; but among several carabideous insects they seem united
                    by the dorsal suture, and are consequently incapable of extension. In these
                    instances the true wings are wanting.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">abdomen</hi> of the Coleoptera is sessile, that is,
                    attached to the metathorax by its largest transverse diameter. Its inferior or
                    ventral part is less extended longitudinally than the superior, and this
                    restriction is chiefly owing to the development of the sternum of the
                    metathorax, which is prolonged backwards, and thus, as it were, usurps the place
                    of the abdomen. This may be very distinctly observed in the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Copris,</hi> in which the segments of the abdomen seem crowded
                    together. In some species the first segment appears divided into two parts by
                    the sternum, which projects along their line of union. Inferiorly, the abdomen
                    is always of a firm or horny consistence; but the upper part is generally soft,
                    being covered by the elytra and wings. When these are wanting or abbreviated,
                    the abdomen is equally hard above as below, as in the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Meloe,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Staphylinidae,</hi><hi rend="subscript">
                    0</hi> r brachelytrous tribes.</p>
                <p>The legs vary in their structure and development. The anterior pair, orthose of
                    the prothorax, are frequently more strongly formed in the male than in the
                    female; and in the former sex the tarsi are often broader than ip the latter.
                    The legs are usually described as composed of five pieces, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >haunch,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">trochanter,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"

                    >tarsus.</hi> M. Auđouin has shown the existence of a sixth portion, moveable,
                    constantly concealed within the interior of the body, and serving to articulate
                    the haunch with the epimera. We have already mentioned it under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">trochantiη.</hi></p>
                <p>The internal structure of the Coleoptera has recently been illustrated by several
                    ingenious observers, such as Ramdhor, Audouin, and Dufour.</p>
                <p>The apparatus for the purposes of nutrition in coleopterous insects may be summed

                    entire order Coleoptera is composed of <hi rend="italic">masticating</hi>
                    species, which are consequently provided with instruments of a more or less
                    resistant nature, adapted for seizing, cutting, and triturating the food
                    previous to its being swallowed. For this purpose the mouth is furnished with a
                    pair of corneous mandibles, sometimes simply incisive, sometimes dentated or
                    toothed. Their motion is transverse and horizontal. There is also a pair of
                    maxillae, usually of a more membranaceous consistence than the mandibles, an
                    upper lip or labrum, an under lip or labium, and from four to six palpi. The
                    salivary glands, which in orthopterous and hemipterous insects present all the
                    characters common to such organs, are rudimentary in size, and few in number,
                    among the coleopterous tribes. They contain a colourless saliva, and their
                    existence hitherto has been ascertained chiefly in genera of the families of <hi
                    rend="italic">Melasoma, Taxicorηes, Stenelytra, Trache-lides, Ehincophora,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Aphidiphaga.</hi> The digestive tube possesses an extent
                    which varies singularly in relation to the habits of life of each particular
                    tribe. In a few it scarcely exceeds the length of the body; while in others, and
                    these are the greater number, it greatly surpasses that extent. The oesophagus
                    is generally short; the crop more or less obvious; the gizzard is in some
                    families garnished interiorly with triturating pieces; the chylific ventricle is
                    of variable size, and either smooth or beset by papillae; the small intestine
                    likewise varies in length; the large intestine consists most frequently of a
                    dilatable caecum; the rectum is sometimes greatly elongated in the female
                    sex.</p>
                <p>The texture of the digestive tube is musculo-membranous, and is composed of three
                    tunics of varying thickness. The biliary or hepatic vessels are always inserted
                    at the posterior extremity of the chylific ventricle. They are of great extent,
                    extremely slender, singularly folded, and of a cellular-membranous texture.
                    Their number and the mode of their connection vary in the different tribes and
                    genera, but they are always of an equal number, or in pairs. There are never
                    less than a single pair,.nor more than three. Sometimes their insertion is
                    limited to the chylific ventricle, in which case they are either free and
                    floating by one extremity, or they form an arch variously twisted, ot which the
                    two extremities are implanted on the same circle. Sometimes the insertion is
                    double, and obtains at one end on the chylific ventricle, and at the other on
                    the caecum. The bile contained in these vessels varies from a deep violet and
                    brown colour, to yellow and white. It is sometimes even diaphanous.</p>
                <p>1 he generative system among the Coleoptera is thus described by Μ. Dufour. “Les

                <p>Besides the ordinary secreting organs, certain coleopterous species are provided
                    with a kind of excrementary secreting apparatus, which is binary, and common to
                    both sexes. Its function is the formation of an acrid humour, liquid or gaseous,
                    which the insect expels as a means of defence when menaced or attacked.</p>
                <p>The respiratory organs of the Coleoptera consist in stigmata placed along the
                    lateral portions-of the body, and of tracheae, sometimes tubular, sometimes
                    utricular, which disseminate the air through all parts of the system.</p>
                <p>The nervous system is composed of a brain or upper ganglion,—of ganglia placed in
                    the median line, variable in their number, and communicating with each other and
                    with the brain by means of a double cord,—and of nerves, properly so called,
                    which emanate from the ganglia.</p>
                <p>The abdominal cavity of these insects always encloses a splanchnic adipose
                    tissue, of which the abundance and colour vary according to the genera, and
                    which appears to be connected with the purposes of nutrition.<note

                <p>In addition to the usual differences, the sexes frequently present external
                    distinctive characters in the antennae and other parts. The male is supposed to
                    perish soon after the sexual union, and the female does not long survive the
                    deposition of her eggs. These eggs, which of course vary in size, form, colour,
                    and consistence, are deposited in various localities, and among very different
                    substances, in accordance with the instincts and economy of the species, and the
                    habits of the larvae about to be produced. These larvae are also very dissimilar
                    to each other in this varied order; but they may be generally described as soft
                    bodied, with the exception of the head and the upper portion of the three first
                    segments of the body, which are of a firmer or more scaly consistence. They are
                    furnished with six feet; and the eyes, which in the perfect state are composite,
                    are in this early condition small granuliform bodies, sometimes amounting to six
                    on each side. The parts of the mouth bear a relation, both to their immediate
                    mode of lifi⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> 9</hi> and their future development in the
                    perfect insect. The mandibles are very strong and corneous in such species as
                    feed on ligneous substances; they are coriaceous in such as feed on leaves, and
                    almost membranaceous in those which prefer carcasses, or other matters in a
                    state of putrescence. The antennae of these larvae are usually very short,
                    cylindrical or conical, and composed of a small number of articulations.</p>
                <p>Coleopterous insects enjoy a considerable length of life, at least in the larva
                    state. The period of endurance, however, of that early condition, is extremely
                    various in the different genera of this most numerous order. Indeed, even among
                    individuals of the same species, the continuance of the different stages of
                    growth varies in accordance with the temperature of particular seasons, or the
                    more or less abundant supply of food. Many species pass the winter in a listless
                    state, abstaining almost entirely from eating, and consequently, even after the
                    lapse of several months, present scarcely any apparent increase of their
                    dimensions. No sooner, however, are they awakened from their temporary trance by
                    the enlivening beams of the returning sun, than they greedily attack their
                    favourite food, and their growth is almost instantaneous. It has been remarked
                    that the larvae which feed on leaves, such as those of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crioceris, Altica,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chrysomela,</hi> remain but a
                    brief period in the larva state; while the subterranean and root-devouring
                    species, on the contrary, not unfrequently continue for two or three years in
                    their dark abodes. Attentive observation has also ascertained that those
                    Coleoptera which pass the winter in the egg state are the shortest lived in the
                    form of larvae ;—they are hatched, nourished, developed, reproduce, and perish,
                    all in the course of the summer first ensuing,—while such as pass the winter in
                    the larva state, or that of nymph, are the longest lived in both of those
                    conditions. It is chiefly in the form of larva that the Coleoptera produce such
                    injury to agriculture, and other branches of rural industry. The ravages of
                    species belonging to the genera <hi rend="italic">Bruchus, Curculio,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Calandra, Melolontha, Crioceris, Altica, Anthrenus,
                    Dermestes,</hi> and numerous others, are unfortunately better known than any
                    counteracting remedies of easy application.</p>
                <p>The larvae of the coleopterous tribes usually change their skins three times, and
                    many of those which live in the earth construct a kind of cocoon, in which they
                    undergo their transformations. These are of the kind formerly mentioned under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> metamorphoses.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus, Geoffroy, Fabricius, Olivier, Latreille, and others, have established
                    many divisions, more or less natural, in the coleopterous order. The number of
                    the articulations of the tarsi varies from three to five, and their amount in
                    eaeh limb has been assumed as the basis of the great sectional divisions of the
                    coleopterous order, so generally adopted by the continental naturalists. As
                    these divisions pervade all foreign works of importance on the Coleoptera, we
                    shall here explain their nature. Geoffroy having observed that all the species
                    of a genus or of a family were characterized by the same number of articulations
                    of the tarsi, and that the differences presented by these parts always bore a
                    relation to other differences in the general organization, he conceived the idea
                    of grounding his primary divisions on their particular structure.</p>
                <p>Many extensive families of coleopterous insects are distinguished by <hi
                    rend="italic">five</hi> articulations to the tarsi; that is, by five joints on
                    each foot. (See Plate CCXX. fig. 2 e.) All of these fall under the first general
                    section called <hi rend="italic">Pentamera,</hi> from wnrα, <hi rend="italic"

                    has even been supposed that an insect exists, the tarsi of which are furnished

                    established. Later and more considerate observation, however, has led to the
                    belief that both of the last-named sections are resolvable among the trimerous
                    species, and that the supposed absence of the second and third joints arises
                    from their extreme minute-</p>

                    extreme simplicity, and consequent ease of application, of the sectional rules
                    deduced from the structure of the tarsi, has probably induced the continental
                    naturalists to adopt them more readily than they would have done had they
                    foreseen the occasional contradictions to which they lead. The fact cannot be
                    disguised that the system is in many instances artificial,— for several insects
                    differ in the number of their tarsi, which are yet nearly allied by their
                    general structure and attributes,—while it would be easy to show that the mere
                    agreement in the number of those parts by no means carries along with it a
                    corresponding relationship in the form of the other more important organs.<note

                <p>We have already endeavoured, in the preceding introduction, to illustrate the
                    geographical distribution of insects in general. We shall here add a few
                    observations more especially applicable to the coleopterous tribes.</p>
                <p>The coleopterous insects of Europe in general, according to Μ. Latreille, bear a
                    strong affinity to those of Western Asia and Northern Africa. These traits of
                    resemblance become more obvious, when, the qualities of the soil and the
                    temperature being analogous, we approach towards the northern tropic. It is
                    under the forty-fourth degree of north latitude that we begin to perceive
                    certain species of carnivorous Coleoptera, of the Lamellicornes, of the
                    heteromerous section, and of the Curculionides, characteristic of the warmer
                    regions of the earth. There also may be observed species of a larger size, and
                    of an ιspect more imposing, than characterize their congeners C of the north.
                    The dominion of the <hi rend="italic">Carαbi,</hi> properly so ' called, so
                    notable over all the northern and temperate countries of Europe, and in the more
                    western regions of Asia, ceases towards the thirty-fifth degree of north
                    latitude. These predaceous insects are succeeded by the genera <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aηthia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Graphipterus.</hi> Viewed in relation to
                    entomological characters, Europe may be said to extend further eastward than it
                    does in accordance with our actual political divisions, as the insects of the
                    Levant, and even of Persia, exhibit a very European aspect. Austria and Hungary,
                    from their central situation and other local circumstances, are numerically
                    richer in species than the western countries of Europe. These latter, however,
                    possess, in consequence probably of their littoral position, and the influence
                    of the oceanic waters, several peculiar species, which, though unknown in the
                    East, nevertheless extend their localities in a lengthened line from north to
                    south. However gorgeous may be the productions of tropical regions, the European
                    continent presents to the entomologist a rich and varied assemblage both of
                    carnivorous and herbivorous Coleoptera. Many of these it possesses in common
                    with other countries, while of some it has to boast a more exclusive possession.
                    The great tribe of the Carnivora, and especially the Carabi or larger predaceous
                    beetles—the <hi rend="italic">Staphylinidce</hi> or brachelytrous kinds—the <hi

                    &amp;c.—are there proportionally more numerous than in any other quarter of the
                    world. Latreille has observed that the herbivorous Coleoptera seem to prevail in
                    South America. Many species of the northern countries of the new world greatly
                    resemble those of the northern and temperate parts of Europe, while others are
                    identical. Of these some may be regarded as naturally distributed alike over
                    Scandinavia, Greenland, the adjacent islands, and North America,—while the
                    greater proportion, which are xylophagous or timber-eating insects, have very
                    probably been transported by artificial means, that is, in cargoes of wood, and
                    in the timbers of our vessels. Notwithstanding many examples which might be
                    adduced to illustrate a certain agreement which exists between the species of
                    Europe and North America, the more general as well as precise truth is, that the
                    entomology of North America is connected by a stronger affinity with that of the
                    southern division of the new world than with that of our own continent and
                    islands. We cannot, for instance, exhibit a single example of that division of
                    <hi rend="italic">Cetonia</hi> of which the thorax presents a posterior lobe,
                    nor of <hi rend="italic">Galerita,</hi><hi rend="italic">Tetraonyx,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Pαrandra,</hi> genera which are distributed throughout the whole
                    of America. One strong feature of conformity has indeed been observed, that
                    North America and Europe both possess many carnivorous Coleoptera entirely
                    unknown in the equatorial regions either of the old world or the new.<note

                <p>The coleopterous order is extremely numerous in species. Comte Dejean’s

                    with the names of 3614 indigenous Coleoptera.</p>
                <p>In relation to the economical uses of the order, we may observe that coleopterous
                    insects are scarcely if at all applied in the arts. Those employed in medicine
                    are chiefly the <hi rend="italic">Cantharis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vesicatoria,</hi> commonly called the Spanish Fly, and the <hi rend="italic"

                    likewise used as a blistering application. The Romans are supposed to have made
                    use of certain coleopterous larvae for dietetical purposes; and some of the
                    South American tribes are known to devour with delight the fattened larvae of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Curculio</hi><hi rend="italic">palmarum.</hi> We shall
                    conclude these introductory observations by a few remarks <hi rend="italic">On
                    the collecting and preserving of Coleopterous Insects.</hi></p>
                <p>This is a very simple matter to those who are zealous in the cause. By far the
                    best method is for the collector to provide himself with a few stout phials half
                    filled with whisky, or any other ardent spirit which he may happen to prefer.
                    When the insects are caught, which they can only be in any considerable number
                    or variety by a sedulous search under stones, and in the other localities
                    afterwards indicated in our notices of the different genera, they may be popped
                    into the phial, where in most instances they die almost instantaneously. This is
                    not only the most humane process, but it is also the best mode of preserving
                    their more delicate portions uninjured. It likewise puts an end to all
                    contention among themselves, which is by no means the effect of the ordinary
                    method of collecting in small boxes,—for in the latter case the larger and more
                    voracious invariably devour the smaller or least assuming; and thus many
                    captures, regarded with pleasure in the morning, are found to have disappeared
                    in the afternoon. If time and opportunity are wanting for the immediate purpose
                    of <hi rend="italic">setting</hi> the specimens, that is, placing them in their
                    most appropriate positions, they may be allowed to remain in the phials for days
                    or weeks without being injured, although in that case greater care is afterwards
                    necessary, especially with the smaller specimens, in consequence of a certain
                    softness in the articulations, induced by maceration in the spirits. When an
                    entomologist (in search of Coleoptera) is employed in what we may call the <hi
                    rend="italic">home circuit,</hi> he requires during his excursions nothing more
                    than a couple of glass phials, as we must suppose him possessed of all other
                    appliances within his dwelling. But during a more distant and prolonged journey,
                    he must provide himself with a few small boxes made either of wood or tin (the
                    last is lighter and thinner, and therefore more commodious), lined with cork at
                    top and bottom, and deep enough to contain an upper and an under range of pins.
                    In these the insects caught during the day may be transfixed in the course of
                    the evening, so that the phials may be left empty for the captures of the
                    ensuing morn. Notes ought to be taken of the places of capture, and the insects
                    should be so arranged in the boxes that, by means of numerals or other marks,
                    any individual may be afterwards recognised in relation to its own particular
                    locality.</p>
                <p>- The <hi rend="italic">setting</hi> of an insect consists merely in placing its
                    limbs and antennae in a natural position, and fixing them in the same for a time
                    by means of pins, on a small board on which there is a layer of cork. (See Plate
                    CCXX. figs. 10 and 12.) They stiffen in a few days, and may then be transferred
                    to their proper places in the cabinet. If not set when either moist or recent,
                    they may be softened by being placed for a night in any small vessel containing
                    a layer of wet sand, and covered with a damp cloth to prevent evaporation. The
                    same process, continued for a somewhat longer time, is equally efficient in
                    regard to foreign species. Each specimen, if not stuck, should, previous to
                    setting, be transfixed by passing a pin through the elytra and abdomen, at right
                    angles with the plane of its position,—enough of the pin being made to project
                    beyond the feet as will suffice to fix its point firmly in the cork.</p>
                <p>When mould appears upon coleopterous specimens, they ought to be exposed for some
                    hours at the distance of two or three feet from a brisk fire, and then
                    delicately brushed with a hair pencil. When mites or aćari make their appearance
                    among them, they ought either to be exposed for a few minutes to a high
                    temperature, which kills the living parasites without injuring the dead insects,
                    or each specimen ought to be carefully washed by means of a hair pencil dipped
                    in spirit of turpentine. A piece of sponge constantly saturated with that fluid,
                    or a supply of camphor, should be kept in each drawer. With a view to maintain a
                    collection in good order, it is very advisable that all specimens obtained from
                    correspondents by purchase or exchange should, previous to their being placed in
                    the cabinet, be submitted to the ordeal of a bath cither in spirit of turpentine
                    or camphorated spirit of wine. If mites or acari are once introduced into a
                    cabinet of considerable extent, their eradication is extremely troublesome. As
                    many collectors are careless of their duplicate specimens, and as it is of
                    course with these that they supply their friends, much injury is frequently
                    inflicted by the introduction even of a single insect in bad condition into a
                    cabinet previously in a proper state.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The first primary division of the coleopterous order contains a numerous and
                    varied assemblage, all of which, however, agree in being, as the name imports,
                    of a voracious disposition. Each maxilla is furnished with two palpi, so that
                    there are <hi rend="italic">six</hi> in all, including those of the labium.</p>
                <p>In the larva state, these insects are elongated, cylindrical, composed of twelve
                    rings or segments, exclusive of the head, which is large, of a scaly texture,
                    and provided with two strong mandibles curved at their extremities. The mouth is
                    also furnished with a pair of maxillae divided into two branches, one of which
                    is formed by a palpus. The ligula bears two palpi, which are shorter than those
                    of the maxillae. The head is moreover provided with a pair of short conical
                    antennae, and six small simple <pb break="no" facs="nls:193746714?mode=fullsize"

                    number of these eyes as only three on each side.</p></note> The first segment of
                    the body is co- ‘vered by a squamous shield,—the others are soft. The first
                    three segments are each furnished with a pair of legs, of which the extremity is
                    curved forwards.</p>
                <p>Of course many modifications occur in the form and aspect of adephagous larvae.
                    For example, those of the Cicindelae have the upper portion <hi rend="italic"
                    >oĩ</hi> the head hollowed out in the centre, while the inferior portion is
                    bulged. Two of the eyes on each side are much larger than the others, and the
                    shield of the first segment oí the body is also large, and of a semicircular
                    shape. The eighth segment bears two small hooked processes in its upper surface.
                    Among the generality, however, of these larvae, the head is weaker and more
                    regular, and the eyes are of equal size. The shield is square, and does not
                    project over the sides; the eighth segment wants the processes; but the terminal
                    segment is furnished with two conical appendages, besides a membranous tube
                    formed by the prolongation of the anal portion of the body. Ί hese appendages
                    are toothed and horny in the larvae of <hi rend="italic">Calasoma</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Carabus.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Harpalus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Licinus</hi> they are more elongated, fleshy, and articulated. In
                    these and other genera, the form of the mandibles in the larvae approaches that
                    of the same species in the perfect state.</p>
                <p>The adephagous Coleoptera have always a first stomach, which is short and
                    fleshy,—a second, which is more elongated, and shaggy on the surface, by reason
                    of the numerous small vessels with which it is furnished,—and a short and
                    slender intestine. The hepatic vessels, four in number, are inserted near the
                    pylorus. These insects may be regarded as terrestrial (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Geodephaga)</hi> and aquatic <hi rend="italic">(Hy-grodephαga),</hi> according
                    to their mode of life.</p>
                <p>The genera of the former subdivision of the order dwell and take their food upon
                    the surface of the earth. They are hence known under the name of ground-beetles.
                    The feet of these <hi rend="italic">terrestrial</hi> species are formed for
                    tolerably rapid motion, and the two posterior pair are inserted at equal
                    distances. The mandibles are obvious and discovered, the terminal portion of the
                    maxillae is straight inferiorly, and curved only at its extremity. The body is
                    generally oblong,—the eyes projecting. The tracheae are tubular or elastic, and
                    the intestine is terminated by an expanded cloaca, provided with two small sacs
                    which produce an acrid humour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>This tribe corresponds to the genus Cicindela of Linnaeus. Its genera are
                    distinguished by a hook or nail, which is articulated by its base to the tip of
                    the maxillae. All the species have a strong head, with large eyes, projecting
                    toothed mandibles, and a short ligula concealed behind the mentum. The labial
                    palpi are composed of four distinct articulations, and, in common with the
                    maxillary palpi, are generally shaggy, or somewhat clothed. The precedence is
                    usually assigned to these insects in our systematic arrangements, from motives
                    probably similar to those which have induced ornithologists to place the
                    accipitrine order at the head of the .class of birds. The greater proportion of

                    the third cylindrical, the last slightly enlarged at its extremity.</p>
                <p>The name by which our present genus is distinguished is used by Pliny as
                    synonymous with <hi rend="italic">Lampyris,</hi> to designate a kind of luminous

                    type="authorial"><p>Plin. viii. c. 26.</p></note> It likewise appears to have
                    been applied by ancient writers to various destructive insects which it would
                    now be difficult to identify, although they are no doubt known to naturalists.
                    In modern times it was originally bestowed by Μ. Geoffroy on the species at
                    present classed under the genera <hi rend="italic">Malachius</hi> and <hi

                    insect prey approaches within their tyrannous grasp. The bodies of these larvae
                    are long, cylindrical, whitish, and furnished with six scaly feet. When
                    approached by human footsteps, or otherwise threatened by danger, -they rapidly
                    descend into their subterranean retreats. When two of these larvae happen to
                    form their domiciles in the immediate neighbourhood of each other, the stronger
                    devours the weaker, with a view to obviate any interference with his own
                    pursuits. They seal up the entrance to their dwellings when about to change
                    their skins or assume the state of nymph.</p>
                <p>The perfect insects are extremely beautiful, of light and active forms,
                    exceedingly swift in their motions, and adorned by brilliant metallic colours.
                    The prevailing hues are different shades of golden green, spotted with white or
                    pale yellow. They frequent dry and sandy soils, where they seem to enjoy the
                    prevalence of bright sunshine. The species are extensively distributed over all
                    the regions of the earth. Their organs of locomotion, and those more immediately
                    subservient to the preservation and nutrition of the individual, are very fully
                    developed, and present in the most perfect form all the attributes which
                    distinguish the entomophagous or insect-eating Coleoptera. They were named by
                    Linnaeus the tigers of the insect tribes. “Though decorated with brilliant
                    colours, they prey upon the whole insect race; their formidable jaws, which
                    cross each other, are armed with fearful fangs, showing to what use they are
                    applicable; and the extreme velocity with which they can either run or fly
                    renders hopeless any attempt to elude their pursuit. Their larvae are also
                    equally tremendous with the imago, having six eyes, three on each side, seated
                    on a lateral elevation of the head, which look like those of spiders; and,
                    besides their threatening jaws, armed with a strong internal tooth, being
                    furnished with a pair of spines resembling somewhat the sting of a scorpion,
                    which stand erect upon the back of the abdomen, and give them a most ferocious
                    aspect.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    in shape and disposition, and some of them are occasionally obliterated. The
                    female has two fuscous spots towards the base of the elytra, and is
                    distinguished, in addition to the more slender tarsi, by having the abdomen
                    divided into six segments; that of the opposite sex consisting of seven, with
                    the penultimate one more or less emarginate. This sexual distinction, first
                    observed by Gyllenhal, exists in most genera of the tribe.</p>
                <p>This beautiful insect frequents dry sandy places exposed to the sun, most
                    commonly in the neighbourhood of heaths, and is distributed more or less
                    abundantly over all parts of Britain. We have traced it through most of thei
                    Highlands of Scotland, as far as the south of Sutherland, and we doubt not that
                    it extends to the most northern extremity of the island. It is an inhabitant of
                    most European countries, ranging from the shores of the Mediterranean to
                    Siberia. This is the most abundant of the British species, and the only one yet
                    found in Scotland. The supposed species <hi rend="italic">C. Maroccana,</hi>
                    Fab. which occurs in Spain and along the coast of Barbary, is now regarded as

                    tarsi prolonged obliquely inwards in both sexes. Body narrow and elongated.
                    Thorax almost cylindrical, narrowed anteriorly. Antennae short, thickening more
                    or less towards the extremity. Last article of the labial palpi dilated.</p>
                <p>The title of <hi rend="italic">Colliuris</hi> was bestowed originally by Degeer,
                    upon an insect belonging to the genus <hi rend="italic">Casĩionia</hi> of Lat.
                    It was established according to its present character by Fabricius under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Collyris,</hi> which has been altered as above by the
                    majority of authors. These insects appear to be all provided with wings. All the
                    species yet met with have been found in the most southern countries of Asia, and
                    in the islands lying north of New Holland.</p>

                    Thighs and hind tarsi ferruginous red. Elytra deeply punctured. This species was
                    taken in Java by the excellent Westermann of Copenhagen, who presented it to
                    Comte Dejean as the true <hi rend="italic">C. longicollis</hi> of Lat. The

                <p>This important tribe corresponds to the old and unrestricted genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Carabus</hi> of Linnaeus. The maxillae are terminated simply by a
                    point or hook, whieh is not articulated, as in the preceding genera. The head
                    does not exeeed the breadth of the thorax, and is more frequently somewhat
                    narrower. The mandibles, with few exceptions, are but sparingly toothed. The
                    ligula is usually projecting, and the labial palpi exhibit only three free
                    articulations.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>J” <hi

                    the palpi are said to consist of four articulations; but among the Carabici it
                    is adherent and forming only a support to the others, is not itself regarded as
                    an articulation.</p></note> Many species are apterous, that is, have no
                    membranous wings beneath the elytra. Their odour is often fetid, and their
                    bodies exude an acrid fluid. The habits and economy both of the larvae and
                    perfect insects are exceedingly various. Some conceal themselves under the
                    earth, others beneath stones, or the bark of trees. They are active in their
                    movements, and are very generally distributed, being, however, more
                    characteristic of temperate than equatorial regions. M. Geoffroy bestowed the
                    generic name of <hi rend="italic">Buprestis</hi> upon carabiđeous insects, on
                    account of the injury which he supposed them capable of inflicting on cattle;
                    and it is possible that the caustic ιumour with which many of them are imbued
                    might be produetive of bad effects in the event of their being swallowed along
                    with better and more accustomed pasture. To whatever species this evil tendency
                    was attributed, the ancients appear to have regarded its other characters with
                    admiration, for the physicians of olden times held it as equal in virtue to
                    Cantharides. Linnaeus, however, transferred the name of Buprestis to the genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Cucujus</hi> of Geoffroy, although none of the latter genus in
                    any way corresponded to the <hi rend="italic">Boυirgη&lt;trtς of</hi> the
                    Greeks. The change proposed by the great reformer has been universally adopted,
                    and the word Carabus is now most famihar to the ear of the entomologist.</p>
                <p>As the larvae of the Carabici dwell in subterranean retreats, a knowledge of
                    their habits and history is difficult to acquire. The body is of an elongated
                    form; the legs are six in number, and of a scaly texture; and the maxillae are
                    strong and pineer-like. With these they seize upon the larvae of other insects,
                    which constitute their favourite food. They are extremely voracious.</p>
                <p>In relation to the economical purposes of the human race, the tribes now under
                    consideration are of no great utility. It is mentioned, however, by the younger
                    Geoffroy, that while he was collecting inseets on the coast of Senegal, a negro
                    brought him a jar containing many thousand specimens of a small carabideous
                    species, which had evidently been previously collected by design. On inquiry he
                    found that they were used for making <hi rend="italic">soap,</hi> some ofwĥieh,
                    of a black colour, he afterwards examined, and found it to possess all the
                    qualities of the European article. Olivier asks whether we could not extract
                    from our indigenous speciesan alkaline matter subservient to the same ends?<note

                <p>This group derives its name from the aspect of the elytra, which appear as if cut

                    by which we must be guided, and not by a single feature, although by its wide
                    prevalence that feature may have been assumed, as in the present instance, for a
                    general basis in the naming of the entire group. The two following genera
                    present rather a sinuation than a truncation of the extremities of the

                <p>The insects of this genus are of considerable size. Their usual colours are black

                    the centre common to both. These grooves are garnished with an ash-coloured or
                    brownish down, which sometimes entirely disappears, and then eaeh groove
                    exhibits two rows of small excavated spots, with a longitudinal and slightly
                    elevated line in the centre. Each elytron has also five spots formed of whitish
                    down,—the first near the base of the exterior margin; the second a little in
                    advance of the middle, in the second groove; the third and fourth rather behind
                    the middle, and on the same line, in the first and third grooves; the fifth near
                    the exterior margin, at the extremity between the second and third grooves. The

                    colours. Although several insects of the north of Africa have been discovered in

                <p>Tlιe Brachini, as far as yet known, have no representative in Scotland. But as
                    the southern parts of the kingdom produce five species, we are not without hope
                    that some of these may ere long be discovered on the northern side of the Tweed.
                    It is, however, evidently a southern genus, for of the nineteen species of the

                    generality of these insects are so remarkably distinguished is, that the abdomen
                    contains peculiar organs which secrete a caustic liquor of an extremely
                    penetrating odour. When this is propelled by the insect on any threatened
                    danger, it produces a detonating sound, and evaporates. M. Dumeril has remarked,
                    that when this reservoir is opened by dissection, the liquid effervesces, and
                    evaporates instantaneously. Paper imbued with a blue vegetable dye is changed by
                    its action, first into a reddish hue, and then into yellow. When the vesicle
                    which contains it is placed upon the tongue, and compressed, a peculiar and
                    rather agreeable savour is felt in the mouth. A sharp pain, however, soon
                    follows on the spot affected, where a yellow colour becomes perceptible, similar
                    to that produced by a drop of nitric acid. Leon Dufour has made us acquainted
                    with the apparatus employed in the production of this fluid.<note

                    discharge their ammunition at all times, especially when roughly handled; and Mr
                    Cooper informed him that a specimen he met with at Cobham in the spring,
                    performed the operation no less than thirteen times in rapid succession·<note

                    known in America, and more sparingly in Africa, has been divided by Bonelli into
                    two. The type of the first division (genus <hi rend="italic">Lanιprias)</hi> is

                    and has been taken as far north as Lairig, in Sutherland. The type of <hi

                    are able to perceive from an inspection of our north-country specimens, there is

                <p>Almost all the genera of this group (seventeen in number in the system of Dejean)
                    were constituent portions of the old genus <hi rend="italic">Scarites</hi> of
                    Fabricius and Olivier. They possess several characters in common. The exterior
                    palpi are not subulate or awl-shaped at their extremity. The elytra are not
                    terminated by a truncation, but are either entire or slightly sinuated. The
                    abdomen is separated from the thorax by an obvious intermediate neckshaped
                    portion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The foreign

                    character.</p></note> The first article of the antennae is always the largest.
                    The anterior legs are often broad and palmateđ, and strongly notched interiorly.
                    The anterior tarsi present no marked disparity in the sexes, and are unprovided

                    Latreille and Dejean, the Scaritides seem to be regarded as not carnivorous. But
                    in opposition to this opinion, so contrary to analogy, we have the authority, as
                    Mr Macleay has noted, of two accurate observers, MM. Olivier and Lefebre de
                    Cerisy. The latter, who resides at Toulon, possesses peculiar facilities for
                    acquiring a knowledge of their natural habits. He states them to be nocturnal
                    insects of prey, which, during the day, lurk motionless in holes of the earth,
                    and sally out at night to attack Melolonthidae and other insects.<note

                <p>The insects included in this division are rather strongly distinguished from the
                    conterminous groups. As they are destined to live chiefly beneath the surface of
                    the earth, their structure is more peculiarly adapted than that of the other
                    Coleoptera to a subterranean mode of life. The body is narrow, the anterior
                    thighs thickened, the tibiae dilated, and furnished with strong spines,
                    presenting a broad surface, well fitted to remove the soil ;— the head and
                    thorax are strong, and the latter is attached to the abdomen by a short peduncle
                    or footstalk. In the last-mentioned particular they differ from most other
                    pentamerous beetles, which usually have the thorax closely applied to the
                    abdomen, and the hinder angles rectangular or even salient, which necessarily
                    prevents any considerable degree of lateral motion. But in insects which
                    excavate holes scarcely exceeding their body in width, some provision is
                    necessary to enable them to turn their anterior portion in different directions,
                    otherwise their progress would be nearly in a straight line. This object, which
                    is analogous to that which is provided for in moles and other burrowing
                    quadrupeds, by the flexibility of the vertebral column, is attained by the
                    interposition of a narrow cylindrical piece between the abdomen and thorax, on
                    which the latter moves as on a pivot, its hinder angles being rounded off that
                    its motions may be performed with greater facility. The form of the antennae is
                    likewise in beautiful accordance with the habits of the insects. They arc
                    composed of nearly globular articulations attached to each other by a slender
                    filament, bearing some resemblance to a series of beads rather loosely strung.
                    By a structure of this kind, they are rendered greatly more pliant and flexile
                    than in the other Pentamera (the joints oř the antennae in which are generally
                    conical), and therefore present no obstacle to the insect’s progress through a
                    resisting medium.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    usually shining, and are characteristic of sandy countries near the sea coast,
                    or of districts impregnated with saline particles. They occur in the warmer
                    countries of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. Dejean enumerates fifty-eight

                <p>These small insects are usually found under stones, by the banks of rivers, and
                    elsewhere. They are common all over Europe, more especially in its southern
                    parts. They also occur in Africa, America, and the East Indies. We have two

                    English entomologists. We lately found a rare and interesting species, <hi

                    environs of St Petersburg. It forms the genus <hi rend="italic">Leiochiton</hi>

                <p>In this division Latreille includes those groups of Carabici which, resembling
                    the preceding in the pointed termination of the elytra, have the four anterior
                    tarsi dilated in the males; the first three or four articulations are in the
                    form of a reversed heart or triangle, and are nearly all terminated by acute
                    angles; their under part is usually furnished (excepting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphonι)</hi> with two ranges of papillae or scales, with an intermediate linear
                    space. The body is always winged, generally oval and arched, or convex above,
                    with the thorax broader than long, or at most nearly isometrical, square, or
                    trapezoidal. The head is never suddenly contracted posteriorly. The antennae are
                    of equal thickness throughout, or are slightly and insensibly enlarged towards
                    the extremity. The mandibles are never remarkably strong. The external palpi are
                    terminated by an oval or fusiform joint of greater length than that which
                    precedes it. The tooth of the notch or emargination of the mentum is always
                    entire,—in some wanting.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    of the tarsi simple. The intermediate tarsi, even in the females, are short,
                    and, with the exception of the dilatation, are formed nearly like the anterior.
                    The species prefer warm and sandy situations exposed to the sun.</p>

                    >Insectorum,</hi> comprised all those insects which Dejean has united in the
                    tribes <hi rend="italic">Harpaliens</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Peroniens,</hi>
                    and the genera <hi rend="italic">Callistus,</hi><hi rend="italic">Codes,

                    rend="italic">Observations Entomologiques,</hi> reduced the genus to the insects
                    which now constitute the tribe <hi rend="italic">Harpaliens</hi> of Dejean,
                    itself consisting of twenty-eight genera. The <hi rend="italic">Harpalidae</hi>
                    of the British writers include, besides our present genus, many genera of the
                    sections afterwards mentioned under the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Simplicimani</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pateĩlirnani.</hi></p>
                <p>The genus Harpalus, even as now restricted and above defined, is very extensive,
                    and probably contains nearly one half of the species of the section. The larva?
                    of these insects, as far as we are acquainted with them, dwell beneath the
                    ground. Their form is conico-cylindrical; their head large, armed with strong
                    mandibles, resembling those of the perfect insect; the posterior part of their
                    body exhibits a membranous tube, terminated by a prolongation of the anal
                    region, and two fleshy articulated appendages. Their metamorphoses are likewise
                    subterranean. The Harpali are distributed over all the earth. They are, however,
                    obviously more abundant in the temperate and even boreal regions of the northern
                    hemisphere, than in equinoctial or southern countries. Comte Dejean’s collection
                    contains 179 species, while Mr Stephens enumerates (including the doubtful
                    kinds) 58 species as indigenous to Britain, besides 15 <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ophoηi,</hi> which Dejean combines with Harpalus.</p>

                    elytra pubescent striated, the interstices punctured. This insect is spread over
                    all Europe. We took it at Cape Wrath. It occurs in Siberia. Μ. Gou-dot brought
                    it from Northern Africa.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">H. oeneus</hi> is distinguished by various shades of green
                    above, with a brassy or coppery lustre; the under side black; external margin of
                    the elytra punctulated, the antennae and legs rufous. This species is extremely
                    variable. It is generally of a rich bronzed green; the males highly polished,
                    the females more obscure, sometimes brownish black. Mr Kirby once took a
                    specimen of this insect, which he immersed in hot water, and was surprised to
                    observe what he at first supposed an intestine thrust itself forth; on a nearer
                    inspection he found it was an intestinal worm, thicker than a horse-hair, and of
                    a brown colour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For
                    other British species we must refer the reader tot he works of Messrs Stephens

                <p>This group (the Quadrimani), in the system of Dejean (where it is named
                    Harpaliens), includes many minor genera not recognised in the <hi rend="italic"

                    >Tetragonoderus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pelecium,</hi> which in Latreille’s
                    arrangement belong to other sections. As we cannot enter into a detailed
                    exposition of the characters of those genera, we shall here exhibit Dejean’s
                    latest views by means of a synoptical table.</p>

                <p>These insects are usually found under stones, or marching about the fields,

                <p>A great variety of opinion is maintained by entomologists regarding the
                    distribution of the component parts of this extensive genus. Bonelli, in the
                    synoptical table annexed to the first part of his <hi rend="italic">Observations
                    Eηtomolo~ giques</hi> (in 1809), published the generic characters of <hi

                    Cophosus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Omaseus,</hi> the latter genus, it is
                    believed, corresponding <hi rend="italic">{,o Melanius</hi> of Bonelli. All
                    these were admitted provisionally into the first edition of I omte Dejean’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Catalogue,</hi> published in 1821. In the third volume, however,
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Species General</hi> of that great collector, he
                    observes as follows: “Ma collection depuis cette époque s’etant considérablement
                    augmentée, je me suis trouvé souvent tres-embarassé pour placer dans ces
                    différents genres les espèces qui je recevais, surtout les exotiques, et
                    quelquefois plusieurs d’entre elles me paraissaient intermédiaires entre deux
                    genres, et appartenir autant à l’un qu’à l’autre. Plus je recevais d’insectes,
                    plus je me trouvais embarassé, et lorsque je voulus classer definitivement
                    toutes mes espèces dans chaque genre, et établir les caractères de chacun de ces
                    genres, après plusieurs essais infructueux, je finis par être convaincu que cela
                    était réellement impossible.” Dejean then thought of following the example of
                    Sturm, who reduces (in his <hi rend="italic">Deutschlands</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fauna)</hi> all the genera above named to those of <hi rend="italic">Abax,
                    Molops, Pterostichus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Platysma·,</hi> but after a
                    deliberate re-examination, even these did not appear sufficiently marked; and he
                    finally determined to combine them all in one under the name of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Feronia,</hi> a term previously used in a comprehensive sense
                    by Latreille in the first edition of the <hi rend="italic">Pegne
                    Animal.</hi></p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="italic">Feronia,</hi> then, of Dejean is one of the most
                    extensive in the coleopterous order, containing above 230 species. It is
                    subdivided by the last-named author into ten sections, corresponding to the same
                    number of genera as established by Bonelli, Megerle, Ziegler, and Sturm.</p>
                <p>According to Latreille’s views, the genus is divisible into three groups as
                    follows: Isí, The species, generally winged, of which the body, more or less
                    oval, is a little convex or arcuated above, with the antennae more filiform, the
                    head proportionally narrower, and the mandibles somewhat less projecting. In
                    their habits these insects approach the genera <hi rend="italic">Harpalus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Zabrus.</hi> Such are the <hi rend="italic">Amaxoe,</hi>
                    of which the thorax is transverse (and which Dejean admits as a distinct genus);
                    the <hi rend="italic">Pcecili,</hi> where it is almost as long as broad, and
                    where the rather short antennae have the third article compressed and angular;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Argutoτes,</hi> which resemble the Paecili, but have
                    proportionally shorter antennae, with the third joint not angular.</p>
                <p>2√, The species usually furnished with wings, but of which the body is straight,
                    plane, or horizontal above, with the head nearly as wide as the body. Such is
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Platysma</hi> of Bonelli, to which Latreille unites
                    <hi rend="italic">Ornα-seus</hi> of Ziegler and Dejean, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Catadromus</hi> of Macleay.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> This division contains Feroniae, analogous to those of
                    the preceding one in their general characters, but distinguished by the want of
                    wings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For a further

                <p>We shall conclude by observing that our English entomologists have adopted all
                    those minor genera, in so far as they are applicable to the British species, and
                    have even proposed several others of still more limited application. We regret
                    that our necessarily narrow limits prevent our entering into minute

                    ovate, rather convex, subpunctate-striate, with a puncture on the third
                    interstice a little behind the middle. This is the <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">concinna</hi> of Sturm and Dejean. A variety occurs with the
                    thighs and sometimes the tibiae rufous; it constitutes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >F.</hi><hi rend="italic">madida</hi> of the latter author. They are not
                    distinct. Both varieties are in this country among the most common of
                    coleopterous insects, occurring beneath stones, at the roots of trees, &amp;c.
                    both on low grounds and on mountains. They seem less common in Germany than in
                    any other country in Europe. <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ηi-gritα</hi> is also of frequent occurrence in all parts of Britain. It is of
                    a shining black, the thorax subquadrate, narrowed behind, the elytra with
                    obsoletely punctured striae, and three impressed dots on the disk. <hi

                    often faintly tinged with brassy; elytra striated, with more than four impressed
                    dots on the disk of each. By the comparison of an extensive series of •specimens
                    of this insect which we have collected in various parts of Scotland, we are
                    satisfied that <hi rend="italic">F. ( Om asciis') Bnlwerii</hi> of Stephens is
                    not specifically distinct. A species frequent under stones in woods and fields,
                    and the last which we shall here mention, is <hi rend="italic">F.
                    melanaria.</hi> It is black, apterous, moderately convex, the thorax with a
                    bi-striated fovea in each of its posterior angles, the elytra with striae nearly
                    impunctate.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Broscus,</hi> Panzer. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cephalotes,</hi> Bon. First three articles of the anterior tarsi dilated in the
                    males, broader than long, and decidedly cordiform. Terminal article of the
                    labial palpi elongated and slightly securiform. Antennae filiform, and but
                    slightly lengthened. Labrum of a square form, broader than long, almost
                    transverse. Mandibles slightly arcuated, and rather sharp. A simple tooth in the
                    middle of the emargination of the mentum. Thorax cordiform, convex, and much
                    contracted posteriorly. Elytra rather long, slightly oval, or parallel.</p>
                <p>This genus was established by Bonelli on the <hi rend="italic">Carabus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cephalotes</hi> of Fabricius, and was also distinguished about the
                    same period by Panzer under the name of <hi rend="italic">Broscιιs.</hi> We
                    adopt the latter term as more familiar to the English collectors. Of the five
                    species with which we are acquainted, two belong to Europe, one to the north of
                    Africa, one to Mount Sinai, and the fifth to Asia Minor. They are all of
                    considerable size, and bear a resemblance to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Stempus</hi> of Megerle.</p>
                <p>The only British species is <hi rend="italic">B. cephalotes,</hi> which is of an
                    elongated form, black, with the head thinly punctured, and the elytra very
                    finely punctate-striate. It occurs in ţsandy places over many parts of Britain;
                    and in the vicinity of Edinburgh is plentiful under stones, and marine
                    rejectamenta, on the shore between Portobello and Musselburgh. We found it as
                    far north as Keoldale, near Cape Wrath. The attitude this insect assumes when
                    disturbed is rather peculiar. The two anterior pair of legs are brought close
                    together, and extended straight outwards at right angles with the under surface
                    of the body. The hind legs are bent upwards, and project in a similar way from
                    the opposite surface. The antennae are drawn close to the sides of the thorax,
                    and the mandibles extended to their utmost stretch, while a considerable degree
                    of rigidity is imparted to the whole. It takes this posture most readily in cold
                    weather; at other times, when more active, it prefers seeking safety by flight,
                    or by burrowing in the sand.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>“The habit of these insects,” it is elsewhere observed, “is very curious. They
                    are found only in the sand on the sea shore, and live in dens about three inches
                    deep and half an inch wide, which are made in a diagonal position in the sand,
                    where it is mixed with decomposed stalks of <hi rend="italic">Elymus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arenarius.</hi> They appear to rove during the day occasionally;
                    but upon any alarm they run swiftly to their dens, projecting from the mouths of
                    which their heads may be seen watching for prey. On holding another beetle to
                    the hole, the one within would immediately seize hold of it with its jaws, and
                    continue so tightly fixed as to suffer itself to be drawn out without quitting
                    its hold. They appear to be very ferocious insects; and, from the number of
                    elytra and other parts strewed about the sand, I it may be supposed that they
                    prey on each other.’<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">Entomological Magazine,</hi> No. 1, p∙ 92.</p></note> The latter
                    observation, we may remark, applies to many insects; although the human race
                    (certainly in that respect the most noted) have been supposed to present the
                    only instances of identical species waging war upon each other.</p>

                <p>The natural position of the genus Broscus seems to be that assigned it by Mr
                    Curtis, between the Scaritides and the species which in the <hi rend="italic"

                    former, <hi rend="italic">Broscus</hi> possesses an elongated form, rather short
                    stout legs, and a pedunculated thorax, which adapt it to a subterraneous mode of
                    life. In the latter the thorax is also pedunculated, and the legs thick and
                    strong, while the more rigid structure of the antennae, admitting less easily of
                    being applied to the sides of the thorax to facilitate progression in a
                    cylindrical hole, together with the general configuration of most of the other
                    parts, assimilate it more decidedly to the other Feroniae, to which its habits
                    perfectly correspond.</p>

                <p>This section is chiefly distinguished from the preceding by the mode in which the
                    two anterior tarsi are dilated in the males; the first joints (usually the first
                    three, then the fourth, in others only the first two) sometimes square,
                    sometimes partly of that form, and the others heart-shaped or reversed
                    triangular, but always rounded at their extremity, and not terminated, as in the
                    preceding sections, by acute angles,—form an orbicular pallet or lengthened
                    square, of which the under surface is usually furnished with brushes or close
                    set papillae, without any intermediate (vacancy. The legs are generally long and
                    slender. The thorax is frequently narrower throughout its whole extent than the
                    abdomen. The species frequent, for the most part, moist places on the banks of
                    rivers.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Règne</hi><hi rend="italic">Animal</hi> this (section is
                    composed of the <hi rend="italic">Patellimq,ηi</hi> of Dejean, of a portion of

                    articles of the anterior tarsi dilated in the males, longer than broad, and
                    slightly triangular or cordiform. Terminal article of the palpi lengthened,
                    cylindrical, more or less oval, and truncated at the extremity. Antennae
                    filiform, rather elongated. Labrum slightly convex, of a square form, broader
                    than long, almost transversal. Mandibles not much advanced, slightly arcuated,
                    rather sharp. A simple tooth in the middle of the emargination of the mentum.
                    Thorax more or less rounded, without obvious posterior angles. Elytra oval, more
                    or less elongated.</p>
                <p>Of this genus <hi rend="italic">A. sexpunctatum</hi> is a beautiful species, of
                    which the head and thorax are golden green, the elytra copper-red, finely
                    striated, and impressed with six large punctures. There is only one recorded
                    instance of its being taken in Scotland,—on the banks of the water of Leith, a
                    little to the west of Edinburgh.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ent. Ed.</hi> p. 99.</p></note> Several
                    other species are, however, common in Scotland. There are about thirty kinds in
                    Britain; and l)ejean s collection contains fifty-six.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Anchomenus</hi> is nearly allied to the preceding,
                    but the labrum is plane, the thorax more or less cordiform, with obvious
                    posterior angles. The body is not so flat. We are acquainted with above forty
                    kinds, of which not more than five inhabit Britain. We consider <hi
                    rend="italic">Platynus aηgusticollis</hi> as belonging to this genus.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Chlaenius</hi> of Bonelli, the tooth of the
                    enιargination of the mentum is bifid, the external maxillary palpi are
                    terminated by an almost cylindrical article, slightly restricted at the base,
                    that of the labial being in the form of a reversed and lengthened cone. There
                    are 115 species of this extensive genus, of which about eight are as yet
                    recognised as British. They are ornamental insects, being frequently adorned
                    with green, and burnished with a metallic lustre. They are spread over almost
                    all the earth,—Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. They seem, however, rare in
                    the southern division of the new world, and, as far as we know, have not yet
                    been found in New Holland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    the mentum. The species are confined to Europe and the north of Africa. In the

                    tarsi are dilated in the males, and the terminal article of the palpi is oval.

                    beneath, with a tinge of blue or green above. The elytra are extremely rough.
                    They appear to inhabit exclusively the mountains and forests of Carniola,
                    Illyria, Turkey in Europe, parts of Hungary, the south of Russia, the Caucasus,

                <p>The great genus <hi rend="italic">Carabus</hi> of Linnaeus originally contained
                    the whole of those extensive natural groups which now constitute the family of
                    Carabici, with which we are still engaged. Even as now restricted, it is one of
                    the most numerous with which the entomologist is concerned, and is rendered
                    highly interesting from the size and beauty of many species. The genera with
                    which the <hi rend="italic">Carabi,</hi> as above defined, bear the most direct
                    relations, are <hi rend="italic">Procerus, Procrustes, Calosorna</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but, as Dejean observes, they differ from the first by the
                    anterior tarsi, dilated in the males,—from the second by the form of the labrum
                    and mentum,—and from the third by several characters easily perceived on
                    comparison.</p>
                <p>The greater proportion of the true Carabi, which form a very interesting and
                    well-observed genus, occur in the comparatively temperate countries of Europe,
                    the Caucasus, Siberia, Asia Minor, Syria, and the north of Africa, as far south
                    as the 30th degree. A few are also found towards the two extremities of America,
                    and it is not improbable that others may be ascertained to inhabit the

                    which the elytra are arched or convex, in the three last those in which they are
                    plane. The nature of the surface of the elytra furnishes the other secondary
                    characters, in pretty close accordance with the methods of Bonelli and
                    Clairville.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    exhibit perhaps the most ornamental examples within the range of the European

                    the heathy wastes, yields to few, even of the exotic species, in its lustrous
                    and metallic splendour.</p>
                <p>The name of Carabus (Kαβα∕3oς), applied generically by Linnaeus to so vast a
                    group, occurs in Aristotle’s history of animals, and denotes sometimes a winged
                    coleopterous insect, at other times a species of crustaceous animal. Latreille
                    supposes it to be a contracted form of <hi rend="italic">Scara~ ljoeus.</hi> In
                    addition to the characters already given, we may mention that the species of the
                    genus, as now restricted, are all of considerable dimensions. Their colours are
                    usually black with a tinge of purple, or greenish with a golden hue. The form of
                    the body is elongated; the head, always narrower than the thorax, is generally
                    of greater extent forwards than transversely, and is borne almost in a
                    horizontal position. The eyes are globular, and behind them the head assumes a
                    narrow neck-like form. The mandibles, which are strong and pointed, are usually
                    destitute of dentation, and may be observed to cross each other when the insect
                    is in a state of repose. The thorax is narrower than the abdomen, is bordered
                    with a slightly recurved margin, and is almost always emarginate in its basal
                    line; its superior portion (strictly speaking the <hi rend="italic"
                    >prothorax)</hi> is more extended than the inferior parts, and covers
                    posteriorly the scutellum of the mesothorax, which, naturally but slightly
                    developed, presents to view its summit only. The elytra are also margined after
                    the manner of the thorax, and their upper surface, rarely smooth, is variously
                    characterized, according to the species, by striae, furrows, depressed points,
                    or rows of bead-like elevations. The true or membranaceous wings are either
                    wanting or exist in a very rudimentary condition. The species therefore are
                    incapable of flight; but, to make amends for this deficiency, their legs are
                    strong and lengthened, the trochanter is greatly developed, and the tarsi of the
                    anterior pair (in the males) are dilated, with their first four articulations
                    spongy on their inferior face.</p>
                <p>All the species are eminently voracious and carnivorous. They not only prey upon
                    the soft bodied and defenceless caterpillars, and on all other insects weaker
                    thah themselves, but they even seize upon and devour their own species. They
                    usually avoid strong light, are partial to a certain degree of moisture, and
                    conceal themselves during the heat of the day beneath stones, among mossy
                    herbage, in garden rubbish, or under the stems or within the hollows of fallen
                    trees. We have noted the usual habits of each of the species in the descriptions
                    which follow; and, in regard to their general distribution, we may observe, that
                    their principal seat appears to be the north temperate zone, that they are
                    extremely rare in the warmer regions of the earth, and probably disappear
                    altogether within the tropics. Their larvae and metamorphoses are but slightly
                    known. Many of the perfect insects exhale a penetrating and fetid odoúr, and
                    when touched exude a dark-coloured caustic humour.</p>
                <p>Mr Stephens enumerates nineteen species of British Carabi. The claims, however,
                    of three or four of these (such as <hi rend="italic">O.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >purpurascens, convexus,</hi><hi rend="italic">auronitens)</hi> to be regarded
                    as truly indigenous, are extremely doubtful. The occurrence of an insect on our
                    island shores is sometimes accidental, and results from the fortuitous impulsion
                    of winds or waves. It is well that the visits of these erratic strangers should
                    be recorded, as they afford an interesting illustration of the extreme extent in
                    one direction of their geographical range; but they cannot on that account be
                    considered as “children of the soil.” We shall here give a few brief notices of
                    the Scottish species.</p>

                    It is rare in Scotland, and we have not yet observed it during our excursions to

                    Dumbarton, Argyll, Perth, and Forfar. It is always regarded as a valuable
                    acquisition, on account of its extreme beauty.</p>
                <p>C. <hi rend="italic">clathratus.</hi> Oblong-ovate, Of a dark brassy hue, thorax
                    rather square, the posterior angles not much produced, the elytra with three
                    elevated lines, and a triple series of deep golden excavations. This is one of
                    the largest and finest of the British Coleoptera. It has hitherto been regarded
                    as a very rare insect, but a closer examination of the wilder districts will
                    probably bring it into more frequent view. We were the first to take it in
                    Scotland,— which we did many years ago, and in considerable numbers (nine or ten
                    specimens in a few days), in the island of Colonsay, the hospitable habitation
                    of John Macneill, Esq. It has been since taken by Mr Macleay in Caithness. Capt.
                    Graham, R. N. and others, also captured several specimens in different parts of
                    Sutherland (near Invershin, on the point of Tongue, and the vicinity of Lairig),
                    in the month of August 1833; and Mr George Little has collected it for some
                    seasons at Ormsary, on the mainland of Argyllshire. On the continent this
                    beautiful insect is found in Siberia, Sweden, Hungary, Italy, and the south of
                    France, especially in the environs of Montpellier. It varies singularly in
                    regard to the development of the true or membranaceous wings. Those which occur
                    in the south of Europe are large, and furnished with wings; those of Sweden and
                    Siberia are apterous, and of smaller size.</p>

                    securiform. Antennae filiform; the third article slightly compressed, sharp on
                    the outer edge, and sensibly longer than the others. Labrum bilobed. Mandibles
                    broad, very slightly curved, more or less sharp, transversely striated, without
                    obvious teeth on their interior. A strong tooth on the middle of the
                    emargination of the mentum. Thorax short, almost transversal, more or less
                    rounded. Elytra usually of a square form, more or less elongated, rarely oval or
                    rounded. Wings most frequently fit for flight.</p>
                <p>This genus is very widely distributed. There are about thirty species in all,
                    spread in different proportions over Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. <hi
                    rend="italic">C. sycσphanta</hi> (Plate CCXXH. fig. 2) and <hi rend="italic"
                    >inquisitor</hi> have occurred in Britain. The genus is as yet unknown in
                    Scotland.</p>
                <p>3ď, The third and last division of the <hi rend="italic">Grandipalpi</hi> of
                    Latreille presents an assemblage of characters which clearly distinguish its
                    component parts from those of the two preceding. Most of the species are winged.
                    The anterior tarsi of the males are always dilated. The labrum is entire. The
                    exterior palpi are merely somewhat dilated or thicker at the extremity, the last
                    joint being in the form of a reversed and elongated cone. The internal side of
                    the mandibles presents no tooth deserving of notice; the one in the middle of
                    the emargιnation of the mentum is bifid. The centre of the superior margin of
                    the ligųla is elevated to a point. On the internal side of the anterior tibiae
                    of several there is a short emargination, or one of the two spurs is inserted
                    higher than the other, so that in this respect these <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carabici</hi> are somewhat ambiguous, and might be placed, as well as those of
                    the ensuing section, immediately after the <hi rend="italic">Patelli-maηi.</hi>
                    They usually <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> inhabit moist situations. A few,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Omophron,</hi> seem to connect their tribe with that
                    which follows,—the aquatic Carnivora.</p>
                <p>In some in which the body is flattened, or convex and suborbicular, the eyes are
                    of ordinary size; the antennae linear, and generally consisting of elongated and
                    almost cylindrical joints; the external sides of the maxillae are bearded, and
                    the two internal spines of the two anterior tibiae are on a level at their
                    origin $ these tibiae have merely a simple longitudinal canal. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Leistus,</hi> Froehlich <hi rend="italic">(Pogo· nophorus,</hi>
                    Lat.), the exterior palpi are much elongated, the mandibles are dilated at their
                    base, the head is suddenly narrowed behind the eyes, and the antennae are long
                    and slender. All the species belong to Europe, and the greater proportion are
                    found to occur in Britain. <hi rend="smallcaps">Nebria,</hi> Lat. resembles <hi
                    rend="italic">Leistus,</hi> but the palpi arc much shorter, the mandibles not
                    dilated, the head not restricted, and the antennae proportionally thicker, and
                    composed of shorter articulations. Several of the species, such as <hi
                    rend="italic">N. Gyl-lenhalii, brevicollis,</hi> &amp;c., are classed by English
                    entomologists in the genus <hi rend="italic">Helobia</hi> of Leach. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Oλiophron</hi> of Lat <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> (see Plate
                    CCXXI. fig. 18), the first joint only of the two anterior tarsi is dilated in
                    the males.</p>
                <p>In other genera the body is tolerably thick, and the eyes large and prominent;
                    the antennae are slightly enlarged near the extremity, and composed of short
                    joints, mostly in the form of a top or reversed cone; one of the two spines of
                    the internal extremity of the two anterior tibiae is inserted higher than the
                    other, with a notch between them. The four or first three joints of the anterior
                    tarsi of the males are in general but slightly dilated. The palpi are more
                    elongated. They occur chiefly by the sides of rivers in Europe and in Siberia.

                <p>Of the two great tribes, viz. <hi rend="smallcaps">CicindeŁetae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carabici,</hi> with the principal genera of which we have just
                    been engaged, there are 2494 species enumerated in the last edition of the
                    Catalogue of Comte Dejean. We come now to <hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 3d,
                    Hydrocantiiari,</hi> Lat.</p>
                <p>This tribe is composed of the undivided genera <hi rend="italic">Dytiscus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Gyrinus</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the old writers.
                    Their feet are adapted for swimming; the last four being compressed, ciliated or
                    laminiform, and the last two at a distance from each other. The mandibles are
                    almost entirely covered. The body is always oval, the eyes but slightly
                    prominent, and the thorax much wider than long. The terminal hook of the
                    maxillae is curved from its base; those at the extremity of the tarsi are often
                    unequal.</p>
                <p>All these aquatic Coleoptera pass both their first and final stage of existence
                    in the fresh and placid waters of lakes and marshes, or the undisturbed parts of
                    tranquil rivers, and are distributed over all the countries of the earth,
                    wherever such localities occur, from Greenland to Van Diemen’s Land.</p>
                <p>The old genus <hi rend="italic">Dytiscus</hi> (Plate CCXXII. fig. 3 and 4)
                    embraced a vast assemblage of aquatic insects which the more minute observance
                    of modern times has partitioned into many genera. They form a truly amphibious
                    family: for although water is their favourite element, they sιirvive for a long
                    time on moist land, and most of them fly about in the evening and morning
                    twilight, and even during the darkness of the dewy night, with great power and
                    celerity. They vary considerably in size, according to the species, some being
                    extremely small, while others measure between one and two inches in length. They
                    are fierce and voracious in their habits, preying indiscriminately upon whatever
                    smaller and softer tribes they are able to subdue. They are frequently observed
                    resting on the surface oí the water, with their legs expanded, their heads
                    downwards, and the terminal segment of their bodies in contact with the air. It
                    is thus that they carry on the process of breathing, for they cannot respire
                    except by bringing a globule of atmospheric air in contact with the stigmata,
                    which are placed on the sides of the abdomen, ∣ just beneath the outer margins
                    of the elytra. Being specifically lighter than water, when they feel the
                    necessity of respiration they have nothing to do but to allow themselves to
                    float to the surface, where, by a peculiar action of the tips of the elytra and
                    the terminal segment of the body, a portion of air is brought into contact with
                    the stigmatic openings. The bodies of the larvae of these insects (Plate CCXXH.
                    fig. 6) consist of eleven well-defined segments. The head is large, flattish,
                    covered above by a scale or shield marked down the centre by a longitudinal
                    furrow. On each side there are five or six black tubercles which are regarded as
                    eyes, and anterior to the eyes are placed the antennae, consisting of three
                    articulations. The mouth is armed with a pair of strong, horny, curved,
                    sharp-pointed mandibles, which serve to seize and transfix the prey. According
                    to Swammerdam and Degeer, these organs are pierced so as to act as suckers, by
                    means of which the animal juices are absorbed. Near the extremity of the abdomen
                    two delicate appendices may be perceived, pointing obliquely downwards. By means
                    of these the larva appears to suspend itself occasionally from the. surface of
                    the water when it wishes to respire. The principal stigmatic openings are at the
                    end of the abdomen, and consist of two small cylindrical bodies, which, when the
                    creature floats, come in contact with the air, and communicate with the tracheal
                    vessels, which are seen to traverse beneath the skin on either side of the body.
                    The movements of these insects in the larva state are effected in the water,
                    partly by the legs and partly by an undulatory motion of the tail. They prey
                    upon other larvae, such as those of dragon-flies, ephemerae, gnats, &amp;c. As
                    an instance of their great voracity, it may be mentioned that we once observed
                    one of the larger kinds transfix and suck out the juices of thirteen well-grown
                    tadpoles in a single day. W hen the period of their transformation has arrived,
                    they leave the water and bury themselves in the moist soft earth of a
                    neighbouring bank. There they work for themselves an egg-shaped chamber, in
                    which they assume the nympha state. (Plate CCXXII. fig. 9.) How long they remain
                    in that condition is not very precisely known, from the difficulty of rearing
                    them in confinement throughout their entire changes, but it is believed that the
                    insect is not long of making its appearance in the perfect state. It may then be
                    kept alive in a tumbler for several seasons, and the larger kinds <hi
                    rend="italic">(Dytisci</hi> proper) soon assume a certain degree of tameness and
                    familiarity, will follow the finger around the walls of their transparent
                    prison, and, coming to the surface at an accustomed signal, will demand,
                    according to their own mode of expression, a young earthworm, or a piece of
                    fresh beef or mutton; for on these and several other articles they feed from the

                    when recently captured, has a smell resembling liquorice. It is said to kill
                    Hydrus piceus, which is a much larger and apparently stronger insect, by
                    piercing it between the head and thorax, the only part of the body which is
                    unprotected. Esper asserts that it is much affected by atmospheric changes, and
                    that it indicates these, when in a state of confinement, by the height at which
                    it remains in its jar.</p>

                    externally into a triangular ciliated lobe, the rest forming a clavate mass,
                    attached by a short peduncle to the upper side of the first joint. Anterior legs

                    formed for swimming. (Plate CCXXH. figs. 8 and 12.)</p>
                <p>In this genus the body is oval and generally very glossy. Γhe head is sunk in the
                    thorax almost to the eyes, and hese are large, and divided by a horny process or
                    border, in such a way that there seems to be two above and two below. Only seven
                    joints of the terminal por∙∙ ion of the antennae are distinctly visible. The
                    singular auriform shape of these organs induced Latreille to form the Gyrini
                    into a family along with <hi rend="italic">Pαrnus,</hi> under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Otioρhori.</hi> But at an after period that great entomologist
                    approximated the genus to the <hi rend="italic">Dytiscidae,</hi> thereby
                    correcting the error he had previously committed of confounding, as Mr Maclcay
                    observes, a relation of analogy with one of affinity. The Gyrinidae live in
                    society, and several species are extremely common on our ponds, and ditches by
                    the way side. They swim flat upon the surface, with their shining backs above
                    water, chasing each other in circles, or darting about in more irregular
                    gyrations. When hemmed into a corner of the pond, they make their escape by
                    darting beneath the surface, carrying along with them a portion of air, which
                    shines like quicksilver. Britain produces several species of this genus. They
                    are known in England by the name of whirlgigs. These insects fly well, and
                    transport themselves with ease and rapidity from place to place. The females
                    deposit their eggs on the leaves of aquatic plants. The eggs are very small,
                    lengthened in the form of little cylinders, and of a white colour tinged with
                    yellow. According to the observations of Degeer, they produced minute six-footed
                    larvae in the course of eight days, which swam in the water, or crept along the
                    sides of the vessel in which they had been deposited. Neither he nor Roesel,
                    however, could succeed in rearing them to a state of completion. These larvae
                    (Plate CCXX1I. fig. 17) exhibit rather a singular aspect, and at first sight
                    resemble small Scolopendrae. They arc of a dingy white or greyish colour, and
                    their clear transparent skin permits the view of their internal structure. Their
                    bodies are long, slender, cylindrical, and divided into thirteen rings, which
                    are deeply incised. The head is oval, very much elongated, and flattened both
                    above and below. It is armed in front with a pair of comparatively large curved
                    jaws, tipped with brown, which, when closed, meet with their points in advance
                    of the head, but are capable of wide extension. The structure of these parts
                    demonstrates a carnivorous disposition. The antennae are very delicate, divided
                    into four articulations, and equal the head in length. The first segment of the
                    body is nearly twice as long as the others, and the three pairs of feet are
                    attached to the first three segments. The eight following rings are garnished
                    with very singular, long, slender, transparent filaments, which float in the
                    water without being apparently under the guidance of the animal. From their
                    resemblance to the gills of the Phryganeae and Ephemerae, it is probable that
                    these are the respiratory organs. The twelfth or penultimate segment of the body
                    is furnished with four of these filaments, of much greater length than the
                    preceding, and covered with long hairs or secondary filaments. The last segment,
                    which is much less than the others, is terminated by four long and remarkable
                    hooks, placed parallel to each other, with their points bent beneath inwards.
                    The whole body" seems filled with little globules of air, which are in frequent
                    motion, sometimes towards the head and sometimes towards the other extremity.
                    Modeer has described the transformations of these creatures in the Memoirs of
                    the Royal Academy of Sweden. About the beginning of August, according to that
                    author, the larvae leave the water, and, crawling up the stems of reeds or other
                    aquatic plants, they are transformed into nymphs, beneath the envelope of a
                    small cocoon, pointed at both ends, and formed of a substance resembling grey
                    paper. Towards the end of the same month the perfect insect is <pb break="no"

                    >G.</hi><hi rend="italic">natator,</hi> of an oval form, bluish-black, extremely
                    glossy, the inflected margin of the elytra, apical segments ofthe abdomen, and
                    legs, ferruginous. This agile little creature appears to have been rather a
                    favourite object of observation with the entomologist, “Water, quiet still
                    water,” says Mr Knapp, “affords a place of action to a very amusing little
                    fellow <hi rend="italic">{Gyrinus natator),</hi> which, about the month of
                    April, if the weather be tolerably mild, we see gamboling upon the surface of
                    the sheltered pool; and every schoolboy who has angled for minnows in the brook
                    is well acquainted with the merry swimmer in his shining black jacket. Retiring
                    in the autumn, and reposing all the winter in the mud at the bottom of the pond,
                    it awakens in the spring, rises to the surface, and commences its sports. They
                    associate in small parties of ten or a dozen near the bank, where some little
                    projection forms a bay, or renders the water particularly tranquil; and here
                    they will circle round each other, without contention, each in his sphere, and
                    with no apparent object, from morning until night, with great sprightliness and
                    animation; and so lightly do they move on the fluid, as to form only some faint
                    and transient circles on its surface. Very fond of society, we seldom see them
                    alone, or, if parted by accident, they soon rejoin their busy companions. One
                    pool commonly affords space for the amusement of several parties, yet they do
                    not unite or contend, but perform their cheerful circlings in separate family
                    associations. If we interfere with their merriment they seem greatly alarmed,
                    disperse or dive to the bottom, where their fears shortly subside, as we soon
                    again see our little merry friends gamboling as before. This plain, tiny,
                    gliding water-flea seems a very unlikely creature to arrest our young attention;
                    but the boy with his angle has not often much to engage his notice; and the
                    social active parties of this nimble swimmer, presenting themselves at these
                    periods of vacancy, become insensibly familiar to his sight, and by many of us
                    are not observed in after-life without recalling former hours—scenes of perhaps
                    less anxious days; for trifles like these, by reason of some association, are
                    often remembered when things of greater moment pass off and leave no trace upon
                    the mind.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>In this, the second family of Pentamerous Coleoptera, Latreille places those
                    genera which have only a single palpus to each maxilla, or four in all,
                    including the labial&lt; pair. The antennae, sometimes of equal thickness, and
                    <hi rend="superscript"> ]</hi> at others slightly enlarged at the extremity, are
                    usually composed of lenticular or graniform articulations; the elytra are much
                    shorter than the body (from which circumstance they derive their name), and the
                    latter is narrow, elongated, generally depressed, with the coxae of the two
                    anterior legs very large. The posterior extremity of the body is provided with
                    two vesicles, which are protruded at will.</p>
                <p>These Coleoptera composed the great genus <hi rend="italic">Staphylinus</hi> (of
                    Linnaeus) before its subdivision by more recent writers. Ancient authors appear
                    to have bestowed the name of <hi rend="italic">Staphylinus</hi> on certain
                    species, which, from the characters assigned them, and their reputed injurious
                    effects on horses, we can scarcely refer to any of the modern genera of
                    brachelytrous insects. Mouffet, however, having satisfied himself that some
                    ancient passage did apply with sufficient correctness, made use of the term
                    Staphylinus in relation to the present group; and whatever may have been its
                    original application, its meaning is now no longer ambiguous in the modern
                    systems. The genus, as constituted by Linnaeus, was first dismembered by
                    Fabricius of two of its component groups, under the generic names of <hi
                    rend="italic">Poederus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Oxyporus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and in still more recent times numerous other subdivisions have taken
                    place, which have raised the original genus to the rank of an ordinal section or
                    comprehensive family.</p>
                <p>Some writers regard the Staphylini as forming the passage from the Coleoptera in
                    general to the Forficulae or ear-wigs, which compose the first genus of the <hi
                    rend="italic">orthopterous</hi> order. In their habits they somewhat resemble
                    the Silphae and Necrophori. They have usually a large, flattened head, strong
                    mandibles, short antennae, and a thorax as wide as the abdomen, which is long,
                    narrow, and generally depressed. The elytra are very short and truncated,
                    although they still suffice to cover the long membranous wings, which, when not
                    in use, are compactly folded. The upper portion of the segments of the abdomen,
                    being exposed in consequence of the shortness of the elytra, is, contrary to the
                    usual rule among the coleopterous tribes, of as firm a consistence as that
                    beneath. From the terminal segment of the abdomen two vesicles are protruded or
                    retracted at the pleasure of the animal, and from these, when irritated, a
                    subtile vapour makes its escape with a strong odour of sulphuric ether, “Though
                    most of the micropterous species,” Mr Kirby observes, “have a fetid smell, yet
                    there are some exceptions to this amongst them. One species (&lt;S'. <hi

                    family, when attacked or touched, elevate the extremity of their abdomen, bend
                    it in various directions, and frequently protrude the vesicles above alluded to.
                    They also use the point of the abdomen to close or unfold their wings. The tarsi
                    of the two anterior legs are frequently broad and dilated, and their coxae, as
                    well as those of the intermediate pair, are very large. The species usually
                    occur in damp places, under stones, in earth, and excrementitious matters. Some
                    live in mushrooms and fungi, or in <pb break="no"

                    while a few of the smaller species are found on flowers. They are all swift,
                    active, and voracious.</p>
                <p>The larvae bear a close resemblance to the perfect insect. In figure they more
                    nearly resemble an elongated cone, the base of which is formed by the head; the
                    terminal segment is prolonged into a tube, and is accompanied by two conical and
                    hairy appendages. Their food and habits of life are very similar to those of the
                    imago.</p>
                <p>According to M. Dufour, the only essential difference between the alimentary
                    canal of the brachelytrous tribes and that of the carnivorous Coleoptera
                    consists in the absence of the crop. The first stomach is small and destitute of
                    folds; the second is very long and pilose; the intestine is extremely short. The
                    biliary vessels are inserted at the same lateral point as in the Carnivora, and
                    present in some species, near the middle, a knot or vesicle, not observable in
                    any other insects. Their sexual apparatus differs greatly from that of the
                    carnivorous Coleoptera.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>Many of the species of this family are of minute dimensions, and a knowledge of
                    their names and characters is of difficult attainment. Many more of the
                    described species than have been hitherto collected no doubt exist in Britain,
                    and many of the Scandinavian species will probably be discovered to inhabit
                    Scotland. There is every reason, indeed, to believe that an assiduous
                    entomologist would here reap a rich harvest among a tribe of insects which seem
                    characteristic of, though by no means peculiar to, temperate or northern
                    countries. Notwithstanding the obscurity in which many of our smaller species

                    richness of their external covering. Even of the European species several are
                    extremely beautiful, and many of the foreign kinds are not only of the largest
                    size for the class of insects, but present a brilliant surface, beset as it were
                    with gold and emeralds, or glittering with an iridescent play of green and
                    azure. The body is in general oval, somewhat lengthened, rather wider and obtuse
                    before, as if truncated, and narrowed behind from the base of the abdomen. The
                    eyes are oval, the thorax short and wide. The scutellum small or unapparent. The
                    extremity of the elytra is frequently dentated. The legs are short.</p>
                <p>All these insects walk very slowly, but fly exceedingly well in dry and sultry
                    weather. When an attempt is made to seize them they drop upon the ground, with a
                    view no doubt to conceal themselves in the subjacent herbage. The abdomen of the
                    female is furnished at its extremity with a coriaceous or horny conical
                    appendage, composed of three pieces (the terminal abdominal rings), and which
                    may be regarded as a kind of ovipositor, by which she deposits her eggs in dry
                    or decayed wood, in which the larvae dwell. Several of the minor species occur
                    on leaves and flowers; but the greater proportion are found in forests or depots
                    of timber. They sometimes appear suddenly in places where they were never seen
                    before, having been involuntarily transported in foreign timber in the nymph or
                    larva state.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Buprestides</hi> are very common in South America and many
                    of the other sultry regions of the earth. They decrease in number as we advance

                    and with little tufts of yellowish or reddish hairs. It sometimes hangs in such
                    abundance on a shrub, as to make it appear all laden with flowers. Others are

                    rend="smallcaps">Tribe 2d, Elaterides.</hi></p>
                <p>This numerôus tribe corresponds to the undivided genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elater</hi> of Linnaeus, and differs from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Buprestides</hi> chiefly in the posterior style of the praesternum, which is
                    prolonged to a sharpish point or spine laterally compressed. On examining the
                    living species, the use of the last-named organ becomes obvious. The legs are
                    very short, and when the creature falls upon its back, which it frequently does
                    while dropping from a plant to the ground, it can only assume its natural
                    position by springing upwards, which it is enabled to do by bringing the
                    projecting point into sudden contact with a groove situated in front of the
                    mesosternum. The sides of the praesternum are also distinguished by a groove, in
                    which the antennae, pectinated or bearded in several males, are partly lodged.
                    The females have a species of elongated ovipositor, with two lateral pieces
                    pointed at the end, between which is the true oviduct. The tarsi are entire.</p>
                <p>The Elaterides occur in flowers, on various plants, and on the ground. We owe to
                    Degeer the description of the larva of one species <hi rend="italic"
                    >(undulatus).</hi> It is long, nearly cylindrical, provided with small antennae,
                    palpi, and six feet. Its body consisted of twelve scaly segments, of which the
                    posterior was covered by a circular plate, furnished with two blunt points
                    curving inwards; underneath was a large fleshy mammilla, which seemed to serve
                    the office of a foot. The larvae of <hi rend="italic">Elater</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">striatus</hi> are said to do much injury, by attacking the roots
                    of wheat. The grub known in this country under the name of wire-worm is an
                    Elater in the early state. It lives under ground for several years, feeding on
                    the roots of grain and vegetables. It is partial to land newly broken up, and
                    does great damage in gardens recently converted from pasture-land. In the year
                    1813, according to Mr Spence, this larva destroyed the greater proportion of the
                    annuals sown in the botanic garden of Hull. In such cases Sir Joseph Banks
                    recommended that slices of potatoes stuck upon skewers should be buried near the
                    seeds, and examined and cleared of the wire-worms from time to time.</p>
                <p>Μ. Leon Dufour has studied the anatomical structure of several species of this
                    family. In the number, length, and mode of insertion of the hepatic conduits,
                    they show a resemblance to the Carabidae. The digestive canal is seldom more
                    than once and a half the length of the body. Immediately succeeding an
                    oesophagus, so short as to be included within the region of the head, there is a
                    small smooth conical crop, which appears to have escaped the observation of
                    Ramdhor. The chylific ventricle is bilobed in certain species. This tribe is
                    very extensive both in exotic and European species, and is much more prevalent
                    in temperate and even northern countries than the preceding. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Elaterides</hi> now consist of numerous genera. Some of the
                    American species are remarkable for the fine phosphoric light which is observed
                    to emanate from them during the evening twilight, and when the shades of night
                    have fallen upon the forests. One of these had the fortune to be transported to
                    Paris under the form of nymph or larva; and having made its escape into the
                    streets after the assumption of the perfect state, it greatly astonished the
                    inhabitants of the Faubourg St Antoine. Most of the genera are recognisable, in
                    a general way, by their narrow, elongated, and somewhat flattish forms. We have
                    above sixty species in Britain, arranged according to the modern views, under
                    not less than twenty genera.</p>

                <p>The various groups of the <hi rend="italic">Elaterides</hi> are referred by

                    the thorax.</hi></p>
                <p>In some the antennae are received on each side into a longitudinal groove, placed
                    directly under the lateral edges of the thorax, and are always filiform, and
                    simply serrated. The joints of the tarsi are always entire, without
                    prolongations, and in the form of a pellet underneath. The thorax is convex or
                    arched, at least on the sides, and dilates towards the posterior angles in the
                    manner of a lobe, pointed or triangular. They approach the <hi rend="italic"

                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Eucne-mis.</hi></p>
                <p>In others the antennae, sometimes clavate, are received, at least partially,
                    either into the longitudinal grooves of the lateral borders of the praesternum,
                    or into fossettes placed under the posterior angles of the thorax. The tarsi are
                    frequently provided with little pellets, formed by the prolongation of the
                    inferior parts, or the penultimate article is bifid. Here are placed the genus
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Adolecera,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXII. fig. 29), and
                    others.</p>
                <p>2 <hi rend="italic">d Antennae exterior or exposed.</hi></p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ceropiiytum,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXH. fig. 30),
                    the terminal joint of the palpi, especially the maxillary, is much larger than
                    the preceding, and almost securiform. These insects are more particularly
                    distinguished from the following by their tarsi, of which the first four
                    articles are short, triangular, with the penultimate bifid. The antennae of the
                    males are ramose on the internal side, the base of the third and following
                    articles being prolonged into a widened branch, rounded at the extremity; those
                    of the female are serrated. In the succeeding genera the articles of the tarsi
                    are entire and almost cylindrical. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Hemirhipus,</hi> Lat.
                    (Plate CCXXH. fig. 31), the mandibles and labrum arc exposed, and the antennae
                    of the male have a flabelliform termination. The species are foreign to Europe.
                    In <hi rend="smallcaps">Elater</hi> properly so called (Plate CCXXH. fig. 27),
                    the antennae of the males are simply serrated. Here we place the fire-fly, or
                    <hi rend="italic">mouche lumineuse</hi> of the French colonists, which during
                    the night diffuses from its thoracic spots a strong and beautiful light,
                    sufficient to enable one to read the smallest print, particularly if several are
                    placed together in a glass vessel. By means of this natural illumination the
                    women of the country (the species is South American) are said to pursue their
                    work, and ladies even use it as an ornament, placing it among their tresses

                    lines in length. The body is very narrow, of a yellow colour, hard, shining, and
                    composed of twelve segments, on the last of which are two indented dark-coloured
                    specks. The head is brown, the extremity of the jaws black. The anterior
                    segments have six scaly feet. It is said to remain five years in the larva

                    slightly convex body; and by the thorax, sometimes semicircular, sometimes
                    nearly square or trapezoidal, projecting over and almost concealing the head.
                    The mandibles are generally small, and terminate in a slender, arcuated, very
                    acute point, generally entire. The penultimate joint of the tarsi is always
                    bilobate, and the terminal hooks have neither dentations nor appendages. The
                    females of some are apterous, or have but short elytra. When seized, most of
                    these insects press their feet and antennae close to the body, and remain as
                    motionless as if they were dead. Several curve the abdomen underneath. They
                    correspond to the old genus <hi rend="italic">Lampyris</hi> of Linn., and

                    The remaining insects of this division are distinguished from the preceding, not
                    only by the want of a snout (it is not apparent even in the last-named genus),
                    by their head, which in the males is almost entirely occupied by the eyes, and
                    much concealed by the square or semicircular thorax—but more particularly by a
                    very remarkable character, either common alike to males or females, or peculiar
                    to the latter sex, viz. the property of phosphorescence. Hence the names of
                    glow-worms, fireflies, &amp;c. bestowed upon the species which form the genus

                    indigenous species. The eyes are large. The body rather soft, oblong-oval, much

                    and particular nature, which we were induced to make in consequence of our
                    having kept the common British glow-worm in confinement.<note anchored="true"

                <p>The beautiful light which emanates from this insect constitutes its most
                    interesting and peculiar attribute. If several ancient nations were worshippers
                    of the sun, and regarded “holy light” as a divine effulgence, the offspring of
                    heaven, and the purest of the elements, we need scarcely wonder that in remote
                    times, when natural phenomena were but slightly understood, even the more
                    obscure manifestations of a supposed celestial principle should have excited the
                    wonder and admiration of mankind. We consequently find many exaggerated accounts
                    of the cause and effects of these flying and creeping lights, which, as they do
                    not illustrate the natural history, properly so called, of the insects
                    themselves, we shall leave for the present<pb break="no"

                    But the actual phenomena are extremely interesting, on account both of their
                    singularity and beauty, and, without the aid of fiction, are well deserving the
                    attention of the poet and philosopher. Huet, bishop of Avranches, an eminent
                    scholar, composed a poem, entitled <hi rend="italic">Lampyris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the masterly genius of Wordsworth, which draws so much
                    that is new and beautiful from the observance of common things, has not failed
                    to immortalize the radiance of the “earth-born star.” “And if,” say Messrs Kirby
                    and Spence, or one or other of these authors, while speaking of the British
                    glow-worm, “living like me in a district where it is rarely met with, the first
                    time you saw this insect chanced to be, as it was in my case, one of those
                    delightful evenings which an English summer seldom yields, when not a breeze
                    disturbs the balmy air, and hundreds of these radiant worms, studding their
                    mossy couch with mild effulgence, were presented to your wondering eye in the
                    course of a quarter of a mile,—you could not help associating with the name of
                    glow-worm the most pleasing recollections. No wonder that an insect which
                    chiefly exhibits itself on occasions so interesting, and whose economy is so
                    remarkable, should have afforded exquisite images and illustrations to those
                    poets who have cultivated natural history.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The glow-worm is now a very rare insect in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Mr
                    Neill informs us that it formerly occurred between the city and the village of
                    Canonmills; but we have not heard of its having been found there or elsewhere
                    around our immediate suburbs for many years. Dr David Ritchie has observed it
                    occasionally near Pathhead, and Professor Wallace has met with it in Fife.
                    Professor Wilson informs us that he once saw it on the Queensferry road, near
                    Comely Bank. We have ourselves taken it by Loch Lomond side, and elsewhere in
                    Scotland. It abounds in the north of England. We once received some living
                    specimens early in July from Borthwick, about twelve miles from Edinburgh. They
                    laid eggs a few days after their arrival, on the sides of a glass vessel. The
                    parents soon after died, probably from being kept in too confined a space; but
                    the young larvae were hatched in a few weeks, and by the end of September they
                    measured about the third of an inch in length. These larvae bear a strong
                    resemblance to the female perfect insect. The body is Composed of twelve
                    segments, of which the central are the largest. The three first segments bear
                    each a pair of feet, and the caudal segments are slightly retractile within each
                    other; and when the insect walks, which it does very leisurely, it bends its
                    tail beneath it in such a way as to assist or support it in its progress. The
                    head is very small, and is also retractile, and is usually withdrawn whenever
                    the insect is alarmed or disturbed. These little creatures throve well in
                    captivity. They were kept on a piece of moist mossy turf, which was frequently
                    renewed; but whether they sustained themselves on the dewy herbage, or by means
                    of the minute animal substances which it contained, it was not for a time very
                    easy to discover. The curved and extended form of the little jaws would in the
                    first place induce one to suppose that they were carnivorous. Olivier, however,
                    observes, in his description of the larva of the glow-worm, “elle vie cependant
                    sur de la terre fraîche, avec de l’herbe et des feuilles des différentes
                    plantes; mais l’on a remarqué qu’elle devient foible et languissante, quand on
                    la laisse manquer de terre humide. Elle est très-pacifique, et paroit
                    craintive.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    the moisture which arises from it, certainly seems necessary to their welfare,
                    for we noticed that, when their turf became dry, and a slice of fresh apple or
                    potato was introduced, they immediately settled on it, and inserted their heads
                    as if drinking. We, however, soon after detected one with its jaws fixed in the
                    head of a minute snail, which it appeared to be devouring, its own head being
                    inserted into the aperture of the shell.</p>
                <p>This observation appeared the more interesting, in as far as it served to connect
                    those insects, by means of their habits, with that singular species the <hi
                    rend="italic">Drilus</hi><hi rend="italic">flavescens,</hi> which is known to
                    feed voraciously on the <hi rend="italic">Helix</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nemoralis,</hi> and the female of which was described by Mielzinski as the type
                    of a distinct genus, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Cochleoctonus.</hi>
                    This latter insect is parasitical on the body of the helix, in the shell of
                    which it dwells and undergoes its metamorphoses.</p>
                <p>While engaged in the observance of these glow-worms, we met with a notice, in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Annales</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi> by a French
                    gentleman of Rouen, on the same subject. In it we have ample proof of the
                    carnivorous propensities of the creatures in question. He placed a great number
                    of the larvae in a vessel with fresh earth, and supplied them with various kinds
                    of leaves. They soon however became extremely feeble, and remained so for
                    several weeks, when he happened to put a dead slug in their jar, of which the
                    young glow-worms were no sooner aware than they greedily seized upon it with
                    their arched and sharp-pointed mandibles. On the ensuing day they were found to
                    have eaten their way so far into the slug, that nothing but their tails was
                    visible. They were perceived however occasionally to quit their prey and walk
                    about upon the moist earth. The French naturalist was curious to observe how
                    they would proceed with a living snail, and he therefore introduced one into his
                    colony of insects. The animal soon began to crawl about its new domicile, but it
                    no sooner came upon the path of a glow-worm than it was seized by the latter
                    immediately beneath the mouth, and with such force and tenacity that it drew
                    itself suddenly into its shell, and of course dragged its enemy along with it.
                    The glow-worm however immediately disengaged its hold, and struggled back to the
                    mouth of the shell, on the back of which it soon mounted, thus keeping the snail
                    in a state of siege. Whenever it protruded even the point of its horns it was
                    instantly seized, bitten, and obliged to withdraw within its fortress. The larva
                    being soon joined by a companion, the two attacked the unfortunate snail, and
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747117?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7117-0143"/>
                    after a continued combat of several hours, they put it to death, and by next
                    morning it was not only slain, but eaten. These and similar experiments were
                    made from the month of November to the month of June, after which the larvae
                    were observed to undergo their transformations. They occupied about a week in
                    assuming the state of nymph—they continued in that state eight days longer— and
                    then appeared in the form of the perfect insect. When about to assume the nympha
                    state, the skin of the upper and anterior portion of the body cracks and opens,
                    or a lateral division takes place on either side, so as to separate the skin <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the upper from that of the under portion. By alternate
                    elongations and contractions they then work their way forwards, and contrive to
                    effect their liberation in a few minutes from their old attire. The nymph is
                    larger than the larva, though not quite so long. Its colour is at first pale
                    yellow, with two reddish spots on the posterior and lateral portion of each
                    segment of the abdomen, as well as on the posterior angles of the thorax. It
                    wants the large acute mandibles of the larva; its antenna? are very obvious, and
                    consist of eleven articulations. The tarsi are likewise distinctly composed each
                    of five articulations. The last rings of the abdomen are very brilliant,
                    especially when the insect is handled; and it was noted as remarkable that the
                    whole body partook, though with less intensity, of that phosphoric splendour
                    which in the perfect insect characterizes only the terminal segments of the
                    abdomen. Before the termination of the eight days which are passed in the nympha
                    state, all the more delicate colours had disappeared, and were finally converted
                    into those duller hues which distinguish the insect in its matured condition. As
                    soon as it has disengaged itself from the slough of the larva, it bends its body
                    into an arch or semicircle, and is then a genuine nymph, although it still
                    continues to move its head, and even its limbs and antennae. In this
                    intermediate condition its general form has undergone no great change, but the
                    head, feet, and antennae are considerably altered, and seem enlarged or swollen.
                    At first the body manifests a slow and heavy movement, which ere long ceases,
                    and the antennae and feet are then applied more closely to the sides of the
                    body. The only signs of life now consist in a movement of the abdomen, which is
                    bent into an arch, or occasionally moved from side to side. The body is shorter
                    than that of the larva, the head is bent beneath the first segment or thorax,
                    the antennae consist of numerous articulations, and the caudal segment of the
                    body, instead of being terminated by a couple of points, is now surrounded by
                    eight of those points, in the centre of which are two fleshy tubercles, placed
                    in a slight depression. Olivier had previously informed us that the nymph, after
                    quitting the skin of the larva, shone with a very lively and brilliant light of
                    a beautiful grcen colour, which became more splendid for a time when the vessel
                    which contained it was moved, and disappeared again, as if by some voluntary
                    action of the animal, even in the nympha state, in which the vital and
                    instinctive powers are usually almost m a state of suspension. According to
                    Dcgeer, the larva is also luminous. We did not however observe any manifestation
                    of that faculty in those in our keeping.</p>
                <p>It has been a frequent subject of inquiry to ascertain the purposes which the
                    light is intended to serve. In the perfect state the female continues wingless,
                    while the male has become <hi rend="italic">a</hi> swift-flying insect; and this
                    has led to the supposition that the lambent flame, which is always most
                    conspicuous in the female, is intended as a “nuptial lamp,” to guide the male to
                    her society. In this case, however, we do not so clearly see the use of it in
                    the larva and nympha states, unless, to be sure, as a preparatory process for
                    the formation of the animal phosphorus. Although many insects discover each
                    other merely by the sense of smell, the fact seems nearly certain that the male
                    or winged glow-worm ascertains his mate by aid of her luminous property; for it
                    is a well-known and successful entomological device to place a female in a
                    conspicuous position, and watch by her side, with a view to entrap the rarer or
                    less visible males, which ere long make their appearance. Olivier has frequently
                    caught the males by holding a female on the palm of his hand,—which makes it the
                    more singular that he did not perceive the two luminous points which the former
                    bears on the last segment of the abdomen,—“Je n’ai pas encore m’assurer, il est
                    vrai, si le mâle de notre espece commune a la propriété de luire.” We may add,
                    that the eggs are also beautifully luminous for some time after they are
                    laid.</p>
                <p>Dufour has examined the anatomical structure of the female glow-worm. The
                    alimentary canal measures about twice the length of the body. The oesophagus is
                    so short as to be nearly imperceptible. It dilates immediately into a short
                    crop. The chylific ventricle is separated from the crop by a valvular
                    contraction. It is long, smooth, that is, unprovided with papillae, but pursed
                    and cylindrical in its two anterior thirds, and intestiform in the remainder.
                    The small intestine is very short.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The matter from which the luminous property of the glow-worm results has been the
                    subject of frequent experiment and observation. It is obviously under the
                    control of the insect, which, when approached, may frequently be observed to
                    diminish or put out its light.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>On this curious subject, however, we beg to refer the reader
                    to the writings of Beckerheim <hi rend="italic">lAnn.</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Chimie,</hi> t. iv. p. 19), Cara-dori, and Treviranus, among foreign authors,
                    and to those of Mr Macartney <hi rend="italic">(Fĥil. Trans.</hi> 1810), and
                    Kirby and Spence (vol. ii.</p><p>P∙ 423), among ourselves.</p></note></p>
                <p>In the perfect female the luminous matter occupies chiefly the inferior part of
                    the three last annuli of the abdomen. These differ from the rest in colour, and
                    are usually of a yellow hue, especially on the under side. The light diffused is
                    more or less intense, according to circumstances. The insect lives for a
                    considerable time in a vacuum, and in various gases; but in nitrous acid,
                    muriatic and sulphurous gases, it soon expires. When placed in hydrogen gas it
                    has sometimes been observed to produce detonation. When the luminous portion of
                    the body of a glow-worm is cut off, the insect continues to live, and the
                    separated segments retain their phosphoric nature, and are luminous for some
                    time, whether placed in vacuum, exposed to the air, or submitted to the action
                    of different gases. By what means the living insect is able to shroud itself in
                    darkness, and then suddenly to clothe itself an it were in a mantle of radiant
                    light, is a subject beyond our power of investigation; but when dried the
                    phosphorescence seems to depend on a certain degree of softness or humidity; for
                    when apparently quite extinct, it may be reproduced by pressure, and the
                    application of a little moisture. In the living state, however, although
                    immersion in warm water produces a brilliant light, the application of cold
                    water tends to its speedy extinction.</p>
                <p>The next peculiarity in the history of the glow-worm consists in the change of
                    its habits in regard to food, which takes place on its attaining maturity. From
                    an insect of a predaceous nature, greedy of animal juices, it becomes entirely
                    herbivorous, not much addicted indeed to food of any kind, but still confining
                    itself, when it does indulge in eating, to the tender leaves of plants. It is
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747130?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7130-0144"/>
                    this circumstance which has no doubt led to so much contrariety of opinion on
                    the part of entomological writers regarding its natural disposition. Most
                    observers having attended to it chiefly after it had undergone its
                    transformations, tliev naturally, and so far correctly, concluded that it was a
                    herbivorous insect. Had they watched its progress from the egg they would have
                    comc to another conclusion, at least in regard to its earlier condition. This
                    alteration in the habits of these creatures is in fact by no means unexampled,
                    either among other genera of the same class, or among the more distantly related
                    ιep-tile tribes. The most familiar instance among the latter is the common frog,
                    which in the early state of tadpole is herbivorous, while under the perfect form
                    it preys on flics and other insects. In this case, to be sure, the order of
                    change is inverted, the alteration being from a herbivorous to a carnivorous
                    diet; while the contrary takes place in the glow-worm. But the analogy is more
                    strictly maintained in the case of those aquatic beetles which form the family
                    of <hi rend="italic">Helophoridae,</hi> which in the larva state are
                    carnivorous, but become herbivorous after assuming their final transformation.
                    The same, singularity is also illustrated by many dipterous flies, which, born
                    and bred amid the putrid moisture of animal remains, no sooner become winged
                    insects, than they seek a purer diet in the nectarous juices of fruits and
                    flowers.</p>
                <p>In relation to the glow-worm, the observation is of more practical interest,
                    because the appearance of the insect among our lawns and shrubberies is so
                    extremely ornamental during the summer nights, that many have tried to import it
                    to districts where it does not naturally occur. They have failed, in consequence
                    of endeavouring to rear the young on vegetable food. Moist herbage, or a supply
                    of damp earth, seems almost indispensable; but, in addition to these, their box
                    must contain some minute testacea, such as the young of the ordinary species of
                    the gcnus Helix. Perhaps the best plan is to hatch the eggs, and then place the
                    young at liberty under an old hedge as soon as they have begun to eat
                    freely.</p>
                <p>2&lt;7, Antennae decidedly remote at their base; head neither prolonged nor
                    narrowed anteriorly in the form of a snout; the eyes of ordinary size in both
                    sexes.</p>
                <p>In genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Drylus,</hi> Oliv. (Plate CCXX1H. figs. 8, 9, and
                    12), the males are winged, and the inner side of the antennae, from the fourth
                    joint, is prolonged like the tooth of a comb. Those of the female are shorter,
                    or somewhat perfoliaceous, and slightly serrated. The maxillary palpi in both
                    sexes are thicker towards the extremity, and terminate in a point. There is a
                    tooth on the internal side of the mandibles. The <hi rend="italic">I).</hi><hi

                    palpi are terminated by a securiform article, and the <hi rend="superscript">
                    j</hi> thorax offers no lateral emarginations. Their bodies are long, narrow,
                    depressed, and of a soft or somewhat flexible consistence. These insects abound
                    in meadows during the summer season, on umbelliferous and other plants. The
                    larvae are characterized by a flat scaly head, furnished with two strong teeth,
                    a pair of small antennae, and four palpi. Their bodies are flattish beneath,
                    divided into twelve rings resembling those of caterpillars, and covered by a
                    membranous skin, which is soft to the touch. The general colour of these larvae
                    is a deep velvety black, except the front of the head, which is shining. The
                    antennae, palpi, and feet are of a reddish or yellowish brown. They dwell in
                    moist earth. Olivier was of opinion that they fed on roots, but the laborious
                    and accurate Degeer asserts that they voraciously devour a great variety of
                    insect prey. That of <hi rend="italic">Telephorus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fuscus</hi> was observed to change into the nympha state towards the end of
                    May. It buried itself in the earth, but presented no appearance of cocoon. The
                    nympha was about six lines in length, with the body somewhat arched, and of a
                    pale-reddish white. The perfect insect was developed in the month of June. Even
                    in the last-named state, in which so many species are chiefly occupied in the
                    indulgence of other propensities, the Telephori, according to Degeer, continue
                    their accustomed appetite. He has observed a female drag a male to the ground,
                    turn him on his back, and suck out his entrails; so that, as among the spider
                    tribes, considerable caution is necessary on the part of an inexperienced suitor
                    while making his advances. Mr Curtis has frequently seen Telephori with other
                    insects in their mouths. He once observed <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lividus</hi> eating an ichneumon, and he took another of the same
                    species with an Empis in its mouth. <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fuscus</hi> is known to prey upon its own species. There are above thirty
                    different kinds of this genus in Britain. Dejean, under the Linnaean name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Canthams,</hi> enumerates 132 species. Whatever we know of the
                    anatomy of these creatures accords with their apparent dispositions. Dufour has
                    ascertained that their digestive canal is absolutely straight. Their biliary
                    vessels are four in number, in which character, as well as in that of their
                    generative system, they present a resemblance to the genus Lycus.</p>
                <p>One of the most remarkable incidents in the history of the Telephori is the
                    frequency with which, in some continental countries, the species are carried
                    into the air in great quantities by violent winds, and unexpectedly deposited in
                    distant regions,—thus giving rise to what are called <hi rend="italic">insect
                    showers.</hi> Sweden and Hungary have been most productive of such phenomena.
                    One of the most ornamental of the British species, and the only onc we shall
                    here describe, is <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">cyaneus</hi> of
                    Curtis. The head is black and shining, but rufous before the eyes; the thorax
                    and abdomen are likewise rufous, the elytra are deep blue, the legs black. This
                    insect is pretty widely, though sparingly, distributed over the southern and
                    central counties of Scotland, and the north of England. We have specimens from
                    the Edinburgh district, from Kinordy in Forfarshire, from Dollar in
                    Clackmannanshire, and from Dumfries and Roxburgh shires.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Silis</hi> of Megerle differs from the preceding
                    chiefly in having an emargination posteriorly on each side of the thorax. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Maltπinus</hi> of Lat. (Plate CCXXI∏∙ fig· 14) the palpi are
                    terminated by an ovoid joint; the head is narrow behind; and the elytra, in
                    several species, are shorter than the abdomen.</p>

                <p>Here we find the palpi generally short and filiform; the mandibles emarginated at
                    the point; the body usually narrow and elongated; the head only covered at base
                    by a flat or but slightly convex thorax, generally square, or elongated and
                    quadrilateral; the joints of the tarsi entire, and the terminal hooks
                    unidentatcd or bordered with a membrane. The antennae are usually serrated, and
                    even pectinated, in the males of several species. Most of these insects are of
                    active habits. They occur on the leaves and flowers of plants.</p>

                    retractile and dilatable vesicle under each anterior angle of the thorax, and on
                    each side of the base of the abdomen. Most of the species are adorned by
                    ornamental and contrasted colours. The habits of the larvae are but obscurely
                    known. Olivier presumes that many of them live in wood, because he has
                    frequently found the perfect insect in timber-yards, as if newly escaped from
                    the nympha state. This is an extensive genus, and may be regarded as
                    characteristic of temperate climes, although a few occur in Africa and the East
                    Indies. Mr Stephens enumerates seventeen British species. Comte Dejean’s
                    collection contains 104 in all. Among the Mclyridcs with filiform antennae, but
                    of which the thorax and abdomen are unfurnished with retractile vesicles,

                    linear. We have figured the male of <hi rend="italic">D. ater</hi> (Plate
                    CCXXIII. fig. 15). In <hi rend="smallcaps">Mely-ris</hi> properly so called
                    (Plate CCXXHI. fig. 16), the antennae are shorter than the head and thorax,
                    insensibly enlarged, but without forming a club, as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lygia.</hi> Their joints are also less dilated laterally', and are almost
                    isometrical. The thorax is less convex.</p>
                <p>In other Melyrides, such as <hi rend="smallcaps">Pelocophorus</hi> of Dej. the
                    maxillary palpi are terminated by a larger and securiform article, a character
                    which, with certain others, approximates them to the ensuing tribe. Dejean at

                <p>Distinguished by at least two of the palpi being projecting and clavate. The
                    mandibles are dentated. The penultimate joint of the tarsi is bilobate, the
                    first very short or but slightly visible in several. The antennae vary, being in
                    some nearly filiform and serrated, in others insensibly enlarged towards the
                    extremity. The body is usually cylindrical, the head and thorax narrower than
                    the abdomen, and the eyes emarginate. Most of these insects occur on flowers,
                    some of them on the trunks of trees or in dry timber. The larvae are regarded as
                    carnivorous.</p>

                    antennae is hardly longer than wide, and is composed of crowded joints; the

                    projecting lobe. The thorax is depressed anteriorly. The species, in the perfect
                    state, occur on flowers. Their larvae feed on those of certain bees. Dufour has
                    described their internal structure. The crop is so short as to be almost
                    entirely contained within the head. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Ne-crobia,</hi><note

                    triangular joint of the same size; the second and third joints of the antennae
                    are almost equal, and the terminal club is elongated, and with looser articles.
                    These insects occur chiefly in spring. They are said to live on carrion, and are
                    richly adorned for such foul feeders. Deep blue is their prevailing colour.
                    There are four species in Britain, of which we have as yet found only two in
                    Scotland, viz. <hi rend="italic">N. τuficol-lis,</hi> of a greenish blue, the
                    thorax, base of the elytra, and legs rufous,—A <hi rend="superscript"> r</hi>.
                    <hi rend="italic">vwlacea,</hi> of a bright blue, shining yet pubescent, the
                    antennae and legs black. If the geographical notices which we have collected of
                    the former species be correct, its distribution must be very extensive. It seems
                    to occur both in Africa and the East Indies,—a wide circuit for an insect which
                    we have taken behind the glass-works at Leith. “Insectum mihi carissimum,” says
                    Latreille, “illis enim infelicissimis temporibus quibus calamitatum omnium

                <p>This tribe, consisting of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ptinus</hi> ofLinnseus,
                    and of some others nearly allied, possesses a body of a tolerably firm
                    consistence, in some cases almost ovoid or oval, and at others nearly
                    cylindrical, but generally short, and rounded at cither end. The head is nearly
                    globular or orbicular, and is received almost entirely into a strongly arched or
                    rounded thorax, resembling a hood. The antennae of some are filiform, or
                    diminished towards the termination, and are simple, flabelliform, pectinated, or
                    serrated; of others they are terminated suddenly by three larger and longer
                    joints. The mandibles are short, thick, and dentated beneath the point. The
                    palpi are very short, and terminated by a larger article, almost ovoid, or like
                    a reversed triangle. The tibiae are not dentated, and the spurs at the
                    extremities are very small. These insects are all of small size, exhibit little
                    variety in their colouring, which is usually dark or sombre, and when touched
                    they counterfeit death. Their motions are slow, and such as are winged seldom
                    take to flight. In the larva state they are extremely destructive in
                    museums.</p>

                    insects of the last-named genus by Geoffroy, was transferred by Linnaeus to a

                    common with most of their congeners, by their frequent simulation of death, and
                    their re-assumption of activity as soon as the threatened danger is removed. In
                    this instinctive mode of preservation Olivier aeeuses them of exhibiting an
                    invincible obstinacy. “Ils se laissent entièrement bruler sans donner aucun
                    signe de vie.” The larvae of these inseets are extremely injurious to old
                    furniture, in which they perforate numerous round holes. Hence the genus is
                    named vrillette by the French, from <hi rend="italic">vrille,</hi> a gimlet. In
                    the larva state they resemble small, white, soft worms, with six short minute
                    fcct. The head is sealy, and is terminated by two maxillae in the form of strong
                    cutting pincers, with which they gnaw the wood into the finest sawdust. When
                    about to change into the nympha state, they line the bottom of their little
                    eells with a few silken threads. Other species feed on flour, bread,
                    sealing-wafers, &amp;e. where they form grooves or galleries, according to the
                    thickness of their working materials. The superstitious fancy of the <hi
                    rend="italic">death-watch</hi> has arisen partly from an insect of this genus,
                    the <hi rend="italic">An. tesse~ latum.</hi> It is supposed, however, to share

                    >pulsatorium of</hi> Linnaeus, and probably with several others. According to Dr
                    Shaw, it is in the advanced state of spring that the former of these insects
                    commences its mysterious pulsations, which, he asserts, is nothing more than the
                    signal-eall of the sexes. The number of distinct strokes is generally from seven
                    to eleven, and these are occasioned merely by its beating with its head with
                    considerable force and quickness against the plane of its position.'· Where the
                    insects are numerous, as is not unfrequently the case in old bouses, these
                    sounds may be beard during the whole day, especially in warm weather. The sound
                    greatly resembles a moderate tapping on a table with the finger nail, and indeed
                    by that simple process they may be induced to beat in reply wļjen not otherwise
                    inclined so to do. “He that could eradicate this error,” says the quaint Sir
                    Thomas Brown, in allusion to the death-tick, “from the minds of the people,
                    would save from many a cold sweat the meticulous heads of nurses and

                <p>In this family, as in the preceding, we find four palpi, and elytra covering the
                    upper surface of the abdomen, or its greater portion; but the antennae are
                    almost always thicker at the extremity, which frequently forms even a
                    perfoliaeeous or a solid club; they are longer than the maxillary palpi, and
                    their base is exposed or scarcely covered. The legs are not fitted for swimming,
                    and the joints of the tarsi, at least of the posterior ones, are usually entire.
                    In the larva state they feed on animal matter. Latreille divides the tribe into
                    two sections.</p>

                    The terminal joints of the tarsi, as well as its hooks, of moderate length, or

                    first two joints are longer than those thatsfollow. The head is distinguished
                    from the thorax by an ovoid strangulation. The maxillary palpi project, and are
                    long and inflated at the extremity. The abdomen is large, oval or ovoid, and
                    laterally embraced by the elytra. The legs are elongated, the thighs clavate,
                    the joints of the tarsi entire. These insects are found on the ground beneath
                    stones and other substances. They form a single genus, divided by some writers
                    into <hi rend="smallcaps">Mastigus</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>This tribe is composed of the great genus <hi rend="italic">Hister</hi> of
                    Linnaeus. The four posterior legs are more widely separated from each other
                    at.their origin than the anterior pair. The legs are contractile, and the
                    exterior tibiae dentated or spinous. The antennae arc always bent or <hi
                    rend="italic">elbowed</hi> (geniculate), and terminated in a solid mass, or
                    composed of close-set articulations. The body is of a very solid consistence,
                    and the elytra so hard that even the pin of the entomologist is with difficulty
                    made to enter, and the praesternum is often dilated in front, and the elytra
                    truncated. The mandibles are strong, and not unfrequently unequal as to size.
                    The palpi are almost filiform, or slightly enlarged at their extremity, and
                    terminated by an oval or ovoid article.. In respect to their habits, the
                    dentation of their tibiae, and some other circumstances, these insects seem to

                    which immediately succeeds it exhibits throughout its parietes some brownish
                    lines, which seem to indicate the existence of interior appendages proper for
                    trituration; and if so, such enlargement may be regarded as the gizzard. The
                    chylific ventricle is very long, twisted on itself, and beset with pointed and
                    projecting papillae. The hepatic vessels have six distinct insertions around the

                <p>These insects feed on putrid and stercoraceous substances, decaying vegetables,
                    &amp;c. and some dwell beneath the bark of trees. Their movements are slow,

                    are known to naturalists affect the same food as the perfect insect. Their form,
                    however, is different, being almost linear, depressed, smooth, soft, and of a

                    skin is scaly and of a brown or reddish colour. These larvae have six short
                    legs, and are terminated by a pair of articulated appendages, and an anal
                    prolongation or tube. The scaly shield of the first segment is longitudinally
                    channelled.</p>

                    frequently dilated in the males, and the exterior margin of the elytra of the
                    greater number is marked by a groove with an obvious border. This tribe is

                    (Plate CCXXHI. fig. 21), the antennae, scarcely longer than the head, terminate
                    abruptly in an almost globular club of four joints, the first of which is long,
                    and the second much shorter than the third. The body forms nearly' a
                    parallelopiped; the thorax is widest anteriorly; all the tibiae are strong,
                    widened at the extremity, and terminated by strong spurs; the elytra are
                    truncated at right angles. The maxillae are destitute of a corneous claw.</p>
                <p>This important and well-marked genus was first defined by Fabricius. Linnaeus had
                    placed the species of which it is composed with the Silphae, while Scopoli and
                    Geoffroy combined them with the genus Dermestes. The most marked peculiarity in
                    their manners consists in their habit of interring small animals, such as mice
                    and moles, for the purpose of depositing their eggs in their decaying carcass.
                    To effect this operation, they remove the earth from beneath the dead body,
                    which sinks into the’hollow, and is afterwards covered with the looser soil of
                    the excavation. Their sense'of smell, like that of many other insects, is
                    extremely delicate, and no sooner has any of the smaller quadrupeds perished,
                    than one or more of these grave-diggers make their appearance, and in a few
                    hours the corpse is interred. The larvae are of a lengthened form, of a
                    greyish-white colour, with a brown head. Their bodies are composed of twelve
                    rings, furnished on their anterior and superior portion with a small scaly plate
                    or shield, of a ferruginous brown colour; the shields of the last segments are
                    provided with small elevated points. The head is hard, scaly, and furnished with
                    strong cutting mandibles. The feet are six in number, very short, and attached
                    to the first three segments of the body. When these larvae have attained to
                    their final term of increase, they descend, it is said, fully a foot beneath the
                    surface, and, forming an oval chamber, the walls of which are strengthened by a

                    caterpillars.</p>
                <p>The genus was originally of great extent, but has been much modified and
                    circumscribed by Fabricius, Dejean, Latreille, Leach, and others. The species
                    which it now contains resemble their congeners in being of an essentially
                    carnivorous nature—preferring animal substances in a state of putrescence to
                    fresher food. They exhale a disagreeable odour, and, when seized, a thick and
                    dark coloured liquid exudes from their bodies. The larvae resemble the perfect
                    insects in their habits. They consist of twelve segments, of which the sides are
                    terminated by sharp angles, the terminal segment being furnished with two
                    conical appendages; the head is small, and bears a pair of tri-articulatc
                    filiform antennae, and two strong maxillae. Like the preceding genus, they
                    undergo their metamorphoses under ground. The species are pretty extensively
                    distributed over the earth, and are rather numerous. Dejean enumerates
                    thirty-four species in his Catalogue, which, however, includes under the generic
                    name of Silpha the genera <hi rend="italic">Oiceoptoma</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Phosphuga</hi> of Dr Leach. Of the restricted genus we have not
                    more than eight British species. Most of these are deep black or dark brown. One
                    of the most ornamental is »S', <hi rend="italic">quadri-punctαtα</hi> (Plate

                    since been brought to us from Loch Tay by Dr Greville. It is more frequent in
                    England, where it frequents oak woods for the purpose of preying on
                    lepidopterous larvae.</p>

                    and received posteriorly into a trapezoidal thorax, slightly bordered, broadest
                    behind. The antennae are generally as long at least as the head and thorax, and
                    are terminated by an elongated mass of five articles. The terminal joint of the
                    palpi is conical. The legs are slender and elongated. With the exception of the

                    beneath, where they form but a slight projection,— in others the penultimate is
                    extremely small, in the form of a knot, inclosed within the lobes of the
                    preceding. The club of the antennae is always perfoliate, of three or two
                    joints, and is usually short or but slightly elongated. The palpi Áire short and
                    filiform, or somewhat thickest at the extremity. The elytra in several are short
                    or truncated. The legs are but slightly elongated, and their tibiae frequently
                    widened at the end; the tarsi are furnished with hairs or pellets. These insects
                    are of various habits, according to the species. They occur on flowers, in
                    mushrooms, beneath the bark of trees, and even on putrid meat. This tribe is

                    larvae of these insects have been studied by M. Wadouer. Their heads are large,
                    their bodies narrow and elongated, with the two terminal segments more extended

                    rarely exercise that faculty. When handled or even approached, they apply their
                    legs and antennae şo close to the body as to exhibit the appearance of a little
                    ball, and in that state they simulate death with great perseverance. Of eight or

                <p>FAMILY V—PALPICORNF.S.</p>
                <p>In this family, as in the preceding, the antennae are terminated by a kind of
                    club, usually perfoliate, but composed at most of only nine articulations, and
                    inserted beneath the advanced and lateral margins of the head, and scarcely

                    last-named organs. The mentum is large and buckler-shaped. The body in this
                    family is generally ovoid or hemispherical, and arched or convex. The feet in
                    most of the genera are formed for swimming, and these present either four
                    articulations to the tarsi, or five, of which the first is much shorter than the

                    Maxillae entirely corneous. Of this tribe (genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hydrophilus</hi> of Geoffroy) Linnaeus formed only a division of his genus
                    Dytiscus. Their anatomical structure however differs in many important
                    particulars from that of the true Dytisci. The digestive canal, which is four or
                    five times as long as the body, presents a strong analogy, both in its length
                    and texture, to that of the La- ∣ mellicornes, and differs from that of the
                    Carnivora excepti as regards the biliary vessels. We perceive neither the
                    swimming bladder nor the excrementitial apparatus, such as these exist among the
                    Hydrocanthari. In the females only, the latter is replaced by secreting organs
                    fitted for the formation of a cocoon to contain the eggs. The sexual organs of
                    the male bear a great resemblance to those of the preceding family. These and
                    other considerations have induced M. Latreille to place them here. The species
                    are more convex in their general forms than the Dytiscidae, and their antennae
                    are dissimilar; but in many of their instincts and habits of life, and in their
                    general transformations, they bear a resemblance to that group. The largest

                    metallic colouring with which the vegetable-eating kinds are frequently
                    adorned.</p>
                <p>The antennae, inserted in a deep groove beneath the lateral margin of the head,
                    are always short, and composed generally of nine or ten articulations; they are
                    always terminated in a club or mass, which usually consists of three joints,
                    expanded in the form of thinnish plates or leaves, disposed in various
                    ways,—like the spokes of a fan, the leaves of a book, the teeth of á comb, or a
                    series of funnels placed above and within each other. The body is generally
                    ovoid or oval, and thick. The exterior edge of the two anterior tibiae are
                    toothed, and the articles of the tarsi, with the exception of certain males, are
                    entire, and without brush or pellet beneath. The anterior extremity of the head
                    is advanced and dilated in the form of a clypeus or epistoma. The mentum is
                    usually large, covering the ligula, or incorporated with it, and bearing the
                    palpi. The mandibles of many are membranous, a character scarcely if at all to
                    be observed in any other Coleoptera. The males are frequently very different
                    from the females, being distinguished by horn-like elevations on the head and
                    thorax, and by the greater size of the mandibles. Linnaeus indeed founded the
                    sections of bis great genus Scarabaeus in accordance with these peculiar
                    projections, while Scopoli assumed the spines or teeth of the fore-legs as the
                    distinguishing characteristic of his subdivisions. The latter author likewise
                    proposed two other methods, one of which regards the number of articulations in
                    the clava of the antennae, and the other takes into consideration the varying
                    manners of the insects themselves. The former of these is extremely defective,
                    the second is chicfly deserving of consideration as exhibiting the first attempt
                    ever made towards a natural arrangement of these insects. They are divided into

                <p>Degeer was the first to avail himself of the improvements indicated by Scopoli,
                    while at the same time he avoided his principal imperfections. He arranged the
                    Scarabaei into three families, as follows: lsí, <hi rend="italic">Scarabées de
                    terre;</hi> 2√, <hi rend="italic">Scarabées des arbres;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >3d,</hi><hi rend="italic">Scarabées des fleurs.</hi> Oryctcs and Trox were no
                    longer regarded as phyllophagous insects.</p>
                <p>Geoffroy separated from Scarabaeus of Linnaeus the ex-scutellated species under
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">Copris,</hi> and Scopoli’s genus Lucanus under the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">Platycerus.</hi> The institution of the genus Copris
                    was certainly an improvement, although it was founded on such defective
                    characters, that coprophagous nsects, such as the family Geo-trupini of
                    Latreille, were included in the same genus with Cetoriia, from which they might
                    have been perceived to be distinct so soon as the necessity was admitted of
                    carrying the investigation among the <hi rend="italic">Lamellicornes</hi>
                    somewhat beyond that first affinity—the form of the antennae.</p>
                <p>At a still later period Fabricius further improved upon the heterogeneous
                    composition of Geoffroy’s genus Scarabaeus, by taking from it the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Trox, AIeloloηtlιa, Ce-toniα,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Trichius.</hi> But the re-union of Geoffroy’s genus Copris with Scarabaeus was
                    a retrograde step which the entomologist of Keil afterwards corrected in a
                    supplementary work. The connection, however, between the insects afterwards
                    named <hi rend="italic">Geotrupes</hi> by Latreille and the genus Copris of
                    Geoffroy, was so far re-established by the formation of the Fabrician genus
                    Scarabaeus.</p>
                <p>Olivier adopted the genus Scarabaeus of Fabricius, with all his other genera
                    except Trichius, and divided it into <pb break="no"

                <p>This important family, in the system of Latreille, seems to include all those
                    insects classed by Linnaeus in the old genera <hi rend="italic">Scaraboeus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Lucanus.</hi> The lamellicorn tribes, indeed, include a
                    very numerous assemblage, many of which, especially such as feed on flowers and
                    living vegetation (called <hi rend="italic">Thalerophaga</hi> by Macleay), arc
                    remarkable alike for beauty of form and splendour of colour. Most of those,
                    however, which feed on decomposed vegetables, or excrementitious substances, are
                    usually of a more uniform black or brownish hue. But even the coprophagous kinds
                    sometimes surprise us by their beauty, and present a singular contrast when
                    disentangled from their repulsive habitations. They are all winged insects,
                    although for the most part rather dull and heavy in their movements.</p>
                <p>The larvae are long, semi-cylindrical, soft, of a whitish colour, and divided
                    into twelve rings or segments. The head, of a harder consistence, is armed with
                    strong mandibles. The feet are six in number, and squamous or of a scaly
                    texture. On each side of the body there are nine stigιnatic openings. The
                    posterior extremity is the most bulky; it is rounded and almost always curved
                    inwards, in such a manner as to prevent the larva from extending itself in a
                    straight line. Its motions are consequently slow and awkward, and when crawling
                    on the surface it frequently rolls over or falls on one side. The nympha or
                    intermediate state is in some instances not assumed till after the lapse of
                    several years. Immediately preceding the assumption of that state the larva
                    protects itself by means of a cocoon of an oval form, composed of earth and the
                    gnawed fragments of other materials, agglutinated by a viscous secretion which
                    exudes from its body. These larvae seek their food in the dung of cattle, in tan
                    pits, in gardens where rich vegetable mould occurs, and among the roots of
                    plants. In regard to their interior structure, it has been observed that the
                    nervous system, when studied in the different stages of life, presents a
                    considerable dissimilarity. The ganglions are less numerous, and approximate
                    more to each other, when the insect has reached the term of its final
                    transformation; and the two posterior ganglia throw out numerous filaments
                    disposed in a somewhat radiated form. In the larva the trachea is elastic, but
                    simply tubular in the perfect insect. The structure of the eye in most of the
                    lamellicorn beetles exhibits characters analogous to those of the Tenebrionites,
                    the Blattae, and other lucifugous or light-shunning species.</p>
                <p>The alimentary canal is of great length, especially among the coprophagous kinds;
                    and the chylific ventricle is beset with papillae, which, according to the
                    investigations of Μ. Dufour, serve as the receptacles of the alimentary fluids.
                    The biliary vessels resemble those of the carnivorous Coleoptera in number and
                    position, but they difłer in being oí greater length and much more slender.
                    Latreille divides this important family into two tribes.</p>

                <p>These correspond to the unrestricted genus <hi rend="italic">Scaraboeus</hi> of
                    Linn. Their antennae are terminated by a foliaceous club, generally capable of
                    being alternately closed or expanded; or are composed of joints that fit into
                    each other, either in the form of a reversed cone, or nearly globular. The
                    mandibles are of identical form, or nearly so, in both sexes; but the head and
                    thorax of the males frequently exhibit projections or peculiar forms. The
                    antennae in the latter sex are frequently more fully developed than in the
                    females. The alimentary tube in these insects is generally much longer than that
                    of the following tribe, and the oesophagus is proportionally shorter. But it is
                    chiefly by the genital system of the males that the Scarabaeides are
                    distinguished, not only from the tribe with which they are conjoined, but from
                    all other pentamerous Coleoptera. The larvae have a cylindrical stomach
                    surrounded by three ranges of small caeca, the small intestine very short, the
                    colon extremely thick and turgid, and the rectum of moderate size. A prodigious
                    accession of fine typical forms has been received of late years by this division
                    of Entomology, far beyond what we are able to indicate in this work.<note

                <p>In some of these the antennae are formed of nine, in others of only eight
                    articulations; the three terminal ones forming the club. The labruin and
                    mandibles are membranous and concealed. The terminal lobe of the maxillae is
                    also of the same consistence, broad and arcuated al the upper margin, and curved
                    inwards. The terminal-article of the maxillary palpi is always the largest of
                    all, nearly oval or almost cylindrical; but that of the labial palpi is almost
                    always more slender than the preceding, or very small. Behind each of these
                    latter palpi is a membranous projection, in the form of a ligula. The mentum is
                    emarginate. The sternum presents no particular projections, and the hooks of the
                    tarsi are always simple. The anterior tarsi are frequently wanting incertain
                    species, either naturally or because they are deciduous. The extent of the
                    alimentary canal is always very great, occasionally (as in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Copτis</hi><hi rend="italic">lunaris)</hi> even ten or twelve times the length
                    of the body. The chylific ventricle occupies the greater portion; it is beset
                    with papillae, conoid or in the form of nails, folded on itself, and maintained
                    in that state of agglomeration by numerous tracheal bridles. The intestine is
                    filiform, but terminates in an enlargement. “Les testicules des coprophages

                    in Egypt, where it formed an object of superstitious worship, but over a great
                    portion of the south of Europe. It is also found in the western regions of Asia.
                    Another species, discovered in Sennaár by Μ. Caillaud, was, how-over, according

                    the tarsi is as long, if not longer, than all the preceding ones taken together.
                    The first article of the labial palpi is dilated internally and almost

                    or dilated, and present two spurs or spines. The epistoma in many has only four
                    or two teeth. The first article of the labial palpi is always larger than the
                    following, and dilated on the internal side. The third and last article is
                    distinct. We shall here name only the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Sisyphus,</hi>
                    which differs from the others in having only eight joints in the antennae. The
                    form of the abdomen is triangular, and the intermediate and hind legs are long
                    and narrow, with the thighs clubbed.</p>
                <p>In all the ensuing Coprophagi the intermediate and hind tibiae are always dilated
                    at their extremity, and almost in the form of a lengthened triangle; the
                    intermediate pair terminate, like those of the preceding, in two strong spines;
                    but the head or thorax, or both these parts, of the males, are distinguished by
                    horns or marked projections. In several the last three articulations of the
                    antennae are semi-cupular, and concentrically fitted into each other. These

                    semi-orbicular or nearly orbicular, but strongly emarginate or truncated in
                    front. The head, and frequently the thorax also, is horned in the males. The
                    scutellum is not apparent. Of this genus we have eight or ten species in
                    Britain. Dejean’s Catalogue contains 150. Some beautiful species of small size
                    occur in Africa and the East Indies. They are likewise met with in New Holland,
                    where they constitute the principal portion of the coprophagous beetles, which
                    seem rare in that vast region, a circumstance attributed by Mr Maclcay to the
                    absence of all large herbivorous mammalia, except of the marsupial kind.</p>

                    terminal article is in the form of a reversed cupula. The thorax is large, and
                    usually exhibits two depressions near the middle of its posterior margin. In <hi

                    the largest of all; and the scutellum, though small and sunken, is yet visible.
                    The anterior legs are generally long, slender, and curved in the males, and the
                    tarsi are often absent. The thorax, with a few exceptions, is without horns. In
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Phanaeus</hi> of Macleay (Copris, Onitis, Fab.), Plate
                    CCXX1V. fig. 4, the first article of the labial palpi is the largest, and
                    dilated on the inner side. A simple sutural void indicates the place of the
                    scutellum. This genus is composed of large and beautiful species, chiefly from
                    the equinoctial regions of the new world. The males differ greatly from the
                    females in regard to the hornlike processes which frequently characterize the
                    head and thorax of the former; but the respective length of the legs docs not

                    the contour of the abdomen, to which they form as it were an arched covering,—a
                    character by which they approach the ensuing section. They are, however, closely
                    related, by the structure of their legs and antennae, to the preceding genera;
                    although the sexual differences are less pronounced or apparent, and frequently
                    consist merely in small tubercles instead of horns. All the species are of small
                    size, and some of them are among the most frequent of the British Lamellicornes.
                    1hey constitute the family <hi rend="italic">Apliodiidae</hi> of the English
                    entomologists. These insects are extensively distributed over the whole of the
                    north temperate zone; and Mr Macleay has made out the proportion of tropical
                    species to be to those from countries beyond the tropics as one to eight.
                    According to the same authority, none have hitherto been brought from New
                    Holland, although several occur at the Cape of Good Hope, which is nearly of the
                    same south latitude. It is probable, however, that if the marine detritus of New

                    but they fly with facility; and their appearance is interesting, as denoting the
                    “ethereal mildness” of returning spring. They are common in cow pastures. We

                <p>The groups of this section have one character in common with the two genera last
                    mentioned, that the elytra entirely cover the posterior extremity of the
                    abdomen; but their other features are distinctive. The labrum is coriaceous, and
                    generally projects beyond the epistoma. The mandibles are corneous, and usually
                    curved and salient. The terminal lobe of the maxillae is straight, and not
                    curved inwards. The third and last article of the labial palpi is always very
                    distinct, and always at least as long as the preceding. With few exceptions, the
                    antennae consist of from ten to eleven articulations. Like the preceding
                    insects, however, these also live in dung, beneath which they dig holes in the
                    earth. Their principal period of flight is during the evening, after sunset.
                    When touched they counterfeit death.</p>

                <p>In this subdivision the labium is terminated by two lobes or projecting ligulae;
                    the mandibles are generally salient and curved; the labrum is exposed in whole
                    or in part; the antennae, in the greater number, are composed of eleven
                    articulations. The bodj is black or reddish, with the elytra smooth or simplĵ
                    striated. The males are generally distinguished from the females by horn-like
                    projections and other external characters. They affect more especially
                    excrementitial substances.</p>

                    although the computation varies according to the view which may be adopted of

                    >Lethrus,</hi> Scopoli, is distinguished from all the others by the form of the
                    antennal club, like a reversed cone, and composed of leaflets contorted into a
                    kind of funnel, and fit· ted concentrically into each other; and by the

                    off with its mandibles. It is hence called <hi rend="italic">Schneider</hi> in

                    (there are only two or three others known) lives in holes in the earth, and
                    fierce battles take place during the nuptial season between the males when
                    aspiring to the favour of the gentler sex. The antennal club of the remaining
                    Arenicoli is composed of ordinary-shaped leaflets, placed one on another like

                    a transverse square, entire, or simply dentated. The mandibles are curved,
                    greatly compressed, dentated at the extremity, and frequently sinuated on the
                    inner side. The species are pretty numerous, and occur both in Europe and

                    devices made use of by insects to deceive their enemies. While the Byrrhidae,

                    so as to give themselves the appearance of a little ball Of inert matter in no

                    opposite line of conduct, and sticks out its legs at full length, where it holds
                    them perfectly still and rigid, so as to produce the same appearance as if it
                    had been long deprived of life. It is thus supposed to deceive the cunning rook

                    mentum. The labrum and mandibles are but little exposed, and the latter şre
                    thick. The palpi arc short, ţhc mentum very hairy. The inner side of the
                    maxillae is armed with teeth. The body, of a cinereous or earthy hue, is rough
                    or tuberculatcđ on the upper surface. The head is inclined, and terminates in an
                    angle or point. The thorax is short, transversal, without lateral borders,
                    sinuated posteriorly, with the anterior angles advanced. The abdomen is large,’
                    arched, and covered with very hard elytra. The an-^ terior legs are advanced,
                    and their thighs cover as it were the lower surface of the head.</p>

                    generally occur on sandy soils, and are supposed by Latreille to feed on the
                    roots of plants. We suspect that our knowledge is still extremely vague
                    regarding their habits of life and modes of transformation. It is certain that
                    they are attracted by dried bones and other cadaverous remains, but it is
                    difficult to determine whether this is owing to the peculiar colour, or the
                    nature of the animal substance. Pallas observes, “sub cadaveribus aestivo ardore
                    exsiccatis cum Histeribus et Der-mcstibus hospitatur;” but it by no means
                    follows from that peculiarity of position that the insect partakes of the
                    carcass, any more than that numerous other species which seek the secure
                    covering of a rock or mass of stone, are in the habit of devouring these
                    inorganic matters. We may further remark that the Troges are the only
                    petalocerous insects among which we find an apterous species,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic">horridus</hi> being destitute of wings.
                    It forms the genus <hi rend="italic">Phoberus</hi> of Macleay, and is worthy of
                    consideration as probably destined, when its habits are better known, to throw
                    some light, either by agreement or opposition, on the history of its congeners,
                    and the value of the groups into which they have been divided. These in general
                    are supposed to delight in cadaverous substances: all insects intended to live
                    on animal matter, partially distributed and collected in masses, arc provided
                    with wings, which convey them rapidly (with the joint guidance of the sense of
                    smell), to those decaying objects which they instinctively desire; but the
                    species above named being destitute of wings, a doubt naturally arises as to the
                    probability of its feeding, like its congeners, on dried cadaverous matter. It
                    has been stated as an illustration of this point, that the genera <hi

                    formation supposed to accord with the fact that the particles of which their
                    food is composed are so universally spread over these arid plains as to obviate
                    the necessity of any rapid or extended change of place.<note anchored="true"

                    form a foliated mass,—the central leaflet being never entirely concealed or
                    inclosed by the others. The labrum is not projecting, and only its anterior part
                    is exposed. The mandibles are entirely corneous, and laterally project beyond
                    the head. The maxillae are corneous, or of a solid texture, straight, and
                    usually toothed. The ligula is covered by an ovoid or triangular mentum, nar-.
                    rowed and truncated at the extremity, where the angles are frequently dilated.

                    >Scarabaeus</hi> appears to have been either applied by the Romans to
                    coleopterous insects in general, or at least to have been used with a wide and
                    indefinite generic application. The origin of the word is bv no means clear, and
                    its derivation from <hi rend="italic">rχ,ζπτω,</hi> as given by Fabricius and
                    Olivier, has been regarded as inconsistent with the rules of etymology. Mr
                    Macleay thinks it difficult to obtain the word at all from the Greek, and
                    regards it it rather as being of Etruscan origin, the more especially as it

                    side of their mandibles sinuous or dentated. These insects occur chiefly in the
                    equatorial regions, both of the old world and the new. They are scarcely known
                    in Europe, and do not exist in Britain. N. <hi rend="italic">punctatus</hi> is

                    The larvae probably dwell in the decaying portions of great timber trees, and no
                    doubt hasten the death and overthrow of these sylvan monarchs. We could dilate
                    with pleasure on the singular aspect of these gigantic Coleoptera, did not the
                    nature of our general plan, and our desire to notice, however briefly, most of
                    the principal genera, preclude our entering into the descriptive details of
                    species. We must therefore rest satisfied with a general reference to the works
                    of Olivier, Fabricius, Latreille, Macleay, and&lt; the Catalogue of Dejean, part

                    This arises partly from iignorance, and partly from the (nearly allied) source

                    dimension affects us with such different ideas in relation to different objects.
                    Many may smile at our using the expression “gigantic” or “magnificent” to
                    creatures the largest of which (of the Coleopterous kinds, e. g. <hi
                    rend="italic">Prionus gigas)</hi> scarcely exceeds six inches in length ;—yet
                    true it is, that to an entomologist accustomed only to the European forms of
                    insect life, the first sight of any of the greater Prionidae, or of <hi

                    which an enlightened artist may be supposed to experience on first beholding the
                    perfect proportions of some great temple. Our ideas are perhaps equally relative
                    in all departments both of art and nature. An Egyptian pyramid is thought <hi

                    with the greatest of the Coptic monuments) is almost nameless as a Scottish
                    mountain. An eagle, from his size and strength, is called a “feathered king,”
                    although his body is less than that of a pig a few months old. A mastiff or
                    Newfoundland dog, being among the largest of the canine kind, is called
                    “majestic,” although a sucking elephant might squeeze both of them to death by
                    an accidental stumble,-—the said elephant being at the same time regarded as a
                    “poor creature,” because it is not a full grown example of the “wisest of
                    beasts.” An ancient walrus, floating among the hoary icebergs of the arctic
                    seas, is looked upon as one of the most ponderous of created things; yet a
                    Greenland seaman considers as insignificant, and will scarcely throw his harpoon
                    into the sides of a young whale, which with one blow of its upraised tail could
                    lash the ocean into foam, sink a “captain’s gig,” and send the walrus with a
                    fractured skull to the bottom of the sea. The same principle is capable of
                    illustration, by the practice of the more enthusiastic disciples of Isaac
                    Walton. Even the most experienced of anglers gazes with delight, almost with
                    wonder, at a river trout of three or four pounds weight. A grilse of the same
                    dimensions, when made to·“spurn the indignant shore,” is viewed by the salmon
                    fisher almost with a feeling of disappointment. We remember our friend Sir

                    and yet the same skilful angler was greatly astonished by a Loch Awe trout,
                    which, though a giant of its kind, was, when brought to the balance, found

                    same time nearly allied to the Melolonthae, and particularly the Cetoniae, of
                    which they bear the external aspect, although their masticating organs differ.
                    Fabricius and Olivier, in fact, arranged most of these insects with each other.
                    The body of the kinds now under consideration is shorter, more rounded, and
                    smoother than that of the preceding. They moreover differ in being frequently
                    ornamented with brilliant colours.</p>

                    anteriorly marked by a small groove or gutter; the legs slender, and the hooks

                    Macleay (Plate CCXXIV. fig. 26), differs from the preceding in the proportions
                    of the mentum, which is obviously longer than broad; in the short and rounded
                    form of the body; in the length of the scutellum, which at least equals a third
                    of that of the elytra; and in the length of the sternal point, the extremity of
                    which attains to the origin of the two anterior legs, or extends beyond it. The
                    mandibles are almost triangular, with the extremity pointed or emarginate. The
                    maxillae are furnished with several teeth. One of the hooks of the tarsi, at

                <p>This section, as well as the ensuing, is formed from the great genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Melolontha</hi> of Fabricius, of which certain species are
                    scattered also among the preceding groups. The Phyllophagi are nearly related to
                    the concluding genera of the third section. Their mandibles, however, are
                    covered above by the epistoma, and concealed beneath by the maxillae,—their
                    exterior side being alone exposed, but without cither protruding or presenting
                    the sinuosities or dentations observed in the Rutelae and other analogous
                    genera. The anterior edge of the labrum is exposed, and is sometimes of the form
                    of a broad reversed triangle, sometimes (and more frequently) of a transverse
                    lamina, emarginate in the centre. The number of the articulations of the
                    antennae is by no means uniform, and varies from eight to ten. The same
                    observation applies to those of the club, which in several differs even in the
                    sexes of the same species. The ligula is entirely covered by the mentum, or
                    incorporated with its anterior face, and the elytra meet completely along the
                    whole of the dorsal suture,—characters which distinguish our present species
                    from those of the fifth or ensuing section.</p>
                <p>*</p>
                <p>The family of <hi rend="smallcaps">Anaplognathides</hi> of Mr Macleay, and some
                    other genera nearly allied to the preceding, form the first subdivision
                    according to Μ. Latreille’s views. The epistoma is thickened anteriorly, and
                    forms, either alone or with the labrum, a vertical facette in the form of a
                    reversed triangle, the point of which rests on the mentum. This last-named
                    portion is sometimes almost ovoid, densely pilose, with the extremity either
                    rounded or truncated, and without emargination,—sometimes in the form of a
                    transverse square, with the middle of the superior margin prolonged into a
                    tooth, simple or emarginate. The maxillae of some terminate by a coriaceous or
                    membranous lobc, very hairy, without teeth, or with a very small number, and
                    situate near the middle of the internal border ;—those of the others are
                    entirely corneous, resemble mandibles, and are either truncated or obtuse and
                    entire at the end, or terminated by two or three tceth.</p>
                <p>In the genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Paciiypus</hi> of Dejcan, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amblyteres</hi> of Maelcay, the mentum is almost ovoid; and in
                    the former the antennae of the males are composed of only eight joints, of which
                    the last five form the club,—in the latter they consist of ten joints, of which
                    the last three form the club.</p>
                <p>In the other genera of this subdivision the mentum forms a transverse square, the
                    centre of the superior margin projecting in the manner of a tooth, entire or
                    emarginate. In the gcnus <hi rend="smallcaps">Anapi.ognathus</hi> of Leach
                    (peculiar to Australasia) there is a sternal projection, and the hooks of the
                    tarsi are entire and unequal. The antennae are composed of ten joints, and the
                    extremity of the maxillae is truncated, or obtuse and entire. These insects are

                    centre, so that when seen in front it exhibits the figure of a reversed or
                    demi-truncated heart. The mentum is as long if not longer than broad, somewhat
                    narrowed anterior to the summit, and either nearly square or heart-shaped; its
                    superior margin is straight, or more or less emarginate or concave, in the
                    middle, but without any tooth-like dilatation. The maxillae arc usually
                    squamous, and armed with several (frequently five.or six) teeth, 1his
                    subdivision is itself capable of a further partition into two groups, the first
                    corresponding to the genus <hi rend="italic">Melolontha</hi> of Fabricius, as
                    restricted by liliger and Latreille—the other to the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hoplia</hi> of Illiger. The former continues to bear the name of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Melolonthides.</hi></p>
                <p>Distinguishable by the following general characteristics. The number of complete
                    leaflets of the club exceeds three in several genera. The form of the body is
                    usually thick and massive. The mandibles are strong, entirely or in greater part
                    corneous, and exhibiting at most only a membranous and hirsute appendage, placed
                    in the emargination of the inner side; the superior extremity is strongly
                    truncated, with two or three teeth or angular projections. All the tarsi are
                    terminated by two hooks; the first article of the two anterior being prolonged
                    inferiorly into a hooked appendage. The labrum is usually apparent,—the
                    maxillary teeth robust.</p>
                <p>The insects of whieh this group is composed were included by Linnaeus, like all
                    those with which wc have been lately engaged, in his extensive genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Scarabaeus,</hi> and they also continued to form a portion of that
                    genus in the works of Geoffroy, Degeer, Schaeffer, and other entomologists prior
                    to the time of Fabricius. The last-named author established the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Melolontha,</hi> which in its extended signification may be
                    regarded as synonymous with the Melolonthides of Latreille. Were we to follow
                    the prevailing and praiseworthy example of botanists, who bestow upon a <hi
                    rend="italic">family</hi> the name of the <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> by which
                    it is most strongly characterized, our present group ought to be denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">Sericides,</hi> in as far as the type is not formed by <hi
                    rend="italic">Melolontlια vulgaris,</hi> but rather by <hi rend="italic">Μ.
                    brunηcα</hi> of Fabricius, which now constitutes the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Serica</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> Macleay. But as it is at all times
                    desirable that families should be named after well-known genera, the designation
                    now adopted is preferable to that which might be derived from the less noted
                    though more characteristic type. The Melolonthides are not often distinguished
                    by brilliant or metallic colouring. Their elytra, of which« brown is a
                    characteristic colour, are generally slightly scaly 1 or hirsute. Throughout the
                    entire period of their existence these insects live on vegetable substances, and
                    their ravages are often extremely injurious. The larvae are very long lived, and
                    sometimes pass three or four years in that destructive state. In cold and
                    temperate climates they are very sluggish, if not torpid, during winter, and
                    descend somewhat deeper into the earth to avoid the effects of frost. The
                    perfect insects feed on leaves,—the larvae for the most part on roots.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Melolontha</hi> properly so called (from <hi

                    M^λaλa&gt;+, or is a term of frequent occurrence in Aristotle and other ancient
                    authors, and was first applied by Fabri cius to the insects of the present
                    genus. It is derived from the words mentioned above, because the insects it
                    denoted either were supposed to be pιoduced from the flowers of fruit-trees, or
                    were accustomed to resort to them for food. This circumstance renders it
                    probable that the of the ancients belonged to the family Cetoniides, as the true
                    Melolonthides are hardly ever seen on flowers; and the description of
                    Eustathius, who says that the animal resembled a wasp, led Air Macleay to
                    conjecture that it might be the <hi rend="italic">Tiichìus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fasciatus,</hi> a vernal beetle common in Greece, which might be readily
                    mistaken by a casual observer for one of the ^ √ meuoptera, as it bears a
                    considerable resemblance to some of the members of that order, both in its
                    colouring and mode of flight. Jylouiiets investigations led him to a very
                    different conclusion—that the insect was of a metallic green, and referable to
                    the <hi rend="italic">Bupres-tιdes.</hi> I he former opinion is greatly the more
                    probable, and accords with the brief notices on the subject found in ancient
                    writers, particularly Hesychιus and the scholiast on Aristophanes; but these
                    notices are too imperfect to warrant the determinate application of a word
                    obviously, used with considerable latitude of meaning, and intended in all
                    probability to indicate a group or tribe of insects rather than any individual
                    species. (See <hi rend="italic">∏or. Ent.</hi> p. 78; and Mouífeti, <hi

                    see Plate CCXX1V. fig. 29, the antennae are ten jointed, with the five or seven
                    terminal joints in the males, and the six or four in the females, composing the
                    club. The labrum is thick and strongly emarginate beneath. All the hooks of the
                    tarsi are equal, and terminate in a point entire or simply uni-dentate at their
                    base. The posterior extremity of the abdomen usually ends in a point or style,
                    at least in the males. Of the species of which the antennal club in the male
                    consists of seven leaflets, in the female of only six, we shall here notice the
                    common cockchafer, <hi rend="italic">Μ. vulgaris (S. Melolontha,</hi> Linn.).
                    The body of this insect is of a pitchy black, with a whitish pubescence; the
                    sides of the abdomen are marked by a range of triangular spots. The elytra are
                    testaceous. The antennae of the males are much larger than those of the females.

                    and over most parts of Europe, is less generally known in Scotland, and is rare

                    successive seasor prevails only for the space of a single month. The male
                    speedily perishes after the sexual union, and the femal&lt; merely survives for
                    a sufficient time to deposit her eggsiι safety. As soon as the latter is
                    fecundated, she digs a hol&lt; in the earth of about half a foot in depth, by
                    means of he dentated fore legs. The larvae which proceed from thes&lt; eggs are
                    soft, lengthened, of a dingy-white or yellowisl colour; they have six short
                    scaly fcet, a large scaly head two antennae, each composed of five pieces, and
                    nin∣ stigmata on each side of the body. The eyes are not a first visible—being
                    concealed under the skin, which is er&lt; long cast off. These destructive
                    creatures feed upon th∣ roots of various plants. They are most voracious during
                    the summer season. In the course of the autumn the; descend into the earth, and
                    pass the winter in a state o profound repose, neither requiring nor desiring

                <p>Although the generality of insects are more destructive in the larva than in any
                    other state, great ravages are occasionally committed even by the perfect
                    insect. It is in relation to the present species that Mouffet records the number
                    of beetles which at Qne time fell into the Severn as being sufficient to stop
                    the wheels of the water-mills. In the year 1688 they covered the hedges and
                    trees in a district of the county of Galway, in such infinite numbers as to hang
                    in clusters like bees when they swarm. When on the wing they almost darkened the
                    light of day, and produced a peculiar sound by the rustling of their wings. When
                    feeding, the noise of their jaws might have been mistaken for the sawing of
                    timber; and in a very short time the foilage of the trees for miles around was
                    so totally consumed, that at midsummer the country wore the aspect of the

                    extremity presents no sensible dentations. The labrum is concealed or but
                    slightly apparent. The maxillae have frequently only small dentations. The body

                    posteriorly at the exterior side. The last two tarsi are usually furnished with

                    inferiorly, and exhibits on the internal side a strong hooked tooth.</p>
                <p>M. Leon Dufour, as Latreille informs us, has remarked, that the digestive canal
                    in these insects (at least in sueh <hi rend="italic">Hopliae</hi> as he has
                    examined) is mueh shorter than that of the Melolonthae, and rather approaches
                    the same part in the genus Cetonia. The chylific ventricle is smooth and
                    flexuous. The small intestine is shorter than in Melolontha, and often presents
                    an ovoid inflation at its origin. The great intestine is elongated, and
                    destitute of valvular anfractuosities, and the reetum is distinctly marked by an
                    obvious collar. The generative system resembles that of the Melolonthae.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Dicrania</hi> (Lepel. and Serville, in <hi

                    the body is very smooth, without scales, the scutellum rather large, and there
                    are two strong spines at the extremity of the four posterior tibiae; the lower
                    extremity of the two hindmost tibiae is dilated. These insects are natives of
                    Brazil. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hoplia</hi> of liliger'there is only a
                    single hook to the two posterior tarsi (Plate CCXXV. fig. 4). The pairs of the

                    is as it were crowned by little spines of nearly equal length. The body is
                    generally furnished with minute scales. The epistoma is either almost square or
                    nearly semicircular. The thighs of the two hind legs are moderately enlarged,
                    and the tibiae are long, straight, and without a hooked tooth at their

                    project beyond the upper extremity of the mentum, and the edges of the elytra
                    are somewhat open, or removed from the usual line of the dorsal suture, towards
                    their posterior extremity, which is narrowed to a point, or rounded. The
                    antennae consist of from nine to ten joints, of whieh the three last alone form

                <p>In these the body is depressed, usually oval, brilliant, hornless, with the
                    thorax trapeziform or almost orbicular. An axillary piece occupies, in the
                    greater number, the space comprised between the posterior angles and the
                    exterior of the base of the elytra. The anal termination is exposed. The sternum
                    is frequently prolonged in the form of a point or advanced horn. The hooks of
                    the tarsi are equal and simple. The antennae are 10-articulate, with the last
                    three joints forming the elub, which is always foliaceous. The labrum and
                    mandibles are eoncealed, lamelliform, and nearly if not entirely membranous. The
                    maxillae terminate in a silky lobe, in the form of a pencil, without corneous
                    teeth. The mentum is usually ovoid, truncated superiorly, or almost square, with
                    the middle of the superior edge more or less coneave or emarginate. The ligula
                    is not projecting.</p>
                <p>The alimentary tube of these insects, aceorđing to Μ. Dufour, is shorter than in
                    any of the scarabideous family. The chylific ventricle has usually its external
                    tunic covered by very small superficial papillae, or projecting points. The
                    enlargement which terminates the small intestine is not cavernous, as in the

                <p>This section, according to the views of M. Latreille, by which we have already
                    been so long guided, is susceptible of division into three prineipal groups,
                    eorresponding to the genera <hi rend="italic">Trichius</hi> of Fabricius, <hi
                    rend="italic">Goliathus</hi> of Lamarck, and <hi rend="italic">Cetonia</hi> of
                    Fabrieius, but reduced and simplified by certain abstractions.</p>
                <p>The Melitoph ili of the first two divisions have no strongly-marked sternal
                    projection; the lateral portion of the mesosternum (or that named <hi
                    rend="italic">epimera</hi> by M. Audouin) does not generally manifest itself
                    upwardly. The thorax does not increase from before backwards as in Cetonia; nor
                    is the exterior side of the elytra abruptly narrowed or uni-sinuate a little
                    below the humeral angle, as in those insects. A more rigorous character consists
                    in the labial palpi being inserted in lateral grooves of the anterior face of
                    the mentum, so that they are entirely exposed, the sides of the mentum jutting
                    beyond them at their origin, and protecting them behind. In the first two
                    divisions these palpi are inserted beneath the lateral margin of the mentum, or
                    in the margins themselves, in such manner <pb break="no"

                <p>In these the mentum is either almost isometrical, or rather longer than broad,
                    and leaves the maxillae exposed. They correspond, as we have said, to the genus
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Trichius</hi> of Fabricius (Plate CCXXV. figs. 8 and 9), of
                    which we may mention as an example <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fasciatus,</hi> probably the only British species. It is black, with scattered
                    yellow hairs, the elytra yellowish, with three transverse black bands,
                    interrupted at the suture. It is very rare in Scotland, but is, however,
                    recorded by Mr Curtis as occurring “on the flowers of the thyme, near Loch
                    Rannoch, in July.” It was also noticed some years ago by Dr Greville in Glen
                    Tilt, and we saw it taken by Mr Giles Mun-by, on the southern border of
                    Sutherland, early in the month of August 1833. The dimensions of the female
                    considerably exceed those of the male. The genus, as now restricted, is not very
                    extensive. Dejean enumerates twelve species, several of which are from North
                    America.</p>

                <p>May be distinguished from the preceding by the mentum, which is much longer and
                    wider, and covers the maxillae. In some the mentum is concave in the centre. The
                    anterior extremity of the epistoma is neither toothed nor horned. Such is the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cremastocheilus</hi> of Knock (Plate CCXXV. fig. 10),
                    in which the thorax forms nearly a transverse square; the maxillae are
                    terminated by a strong tooth, hooked or falciform, with setae or little spines
                    in place of an inner lobe; the last article of the palpi is very long and
                    cylindrical; the mentum in the form of a widened heart, or of a reversed
                    triangle rounded at the upper angles, without sensible emargination. In others
                    the mentum is in the form of a greatly widened heart, but without a discoidal
                    cavity, its superior edge being emarginate or sinuous. The anterior extremity of
                    the epistoma in the males is divided into two lobes, in the form of obtuse or
                    truncated horns. The thorax is almost orbicular. Such is the extraordinary genus

                <p>In this group the sternum is more or less prolonged to an obtuse point, between
                    the intermediate pair of legs; the axillary piece before mentioned is always
                    visible above, and occupies the entire space which separates the posterior
                    angles of the thorax from the base of the elytra; the thorax is usually enlarged
                    posteriorly, and has the form of a triangle truncated anteriorly or at its
                    point. The mentum is never transversal; its superior margin is more or less
                    emarginate in the middle. The terminal lobe of the maxillae is silky or
                    pencil-shaped. The body is almost ovoid, and depressed. The membranaceous
                    texture of the mandibles and maxillae of these insects demonstrates, as Mr
                    Macleay has observed, that in the perfect state they live on vegetable juices.

                <p>Sufficient data have not yet been collected for the proper elucidation of their
                    geographical distribution, but it appears that many more species exist within
                    than without the tropics. In some the thorax is prolonged posteriorly in an
                    angular form, so that the scutellum disappears. These form the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Gymnetis</hi> of Macleay (Plate CCXXV. fig. 12). Several
                    species occur in America. In others from New Holland and the East Indies the
                    clypeus is bifid, or armed, in the males, with a couple of horns, and the body
                    is proportionally narrow and elongated, with the abdomen obviously decreasing in
                    size posteriorly. It is even almost triangular in some. The club of the antennae
                    is elongated. These constitute the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Macronota</hi> of

                <p>The Lucanides of the second section have the antennae simply bent, or but
                    slightly geniculate and hairy; the labrum is always exposed, crustaceous, and
                    transversal; the mandibles strong and much dentatcd, but without any remarkable
                    disproportion of size between the sexes; the maxillae are entirely corneous,
                    with two strong teeth at least; the ligula, likewise corneous or very hard, is
                    placed in the superior emargination of the mentum, and terminated by three
                    points. The abdomen is supported on a kind of pedicle, bearing the scutellum
                    above it, and separated from the thorax by a neck or obvious interval. These
                    insects form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Passalus</hi> of Fabricius (Plate
                    CCXXV. figs. 21 and 23), which has undergone subdivision in recent times. In <hi

                    the antennae is composed of five joints, the labruin is very short, the maxillae
                    have but two teeth, one terminal, the other on the inner side.<note

                    coprophagous tribe. All these insects are foreign to Europe, and we believe also
                    to Africa. They are characteristic chiefly of South America, but are also known
                    in New Holland, Java, and the eastern countries of Asia. Madame Merian informs
                    us that the larva of the species figured in her work feeds on the roots of the
                    sweet potato. The perfect insect is well known in sugar-houses.</p>

                <p>All the groups of this, the second primary section of the coleopterous order,
                    feed on vegetable substances. Latreille comprises them under four great
                    families, of which the first two exhibit, by reason of an excrementitious
                    apparatus discovered by Μ. Dufour, an analogy to some of the pentamerous
                    Coleoptera. Their chylific ventricle is also frequently beset by papillae. In
                    several of these insects we find the vestiges of another secreting apparatus, of
                    which we have few examples among the Coleoptera, that denominated the <hi

                    or pentamerous section, with few exceptions, amount to six in number, and have
                    two intestines, distant from each other; at one extremity, according to Dufour,
                    they are inserted by six insulated ends around the collar which terminates the
                    chylific ventricle; at the other they open into the origin of the caecum by
                    trunks varying in number in different families and genera.</p>
                <p>The first general division of the section may be made to contain the first three
                    families. The elytra are generally of a firm and hard consistence, the hooks of
                    the tarsi almost always simple, the head ovoid or oval, susceptible of being
                    sunk posteriorly in the thorax, or sometimes narrowed behind, but not abruptly,
                    and without any neck at the base. Many of these insects are “darklings,” that
                    is, lucifugous or light-shunning.</p>

                <p>This group consists of black or ash-coloured species, without mixture or variety

                    for the most part apterous, with the elytra as it were soldered together. The
                    antennae are partly or entirely granose, almost of the same size throughout, or
                    a little enlarged at their extremity, inserted under the projecting margin of
                    the head, with the third articulation generally elongated. The mandibles are
                    bifid or emarginate at the extremity, and there is a corneous tooth or hook on
                    the inner side of the maxillae· All the articulations of the tarsi are entire,
                    and the eyes are oblong and but slightly elevated—a character which, according
                    to Μ. Marcel de Serres, indicates nocturnal habits. Almost all these insects

                    composed of the reunion of three biliary vessels. The bile is yellow, sometimes
                    brown, or even violet coloured. The alimentary tube<note anchored="true"

                    times the length of the body. The oesophagus is long, and leads to a crop,
                    smooth or glabrous externally, more developed among the last-named insects,
                    where it forms an ovoid sac lodged in the pectus; it is furnished interiorly
                    with folds or longitudinal fleshy columns, terminating in some species, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">Erodii</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Pimelioe,</hi> beside the
                    chylific ventricle, at a valve formed of four principal corneous, oval, and
                    connivent parts. The chylific ventricle is elongated, flexuous or doubled,
                    generally beset with small papillae or projecting points, and terminates in a
                    small collar, callous within, which receives the first insertion of the biliary
                    vessels. In the genera <hi rend="italic">Blaps</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asida</hi> there is a salivary apparatus, consisting of two floating vessels or
                    tubes, sometimes, as in the latter, perfectly simple, sometimes, as in the
                    former, irregularly branched. The same structure no doubt will be found to occur
                    in others of the family. The texture of the tunics of the alimentary canal has

                    Dufour in relation to these insects, he states that they are provided with a
                    double excrementitial secreting apparatus, totally different in structure from
                    that of the pentamerous tribes. It consists of two tolerably large oblong
                    bladders, placed altogether beneath the viscera of digestion and generation,
                    closely approximated to each other, with extremely thin parietes, and surrounded
                    by vascular folds, adherent, more or less pursed or turgid, and of which it is
                    difficult to ascertain the precise point of insertion, from the impossibilitv of
                    unrolling them. The same may be said of the canals destined to the emission of
                    the secreted fluids. They are concealed by a kind of membranous diaphragm, which
                    is applied, by means of a fleshy pannicle, to the last ventrical segment. The
                    fluid flows out laterally, and not from the extremity of the terminal segment:
                    it is of a brownish colour, extremely acrid and irritating, of a peculiar and
                    penetrating odour, and is capable of being thrown to a distance <hi

                <p>Those in which the body is generally oblong, with the abdomen laterally embraced
                    by the elytra, and in which these parts are frequently narrowed towards the end,
                    and terminate in a tail-like point, form Latreille’s first division. The tarsi
                    are nearly alike in both sexes, and without any remarkable dilatation. In the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Acant∏omera,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 2), the
                    thorax is almost orbicular, transversal; the abdomen nearly globular; the third
                    article of the antennae cylindrical, and longer than the ensuing. In <hi

                    is almost square, and plane or but slightly convex. The abdomen is oval,
                    transversely truncate at the base, more or less elongated. The elytra, for the
                    most part, are narrowed or prolonged to a point, especially in the males. The
                    third article of the antennae is cylindrical, and much longer than the ensuing;
                    the last is short and ovoid. As an example of this genus (of which there are

                    wanting. All the species are winged. Their body is generally square, their
                    thorax trapezoidal or semicircular, and either concealing or receiving the head.
                    The antennae, usually inserted beneath a marginal projection of the sides of the
                    head, are short, more or less perfoliate or granose, and either enlarge
                    insensibly or terminate in a club. The legs are not adapted for running, and all
                    the articles of the tarsi are entire, and terminated by simple hooks; the
                    anterior tibiae are often broad and triangular. Several males have the head
                    furnished with horns. The greater proportion of these Heteromera occur on tree
                    fungi, or beneath the bark; some live on the ground under stones. M. Dufour has
                    observed an excrementitial secreting apparatus in several genera, and salivary

                    Among the ovoid and convex species, with the central portion of the thorax

                    is larger than the preceding ones, and hatchet-shaped. This tribe corresponds to
                    the unrestricted genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cossypiius</hi> of Olivier and
                    Fabricius.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cossyphus</hi> properly so called (Plate
                    CCXXVI. fig. 3), the thorax is almost semicircular, exhibits no anterior
                    emargination, and entirely covers and conceals the head. The antennae are short,
                    terminate abruptly in an oval mass of four articles, chiefly transversal: the
                    second of the whole number and the following ones are almost identical. These
                    insects inhabit the East Indies, the south of Europe, and the north of Africa.
                    In <hi rend="smallcaps">He-laeus</hi> of Lat. and Kirby, the head is received
                    into a deep emargination, or median aperture of the thorax, and is exposed at
                    least superiorly. The antennae terminate gradually in a narrow elongated club.
                    These insects are peculiar to New Holland. Some other species, proper to South
                    America, of which the body is almost hemispherical, very convex, and of a soft

                <p>This family of heteromerous Coleoptera differs from the preceding one chiefly in
                    the antennae, which are neither granose nor perfoliated. In the greater number
                    the extremity is not thickened. The body is generally oblong, arcuated above,
                    and the legs elongated, as in many other insects. The males, except in their
                    antennae and genera] dimensions, resemble the females. Our present species
                    generally are of much more active habits than those we have just left. Many
                    conceal themselves beneath the bark of trees, while most of the others are met

                    >Cistela</hi> approach the Tenebriones; but in Cistela the chylific ventricle is
                    smooth, and the mandibles entire, and the species affecl flowers and leaves, a
                    habit by which they are distinguished from Helops. Most of the Dirceae possess
                    the faculty of leaping, and the penultimate article of the tarsi, or at least of
                    some of them, is bifid. Some live in mushrooms, others in old wood. They connect
                    on one side with Helops<pb break="no" facs="nls:193747416?mode=fullsize"

                    with that sub-genus of the same tribe named <hi rend="italic">Nothus</hi> by
                    Ziegler. These are the principles by which Latreille has been recently directed
                    in his arrangement of the present family.</p>
                <p>A certain number (including the first four tribes) have the antennae approximate
                    to the eyes, and the head not prolonged into a trunk, but terminated at most by
                    a short muzzle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 1st, Helopii.</hi></p>
                <p>Antennae covered at their insertion by the margins of the head, almost filiform,
                    or a little larger towards the extremity, generally composed of nearly
                    cylindrical articles attenuated towards the base, and of which the penultimate
                    are frequently a little shorter, in the form of a reversed cone,—the terminal
                    being for the most part nearly ovoid, and the third always lengthened. The
                    extremity of the mandibles is bifid; the last joint of the maxillary palpi is of
                    larger size, and hatchet-shaped, or in the form Of a reversed triangle. The eyes
                    are oblong, reniform, or emarginate. None of the legs are adapted for leaping;
                    the penultimate joint of the tarsi, or at least of the hindmost ones, is almost
                    always entire, or not deeply bilobed; the terminal hooks are simple, or without
                    fissure or dentation. The body is for the most part arcuated above, and always
                    of a firm and solid consistence. Such of the larvae as are known are filiform,
                    smooth, shining, with very short feet, like those of the Tenebriones. They occur
                    in old wood. It is also beneath the bark of ancient trees that we find the
                    perfect insects. The tribe corresponds in great part to the genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Helops</hi> of Fabricius.</p>
                <p>Some have the body almost elliptical, strongly arcuated above, or very convex,
                    with the antennae at the utmost as long as the thorax, compressed and dilated
                    towards their extremity, like the teeth of a saw; the thorax transversal, plane
                    above, either trapezoidal and widening posteriorly, or almost square; the elytra
                    frequently terminated by a point or tooth. The posterior extremity of the
                    praesternum forms a little salient point, which is received by a forked notch of
                    the mesosternum. Here are placed the genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Epitragus</hi>

                <p>In all the other Helopii, the mesosternum exhibits no marked emargination, and
                    the posterior extremity of the praesternum is not prolonged to a point. Here are

                    nearly in the form of a reversed cone, or cylindrical and attenuated at the
                    base. The thorax is transverse, or scarcely as long as broad, either square, or
                    trapezoidal, or heart-shaped, abruptly narrowed posteriorly, terminated by
                    pointed angles, and always applied exactly to the base or the elytra. Here also

                <p>This is very closely allied to the preceding, but the insertion of the antennae
                    is not covered. The mandibles terminate in an entire point, or are unemarginate.
                    The hooks of the tarsi are dentated beneath like the teeth of a comb. Several of
                    these insects live on flowers. Their digestive canal is shorter than that of the
                    Helopii, and( the chylific ventricle exhibits no papillae. They correspond to
                    the genus <hi rend="italic">Cistela</hi> of Fabricius.</p>
                <p>In some all the articles of the tarsi are entire. The last joint of the maxillary
                    palpi is simply a little larger, obconical or triangular. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lystronichus,</hi> Lat., the thorax is thick, narrower than the
                    abdomen, almost orbicular or heart-shaped. The antennae are thickened towards
                    the extremity. The thighs are clubbed. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Cistela</hi>
                    properly so called, the thorax is depressed, trapezoidal, of the breadth of the
                    abdomen at its posterior margin, or scarcely narrower. The antennae are
                    filiform, or slightly enlarged at the extremity, and the head is advanced in the
                    manner of a muzzle. In others, such as the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Allecula,</hi> Fab., the penultimate article of the tarsi is bilobed, and the
                    last joint of the maxillary palpi much dilated, in the form of a hatchet. The
                    body is generally more oblong.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 3d, Serropalpides.</hi></p>
                <p>The most remarkable distinction of this tribe, and that from which it derives its
                    name, is the frequent serration of the maxillary palpi, which are likewise large
                    and inclined. The antennae are inserted in an emargination of the eyes, exposed
                    as in the preceding tribe, and often short and filiform. The mandibles are
                    emarginate or bifid at the extremity, and the hooks of the tarsi are simple. The
                    body is almost cylindrical in some, oval in others, with the head inclined and
                    the thorax trapezoidal. The anterior extremity of the head is not advanced, and
                    the posterior thighs are not inflated. The penultimate article of the tarsi, or
                    at least of the four anterior, is frequently bilobed; and in those in which it
                    is entire the posterior legs at least are adapted for leaping; they are thin,
                    long, compressed, the tarsi small, almost setaceous, with the first article
                    elongated. The anterior are always short and dilated. The genus <hi
                    rend="italic">Dirccea</hi> of Fabricius forms the type of the tribe. It contains
                    the genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Orchesia,</hi> Lat., <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>This tribe is allied to the preceding by several characters, such as the exposed
                    insertion of the antennae near the eyes, the bifid extremity of the mandibles,
                    the bilobation of the penultimate article of the tarsi, and the hatchet shape of
                    the terminal joint of the maxillary palpi; but they exhibit other characters,
                    which authorize their separation. The body is elongated, narrow, almost linear,
                    with the head and thorax scarcely so broad as the abdomen; the antennae are
                    longer than those parts, serrated in some (such as <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cαlopus),</hi> filiform or setaceous, and composed of long and nearly
                    cylindrical articles, in others. The anterior extremity of the head is more or
                    less prolonged in the form of a small muzzle, and rather restricted behind, with
                    the eyes proportionally more elevated than among the preceding tribes. The
                    thorax is at least as long as wide, and a little narrowed behind. The elytra are
                    linear, or narrowed posteriorly, and are frequently flexible. Latreille regards
                    the species as allied to <hi rend="italic">Tele-plιorus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Zonitis.</hi> Μ. Dufour has recognised in the OEdemerites the
                    existence of salivary vessels, of a simple nature, flexuous and floating, as
                    well as of a paunch formed by a lateral crop, furnished with a neck or
                    pedicle.</p>

                <p>i They are the only Coleoptera in which that character has been observed. These
                    insects, of which the transformations are unknown, are found on flowers and
                    trees. They are all comprised in the old genus <hi rend="italic">OEdemera
                    of</hi> Olivier.</p>
                <p>In some the antennae are always short, inserted in a notch of the eyes, and
                    simple; the posterior thighs are inflated, at least in one of the sexes; the
                    thorax as broad as the base of the abdomen; and the hooks of the tarsi bifid.
                    Such is the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Nothus</hi> of Ziegler, in which the
                    maxillary palpi are terminated by a large elongated hatchet-shaped article. The
                    posterior legs in one of the sexes are very large, and furnished beneath with a
                    strong tooth and two little spurs, near the lower extremity of the tibiae. The
                    head is not prolonged anteriorly.</p>
                <p>In others the antennae are always longer than the head and thorax, the legs
                    usually of nearly equal size, the thorax narrower than the base of the abdomen,

                <p>In this, which forms the concluding tribe of the Stenelytra, are grouped certain
                    insects, some of which are evidently allied to the preceding, while others in a

                    elongated muzzle, or of a flattened trunk, bearing the antennae at its base, and
                    in advance of the eyes, which are always entire or without emargination.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the antennae are filiform, and the muzzle not enlarged at the base; the
                    thorax is narrowed in front in form of a truncated cone or of a trapezium; the
                    ligula is emarginate, and the terminal joint of the tarsi bilobed. These insects
                    occur on flowers, a habitat indicated by the silky prolongation of the terminal
                    lobe of the maxillae. Such are the genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Stenostoma,</hi>
                    Fab. and <hi rend="smallcaps">Mycterus,</hi> Clairville.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the antennae are terminated by an elongated mass, formed by from three
                    to five terminal joints; the muzzle is very flat, with a projecting angle on
                    each side, anterior to the extremity; the thorax is in the form of a truncated
                    heart, narrowed posteriorly; the ligula and all the joints of the tarsi are
                    entire. These insects dwell beneath the bark of trees, and seem allied to the
                    <hi rend="italic">Aηthribi</hi> of Fabricius. They form the genus <hi

                <p>The head is triangular or heart-shaped, borne upon a kind of neck or abrupt

                    extremity, generally and at least partially granose, with the terminal article
                    longer than the preceding in the males. The palpi are thickened at their
                    extremity, and the terminal joint of the maxillary is larger, and in the form of
                    a reversed triangle. The thighs are oval and clubbed; the tibiae elongated,

                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Dendroides,</hi> Lat. the antennae of the males
                    are almost as long as the body, and give off long bearded filaments; in the same
                    sex the eyes are large, and approximated behind. The thorax is trapezoidal, or
                    in the form of a truncated cone; and the body, as well as the legs, is
                    proportionally more elongated. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pyrochroa</hi>

                <p>These do not present, either in relation to the form of the tarsi and their
                    hooks, or to that of the antennae, any constant character in common, but they
                    are easily distinguished from the other Heteromera of the same family by the
                    general conformation of their body. It is elevated, and arcuated; the head is
                    low, the thorax trapezoidal or semicircular, and the elytra either very short,
                    or narrowed, and terminated by a point, as well as the abdomen. Several of these
                    insects approach the Pyrochroides in respect to their antennae ;—others in their
                    maxillae, the hooks of the tarsi, and their parasitical habits, resemble <hi
                    rend="italic">Nemogηathus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Sitaris,</hi> two genera of
                    an ensuing tribe; —but they differ from all of these in their extreme agility,
                    and the firm and solid consistence of their teguments. They formed the old genus
                    <hi rend="italic">Mordella</hi> of Linn.</p>
                <p>Some have the palpi almost of the same thickness throughout. The antennae of the
                    males are strongly pectinated or fan-like. The extremity of the mandibles offers
                    no emargination. The articles of the tarsi are always entire, and the hooks of
                    the hindmost are dentated or bifid. The middle of the posterior margin of the
                    thorax is always much prolonged backwards, like a scutellum. 1he eyes are
                    unemarginate. The larvae of certain species (/?«’- <hi rend="italic"

                    the wings extended, and reaching beyond the elytra, which equal the length of
                    the abdomen. The hooks of the tarsi are bifid. The antennae, inserted near the
                    inner edge of the eyes, are pectinated on both sides in the males,—serrated, or
                    with only a single range of short teeth, in the females. The terminal lobe of
                    the maxillae is very long, linear, and projecting; and the ligula is also
                    elongated, and deeply bifid. Some naturalists having found in the nest of the
                    common wasp several living specimens of <hi rend="italic">P. paradoxus,</hi> it
                    has been inferred that they live there in the larva state. M. Farines, however,

                <p>Others have the wings always covered by the elytra, which are prolonged nearly to
                    the extremity of the abdomen, and terminate in a point. 1he posterior margin of
                    the thorax is slightly if at all lobed. The abdomen or the females is terminated
                    by a pointed tall. The eyes are sometimes emarginate. The maxillary palpi are
                    terminated by a large article, in the form of a hatchet or reversed triangle.
                    The extremity of the mandibles is notched or bifid. The antennae, even in the
                    males, are merely serrated. <hi rend="smallcaps">IπMordella</hi> properly <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">so</hi> called (Plate CCXXVĬ. fig. 8), the antennae, of equal

                    tarsi are entire, and the hooks of the last present beneath one or two small
                    indentations. M. Dufour has observed in a species of this genus two floating
                    salivary vessels, longer than the body. The hepatic vessels have no caecal
                    insertion,—an exceptive character in the present section. The genus <hi

                    the antennae, which are simple, and gradually enlarged, by the emargination of

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 4th, Antπicides.</hi></p>
                <p>Here the antennae are simple, or slightly serrate, filiform, or a little thicker
                    towards the end, and most of the articles are in the form of a reversed cone,
                    and nearly alike, except the last (and sometimes also the two preceding), which
                    is larger and oval. The maxillary palpi are terminated by a securiform club. The
                    penultimate joint of the tarsi is bilobed. The body is narrow anteriorly, with
                    the eyes entire or slightly emarginate. The thorax is sometimes in the form of a
                    reversed oval, narrowed and truncated posteriorly, sometimes divided into two
                    knots, in others semicircular. Certain species are found on plants of different
                    kinds, but the majority occur upon the ground. They run with great swiftness,
                    and their larvae have been supposed to be parasitical. They compose the genus

                <p>The two concluding tribes of this family, and of the heteromerous section,
                    exhibit certain characters in common, such as the termination of the mandibles
                    in a simple point, the palpi filiform or simply a little longer at their
                    extremity, but never either clubbed or securiform, the abdomen soft, the elytra
                    flexible, and in most instances blistering or vesicatorial, and, with few
                    exceptions, the articles of the tarsi entire, and the hooks of these parts
                    generally bifid. They are all herbivorous in the perfect <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> state, but many are parasitical, while larvae, in the dwellings of other
                    tribes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe</hi> 5τπ, <hi rend="smallcaps">Horiales.</hi></p>
                <p>These differ from the ensuing, or Cantharidiae, in their hooks, which are
                    dentated, and each accompanied by a serrated appendage. The antennae are
                    filiform, not longer than the thorax; the labrum is small, the mandibles strong
                    and projecting, the palpi filiform, the thorax square, and the two posterior
                    legs very robust, at least in one of the sexes. The tribe is composed of the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Horia</hi> of Fabricius (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 10).
                    These insects inhabit the intratropical regions of India and America. The
                    lamented Lansdown Guilding has published figures and a short history of <hi

                    bee <hi rend="italic">(Xylocopa teredo),</hi> and the larvae, when hatched, are
                    supposed to devour the food deposited in the ligneous chambers for a very
                    different purpose by the parent bee. “Forsan,” says Mr Guilding, “dum larva
                    cibum apìbus praeparatum avide consumit, hospes fame perit.” It is often so.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 6th, Cantharidiae.</hi></p>
                <p>This tribe is distinguished from the preceding by the hooks of the tarsi, which
                    are deeply divided, and appear as if double. The head is generally large,
                    broader, and rounded posteriorly. The thorax is usually narrowed behind, and
                    approaches the form of a truncated heart; in some it is almost orbicular. The
                    elytra are often somewhat inclined laterally, or tectiform, and rounded. These
                    insects counterfeit death when seized, and several of them exude a yellow
                    caustic liquor, of a penetrating odour, from the joints of their antennae; but
                    no peculiar apparatus for the production of that secretion has yet been
                    ascertained. Many kinds are highly serviceable in the formation of blistering
                    applications. They were all included originally in the old genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Meloe</hi> of Linnaeus, now greatly subdivided. The anatomical
                    observations of Μ. Dufour, and the extremely interesting researches of Μ.
                    Bretonneau of Tours, on the vesicatorial properties of this tribe of insects,
                    have enabled Latreille to arrange them in what he regards as a natural
                    order,—not greatly differing, however, from that which he had previously
                    adopted. Μ. Bretonneau has ascertained that the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Sitaris</hi> is not vesicatorial,—and Μ. Dufour has found that these same
                    Heteroιnera possess only four biliary vessels instead of six, the amount by
                    which other insects of the tribe are characterized. That genus also resembles
                    <hi rend="italic">Zοηi∙ tis</hi> in its general organization, while the latter
                    is itself closely allied to <hi rend="italic">Cantharis.</hi> The series of
                    groups adopted by Latreille is also in harmony with the progressive changes in
                    the form of the antennae.</p>
                <p>In some these organs are composed in both sexes of only nine articulations, of
                    which the last is large, and in the form of an ovoid head; those of the males,
                    as well as their maxillary palpi, being very irregular. The body is depressed.
                    Such is the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cerocoma</hi> of Geoff. The species make
                    their appearance during the summer solstice, and frequently in great numbers on
                    the same spot. They frequent the flowers of the wild chamomile, milfoil, &amp;c·
                    <hi rend="italic">Meloe Schcefferi of</hi> Linn, of a bluish green, with the
                    antennae and legs wax yellow, may be mentioned as an example.</p>
                <p>In all the others the palpi are identical and regular in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193747455?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7455-0169"/> both sexes.
                    The antennae have generally eleven articulations, and when they offer one or two
                    less they terminate regularly in a club. The body is thickish, and the elytra
                    somewhat inclined.</p>
                <p>In some the antennae, always regular and granose in both sexes, sometimes appear
                    to be composed of only from nine to ten joints, and are not longer than half the
                    body; they occasionally terminate in an arcuated club, or are obviously enlarged
                    at the extremity; while in others they form from the second joint a short
                    cylindrical or almost fusiform stem. They constitute the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Mylabris</hi> of Fabricius. Such of them as have the two or three last joints
                    of the antennae united, at least in the females, and forming an abrupt, thick,
                    ovoid, or button-shaped club, the extremity of which does not extend beyond the
                    thorax, and in which the total joints are only from nine to ten, form the genus
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Hycleus</hi> of Lat. Such, again, as have the antennae
                    proportionally longer, and offering in both sexes eleven distinct and
                    well-divided articulations, gradually enlarging, or terminating by degrees in an
                    elongated club, of which the terminal joint, very distinguishable from the
                    preceding, is large and ovoid, belong to the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mylabris</hi> properly so called (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 11). The species we have
                    here represented is the J∕. <hi rend="italic">chicorii.</hi> It is more than
                    half an inch long, black, pilose, with an almost round yellowish spot on the
                    base of each elytron, and two transverse and indented bands of the same colour,
                    one near the centre, and the other nearer the extremity. The antennae are black.
                    This insect, unknown in Britain, is occasionally found as far north as the
                    vicinity of Paris, but it is much more common in the south of France, and other
                    meridional parts of Europe. Its blistering qualities are quite as active and
                    efficient as those of the true <hi rend="italic">Cantharis</hi> or Spanish fly;
                    and in Italy it is employed for the same purposes, mixed up with the latter, or
                    even used alone. <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">pustulatus</hi> is
                    used by the Chinese.</p>
                <p>In the other Heteromera of this tribe the antennae, always composed of eleven
                    very distinct joints, are almost of equal thickness throughout, or rather more
                    slender towards the extremity, and frequently much longer than the head and
                    thorax. They are irregular in several males. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Meloe</hi>
                    properly so called (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 12), the antennae are composed of short
                    and rounded joints, the intermediate of which are the largest, and sometimes so
                    disposed that these parts in the males exhibit an emargination or crescent-like
                    form. The wings are wanting, and the elytra, oval or triangular, with a portion
                    of the inner margins crossing each other, only partially cover the abdomen,
                    especially that of the females, which, as often happens, is extremely
                    voluminous. According to Dufour, the crop of these insects may be considered as
                    a true gizzard, being furnished internally with callous and anastomosing plicae,
                    and separated from the stomach or chylific ventricle by a valve formed of four
                    principal pieces, each of which results from two hollow cylinders placed back to
                    back, and tridentated posteriorly.</p>
                <p>All the species of the genus Meloe are awkward and mis-shapen, and of sluggish
                    movements. They are found either crawling slowly and heavily along the surface
                    of the earth, or on plants of humble growth. They feed on leaves, and when
                    handled, an oily fluid of a yellow or reddish colour flows from the joints of
                    their legs. Latreille suspects that these insects are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eupτestides</hi> of the ancients, to which were attributed such destructive
                    effects on cattle, when inadvertently swallowed by the latter. The genus seems
                    characteristic of the European continent and islands. Eight or nine species
                    occur in Britain; and of the twenty-one species enumerated by Dejean, the whole
                    are European. Mr Kirby however possesses a specimen taken in North America by
                    Professor Peck. They are all characterized by dark or sombre colours. They are
                    most frequent in spring and autumn, and occur in fields and pathways,
                    preferring, it is said, a sunny situation and a sandy soil. In some districts of
                    Spain they are employed along with Cantharides, or in their room. They are also
                    used by farriers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In
                    regard to these insects we may further observe, that Dr Leach was informed by Mr
                    Hunneman that the species called <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >variegatus</hi> is highly prized in Germany as a medicine, being considered as

                    its neck, and suspending it till dry; the oily secretion first thrown out being
                    preserved, as in that the chief virtue is supposed to exist. Mr Hunneman adds
                    more particularly, that the late king of Prussia, Frederick the Great, purchased
                    the nostrum from the discoverer for a valuable consideration, as a specific
                    against the bite of a mad dog. According to the recipe, twenty-five of these
                    insects that have been preserved in honey, are, with two drachms of powdered
                    black ebony, one drachm of Virginia snake-root, one ditto of lead filings, and
                    twenty grains of fungus sorbi, to be reduced to a very fine substance; the
                    whole, with two ounces of theriaca of Venice (and, <hi rend="italic">if
                    necessary,</hi> a little elder root), to be formed into an electuary! (See <hi
                    rend="italic">Linn. Trans,</hi> xi. p. 245.)</p></note> The females, when filled
                    with eggs, become greatly dilated, and in that condition much exceed the males
                    in size. An individual of the former sex observed by Goëdart, and fed by him
                    with the leaves of anemone and ranunculus, laid 2212 eggs between the 12th of
                    May and the 12th of June, besides about as many more which were thrown aside
                    uncounted. It effected this laying at two separate periods, placing the
                    extremity of its abdomen in a hole which it had formed in the earth, and
                    depositing the eggs in packets. These are of a yellowish colour, and resemble
                    grains of sand pressed together. The larvae are long, cylindrical, garnished
                    with scattered hairs, composed of eleven nearly equal segments, besides the
                    head, which is oval, and provided with two eyes, and a pair of longish antennae.
                    They have six legs, of rather large size compared with the length of the body,
                    which is terminated by two long bristle-like appendices. Their larvae are
                    supposed by some ingenious observers to be parasitical on the bodies of winged
                    insects. Degeer having remarked that a strong resemblance existed between the
                    larvae of Meloe, and a small insect which he found adhering to <hi rend="italic"
                    >Eristalis intrica-rius,</hi> he placed two domestic flies among the former, and
                    found that they were speedily adhered to by the larvae, which stuck to them
                    pertinaceously, and caused their death in two or three days. Bees are also
                    subject to their attacks; and MM. Lepelletier and Serville are said to have
                    recently confirmed the observations of Degeer, by breeding these parasites from
                    the eggs of Meloe. “On the other hand,” says Mr Curtis, “Mr Kirby is disposed to
                    think that his <hi rend="italic">Pediculus</hi><hi rend="italic">Melitta</hi>
                    (P. Apis, Linn.?) is not the larva of Meloe; and M. Leon Dufour has even formed

                    elytra, of the ordinary structure, covering longitudinally the back of the
                    abdomen. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cantharis,</hi> Geoff. (Plate CCXXV1.
                    fig. 14), all the joints of the tarsi are entire, the thorax almost ovoid, a
                    little elongated, and restricted anteriorly, truncated posteriorly. The second
                    joint of the antennae is much shorter than the following, and the last of the
                    maxillary palpi is sensibly larger than the preceding. The head is a little
                    broader than the thorax. The antennae of the males are sometimes irregular, and
                    even semi-pectinated. The name of Cantharis is extremely ancient, and has been
                    received in a variety of acceptations. Aristotle did not apply it to any
                    particular insect, but to various Goleoptera.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p/></note> Linnaeus made use of the term to
                    designate a great genus of the same order, which, however, did not include the
                    true Cantharis, which he placed in <hi rend="italic">Meloe.</hi> Geoffroy
                    substituted the name <hi rend="italic">Cicindela,</hi> already otherwise
                    employed, for that of Cantharis, and placed in the latter the genuine Spanish
                    fly. Fabricius placed it in his genus <hi rend="italic">Lytta,</hi> which
                    corresponds to Cantharis of Geoffroy. The latter, however, amidst all these
                    revolutions of names, appears to have maintained its ground, and to have been
                    the most generally adopted.</p>
                <p>The Cantharides properly so called have an elongated and almost cylindrical form.
                    The history of the most noted species, <hi rend="italic">C. veswatoria,</hi>
                    commonly called the Spanish fly (fig. 14), is still somewhat doubtful, so far as
                    concerns our knowledge of its transformations. Neither De-gecr nor Geoffroy ever
                    saw the larva. Those who suppose themselves to have seen it say that it feeds on
                    various roots, and is metamorphosed in the earth,—an observation which accords
                    with the usually sudden appearance of the perfect insect, the unexpected
                    apparition of which has sometimes given rise to the belief that they migrated
                    from more southern regions. It is described by Olivier as consisting, in its
                    early state, of thirteen segments, soft, of a yellowish-white, with six short
                    scaly feet,—the head rounded andflattish, and furnished with two short filiform
                    antennae. The mouth consists of a pair of tolerably solid maxillae and four
                    palpi. The medicinal uses of this now celebrated beetle are universally known,
                    but its connection with the sanitory art is not traceable to a remote antiquity;
                    for the Cantharis of the ancients was certainly not the same as the Spanish fly,
                    and is even supposed to have belonged to a different genus. According to the
                    testimony of Pliny and Dioscoridcs, who affirm that the best Cantharides arc
                    such as are marked with transverse yellow bands, it becomes evident that their
                    species was the <hi rend="italic">Mylabris chicοrii</hi> already mentioned,
                    which in China is used for epispastic preparations down to the present day· The
                    insect of the European laboratories, <hi rend="italic">C. vesicatoriα,</hi> is
                    of a beautiful golden green, with black antennae. 1he males are less than the
                    females, and there exists in general a great variety of size among different
                    individuals. Diese insects are very common in France,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p/></note> Italy, and Spain. The greater
                    proportion employed in commerce come from the last-named country, and hence
                    their common name, lheir collection requires precaution on the part of those who
                    are employed in that office, both with a view to guard against injurious
                    accidents, and for the proper preservation of the objects themselves. They are
                    killed by means of vapour of vinegar, and completely dried after they are dead.
                    The following is the plan of procedure . In the course of the month of June the
                    natives place extended cloths or sheets beneath the trees on <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ι</hi>.which the Cantharides occur, and make them tumble'
                    down by beating all the branches. When they have obtained a considerable
                    quantity, they either put them into a hair sieve, which they place over the
                    vapour of vinegar, or into a fine cloth, which they dip repeatedly in a vessel
                    containing diluted vinegar. They are then allowed to dry under the shade of some
                    loft or granary, being placed on hurdles covered with cloth or paper, and
                    stirred occasionally with a stick, or with the hand protected by a stout glove.
                    When thoroughly dry they are packed into vessels of wood or glass, which are
                    afterwards carefully and tightly closed. These little processes being properly
                    attended to, the insects retain their blistering qualities for a length of
                    time.</p>
                <p>The chemical analysis of Cantharides has been made by numerous experimentalists,
                    who appear, however, to have confined their researches rather too exclusively to
                    the Spanish fly. Had they studied with equal assiduity the genera <hi
                    rend="italic">Meloe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mylabris,</hi> and even <hi
                    rend="italic">Cardbus, Cοc-ciηclla,</hi> and several <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tenebriones,</hi> they would have discovered in these also an analogous or
                    identical principle, less active perhaps in its nature, but for that very reason
                    susceptible of being employed with greater advantage in special cases.
                    Thouvenet, Fourcroy, Beaupoil, Orfila, and especially Robiquet, have arrived at
                    some remarkable results. The latter has demonstrated the existence of a
                    particular substance, on which he has bestowed the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cantharadine,</hi> and which may be characterized as white, crystalline,
                    insoluble in water, soluble in boiling alcohol, in ether, and in oils. It is the
                    seat of the vesicatorial or blistering property, which does not therefore reside
                    in the green oil, nor in the black insoluble matter, nor in the yellow matter
                    soluble in alcohol and in water,—the other ingredients of which analysis has
                    demonstrated the presence. This discovery, though important in a scientific
                    point of view, has produced no alteration in the practice, which proceeds
                    effectually enough upon the old experience, that when the substance of the
                    insect is reduced to powder, mixed up with some fatty matter, and applied to the
                    surface of the body, it immediately proceeds to action, and detaches the outer
                    skin from the dermis with great rapidity. It is also used for several other
                    purposes.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"/> Naturalists are
                    acquainted with many other species of Cantharis besides the Spanish fly. Of
                    these we may mention <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">Syriaca</hi> of
                    Olivier, which occurs in Syria and the south of Europe, and the <hi

                    the southern provinces of France, Italy, the Levant, and Siberia. In the United
                    States a species, described by Fabricius under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >vittata,</hi> is employed for medicinal purposes. It is found in great
                    abundance among potatoes.</p>

                    replaced by mammillae. The perfect insects occur among flowers and plants.
                    Latreille divides them into seven families. The larvae of the first four or five
                    most commonly live concealed in th,e interior of plants, and are generally
                    destitute of feet, or have these organs extremely small; many attack the hard or
                    ligneous portion of their dwelling. These Coleoptera are the largest of their

                    bestowed on this difficult family. Messrs Gennar and Schoenherr, more
                    particularly, have devoted their time to its elucidation; and the latter author
                    (in his <hi rend="italic">Curcnliοmdιιm Dlgpońtìo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Methodica,</hi> Leipsic, 1826) gives a hundred and ninety-four genera,
                    exclusive of sub-genera. He divides the Curculionidae, in accordance with the
                    straightness or geniculation of their antennae, into two great sections, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Rcctleornes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Or-thocera,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Fractìcornes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gonatoccra.</hi> The recent
                    observations of Μ. Leon Dufour on the internal structure of these insects seem
                    to strengthen the propriety of that classification. The species of the latter
                    section are furnished with salivary vessels, which are wanting in those of the
                    former. In Latreilles recent reconstruction of Schoenherr’s arrangement, the
                    Recticornes compose four tribes—the <hi rend="italic">Brucheies,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">Anthrlbldcs,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Attelabides,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">Brentidcs.</hi> In the first two the labrum and palpi are very
                    visible; these palpi are filiform or larger at the extremity; they are small and
                    conical in the two other tribes, as in all the following Rhyncho-phora. The
                    Fractìcornes form a fifth tribe, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Curcullonites.</hi>
                    These are divided into the <hi rend="italic">Brevirostres</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">Longìrostres,</hi> terms which bear relation to the place of
                    insertion of the antennae. In the former these organs are attached to the
                    extremity of the muzzle, or on a line with the base of the mandibles,—while they
                    are placed further back, or nearer the head, in the latter. The genera of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Brcvîrostres</hi> are arranged in three subtribes, viz. <hi

                    >Brachyceridcs,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Liparidss,</hi> —corresponding to the
                    genera Curculio, Brachycerus, and Liparus of Olivier; the last sub-tribe
                    comprising also some Lixi of that author. The relative size and form of the
                    mentum, the mandibles, the presence or absence of wings, the direction oí the
                    lateral sulci of the proboscis, in which the first joint of the antennae is
                    partly lodged, the length of that joint, and the proportions and forms oí the
                    thorax—these and other secondary considerations furnish the characters of the
                    various groups. The <hi rend="italic">C urculio&gt;ιltcs Longirostres</hi> are
                    divided into two principal sections, in accordance with their habits, and the
                    composition of their antennae. These consist, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phyllophagl,</hi> uí not fewer than ten joints, the last three of which, at
                    least, form the terminal club. But among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Spcrmatophagl</hi> the antennae never consist of more than nine joints, of
                    which the last or the last two form the club. The legs oí the Plιyllophagi are
                    sometimes contiguous and sometimes remote. Those in which they approach each

                <p>This numerous and widely extended family, so remarkable for the beauty of its
                    South American species, is easily recognised by its more or less extended
                    muzzle, terminated by a mouth, of which the parts, from their peculiar structure
                    and position, are not easily determined without the aid of microscopical
                    cxamination and dissection. The abdomen is generally of a bulky form, the
                    antennae geniculate and clavate, and the penultimate joint of the tarsi almost
                    always bilobate. In many tribes the posterior thighs are dentated. The body of
                    the larvae is oblong, and resembles a small white worm, exceedingly soft. The
                    head is squamous or scaly, and the fcet are either wanting or mammillaeform.
                    They live by gnawing the various parts of plants. Many dwell exclusively in the
                    interior of fruits and seeds, and do great damage to the farmer, grain-dealer,
                    and horticulturist. Some, such as the Brachyceri, are supposed to live beneath
                    the ground, and to feed on roots.</p>
                <p>The muzzle in this richly adorned family differs essentially from the <hi
                    rend="italic">rostrum of</hi> the hemipterous species. It is in fact merely a
                    prolongation of the head, and not composed of the parts of the mouth, as in the
                    last-named order. This prolongation, however, exerts an influence over the
                    alimentary tube, the oesophagus being thereby somewhat prolonged, and—as we find
                    to be the case in the truly suctorial tribes—there is also a provision of
                    salivary glands.</p>
                <p>We have little detailed information regarding the internal structure of the
                    Curculionidae. Two species <hi rend="italic">(Attelabus betuleti</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cryptorhynchus lapaŧhi)</hi> have been examined and described

                    <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> was moderately long, the stomach partially shaggy,
                    and the small intestine inversely claviform. In other respects, however, they
                    differed materially. There was no crop or gizzard in the former, the stomach was
                    fringed on each side, except at its upper extremity, with a series of small
                    caeca or shags, and there were three pair of bile-vessels; in the latter the
                    gullet was dilated into a crop, which included a gizzard of singular and
                    exquisite construction; for, though so minute as scarcely to exceed a large
                    pin’s head in size, it was found to be provided internally with more than four
                    hundred pairs of teeth, moved by an infinitely greater number of muscles. A
                    transverse section of this gizzard represented two concentric stars, with nine
                    rays each, the object of this structure being the comminution of the timber
                    which the insect has to perforate, and probably devour. The stomach was very
                    slender, but dilated in the middle into a spherical vesicle; and only two pairs
                    of bile vessels were observable.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>It may well be supposed, that in a family consisting of not much less than three
                    thousand ascertained species, many diversities occur both in habit and external
                    structure. The antennae are sometimes straight, but more frequently have an
                    angular bend. They are inserted either towards the extremity of the muzzle when
                    that organ is short, or nearer the centre, or even towards the base, in the long
                    snouted species. The number of the articulations of the antennae varies in
                    certain genera from six to ten; but eleven is the more usual number, or even
                    twelve, if we count the false or terminal article. The body is generally
                    narrowest in front, with a large abdomen covered by very hard elytra. The tarsi
                    are very frequently garnished beneath with short hairs. None of the species are
                    carnivorous in any degree; but even in the perfect state they are sometimes
                    extremely noxious, when they happen, as they sometimes do, to occur in great
                    abundance. They tap the buds and leaves of trees, and of several cultivated
                    vegetables, and feed upon their juices.</p>

                    formerly placed among the Heteromera, but which other natural affinities connect
                    more closely with the following genus. Those of which the antennae and eyes
                    resemble the last, but which present only four tarsal articulations, compose the

                    are filiform, frequently serrated or pectinated. The eyes are emarginate. The
                    anus is exposed, and the hind legs are frequently very large. 1 hese species
                    deposit their eggs in the yet tender germs of our leguminous plants, of our most
                    valuable grains or palms, coffee, &amp;c., where the excluded larvae occasion
                    infinite damage. The perfect insect detaches a portion of the epidermis in the
                    form of a cap, and, on issuing, produces those circular holes so often seen on
                    peas and beans. Such is a small species called <hi rend="italic">B.pisi</hi>
                    (see the figure last referred to), an insect which has been known to occasion
                    great injury in North America. A very large species, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >B.</hi><hi rend="italic">Bactris</hi> of Linn, occurs in Cayenne, where it
                    feeds on the fruit of <hi rend="italic">Cocos guinensis.</hi> It is named <hi

                    and bifid hooks to the tarsi. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Xylophilus</hi> of
                    Bonelli is characterized by clavate palpi.</p>
                <p>In the other tribes there is no apparent labrum. The palpi are very small,
                    inconspicuous to the naked eye, and of a conical form. The anterior prolongation
                    of the head represents a beak or trunk.</p>

                    the snout is elongated in the form of a proboscis. In' Rhynchites the latter is
                    somewhat widened at the end, and the abdomen is nearly square. In Apion, of
                    which Mr Stevens enumerates ninety-one species as indigenous to Britain, the

                    species of Brentus found in Europe, the <hi rend="italic">B. italiens,</hi>
                    which lives beneath the bark of trees, and generally, according to Savi the

                    beneath. The antennae are short, not much bent, and present externally only nine
                    joints, the last of which forms the club. These insects are destitute of wings,
                    and their body is very scabrous or uneven. They are characteristic of Southern
                    Europe and of Africa, live on the ground, in sandy soils, and appear very early
                    in the spring. The women of Ethiopia use one species as a sort of amulet,
                    passing a string through its body, and hanging it around their necks.<note

                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Curćulîó,</hi> Fab. almost the whole of the
                    under parts of the tarsi are furnished with short stiff hairs forming pellets,
                    and the penultimate article is deeply divided into two. The antennae are
                    composed of eleven articulations, or even of twelve, if we count the false one
                    by which they are sometimes terminated. The last form the club. This splendid
                    and extremely numerous genus, although greatly restricted by Fabricius, compared
                    with its vast extent in the system of Linnaeus, has been still more
                    circumscribed by authors of the present day. An enormous accession of species
                    having been discovered and described, these have been arranged by Germar,
                    Schoenherr, Megerle, Dejean, and others, into a corresponding variety of generic
                    groups, partly for the sake of convenience, and partly (though not entirely)
                    because the nature of the subjects required such systematic modifications.
                    Latreille’s observations have led him to form these Curculiones into two
                    principal divisions.</p>
                <p>Isŕ, Those in which the mentum, more or less widened superiorly, and more or less
                    orbicular, occupies the entire breadth of the cavity of the mouth, and wholly or
                    nearly conceals the maxillae,—and in which the mandibles have no very sensible
                    dentations, or merely exhibit a slight sinus underneath the point. The generic
                    groups are as follows. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyclomus</hi> the tarsi (as in
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Brachycerus)</hi> are unprovided with brushes, and the
                    penultimate articulation is entire, or very slightly notched, without distinct
                    lobes. In this genus Latreille would comprise those named <hi rend="italic"
                    >Crytoρs, Deracαnthus, Amycterus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cyclomus</hi> of
                    Schoenherr. The tarsi of all the others are furnished with brushes beneath, and
                    the penultimate joint is deeply bilobate. Some are apterous. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Curculio</hi> properly so called (Plate CCXXVI. fig. 18), the
                    lateral sulci of the proboscis are oblique and directed inferiorly. The anterior
                    legs differ little in their proportions from the following ones. The genus, even
                    thus restricted, comprises an immense number of groups, raised by Germar and
                    Schoenherr to the rank of genera, “dont les caractères,” says Latreille, “sont
                    peu importants et souvent très-equivoques.” <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> He
                    thinks that at most only those should be detached of which the antennae are

                    as a rare insect in the southern parts of England. The imperfect description of
                    this species given by Linnaeus, who appears, in some of his works, to confound
                    it with another insect, has rendered it rather difficult to identify his <hi

                    perplexed. From an inaccurately named specimen in the Linnaean cabinet, Marsham
                    was led to believe that it was the <hi rend="italic">Cur. ρini</hi> of that
                    illustrious observer, and he accordingly described it under that name in his <hi

                    insect which in fact belongs to a different genus. The larva inhabits the wood
                    of the Scotch fir, often proving very descructive to young plantations of that
                    tree. The manners of the perfect insect are well described by Linnaeus in his
                    peculiar style: "Tarde incedit, arcte apprehendit, tenaciter adhaeret, ore

                <p>Others have from three to four teeth upon the mandibles, the mentum abruptly
                    narrowed near its upper extremity, and truncated, the palpi very small or
                    imperceptible. The antennae terminate gradually in an elongated fusiform club.
                    The body has in most an analogous form. Olivier placed these insects in the
                    genus Lιxus, from which, in fact, they do not greatly differ. They compose the

                    beyond the origin of the mandibles, and often near the centre of the proboscis,
                    which is usually elongated. It comprises, with the exception of a few species,
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Lixιιs, Rhyηchceηus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Calandra</hi> or Fabricius. In the two former the antennae are composed of at
                    least ten articulations; they frequently consist of from eleven to twelve, of
                    which at least the last three form the club.</p>

                    characterized by a coriaceous epidermis and spongy extremity. These insects
                    live, at least in their larva state, on grain and ligneous substances. They form
                    the great genus <hi rend="italic">Calandra,</hi> now subdivided into the six

                    which seems to form the club, although it is probably also of a compound
                    structure. The four following are provided with wings. In the first three the
                    tarsi, in accordance with the almost universal and implied character of the
                    great <hi rend="italic">tetramerous</hi> section of which they form a part, are
                    all composed of four articulations, <hi rend="italic">of</hi> which the

                    inserted near the middle of a straight projecting proboscis,—their eighth joint
                    forming a greatly elongated and almost cylindrical club. The anterior legs are
                    longer than the others, at least in the males. Of this genus we may mention as
                    an example a well-known and singular-looking insect, found in Cayenne and
                    Brazil, called <hi rend="italic">R. barbirοs∙ tris,</hi> on account of a thick
                    yellowish-brown beard which envelopes the proboscis of the male, and gives it
                    somewhat the appearance of a bottle-brush. The female wants this kind of
                    garniture on her snout, and she was consequently mistaken by Illiger for a
                    separate species, and named <hi rend="italic">R. verrvrostris.</hi> In the genus

                    probably in most other northern countries. But in France and other continental
                    territories it is extremely injurious. This little creature measures about a
                    couple of lines in length, and is generally of a pitchy red, smooth, the thorax
                    deeply punctured. The elytra are rather narrower than the base of the thorax,
                    and do not cover the extremity of the abdomen. They are marked with deep striae,
                    punctured in the bottom. The legs are ferruginous. It is not in the perfect
                    state that this destroyer commits its ravages. The season for the deposition of
                    the eggs, and the periods of transformation, vary to a certain extent with the
                    temperature of particular seasons; but generally in the south of France, as we
                    are informed by M. Audouin, the female commences her maternal labours about the
                    month of April, and continues them till the autumn. She first buries herself in
                    a heap of grain, to the depth of some inches, and then commences to pierce their
                    envelope, probably by means of a little dart concealed beneath the lower portion
                    of the proboscis. The envelope is then raised, and a small hole bored, either in
                    an oblique direction, or parallel with the surface of the grain. A single hole
                    is made in each grain, and a single egg is laid in each hole, after which the
                    opening is closed by a glutinous matter, so nearly resembling the colour of the
                    grain, that it is extremely difficult to discover which is in a sound state, or
                    which contains the germ of an insidious foe. The injured grains may, however, be
                    detected by their floating when immersed in water, as well as by their feeling
                    lighter when fingered by a practised hand. The egg thus laid is soon hatched,
                    and gives birth to a very minute, white, soft, elongated worm, composed of nine
                    segments, with a rounded corneous head, furnished with two strong mandibles, by
                    means of which it daily enlarges its dwelling, fills its own stomach, and
                    empties the purse of the farmer or grain-merchant. Having attained the term of
                    its increase, it is transformed into a nymph, remains in that state for eight or
                    ten days, and is transformed into a perfect insect, which, piercing the envelope
                    of the grain, ere long produces in its turn a numerous progeny. The influence of
                    temperature, so general on insect life, is effective on this noted <hi

                    forty-five days may be stated as an average term between the union of the scxes

                    the old and unphilosophical belief prevailed of the spontaneous generation of
                    the lower tribes of animal life, it was thought sufficient to say that these
                    weevils were “engendered in the grain by humidity.” At an after period it was
                    thought by some who called themselves “observers”—(men of the same class with
                    those who settle all natural phenomena by a paragraph in a newspaper, which they
                    sign “Scrutator ),—that the perfect insect laid her eggs in the green ear, from
                    whence, when the fields were ripe for harvest, they were transported to the
                    stores of the granary. The accurate and inimitable Leeuwenhoeck <hi
                    rend="italic">{Continuatio Epistolarum,</hi> p. 56) dispelled these errors, and
                    taught us the tιuth of nature, of which he was ever so great an interpreter. As
                    each larva consumes only a single grain, we may form some idea of their power of
                    increase, from the vast quantity sometimes destroyed. According to the
                    calculation of Degeer, a single pair will produce (among themselves and their
                    descendants), in the course of a season, <hi rend="italic">twentythree thousand
                    six hundred</hi> individuals; so that, we may add, a few hundred weevils flying
                    through the grating of a granary, and settling among its treasured heaps, might
                    in the course of four or five months devour or destroy between <hi rend="italic"
                    >one and two hundred millions</hi> of grains. Various modes have been suggested
                    by economists and men of science to stay the progress of these destroyers. We
                    are not sure that any of them have been found Very efficacious. The most
                    approved is the following: When the principal body of grain is suspected, let a
                    small heap be placed apart in a corner, and the rest repeatedly stirred about
                    and disturbed. The weevils, which love repose and a quiet life, will leave their
                    usual domicils, and seek about for more peaceful dwellings. An instinct, which
                    the foresight of man in this instance renders unavailing, induces them to settle
                    on the smaller heap, and the shoveling of the main body being continued for some
                    days, a vast number may bc thus got quit of. Boiling water is then thrown upon
                    the congregated insects, which have sought rcfugc in what they deemed a place of
                    safety. As this process destroys only the perfect insects, and not thď eggs or
                    larva, neither of which care about being stirred up with any pole, however long,
                    it must be employed during the earliest heats of spring, and before the laying
                    of the eggs. It is said to succeed best when (whatever the principal store
                    consists of) the decoy heap is formed of barley, which, it seems, is a favourite
                    food of weevils. Reduction of temperature by ventilation has also been
                    recommended, as tending to diminish their productive powers; and Μ. Clement
                    thinks that dryness produced by lime may prove useful, by its tendency to
                    destroy the eggs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>‘ See

                <p>These exhibit a head formed in the ordinary way, without any obvious muzzle, or

                    brushes, the second and third being heart-shaped, the fourth deeply bilobed,
                    with a little swelling or nodule resembling an articulation at its base.<note

                    as pertaining o ıe great pentamerous section.</p></note> The ligula, borne upon
                    a short and transverse mentum, is generally membranous, heart-shaped, emarginate
                    or bifid,— in others corneous, and forming the segment of a very short and
                    transverse circle. The antennae are filiform or setaceous, generally at least as
                    long as the body, sometimes simple in both sexes, sometimes serrated, pectinated
                    or flabelliform, in the males. The eyes of a great number are reniform, and
                    surround the antennae at their base. The thorax is in the form of a trapezium,
                    narrowed anteriorly in such as have the eyes rounded, entire, or slightly
                    emarginate; in which case also the legs are long and slender, and the tarsi
                    lengthened. M. Leon Dufour has remarked that the Longicornes, in regard both to
                    the alimentary tube and the disposition of the hepatic vessels, generally
                    resemble the Melasoma, and, contrary to the opinion of M. Marcel de Serres, he
                    denies the existence of a gizzard. The alimentary canal, usually beset with
                    papillae, is preceded by a crop, which is smaller and less distinctly marked in
                    Lamia and Leptura, the concluding genera.</p>
                <p>1he larvae of almost all the Longicornes live in the interior or beneath the bark
                    of trees. They are either apodal, or provided with very inconspicuous legs.
                    Their body is soft, whitish, largest anteriorly, with a squamous head, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> furnished with strong mandibles, but without any
                    other projecting parts. They are extremely destructive to the larger forest
                    trees, piercing them to a considerable depth in all directions. A certain number
                    gnaw the roots of plants, ſhe abdomen of the female, in the perfect state, is
                    terminated by a tubular and corneous oviduct. Several species produce a sharpish
                    sound by rubbing a portion of the thorax against the pedicle which attaches the
                    base of the abdomen. Lister calls this sound <hi rend="italic">querulous,</hi>
                    while Dumeril compares it to the braying of an ass. It is on account of this
                    peculiarity that <hi rend="italic">Prionus</hi><hi rend="italic">coriarius</hi>
                    is known in Germany by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Fiddler. Of</hi> this
                    numerous and graceful family some are nocturnal, and frequent old woods and the
                    trunks of ancient trees; others occur on flowers and among flowering shrubs and
                    hedges, and are richly gilded and adorned with various colours ;— while all are
                    remarkable for their elongated bodies, their lengthened limbs, and their long
                    and delicately formed antennae. Several of the species are among the very
                    largest of the coleopterous tribes. The deficiency of wood in our northern
                    quarter of the island is a circumstance unfavourable to the frequent occurrence
                    among us of these lovers of “forest scenery.” Even of the English species
                    commonly so called, a few of the finest are probably not original inhabitants of

                    foreign timber, and have afterwards, when excluded in the perfect form,
                    contrived to wing their way, and colonize among our native woods. Their
                    characteristic position is in countries adjoining the equator (especially in
                    South America), and they seem to diminish both in size and number in proportion
                    to their distance from the torrid zone. Britain in general, and more especially
                    Scotland, are considerably to the north of the limit where these insects cease
                    to be common; and in other respects our island presents few local peculiarities
                    at all adapted to their increase. Yet the indefatigable Mr Stephens enumerates
                    about one hundred indigenous species of Longicornes, including, however, certain
                    genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Trogosita</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cucujus,</hi> which Latreille and others do not admit among the long-horned
                    tribes.</p>
                <p>According to the system by which we are at present guided, the Longicornes are
                    divisible in the first place into two sections.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">a.</hi></p>
                <p>In some the articulation of the palpi is in certain cases nearly in the form of a
                    cone, or reversed triangle; in others nearly cylindrical, and truncated at the
                    extremity. The terminal lobe of the maxillae is straight (not curved upon the
                    inner one at its extremity); the head generally projected or simply inclined,
                    and when, by a rare exception (as in <hi rend="italic">Dorcacerus),</hi> its
                    position is vertical, its breadth then nearly equals that of the body, and the
                    antennae are distant at their base, and spiny. The thorax, often unequal or
                    square, is rarely cylindrical. They are subdivisible into two lesser tribes as

                    the maxillae small or imperceptible. The antennae are inserted near the base of
                    the mandibles, or of the emarginatio∏ of the eyes, but are not surrounded by
                    them at their origin. The thorax is most frequently trapezoidal or square, and
                    notched or đentated on the sides.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Pλrandra</hi> of Lat. the antennae are simple,
                    almost granose, compressed, of the same size throughout, and at most as long as
                    the thorax; and the ligula is corneous, in the form of a short segment of a
                    circle, transverse, and without emargination. The body is depressed, and
                    parallelepiped, with the thorax square, rounded at the posterior angles, and
                    without any teeth or spines. These tribes are peculiar to America. In <hi

                    the antennae and maxillary lobes resemble those of the preceding; but the
                    ligula, as in all the ensuing Longicornes, is membranous. The thorax is almost
                    globular, without margins, and unarmed with teeth or spines. The species, which
                    are few in number, inhabit Europe, and their larvae occur in trees of the pine
                    tribe. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Prionus</hi><note anchored="true"

                    longer than the head and thorax,—serrated or pectinated in some, —simple,
                    attenuated towards the extremity, and with elongated articulations, in others.
                    The terminal lobe of the maxillae is at least as long as the first two
                    articulations of the palpi. The body is generally depressed, with the body
                    square or trapezoidal, and either toothed or spiny, or presenting a lateral
                    projecting angle. These insects are said to take wing only during the night or
                    evening. When reposing they occur on trees. Some exotic species are remarkable
                    for their great size, and their projecting mandibles. “C’est dans ce genre,”
                    observes M∙ Guerin, “qui sont les plus grands Coléoptères connus, puisque

                    number of generic groups; but Latreille regards the characters assigned for
                    their distinction as by no means sufficiently precise. We shall here notice the

                    rend="italic">Animal.</hi></p>
                <p>A considerable amount of species, all from South America, have the body
                    proportionally shorter and broader than those that follow, and are remarkable
                    for the extent of the thorax, which nearly equals half the length of the
                    abdomen. The anterior legs at least are distant at their base. The scutellum is
                    large in several species. The antennae are often pectinated, serrated, or spiny.
                    Those of this division, of which the thorax, nearly semi-orbicular and always
                    very large, is smooth or merely chagrined, with a single tooth on either side at
                    the posterior angles, —of which the posterior extremity of the praesternum is
                    plane, truncated, without emargination, or emarginate, and placed upon the
                    mesosternum,—of which the scutellum is always very large, and the legs distant
                    at their origin—form the two following genera . ’ — <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>In other groups of species, the thorax, sometimes square or cylindrical,
                    sometimes orbicular or nearly globular, is very much snorter than the elytra, at
                    least in those in which it is extended in breadth, and the praesternum presents
                    neither a carina nor pointed prolongation at its posterior extremity. The
                    scutellum is always small, and the legs are approximate at their origin.
                    Several, remarkable for their beautiful metallic colouring, and the agreeable
                    odour which they exhale, exhibit rather an anomalous character in regard to the
                    relative proportions of the palpi,—the maxillary being smaller than the labial,
                    and even shorter than the terminal lobe of the maxillae, which frequently
                    projects. The body is depressed, with the anterior of the head narrow and

                    Others, more characteristic of the western countries of the ancient continent,
                    form the genus <hi rend="italic">Purpuricenus</hi> of Ziegler and Dejean. An

                    square or a little dilated in the middle, or oblong and almost cylindrical; it
                    is often rugose or tuberculated laterally. They compose the genus <hi

                    grubs, that disputed question still remains obscure. Latreille places in this
                    niche of the entomological system various Callichromae (so called) of Dejean,
                    with a smooth or but slightly unequal thorax. Most of them belong to South
                    America. They are in general beautifully ornamented by the hand of nature,
                    though their size is small. Some are singularly distinguished by one or more
                    little globular tufts of hair upon the antennae, and even the hind legs of
                    certain species are similarly adorned. The thighs of these insects (some of

                    more narrow, nearly cylindrical, and simply dilated and rounded in the centre.
                    The palpi, always very short, are terminated by an article rather thicker and
                    broader than the preceding ones, and in the form of a reversed triangle. These

                    Dejean, <hi rend="smallcaps">Clitus</hi> of Fabricius, and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    British species..</p>
                <p>Latreille concludes our present tribe of insects with certain species, which, in
                    regard to the palpi, the form of the head, thorax, and elytra, and their general
                    proportions, offer some remarkable and anomalous characters. He commences with
                    such as present a thorax analogous to that of the preceding, especially the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Certallum.</hi> It is as broad as the head, and as the
                    base of the elytra, or scarcely narrower, and is either almost cylindrical, or
                    rounded, or nearly orbicular; in both cases wider near the middle. The terminal
                    articulation of the palpi is sometimes attenuated near the end, and terminated
                    in a point, sometimes thicker and truncated, and obconical. All the thighs are
                    clubbed, and supported by an abrupt, slender, and lengthened pedicle. The elytra
                    of the greater number are either very short, or abruptly narrowed at a little
                    distance from their base, and then subulate.</p>
                <p>In the genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Obrium</hi> of Megerle, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Riiinotragus</hi> of Dalman, the elytra do not exhibit those
                    peculiar forms; but in Necydalis, Linn, those parts are either very short and
                    scale-like, or prolonged, as usual, as far as the extremity of the abdomen, and
                    abruptly contracted a little beyond their origin, then greatly narrowed, and
                    terminated in a point. They do not resemble the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >AEdemerae,</hi> with which they were arranged by Fabricius, except in the form
                    of the elytra. They are divisible into two minor groups. For example, those with

                <p>Certain insects, for the most part proper to the African islands, to New Holland,
                    New Ireland, and New Zealand, present some ambiguous characters; and, according
                    to Latreille, ought perhaps, in a natural order, to be placed between the
                    Lamiariae and the Lepturetae. In the mean time, however, he concludes with them
                    the tribe Cerambycini. The palpi are almost filiform, with the terminal
                    articulation nearly cylindrical, slightly attenuated towards the base. The
                    tlιorax is usually smooth, or but slightly uneven, without acute tubercles, is
                    widened posteriorly, or presents the form of a trapezium or of a truncated cone.
                    The abdomen is almost in the form of a reversed triangle in the greater number,
                    and the elytra are truncated at the extremity. They form four genera, viz. <hi

                <p>The head is vertical and the palpi filiform, or scarcely larger at their
                    extremity, and terminated by an article more or less ovoid, and tapering to a
                    point. The exterior lobe of the maxillae is a little narrowed at the extremity,
                    and curved upon the inner division. The antennae are most frequently setaceous
                    and simple, and the thorax, exclusive of the lateral tubercles or spines, is
                    nearly of an equal width throughout. Some species are apterous,—a character not
                    exhibited by any other division of the family.</p>
                <p>Our present tribe, in the system ofLatreille, is composed of the genera <hi

                    provided on •each side with a moveable tubercle, terminated by a point or spine.
                    The body is flattened, with the thorax transversal; the antennae are long and
                    slender; the anterior legs much longer than the others, especially in the males;
                    anil the elytra are truncated at the end, and terminated by two teeth, of which
                    the exterior is the strongest. The singular species above named, of which the
                    colours present an agreeable mixture of grey, red, and black, is known to the
                    French colonists by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Harlequin</hi> of Cayenne.
                    It is a very large insect. The <hi rend="italic">Prionus accentifer</hi> of
                    Olivier pertains to the same genus.</p>
                <p>All the other Lamiariae are referable to the great genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Lamia</hi> (Plate CCXXVH. fig. 4), which, however, has been extensively
                    subdivided in modern times. A great number of species, chiefly from South
                    America, of which the legs are robust and the tarsi much dilated, fall under the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Acanthocinus</hi> of Megerle and Dejean. Not more
                    than three species are known in Europe. Of these we received <hi rend="italic"
                    >A. eεdilis</hi> (called the <hi rend="italic">Carpenter</hi> in France), from a
                    wood near Inverness; and Sir Thomas Dick Lauder informs us that he likewise took
                    it in a forest of that northern county. Specimens from the neighbourhood of
                    Kirkaldy are preserved in the collection of Sir Patrick Walker. The species is
                    remarkable for the great extent of the antennae, which in the males are four
                    times the length of the body. It is characteristic of northern countries, and
                    most of the British examples have occurred in Scotland. “Habitat frequens,” says
                    Linnaeus, writing in reference to Sweden, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> in

                    neighbouring countries of Asia. Their antennae are generally shorter than the
                    body, with their articulations in the form of a reversed cone, which gives them
                    a knotted aspect. A species common on the continent of Europe <hi rend="italic"
                    >(^Cer. fuligiηator,</hi> Linn.) is almost exclusively confined to calcareous
                    soils.</p>
                <p>Other Lamiariae have the thorax cylindrical, and unfurnished with tubercles or
                    spines. The body is always elongated,—in some almost linear. They compose the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Saperda</hi> of Fab., which has been greatly
                    subdivided. We have several British species, of which we shall here name only

                    with a yellowish ashy down, spotted with black, and the antennae coloured

                    sometimes proves injurious to plantations of that tree.</p>

                <p>The eyes are rounded, entire, or scarcely emarginate, and the antennae are then
                    inserted forwards, or at most at the anterior extremity of that feeble
                    emargination. The head is always inclined, prolonged posteriorly behind the eyes
                    in several, or abruptly narrowed into a neck-like form at its junction with the
                    thorax. This last part is conical or trapezoidal, and narrowed anteriorly. The
                    elytra become gradually narrower from the base. This tribe corresponds to the
                    genus <hi rend="italic">Leptura</hi> of Linnaeus, with the exception of a few
                    species which fall more naturally among the preceding tribes, and also of suçh
                    as belong to the more modern genus <hi rend="italic">Oonaeia.</hi> We shall here
                    notice only a few of the genera which, as native to our own island, are the most
                    likely to interest the British naturalist.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Rhagium</hi> (of which we have three indigenous
                    species) (Plate CCXXVIL fig. 6), the antennae are simple, and at most not more
                    than half the length of the body. The terminal articulation of the palpi forms a
                    triangular club. The head is large, almost square, with the eyes entire. The
                    sides of the thorax are furnished with a conical or spinous tubercle. In the

                    eminences from which they spring are almost confounded in one plane. The thorax
                    is almost always smooth, or without lateral tubercles. The majority of the genus
                    occur in Europe, and Britain produces about a score. Few of them have yet
                    occurred in Scotland, probably owing to our comparative deficiency in wood. We
                    have met with only one species in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh, <hi

                <p>FAMILY V—EUPODΛ.</p>
                <p>Some of the component parts of this family are nearlj allied to the Longicornes
                    or preceding tribes, while others so much resemble the Chrysomelae as to have
                    been arranged with the latter by Linnaeus. The organs of manducation present the
                    same range of affinities. Thus among the Donaciae, the ligula is membranous,
                    bifid 01 bilobed, as among the Longicornes, and their maxillae an very analogous
                    to those of the latter; while among the concluding Eupoda the ligula is almost
                    square or rounded, and analogous to that of the ensuing family, callee <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cyclica.</hi> At the same time the maxillary lobes are
                    membranous, or but slightly coriaceous, whitish, or of a yellowish hue; the
                    exterior expands towards the extremity and has not the figure of a palpus,—a
                    feature which allies our present family rather to that which we have lei than to
                    the one which follows. The body is more or less oblong, with the head and thorax
                    narrower than the ab domen. The antennae are filiform, or gradually enlarg(
                    towards the extremity, and are inserted before the eyes These are in some
                    entire, round, and projecting, in other slightly emarginate. The head is
                    received posteriorly bj the thorax, which is cylindrical, or in the form of a
                    trans verse square. The abdomen may be called large wheι compared with the other
                    parts, and forms a lengthene&lt; square, or elongated triangle. The
                    articulations of th&lt; tarsi, excepting the terminal one, are furnished beneatl
                    with little cushions, and the penultimate is bifid or bilob cd. The posterior
                    thighs are very large in many species <pb break="no"

                    that character that the family derives its name. They are all winged insects,
                    and occur on the stems and leaves of various plants, especially, so far at least
                    as many of the European species are concerned, on the liliaceous tribes. The
                    larvae of the Donaciae feed on the internal portion of the roots of aquatic
                    plants. Those of other genera live exposed, but, after the manner of the
                    Cassidae, cover themselves with a case or scabbard formed of their own
                    excrementitious matter. Latreille divides the family into two tribes.</p>

                    are among the richest and most beautiful of the coleopterous tribes. There is
                    something striking in their gigantic limbs, and their colours consist of

                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Donacia,</hi> Fab. (Plate CCXXVH. fig. 8), the
                    posterior thighs arc large and inflated. The antennae are of equal size
                    throughout, and composed of lengthened articulations. The eyes are entire, and
                    the terminal joint of the tarsi is inclosed, for the greater part of its length,
                    by the lobes of the preceding articulation. This interesting genus was
                    confounded with <hi rend="italic">Leptura</hi> by Linnaeus and Degeer, and with
                    <hi rend="italic">Stenochorus</hi> by Geoffroy. It was established by Fabricius
                    under its present name, from δovαξ, <hi rend="italic">a reed,</hi> on account of
                    the species of which it is composed being found on reeds and other aquatic
                    plants, such as those of the genus Iris, Saggitaria, Nymphaea, &amp;c. to which
                    they cling with great tenacity, and on the roots of which the larvae are
                    supposed to feed. In the form of their bodies and antennae they show an alliance
                    to the Cerambycidae, but their habits, and the structure of the cibarian organs,
                    ally them still more closely to <hi rend="italic">Crioceris</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Galeruca.</hi> They are frequently bronzed or gilded in their
                    aspect, and are covered in some cases by a fine silky down, w hich is supposed
                    to prove useful to them when they fall into the water. Indeed, even in the
                    perfect state, they are partly aquatic, and may be seen to seek repose and
                    shelter on the under side of the leaf of a water lily, where they are
                    necessarily submerged. According to Μ. A. Brongnĩart, the chrysalids are
                    attached to their filaments by one edge only. M. Leon Dufour inclines to think,
                    in consequence of anatomical investigation, that the Donaciae ought to be formed
                    into a particular family. His observations, as we are informed by M. Latreille,
                    demonstrate that their hepatic vessels, in number, form, structure, and
                    arrangement, constitute a very remarkable exception to those of the Tetramera in
                    general, and one which even appears peculiar to the genus. These vessels only
                    open into the chylific ventricle, while in all the other Ťetramera which M.
                    Dufour has dissected, they have two insertions, one of which is ventricular, and
                    the other caecal. These biliary ducts, which are only four in number, are of two
                    different kinds, —the first are capillary, and disposed in two strongly flexed
                    curves, and are inserted by four distinct ends into a short obround vesicle
                    placed at the inferior and somewhat lateral extremity of the chylific
                    ventricle,—the others are much shorter, thicker, more dilatable, thin, and
                    tapering at both ends, with one extremity free, and separately inserted by the
                    other into the superior and dorsal region of the ventricle. They contain a
                    whitish pulp, which is regarded as an alimentary substance. The oesophagus is
                    capillary, and has no dilatation in the form of crop. The ċhylific ventricle is
                    beset with projecting papillae.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    great amount, when we consider that Dejean’s Catalogue contains only twenty-six
                    in all. The genus may be regarded as characteristic of Europe, for scarcely any
                    occur in other countries, although a few have been collected in America.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Crioceris</hi> properly so called, differs from
                    the preceding in the posterior legs being scarcely, if at all, larger than the
                    others. The antennae become somewhat enlarged towards the extremity, are almost
                    granose, with their articulations not much longer than broad. The eyes are
                    elevated and emarginate, and the posterior extremity of the head forms a kind of
                    neck behind these latter organs. These insects are of small size, their bodies
                    narrow and elongated, and frequently ornamented with lively colours. They live
                    on the leaves of various plants,—Liliaceae, Asparagi, &amp;c. and occur in
                    gardens and meadows. When seized they produce a sharpish sound, by rubbing the
                    superior extremity of the abdomen against the inferior extremity of the elytra.
                    The larvae feed on the same plants as those on which we usually find the perfect
                    insects, and are somewhat adhesive or tenacious by means of their six scaly
                    feet. Their bodies are soft, short, and inflated; and they protect themselves in
                    that early state from the action of the sun and the changes of the season, by
                    covering their backs with their own ordure. They occupy a subterranean position
                    in the nympha state. The species are extremely numerous as the genus was
                    originally constituted, but it has been greatly restricted in recent times. Mr
                    Stephens gives seven as the amount of British species. Of these not above three
                    have yet been found in Scotland. <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>In others the mandibles, instead of tapering to a point, as in the two preceding
                    genera, are truncated. The palpi are terminated by a strongly inflated joint,
                    truncated, with a small angular prolongation, exhibiting the appearance of
                    another joint. The antennae are slender, and composed, of very long and almost
                    cylindrical articulations. Such is the" genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Megascelis</hi> of Dejean and Lat. (Plate· CCXXVII. fig. 9), peculiar to South
                    America.</p>

                <p>FAMILY VI—CYCLICA.</p>
                <p>In this family the first three joints of the tarsi are still spongy, or furnished
                    beneath with pellets, the penultimate joint divided into two lobes, and the
                    antennae filiform, or a little larger towards the extremity; but the body is
                    usually rounded, with the base of the thorax as broad as the elytra in such (and
                    these are few in number) as are of an oblong form. The exterior division of the
                    maxilhc, in its narrow and almost cylindrical form, and darker colour, presents
                    the appearance of a palpus; the interior division is broader and destitute of a
                    scaly tooth. The bgula is almost square or oval, entire, or slightly emarginate.
                    It appears from the anatomical researches of M. Leon Dufour, that the alimentary
                    canal is at least thrice the length of the body in such of the genera as have
                    been examined; that the oesophagus is usually inflated behind the crop; and that
                    the chylific ventricle, or stomach, is generally smooth, at least throughout a
                    great part of its length. The biliary apparatus resembles that of the
                    Ccrambycidae and other Longicornes, in the number and double insertion of the
                    vessels of which it is composed ;—these amount to six, two of which (except in
                    the genus Cassida) are for the most part shorter and more slender. The larvae
                    have six feet; their bodies are soft, and frequently coloured. They feed, like
                    the perfect insect, on the leaves of plants, to which they adhere by means of a
                    viscid humour. Some enter the earth prior to their assumption of the nympha
                    state, w hile others undergo that change attached to the plants on which they
                    feed, and partly encompassed by the exuviae of the larva. The perfect insects
                    are of small size, but they are frequently adorned by brilliant colours and
                    metallic splendour. They are slow and timorous in their general movements, and
                    when attempted to be seized, they closely fold their feet and antennae, and drop
                    to the ground. Several species are good leapers, and the females are extremely
                    prolific. Latreille divides this family into three tribes, according to the mode
                    in which the antennae are inserted.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 1st, Cassidariae.</hi></p>
                <p>These have the antennae inserted on the superior part of the head, and
                    approximate, straight, short, filiform, and almost cylindrical, or increasing
                    gradually towards the extremity. The mouth, situate altogether underneath, and
                    with very short almost filiform palpi, is sometimes arched (cintrée), sometimes
                    partially received into the cavity of the praesternum. The eyes are ovoid or
                    round; the legs contractile and short, with the tarsi flattened,— the lobes of
                    the penultimate articulation entirely inclosing the terminal one. The body being
                    flat beneath, these insects, by the disposition of their tarsi, are enabled to
                    adhere closely to the surface of vegetation, and to remain there immoveable; in
                    other respects the body is generally orbicular or oval, and is margined all
                    round, or overlapped, by the thorax and elytra. The head is concealed beneath
                    the thorax, or is received into its anterior emargination. The colours are
                    extremely varied, and are distributed in the form of spots and radiated
                    markings, in a manner delightful to look upon. The larvae present a less
                    inviting aspect, and have the instinctive habit of covering themselves with
                    their own excretions.</p>
                <p>In the old genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hispa,</hi><note anchored="true"

                <p>and the antennae are filiform, and borne projecting forwards. These insects now

                    10), and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hispa</hi> properly so called (ibid. fig. 11)∙</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cassida,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>From <hi rend="italic">cassida,</hi> a helmet.</p></note>
                    Linn, and Fab. (Plate CCXXVII. fig. 12), is distinguished from the preceding by
                    the orbicular or almost ovoid form of the body, which, however, in a small
                    number is nearly square. The thorax, more or less semicircular, or in the form
                    of the segment of a circle, entirely covers and conceals the head, or incloses
                    it in its anterior emargination. The elytra, often elevated about the region of
                    the scutellum, project over the body. The mandibles are furnished with not fewer
                    than four teeth, and the external maxillary lobe is at least as long as the
                    internal. The name by which the insects of this genus are distinguished was no
                    doubt bestowed upon them on account of a strongly marked character in their
                    structure. The edges of the thorax and elytra overlap and protect the limbs and
                    abdomen on all sides, and the head is also nearly covered and concealed by the
                    prothorax. Many of the species are highly ornamental, and present pleasing
                    combinations of green and golden hues, which, however, soon disappear or
                    diminish in intensity after the death of the insect, but may be temporarily
                    restored by the use of hot water. These insects are herbivorous in their habits,
                    and are fond of artichokes and thistles. The structure and habits of the larvae
                    are rather singular, and have been studied and described by Goedart, Roesel,
                    Réaumur, and Degeer. They are flattish, rather broad, and beset laterally by
                    sixteen branched spines placed horizontally on each side of the posterior and
                    superior portion of the body. At the base of these spines may be observed seven
                    small cylindrical truncated tunnels, each placed on a distinct segment. These
                    are probably the stigmatic openings. The head is small, of a corneous
                    consistence, and presents four small tubercles on each side of its superior
                    part, and only three on its inferior. These are regarded by Degeer as genuine
                    eyes. Six scaly feet terminated by a brown-coloured hook, sustain the body,
                    which is terminated by a two-branched fork, curved oveι the back, and usually
                    bearing a pile of excrementitious matter, under which the larva lies in part
                    concealed. Il can elevate or depress this “stercorareous parasol” al pleasure,
                    for the varying purposes of shade or shelter. The nymph is shorter than the
                    larva, broad, flattened, ol an oval form, and surrounded by peculiar appendages.
                    I∣ has an ample thorax, terminated by a circular arch, and furnished with
                    similar points or appendages. The legs and the segments of the abdomen are
                    perceptible. It was in the aspect of one of these nympħae that Goedart supposed
                    he recognised a representation of the human figure surrounded by an imperial
                    crown. The genus Cassida presents an immense amount of species. About twenty are
                    indigenous to Britain, several more occur on the continent of Europe, and,
                    including exotic species, Dejean enumerates 103 as the amount (in 1821) of his
                    ther splendid, and now (1834) unrivalled collection of Coleop· tera.</p>

                    when viewed from above, as if truncated in front, or deprived of the head. The
                    terminal articulation of the palpi is always ovoid.</p>

                    remarkable for its entomological riches. In a state of repose they draw in their

                    5</hi> of Kirby (Plate CCXXVH. fig. 14), the body is almost globular, very
                    smooth and convex, and the thorax extremely short, broad, gradually raised, and
                    slightly lobate at the middle of its posterior margin.</p>
                <p>In other groups, the antennae, perceptibly longer than the head and thorax, are
                    simple and filiform, or enlarged towards the extremity, or even terminated by a
                    club,—in which case they are generally toothed like a saw, but only from the
                    seventh joint. In several the body is oval, and narrowed in front. The last
                    article of the antennae is furnished with an appendage, so as to produce an
                    appearance of twelve joints. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cryptocephalus</hi> properly so called, the body is cylindrical, and the thorax
                    as broad as the abdomen throughout its length. The antennae and palpi are of the
                    same size throughout. We have above a score of species in Great Britain. In the
                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Eumolpus</hi> of Kugelan the body is narrowed in
                    front, and almost ovoid. The mandibles are of ordinary size, and the second
                    joint of the antennae is shorter than that which follows. Almost all of them are
                    exotic, although a few are found in Europe, of which <hi rend="italic">E.
                    vitis,</hi> Fab. and certain others, are said to occur in England. According to
                    Geoffroy, the larva of the last-named insect is extremely destructive to
                    vineyards.</p>
                <p>We now approach the second great genus of the present tribe, that called <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrysomela</hi> by Linnaeus. Of its modern reconstruction we shall
                    likewise present the reader with a general sketch. The body of these insects is
                    usually ovoid or nearly ovular, with the head salient, projecting or merely
                    inclined. The antennae are simple, about half the length of the body, and most
                    frequently granosc, and insensibly enlarged. When the great Swedish naturalist
                    established his extensive genus Chrysomela, he included within its somewhat too
                    ample boundaries numerous groups, which the more precise observation and richer
                    materials of later entomologists have caused to be erected into separate genera.
                    It is thus that we owe <hi rend="italic">Erotylus, Colaspis, ĩunÅAdorium</hi> to
                    Fabricius, <hi rend="italic">Eumolpus</hi> to Kungelman, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Helodes</hi> to Paykul, <hi rend="italic">Doryphora</hi> to Illiger, and <hi
                    rend="italic">Paropsis</hi> to Olivier,—besides several others, to the origin of
                    which we need not here particularly allude. Many of the species of this gcnus
                    are among the most beautiful and highly adorned of all the insect tribes. Azure,
                    and green, and gold, form their ordinary costume; and to that lustrous aspect,
                    combined with their compact and rounded forms, they no doubt owe their title of
                    <hi rend="italic">Chrysomela,</hi> which in the Greek language signifies an
                    apple of gold.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The word
                    <hi rend="italic">chrysomelum,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">χζυσos, gold,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">μnλta, an apple,</hi> denoted in ancient times a fruit
                    with a yellow rind, and was deemed by Linaeus sufficiently applicable to the
                    insects of our present genus, on account of their rounded form and brilliant
                    colouring.</p></note> These insects are of small or medium size. Few of them
                    measure more than half an inch in length, and the greater number do not equal
                    that dimension. They are strictly herbivorous, and sometimes commit considerable
                    ravages on agricultural and garden produce. The larvae have in general six feet,
                    an elongated body, beset with warts or tubercles, and terminated by a kind of
                    nipple, which secretes a viscous fluid, used both in walking, and in order to
                    fix the insect firmly before its conversion to the nympha state. Their
                    transformations usually take place in the open air, in which case they are
                    protected by the hardening of their natural envelope. Many of the species are
                    gregarious, while others are solitary; and it is among the latter that such
                    occur as undergo their metamorphoses under ground. We shall now enumerate the
                    principal generic groups into which the old genus Chrysomela has been
                    subdivided.</p>
                <p>In some the body is always ovoid, or nearly oval, and furnished with wings; the
                    palpi terminate in a point. These insects resemble the Eumolpi already
                    mentioned, and differ from the ensuing Chrysomelinae in their filiform antennae,
                    which are longer than half the length of the body, composed of elongated nearly
                    cylindrical articles, of which the eleventh or terminal bears an appendage or
                    false joint nearly half as long as the article itself. Such are <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Colaspis,</hi> Fab. which have no projection of the
                    mesosternum; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Podontia,</hi> Dalman, in which that part
                    projects in the form of a short and conical point, the end of which is received
                    into a posterior emargination of the praesternum.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Dalman’s <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides
                    Entomologicoe.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>In the following groups the antennae are short, composed of articulations in the
                    form of a reversed cone, or more or less nearly granose, and enlarged towards
                    the extremity. The false joint or terminal appendage is very short and
                    indistinct. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Phyllochaŗis</hi> of Dalman there
                    is no mesosternal projection; but in <hi rend="smallcaps">Doryphora</hi><note

                    Illiger (Plate CCXXVH. fig. 15), that part is advanced like a distinct horn. The
                    former genus inhabits New Holland and the island of Java,—the latter is peculiar
                    to South America. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Paropsis,</hi><note

                    (ibid. fig. 16), is distinguished from all the rest of the family by the
                    maxillary palpi, of which the terminal article is much larger than the others,
                    and hatchet-shaped. These insects, in so far as entomological research has yet
                    extended, secm peculiar to New Holland. The two genera next ensuing interest our
                    native naturalists as abundant over Britain. The terminal article <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193747650?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7650-0184"/> of their palpi
                    is also well distinguished from the preced- ’ ing, to which it is equal, if not
                    larger, in size,—its form being more or less semi-ovoid. Ihese insects are
                    widely spread over most parts of the ancient continent, especially Europe. In
                    the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Timarcha</hi> of Megerle and Dejean (Plate
                    CCXXVH. fig. 17), the species are few in number, and apterous. The elytra are
                    joined together, the body gibbous, and the tarsi much dilated, especially in the
                    males. They occur on the ground in woods, fields, and by the sides of highways.
                    Their movements are slow and heavy, and a yellowish or reddish liquor frequently
                    exudes from their articulations. Linnaeus classed a well-known species of this
                    genus (7 <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. <hi rend="italic">tenebricosa)</hi> as
                    a tenebrio. It has been dissected by M. Leon Dufour, and exhibited an intestinal
                    tube three times the length of the body. It presented no appearance of a crop;
                    and the stomach, which was long and folded on itself, contained no sensible
                    papillae: some small transverse muscular bands were just discernible. The
                    stomach is followed by a filiform intestine, then bv an oblong caecum, bordering
                    on the rectum. As far as our own observation has extended, the species, with a
                    few exceptions from the north of Africa, seem confined to Europe. In the genus
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Chrysomela</hi> properly so called (Plate CCXXVH. fig. 18),
                    the species are all provided with wings, and the terminal article of the palpi
                    is as large or larger than the preceding ones, and in the form of a truncated
                    ovoid, or reversed cone. The species of this delightful genus are extremely
                    numerous, even in its now restricted state. Comte Dejean was many years ago in
                    possession of 120 species, and we know that his collection has recently been
                    much augmented. Even in Britain we possess about thirty species, exclusive of
                    fourteen kinds of <hi rend="italic">Phcedoη</hi> and six of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Melasoma,</hi> genera so nearly allied in structure and economy, that some
                    authors do not yet distinguish them from the Chrysomelae strictly so called. We
                    regret that within our present limits we cannot describe the species. We shall
                    merely tnention that we lately received one of the largest and most beautiful,
                    <hi rend="italic">C.</hi><hi rend="italic">fulgida,</hi> from the valley of
                    Clova in Forfarshire. It was previously unknown in Scotland. Another species of

                    the broom, has of late years been taken occasionally in Wales·<note

                    intermediate dorsal segments of the larva of this species there is a pair of
                    black, elevated, conical tubercles, of a hard substance, from all of which when
                    touched it emits a small drop of a white milky fluid, the smell of which,
                    according to Degeer, is almost insupportable, being inexpressibly strong and
                    penetrating. These drops proceed at the same instant from all the eighteen scent
                    organs, which then present a singular spectacle. The precious fluid, however, is
                    by no means wasted wļien exercised, for each drop, after a momentary appearance,
                    during which it dispenses its perfume, is withdrawn again within its receptacle,
                    till again required. (See Degeer, t. v. p. 291; and Kirby and Spence’s <hi

                    white dead-nettle,—of the latter, <hi rend="italic">P. Phellandrii</hi> and <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 3d, Galerucitae.</hi></p>
                <p>Characterized by the antennae being always at least half as long as the body, of
                    the same thickness throughout, or insensibly enlarged towards the extremity,
                    insert, ed between the eyes, at a short distance from the mouth, and usually
                    approximate at their base, and close upon a small longitudinal carina. The
                    maxillary palpi, thickest towards the middle, are terminated by two joints of a
                    conical form, but opposed or united by their base, the terminal one being either
                    truncated, or obtuse, or pointed. The body is sometimes ovoid or oval, sometimes
                    nearly hemispherical. Several, especially of the smaller kinds, have the
                    posterior thighs very large, which gives them the power of leaping. They form
                    the old genus <hi rend="italic">Gaheruea.</hi></p>
                <p>Latreille divides these insects into two principal groups, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isopodes,</hi> or such as cannot leap, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anisοpοdes,</hi> or such as possess that faculty.</p>
                <p>To the former belong the genera <hi rend="smallcaps">Adorium,</hi> Fab., of which
                    the species are foreign; <hi rend="smallcaps">Luperus,</hi> Geoff’., of which we
                    possess two British species; and. <hi rend="smallcaps">Galeruca</hi> properly so
                    called, of which our indigenous kinds are more abundant, and which is likewise
                    extremely numerous both in Asia and America. <hi rend="italic">G. tanaceti</hi>

                    leaves of plants, and are familiarly known by the name of garden fleas. South

                    Many subdivisions have been proposed of the old genus just named. Of these,
                    Latreille admits as established groups the genera <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Octogonotes</hi> of Drapiez,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    Lat., and <hi rend="smallcaps">Altica</hi> properly so called. The last-named
                    genus is the most frequent and best known in Britain. The species are of small
                    dimensions, and occur in great numbers during the spring in humid places, and
                    are extremely destructive both in the larva and perfect state to pot-herbs and
                    other garden produce. The larvae resemble those of Chrysomela and Criocerĩs, and
                    some of them are remarkable for discharging an odorous and acid fluid from
                    certain small tubercles on their backs. The nymphae bear a likeness to those of

                <p>FAMILY VIL—CLAVIPALPI.</p>
                <p>The insects of this family resemble the others of the same section in having the
                    under part of the first three articulations of the tarsi furnished with brushes,
                    and the penultimate bifid,—but they are distinguished from them by their
                    antennae, which are terminated by a distinct perfoliated club, and by their
                    maxillae armed on the inner side with a claw or corneous tooth. A few have the
                    articles of the tarsi entire, but they still differ from other Tetramera with
                    analogous tarsi, in their globular or ball-like form. In this family the body
                    is· usually rounded, frequently even very convex and hemispherical. The antennae
                    are shorter than the body, the mandibles emarginatß or dentated at the
                    extremity, and the palpi terminated by a large joint; the last joint of the
                    maxillary palpi is very large, transverse, compressed, almost lunate. The form
                    of the organs of manducation indicates that these insects are gnawers; and most
                    of the European species occur on tree fungi, beneath bark, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Some have the penultimate joint of the tarsi bilobed, and are not contracted like
                    a ball. Of these, a certain number have the last article of the maxillary palpi
                    transverse, and almost lunate or securiform. Such are the following genera. <hi

                    almost cylindrical, and the terminal club oblong. The corneous interior division
                    of the maxillae is terminated by two teeth. They are peculiar to South

                    almost granose, and terminate in a shorter and ovoid club. The interior division
                    of the maxillae is membranous, with a single small terminal tooth, lhe
                    hemispherical or rounded species form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Tripl ax</hi> of that author.</p>
                <p>The remainder of this little group have the last article of the maxillary palpi
                    elongated, and more or less oval. Such are <hi rend="smallcaps">Languria</hi> of
                    Lat., of which the species are strangers to Europe; and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Piīalacrus</hi> of Paykul <hi rend="italic">(Amsoto-</hi> rø«, liliger and
                    Fab.). The latter genus contains certain small shining hemispherical insects,
                    frequently found on flowers. They pass the winter under moss or beneath the ark
                    of trees, where they probably also undergo their metamorphosis. Their general
                    colours are brown or black; <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> eιr movements are
                    rapid, and they arc with difficulty cιzed or retained, on account of their
                    smooth and polished surface. They differ from the last-named exotic genus, not
                    only in their general form, but in the club of their antennae being composed of
                    three instead of five articulations.</p>
                <p>In the remaining Clavipalpi all the joints of the tarsi are simple, and the body
                    is almost globular. Such is the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Agathidium,</hi>
                    Illig. so named from <hi rend="italic">aγa∂ις, a clue,</hi> probably in
                    reference to the faculty possessed by the species of rolling themselves into a
                    ball,—in which state they feign death in the most imperturbable manner. They
                    occur in woods, beneath the bark of trees, and in mushrooms. We regard the
                    genus, of which about a dozen species occur in Britain, as rather characteristic
                    of the north of Europe. It was originally constituted by a dismemberment of
                    Sphaeridium, from which, according to the sectional system of Latreille, it
                    stands ata great distance, having, in common with other <hi rend="italic"
                    >Tetramera,</hi> only four articulations to all the tarsi. The same character,
                    in this instance we fear an artificial one, also removes it widely from <hi
                    rend="italic">Anisotoma, Leiodes,</hi> and other genera with which it is, in all
                    likelihood more naturally, conjoined by Mr Stephens and other English
                    entomologists.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>TRIMERA.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Three Articulations to all the Tarsi.</hi></p>
                <p>This, the fourth primary section of the coleopterous order, consists of three
                    families, of which the first two bear a strong relation to the concluding genera
                    of the section we have just quitted. Their antennae, almost always composed of
                    eleven articulations,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p/></note> terminate in a club formed by the three last joints. The club is
                    compressed, and in the form of a reversed triangle. The first article of the
                    tarsi is always very distinct; the penultimate is usually bilobed; and the last,
                    presenting a knot at its base, is terminated by a pair of hooks. The elytra are
                    not truncated, and entirely cover the abdomen. The genera of the third family,
                    however, differ from the other two in the characters last mentioned, in which,
                    as in several others, they make an approach to the Brachelytra, and other groups
                    of the great pentamerous section. In their habits also they differ greatly from
                    the rest of the trimerous families.</p>

                    large and securiform, and the penultimate article of the tarsi is deeply
                    bilobed. In the remainder of the family the articles of the tarsi are simple, or
                    at least the penultimate is very slightly bifid, a character which, with certain
                    others, distinguishes these insects from the Fungicolae.</p>
                <p>In the extensive and beautiful genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Coccinellλ,</hi>
                    commonly called Lady-birds (Plate CCXXV1I. fig. 23), the antennae are distinctly
                    composed of eleven articulations. The body is nearly hemispherical, the thorax
                    very short, slightly if at all margined, and the penultimate joint of the tarsi
                    is deeply bilobed. The head is not concealed. This genus was established by
                    Frisch, and has been adopted by all succeeding entomologists. It serves,
                    according to Mr Curtis, as a remarkable example of the value of structure in the
                    combination of groups, and of the slight importance of the distribution of
                    colour when employed to distinguish species. “As a genus, Coccinella is so
                    natural that its appellation has never been disturbed; whereas the species
                    composing it are so variable that many of them have been described under a great
                    variety of names.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                    rend="italic">British Entomology,</hi> vol. v. f. 208.</p></note></p>
                <p>These insects are distinguishable from the neighbouring genera of <hi
                    rend="italic">Chrysomela</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Erotylus</hi> by the number
                    of articulations of the tarsi, which never exceed three. In this character they
                    so far coincide with <hi rend="italic">Eumorphus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >En-</hi><hi rend="italic">domychus, and Dasycerus,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    but from those genera they differ in the shortness of their antennae, the form
                    of their bodies, and the development of the last articulation of the maxillary
                    palpi. The general form of these beautiful, and for the most part
                    familiarly-known insects, is hemispherical,—an aspect produced chiefly by the
                    convex shape of the elytra. The under surface is extremely flat, and the legs
                    are short, and, except when the insect is in motion, scarcely project beyond the
                    lateral edges of the elytra. Leon Dufour has illustrated the anatomical
                    structure of this genus with his accustomed accuracy. He dis-, covered in <hi
                    rend="italic">C. septernpunctata</hi> a salivary apparatus composed of three
                    pair of diaphanous vessels, of extreme tenuity, more or less twisted, and
                    extending from the hinder part of the mouth into the abdomen, where the
                    extremities appear to float. He was, however, unable to detect the appearance of
                    any gland or other organ of an essentially secreting nature; but when submitted
                    to a powerful microscope, these vessels exhibited a structure entirely analogous
                    to that of the salivary conduits observable in the dipterous and hemipterous
                    tribes. A linear and tubular axis was perceptible through their pellucid coats,
                    resembling that of the excrementitial secretions of the Carabidae. The digestive
                    canal is itself scarcely longer than the body of the insect, and is consequently
                    nearly straight. The oesophagus seems inclosed in the head, in such a way that,
                    to render it observable, the alimentary tube must be drawn backwards. The
                    stomach is not preceded by any crop or gizzard. It is bilobed at its origin,
                    where it approaches the head, and receives the oesophagus in the notch or slope
                    produced by that bilobation. It is. longeι than the rest of the tube,—is very
                    smooth and dilatable,—and was found filled sometimes with a blackish, sometimes
                    with a yellowish pulp. Near its termination were the biliary vessels, six in
                    number. These vessels are somewhat large in proportion to the size of the
                    insect, and each has a distinct and isolated insertion on' the stomach, like a
                    caecum.. They have a very varicose aspect, and always appear diaphanous. The
                    insertion of these biliary vessels indicates the limits of the stomach, and we
                    have then a very short intestine, followed by a slightly bulged caecum, and a
                    rectum distinctly marked.</p>
                <p>The larvae of the Coccinellae feed on Aphides, and are extremely useful in the
                    destruction of those noxious insects which abound to the deterioration of so
                    many valuable plants. In the perfect state many of the species pass the winter
                    in the clefts of palings and the chinks of walls. Their eggs are usually laid in
                    spring. These are of a yellow colour, with a disagreeable smell, and produce
                    larvae of an aspect very different from that of the perfect insect. In that
                    early condition the body is much broader than deep, and is pointed towards the
                    extremity, which bears a fleshy projection, carried by the insect on the plane
                    of its position, and serving as a kind of supernumerary foot. The body consists
                    of twelve rings or segments, which in some cases are garnished with spines or
                    tubercles, in others smooth. When the larvae have attained to their full size,
                    they adhere by their hinder extremity to a leaf or a stone, and partly freeing
                    themselves from a slough or skin, they assume the state of Chrysalis. In the
                    course of a week or two, according to the species, the perfect insect makes its
                    appearance. It is at first soft, flexible, and almost colourless, but a very
                    short period suffices to adorn it with those gay and contrasted markings which
                    render the Coccinellae or “Lady-birds” among the most admired of all the smaller
                    tribes of coleopterous insects. Some contrariety of opinion appears to exist in
                    regard to the food and habits of these insects in the perfect state. Perhaps
                    their instincts may vary according to circumstances, or may present a disparity
                    in the species. We have frequently observed them preying upon Aphides; and yet
                    Bose, in describing the <hi rend="italic">Coccinella borealis</hi> of America,
                    mentions its destructive attacks upon the leaves of the melon plantations; and
                    other species are said to be injurious to the crops of lucerne and cinqfoils.
                    Their numbers vary greatly in different years. In 1807, as Messrs Kirby and
                    Spence inform us, the shore at Brighton, and all the watering-places on the
                    south coast, were literally covered with them, to the great surprise and even
                    alarm of the inhabitants, who were ignorant that their little visitors were
                    merely emigrants from the neighbouring hopgrounds, where in their larva state
                    they had slain their thousands and their tens of thousands of the Aphis, which,

                <p>In this order the wings arc likewise four in number. The elytra or upper pair are
                    softer and more flexible than in the preceding order·; they are semi-membranous,
                    reticulated, and for the most part do not form by their junction, when closed, a
                    straight line along the dorsal suture. The true wings are folded longitudinally,
                    and usually after the manner of a fan, and are divided by longitudinal
                    membranous nervures. Maxillae terminated by a corneous piece, toothed, and
                    protected by the galea, a portion which corresponds to the exterior division of
                    the jaws of coleopterous insects. In this order there is also a kind of tongue
                    or epiglottis. The metamorphosis is semi-complete.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus arranged the first genus of our present order with his Coleoptera,
                    placing it, however, by itself at the termination of that order ;—the remaining
                    genera were grouped with his hemipterous tribes. Wc owe their separation to
                    Degeer, who formed the whole into an order, under the name of <hi rend="italic"

                    the mouth, and the nature of the metamorphosis, exhibit its alliance to the

                    present treatise, in conformity with the views of Μ. Latreiìle, although we are
                    aware that most English entomologists, and many foreign ones, prefer that it
                    should be dis-hngmshed as above mentioned.</p></note> They correspond to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Uloηata</hi> of Fabricius. The title which they now bear was
                    imposed by Olivier.</p>
                <p>The body of orthopterous insects is generally of an elongated form, and of a
                    somewhat soft and fleshy consistence. It is composed as usual of head, thorax,
                    and abdomen. We shall briefly describe the general characters of these parts.
                    The head varies considerably in size, form, and position. It is usually large
                    and vertical, and presents in the greater number of species two or three
                    stemmatic eyes. The front is sometimes prolonged into a conical form, as in
                    certain species of the genera <hi rend="italic">Truxalis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Mantis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> sometimes it bears a kind of
                    fleshy appendix resembling a veil, as in the <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">umhraculosus</hi> of Spain. The true eyes occupy the sides of the
                    head, and are generally very large, with a reticulated aspect. The antennae do
                    not vary so greatly in their structure as among the Coleoptera, but they are
                    usually composed of a greater number of articulations. They are generally
                    inserted in front of the eyes, but sometimes beneath or between them. Their
                    articulations are not very distinct, and as to shape they are filiform,
                    setaceous, massive, perfoliated, and sometimes ensiform, or resembling the blade
                    of a sword.</p>
                <p>The mouth consists of a labrum, two mandibles, a pair of maxillae, a labium, and
                    four palpi. The labrum is attached to the clypcus by a distinct suture; it is
                    moveable, always external, demi-coriaceous, somewhat arched or vaulted, almost
                    semicircular, rounded in front, and advancing on the mandibles. The mandibles
                    are scaly, or corneous and strong, triangular, short, thick, with the exterior
                    side arched, and the interior armed with many unequal teeth or dentations.
                    According to the observations of Marcel de Serres, these dentations bear a close
                    relation to the mode of nourishment; and he distinguishes them, as we do the
                    dental system of the Mammalia, as <hi rend="italic">incisive, canine,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">molar.</hi> These last arc the largest, and there is never
                    more than one in each mandible, placed towards its base. The three sorts of
                    teeth never exist simultaneously, and it is by their presence or absence, and by
                    the modifications of their forms, that we may recognise the nature of the
                    various substances by which the different tribes of Orthoptera arc nourished. In
                    the genera <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Empusa,</hi> for
                    example, which are purely carnivorous, we find only the canine teeth or <hi
                    rend="italic">laniares.</hi> Those species which have only incisive and molar
                    teeth are herbivorous, while such as are omnivorous possess canine and molar
                    teeth, but of smaller dimensions. The maxillae resemble in a great measure those
                    of the carnivorous Coleoptera. They are very strong, corneous, at least on their
                    superior portion, which forms a kind of large conical tooth, provided with two
                    or three dentations. They also bear <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193747702?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7702-0188"/> two’palpi, but
                    that which is named the internal palpus among the carnivorous Coleoptera is here
                    transformed into a membranous inarticulate piece, sometimes cylindrical, in
                    other instances triangular or dilated, but in all cases vaulted above, and
                    covering the extremity of the maxillae. It is to this particular portion, or
                    internal maxillary palpus, that Fabricius applied the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >galea,</hi> or helmet, a term not very accurately translated <hi rend="italic"
                    >galette</hi> by Olivier. The external maxillary palpi, which alone are
                    apparent, are composed of five articulations, of which the two first are
                    extremely short; and it is in these palpi that Olivier and Marcel de Serres
                    suppose themselves to have discovered the organ of the sense of <hi
                    rend="italic">smell.</hi> The latter author observed in their interior a pair of
                    nerves spreading themselves over the vesicular membrane which terminates their
                    last articulation. These he names the olfactory nerves: one is furnished by the
                    fifth pair, which springs from the inferior face of the brain, and the other by
                    the first pair, which derives its origin from the lateral and superior face of
                    the first ganglion of the head. Between these two nerves there is a trachea,
                    which, before it reaches the vesicular membrane, commences to form a pneumatic
                    pouch. This pouch is more fully developed in the interior of the palpus, and
                    throws off numerous ramifications, which spread themselves within the cavity of
                    the organ. It was this peculiar structure which induced Olivier and Marcel de
                    Serres to regard these palpi as the organs of the sense of smell. We may add,
                    however, that Latreille is by no means satisfied that they are so, and thinks
                    that additional observation is necessary to establish this alleged fact in the
                    physiology of insects. The labium, or ligula, of the Orthoptera, is almost
                    membranous, elongated, slightly enlarged towards its extremity, and divided into
                    two or four stripes or portions.</p>
                <p>The interior of the mouth exhibits an additional piece, which some regard as a
                    tongue; it is fleshy, longitudinal, carinated above, broader at its base,
                    slightly restricted before its anterior extremity, rounded, immoveable, and
                    somewhat notched at its point. The mentum is coriaceous, in form of a transverse
                    square, rather narrow towards the summit. The labial palpi are composed of only
                    three articulations, as among the coleopterous tribes.<note anchored="true"

                    Those of the maxillae consist of five.</p>
                <p>The thorax is composed, as in other cases, of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a
                    metathorax. The first is generally the largest, and is the only part exposed. It
                    presents a great variety of forms, some of which are sufficiently singular. The
                    elytra, in the greater number, are coriaceous, thin, flexible, semitransparent,
                    and reticulated. They are occasionally almost horizontal, with a straight dorsal
                    suture, as among the Coleoptera; but they are much more frequently more or less
                    inclined, with their inner edges crossing each other when closed over the back.
                    The true wings are broader than the elytra, membranous, full of reticulations,
                    and longitudinally folded after the fashion of a fan. To this latter character,
                    however, the somewhat anomalous genus <hi rend="italic">Forficula</hi>
                    (containing the earwigs) presents an exception, as in it the wings are also
                    transversely (as well as longitudinally) folded, as among the Coleoptera. In
                    some cases the females, and in a few instances both sexes, among the Orthoptera,
                    are destitute of wings. In many species the elytra of the males are short or
                    rudimentary, and in that sex also a portion of the inner margin of these parts
                    frequently resembles talc or parchment, and exhibits large irregular nervures.
                    It is by the rapid friction of these upon each other that the monotonous song,
                    or <hi rend="italic">stridulation</hi> as it is called, of many species is
                    occasioned. In others, however, a shrill monotonous cry is produced by rubbing
                    the posterior limbs against the edges of the elytra.</p>
                <p>The legs of orthopterous insects are sometimes similar to each other. In other
                    cases the anterior pair are more extensile, and are armed with spines, with
                    which they transfix their prey,—or they are dilated, compressed, strongly
                    toothed externally, and adapted for burrowing in the earth. The posterior legs,
                    as among locusts and grasshoppers, are frequently much larger than the others,
                    and fitted for powerful leaping; and both the middle and posterior pair are more
                    widely apart from each other at their origin than among the coleopterous
                    species. The arti-eolations of the tarsi differ in the different tribes; but we
                    believe that no <hi rend="italic">heteromerous</hi> species have been yet
                    observed. These articulations are not unfrequently furnished beneath with little
                    membranous cushions, and the terminal articulation is always provided with a
                    pair of hooks or claws.</p>
                <p>The form of the abdomen varies in this order. It is divided externally into eight
                    or nine rings, and is often terminated by projecting appendages. Many of the
                    females are furnished with an ovipositor, composed of two portions closely
                    applied, and frequently surrounded by a common envelope.</p>
                <p>In relation to the anatomy of the Orthoptera, we may state, that they are all
                    characterized by a first membranous stomach or crop, succeeded by a muscular
                    gizzard, armed interiorly with scales or corneous teeth, according to the
                    species. Around the pylorus, except in the <hi rend="italic">Fοrji∙</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">culee,</hi> are two or more blind intestines, furnished at their
                    base with many small biliary vessels; and numerous other vessels of a similar
                    nature are inserted towards the middle of the intestine. The digestive system of
                    the larvae resembles that of the perfect insect.</p>
                <p>M. Marcel de Serres has particularly devoted himself to the study of the internal
                    structure of these creatures. He informs us that the Orthoptera with setaceous
                    antennae, such as the genera <hi rend="italic">Elatta, Mantis,
                    Gryllο-iαlp∏,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gryllus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Locusta,</hi> have only elastic or tubular tracheae, and these of two
                    kinds,—the one arterial, the other pulmonary. The latter alone distribute the
                    air to all parts of the body <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>, after having
                    received it from the former. In the genera characterized by cylindrical or
                    prismatic antennae, such as <hi rend="italic">Acrydiurn</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Trιιxalis,</hi> the pulmonary tracheae are replaced by vesicular
                    ones. They are covered by cartilaginous hoops or moveable ribs, and receive air
                    by means of tubular or elastic tracheae, which proceed from the arterial kind.
                    According to the same authority, the nutritive system is more or less developed,
                    and exhibits four principal modifications. <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">Gryllo-talpa</hi> in that respect excel the others. In them
                    the crop is shaped like a bagpipe, and placed on one side, while in the rest it
                    is on a line with the gizzard. In the latter also the hepatic vessels are
                    inserted insulately, but in the former by means of a common deferent canal. The
                    genera <hi rend="italic">Truxalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Acrydiurn</hi>
                    (criquets), although resembling <hi rend="italic">Locusta</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(</hi><hi rend="italic">Sauterelles')</hi> in their digestive system, differ in
                    respect to the superior hepatic vessels, which are not furnished at their
                    extremity with secreting vessels, and no longer form enlarged pouches, but
                    cylindrical and elongated canals. The intestines of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elatta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi> present only two divisions; their
                    nutritive system is in other respects the same. The <hi rend="italic"

                    According to Baron Cuvier, they differ from all other Orthoptera in wanting the
                    superior hepatic vessels.</p>
                <p>The metamorphoses of the Orthoptera are called semicomplete, and consist chiefly
                    in the development and increase of the elytra and wings. Both the larvae and
                    nymphae feed and move about like the perfect insects, and differ chiefly by the
                    entire want of wings in the first state, and their rudimentary condition in the
                    second. These insects lay an immense number of eggs, of an elongated form and
                    considerable size. They are sometimes deposited in a mass, and inclosed together
                    within a capsule. Both young and old are extremely voracious, and frequently
                    produce the most frightful consequences by their-devastations. On the other
                    hand, we are not aware of any recompensing advantages derivable to the human
                    race from any species of orthopterous insects. Several eastern tribes no doubt
                    use them as food, and seem to have done so in remote times, as indicated by the
                    ancient name of <hi rend="italic">Acridophagi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    the sacred writings have recorded that the food of John the Baptist in the
                    wilderness was “locusts and wild honey.” We believe that no aquatic species is
                    contained in this order.</p>
                <p>Mr Macleay has observed, that although there may be reason for hesitation with
                    respect to the types of the Neuroptera, there is none in relation to the
                    principal forms of the orthopterous order. These forms seem to have been
                    perceived by all entomologists, and their dissimilarity has led to tribes being
                    regarded in the light of orders. “Indeed no forms that are within the limits of
                    an order can be more distinct from each other than those of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phasma,</hi><hi rend="italic">Truxalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">Locusta,</hi><hi

                    types of so many groups by Linnaeus. The affinity of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Flatta</hi> to <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi> is acknowledged in the <hi

                    lately instituted by Professor Klug of Berlin, one of the first entomologists of
                    the present day, proves the proximity of <hi rend="italic">Phasma</hi> to <hi
                    rend="italic">Truxalis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and no entomologist is
                    ignorant that the chain of connection from <hi rend="italic">Acτidium</hi> to

                    been long since detected, and is now perfectly established. Hence some notion
                    may bė obtained of the contents of the orthopterous circle, if we reckon the
                    above-mentioned five genera as the types of the following tribes:</p>
                <p>1. Phasmina.</p>
                <p>2. Acridina.</p>
                <p>3. Locustina.</p>
                <p>4. Gryllina.</p>
                <p>5. Blattina.</p>
                <p>But as this series returns into itself, and the genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Forficula</hi> cannot be inserted therein without disturbing its regularity, we
                    must agree with Degeer and Mr Kirby, that it belongs to a distinct order. That
                    this order can only be esteemed osculant between the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The insects of this genus, known under the familiar name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >earwigs,</hi> are frequent in moist places, beneath stones, under the loose
                    bark of old trees, or in decayed timber. They are injurious in gardens, where
                    they attack various kinds of fruit. They also pierce the petals of flowers, and
                    do not refuse animal food. Our entomological cabinet, when left open for a
                    summer night, has sometimes suffered from their depredations. They may therefore
                    be regarded as omnivorous. Their alleged inclination to enter the <hi
                    rend="italic">ear</hi> is a vulgar error,'not derided however even by the
                    Swedish sage :—“Aures dormien-tum interdum intrans,” says Linnaeus, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ii</hi> spiritu frumenti pellenda.”</p>
                <p>We shall not here describe the species, as their general appearance must be
                    familiar to the reader; but we shall devote a few lines to the manners of the
                    common earwig, <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi rend="italic">auricularia.</hi> The
                    female is known to watch over her eggs wit*h great care,—an uncommon tendency
                    among insects. Degeer placed an earwig, with her eggs, in a box with fresh
                    earth, early in the month of April. They had been scattered by accident about
                    the box; but she soon collected them together, and placed herself above them, as
                    if she were hatching. Towards the middle of May the young made their appearance.
                    They seemed large in proportion to the eggs, and appeared as if swollen. The
                    movement of the dorsal vessel was very perceptible through the skin. These
                    larvae have neither wings nor elytra. They are composed of thirteen segments, of
                    which the first three bear the legs, and the last exhibits the germ of the
                    pincers, which are conical and slightly divergent. The antennae are composed of
                    eight articulations. Degeer endeavoured to bring up the young along with their
                    mother, and fed them with slices of apple. They were observed to cast their
                    skins several times, and after each of these changes the antennae gained an
                    additional articulation. The pincers also became longer, and their points
                    approached each other, as in the adult insect. These larvae, however, all
                    perished by degrees but one; and the mother also perished, and was found half
                    devoured by her offspring, an ungrateful return for such tender solicitude. This
                    unnatural voracity, however, probably arose from a deficiency of other food, as
                    they are never observed to attack each other in a state of freedom. The
                    remaining larva increased in size, and assumed the nympha state towards the end
                    of July. The cases of the elytra and wings are flat, and closely pressed upon
                    the back, and the pincers have assumed their usual aspect. It therefore does not
                    greatly differ from the perfect insect.</p>
                <p>The genus contains many species, and is widely distributed. Several sub-genera

                    appendages. Their crop is longitudinal, their gizzard furnished interiorly with
                    strong hooked teeth, and there are from eight to ten caeca around the

                    Some inhabit woods or the crevices of old walls, while others frequent
                    store-roomş and dwelling-houses, where their voracious propensities produce
                    great damage to all kinds of provisions. , They likewise destroy silk and
                    woollen stuffs, and even leather. But their ravages are chiefly confined to warm
                    countries. The species are numerous. Olivier<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    his time. The <hi rend="italic">Blatta orientalis</hi> of Linn, is about an inch
                    long, of a reddish chesnut-brown. The wings, which are shorter than the abdomen
                    in the male, are merely rudimentary in the female, and are wanting in the larvae
                    of both scxes. The eggs, to the number of sixteen, are inclosed symmetrically in
                    an oval compressed shell, which is at first white and afterwards brown. It is
                    tolerably solid, and is toothed along its edges like a saw. The female carries
                    it about with her for some time, and afterwards attaches it to a favourable
                    position, by means of a gummy exudation. This species, originally imported from
                    eastern countries, is now widely spread over Europe, and occurs as far north as
                    Finland.</p>

                <p>We may observe, that the genus <hi rend="italic">Mantis,</hi> as originally
                    constituted by Linnaeus, contained a great variety of very singular and somewhat
                    incongruous forms. It has since been greatly restricted, and more precisely
                    defined, by Illiger, Latreille, Lichtenstein, and other modern writers. Thus it
                    is distinguishable from <hi rend="italic">Empusa</hi> of Illiger, by the
                    antennae, which in the latter genus are pectinated in the male sex, and by the
                    want of the frontal prolongation of the head. From the spectre insects <hi
                    rend="italic">(Spectrum)</hi> with which they were likewise combined by
                    Linnaeus, the true species of Mantis may be easily discriminated by the form and
                    relative length of the legs, which in the spectres are of uniform size. The head
                    in Mantis is triangular, vertical, with large eyes, and three small distinct
                    stemmata. The antennae are simple, setaceous, inserted between the eyes, and
                    composed of numerous articulations. The labrum is entire; the mandibles cutting
                    or incisive; the palpi filiform, pointed, not compressed; and the ligula is
                    composed of four parts or divisions of nearly equal length. The thorax is long,
                    and composed almost entirely of the first segment, of which the anterior
                    extremity is frequently dilated, and the sides rounded. The first pair of legs
                    are held in advance and raised, the haunch being very large, and the thigh
                    toothed and compressed; the tibia is also toothed, and terminated by a strong
                    hook or crotchet. The other legs are slender, simple, and unarmed with teeth or
                    spines. The elytra are horizontal, narrow, lengthened, rather thin,
                    semitransparent, and overlap each other on their inner edges. The under or true
                    wings are folded lengthways like a fan. The abdomen is oblong, and is terminated
                    by two conical articulated appendages, and a compressed scaly plate, arched on
                    the back, and composed of several short pieces received into a pair of anal
                    valves.</p>
                <p>Such, we conceive, are the characters of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mantis</hi> properly so called. It contains a considerable number of species,
                    all characterized by singular and eccentric forms. We do not know by what means
                    it has happened that an insect of this genus has become, in various parts of the
                    world, if not an object of religious worship, at least a subject of
                    superstitious wonder and credulity. From time immemorial the Mantis, in Turkey,
                    has been regarded as a sacred insect; and even among the apathetic Hottentots,
                    so sparingly endowed with any thing allied to the nobler faculties, it is said
                    to be held in still higher estimation. The <hi rend="italic">Mantis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">religiosa</hi> of Europe, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pregα-T)iou</hi> (Prie-Dieu) in the southern provinces of France, is well known
                    as living habitually under the safe-guard of a religious veneration on the part
                    of the peasantry, who deem it a faithful guide and guardian of children who have
                    lost their way. It has obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">religiosa,</hi>
                    from the incessant movements of its fore legs, which it is continually raising
                    into the air, and as it were clasping together. This action, however, is the
                    result of its peculiar instinct and mode of life; for the insect, in common with
                    the rest of the genus, is a fierce, cruel, gormandising creature, and so far
                    from indulging, as is fondly supposed, in a state of religious abstraction, is
                    continually seeking for what it may devour. It preys upon all the weaker
                    insects, which it cither crushes to death, or relentlessly impales alive upon
                    the sharp spines of its own shanks. To effect this, it is perpetually moving its
                    arms or fore-legs in the air, and closing one armed joint upon another, so that
                    whatever insect prey approaches within its reach is immediately transfixed and
                    devoured. In some of the French provinces it is called the <hi rend="italic"

                    The wings and elytra vary in their degree of development in the different
                    species, but they frequently cover the abdomen in such a manner as to make it
                    appear as if two leaves had fallen upon the insect. Some seem green and fresh,
                    others brown and withered, while an intermediate kind present the red and yellow
                    hues of autumn. This imitation, or rather representation, of the vegetable
                    kingdom, is indeed so singular as to attract the attention and excite the
                    astonishment of the least curious inquirer; and it is in reference to the
                    peculiar character just mentioned that these insects are known by the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">walking leaves.</hi> According to some authors, the antennae
                    of the males are long, slender, setaceous, and composed of a great number of
                    nearly cylindrical articulations,—while those of the females are shorter than
                    the head, conical, granular, and composed of not more than nine articulations.
                    It appears that this great disparity between the sexes led Latreille into an
                    error when he formed a distinct species of <hi rend="italic">Ph.

                    inches long, very flat, and of a pale yellowish-green colour. The thorax is
                    short and dentated on the sides, and the foliations of the thighs are likewise
                    dcntated. In the female the antennae are very short, the elytra as long as the
                    abdomen, and the true wings wanting. The form of the male is narrower and more
                    lengthened, and the antennae long and setaceous; the elytra are short and the
                    wings long. This species, Latreille informs us, is raised by the inhabitants of
                    the Sechelles Islands as an object of entomological commerce. The Same species,
                    and some others nearly allied, occur in India, and the great eastern islands,

                    fields and dwelling-houses. The common species (ćr. <hi rend="italic"
                    >domesticus,</hi> Linn.) (Plate CCXXVHI. fig. 9) is of a pale yellowish or clay
                    colour, mingled with brown. The female bears a long ovipositor, and the male is
                    characterized by his perpetual cry of <hi rend="italic">cree cree,</hi> uttered
                    most continuously during warm weather, or in the vicinity of ovens or large
                    kitchen fires. These insects remain in their retreats during the day, and come
                    forth in the night season to seek their prey. They feed on bread, flour, and
                    other articles of domestic economy. Latreille says they also devour insects. The
                    common cricket is widely distributed over Europe. In Spain it is kept by the
                    peasantry in little cages hung by the fireside, for the sake of its song.</p>
                <p>The field cricket (G. <hi rend="italic">campestris)</hi> is larger than the

                    head is large. The posterior thighs are red beneath. The female, during the
                    month of July, lays about three hundred eggs, from which the young are excluded
                    in fifteen days. They feed on herbs and roots, and moult or change their skins
                    before winter. During that inclement season they lie torpid under· ground, and
                    rc-appear in spring. The larvae are apterous, the nymphae bear the rudiments of

                <p>1hese insects are herbivorous. They occur ĩn grassy meadows, and on shrubs and
                    trees. In flying they spring into the air, and then extend their capacious
                    wings, but their flight is neither rapid nor long sustained. The cry <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the male is sharp and continuous, and is produced by the
                    friction of the elytra. The genus is extensive, and occurs in many countries.
                    They are usually of a brilliant green. One of the best known in Europe (it is
                    also an English species) is the Z. <hi rend="italic">viridissima,</hi> Lat.
                    (Plate CCXXVIH. fig. 12). It is about two inches in length, of a fine green
                    colour, without spots. The ovipositor is straight, and of the length of the
                    body. Another species <hi rend="italic">(L. verrucivora,</hi> Fab.) is likewise
                    green, but the elytra are spotted with brown and black. The ovipositor exceeds
                    the length of the abdomen, and is slightly arched. This latter bites pretty
                    severely, and derives its specific name from a practice said to be followed by
                    the Swedes, who allow it to gnaw their warts, which are alleged speedily to
                    disappear, from the action of a black and bilious liquid which escapes from the
                    mouth of the insect during mastication.</p>
                <p>Several species are nearly apterous, or present merely scalc-like rudiments of

                <p>All the preceding genera of the leaping or saltatorial Orthoptera have this
                    character in common, that the males effect their peculiar cry chiefly by a
                    portion of the elytra, which is discoloured, transparent, and somewhat resembles
                    a mirror or small tambourine. But in the following genera, the stridulation of
                    the male is effected by the friction of the spiny legs against the sides and
                    edges of the elytra and wings. The antennae are sometimes filiform and
                    cylindrical, sometimes sword-shaped, or terminated by a mass, always at least as
                    long as the head and thorax. The ligula in the greater number has only two
                    divisions. There are three simple eyes, the labium is notched, the mandibles
                    much toothed, the abdomen conical and laterally compressed. The tarsi are
                    composed of three articulations, and the female is not furnished with a
                    prolonged ovipositor.. They all leap better than the preceding genera, and have
                    a higher and more sustained flight. They feed on vegetables, and are extremely
                    voracious. They compose the old genus <hi rend="italic">Acrydium</hi> of
                    Geoffroy, which Latreille divides as follows.</p>

                    pointed. Posterior legs large and long, approximated to the intermediate, which
                    are farther than usual from the anterior pair.</p>

                <p>This genus contains the noted insects commonly called <hi rend="italic"
                    >locusts,</hi> the structure and history of which we shall briefly detail. The
                    head is largely developed, and supports two rather short antennae, composed of
                    twenty articulations. The true eyes are oval, projecting, and situated on the
                    sides of the head, while the stemmatic cyes, three in number, form a triangle on
                    its summit. The mouth is composed of a large and broad upper lip, slightly
                    notched on its anterior margin; of strong cutting mandibles, irregularly
                    toothed; of maxillae terminated by three teeth, and supporting at the same time
                    the galeae by which they are covered, and a pair of filiform palpi, consisting
                    of five articulations; of an inferior lip, broad, advanced, bifid at the
                    extremity, and giving insertion to a pair of filiform palpi of four
                    articulations. The prothorax, of the same breadth as the body, sometimes
                    exhibits superiorly small <hi rend="italic">heels,</hi> which are prolonged
                    transversely on the sides in slight impressions, appearing to indicate the
                    natural divisions of that portion of the thorax. The chest of the mesothorax and
                    metathorax, or rather the sternum, is broad, flattened, and very dissimilar to
                    that of <hi rend="italic">Locusta</hi> (Sauterelles), in which it has the
                    appearance of two triangular foliaceous plates. The elytra are coriaceous,
                    narrow, and as long as the wings, which are large, reticulated, folded like a
                    fan, and frequently ornamented by brilliant shades of red or blue. The legs are
                    of unequal length,—the two anterior pair being of ordinary proportions, while
                    the hindmost are large, and formed for leaping. Many species exhibit on each
                    side, and near the origin of the abdomen, a large cavity, closed interiorly by a
                    thin membranous diaphragm, of a pearly white colour. Latreille regards it as a
                    pneumatic pouch, forming an acoustic instrument. It may no doubt be influential
                    in regulating the sounds uttered by these insects, which, however, are certainly
                    produced in the first place by the alternate friction of the inner face of the
                    hind legs against the surface of the elytra.</p>
                <p>The females, which arc not provided with an exserted ovipositor, lay their eggs
                    in some instances in the ground, in others on the stalks of plants, to which
                    they adhere naturally by a gummy secretion, and are, moreover, enveloped and
                    protected by a frothy matter, which hardens over them, ſhe larvae, the nymphae,
                    and the perfect insects, arc all voracious, and feed on plants. The ravages of
                    locusts are so well known to all readers of foreign travels, and accounts of
                    their desolating inroads have been so frequently extracted, and published in
                    numerous popular works, that a few slight notices of the subject will here
                    suffice.</p>
                <p>Locusts are of very common occurrence in many parts Qt Africa. Mr Barrow records,
                    that in the southern districts which he visited, the surface of an area of
                    nearly 2000 square miles might literally be said to be covered by them. 1he
                    water of a wide river was scarcely visible, m consequence of the innumerable
                    dead locusts which i°atedonits surface, apparently drowned in their attempts to
                    reach the reeds which grew along its shores. Except these much wished-for reeds,
                    they had devoured every other green thing. Their destruction on a former
                    occasion was sudden and singular. All the full-grown insects were driven into
                    the sea by a tempestuous wind, and were afterwards cast upon the beach, where
                    they formed a bank three or four feet high, and extending <hi rend="italic"
                    >nearly fifty English miles.</hi> The smell, as may be easily supposed, was most
                    abominable, and was sensibly felt at the distance of 150 miles. In regard to the
                    lndian locusts, a correspondent of Messrs Kirby and Spence informed these
                    authors, that he was an eye-witness to an immense army of locusts which ravaged
                    the Mahratta country, and was supposed to come all the way from Arabia. This
                    column extended <hi rend="italic">five hundred miles,</hi> and was so compact
                    when its members were upon the wing, as to darken the sun like an eclipse, so
                    that no shadow was cast upon the ground, and some lofty tombs, distant not more
                    than two hundred yards from the observer, were rendered invisible. These were
                    not the <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi><hi rend="italic">migratorius</hi> of
                    Linnaeus <hi rend="italic">(A. migratoriurn,</hi> Plate CCXXVHI. fig. 13), but a
                    red species, the peculiar colour of which is said to have added additional
                    horror to the scene ;—for after having stript the trees of their foliage, they
                    congregated around the bare and desolate branches, producing a hue like blood.
                    When they moved again, “the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots,
                    and of many horses running to battle.”</p>
                <p>The migratory flight of these insects, their desolating effects upon vegetation,
                    and consequent injury both to man and beast, have afforded a frequent subject of
                    exercise to the pen of the poet; but by none has their injurious inroads been so
                    magnificently portrayed as by the prophet Joel, “A day of darkness and of
                    gloominess, a day of clouds and of thick darkness, as the morning spread upon
                    the mountains; a great people and a strong: there hath not been ever the like,
                    neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many generations. A
                    fire devourcth before them, and behind them a flame burncth: the land is as the
                    garden of Eden before them, and behind them a desolate wilderness; yea, and
                    nothing shall escape them. The appearance of them is as the appearance of
                    horses; and as horsemen so shall they run. Like the noise of chariots on the
                    tops of mountains shall they leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that
                    devoureth the stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.” “The earth shall
                    quake before them; the heavens shall tremble: the sun and the moon shall be
                    dark, and the stars shall withdraw their shining.” “How do the beasts groan! the
                    herds of cattle are perplexed because they have no pasture; yea, the flock's of
                    sheep are made desolate.”</p>
                <p>Dr Southey, “the laurel-honouring laureate,” as he is well called by his friend
                    and fellow poet S. T. Coleridge, has also, in his “wild and wondrous lay” of
                    Thalaba, sketched the progress of these destroyers.</p>
                <p>Onward they came, a dark continuous cloud Of congregated myriads numberless, The
                    rushing of whose wings was as the sound Of a broad river headlong in its course
                    Plunged from a mountain summit, or the roar Of a wild ocean in the autumn storm,
                    Shattering its billows on a shore of rocks.</p>
                <p>The scene of the above quotation is Arabia, where these insects are very
                    formidable, and of different kinds. Forskal thinks that the species which
                    chiefly infests that tented region, and which he names <hi rend="italic">Gryllus
                    gregarius,</hi> is distinct from the <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi><hi

                    which induces the Arabs to believe that they are produced by the waters of the

                    they destroyed the harvests, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747780?mode=fullsize"

                    dwelling-houses, devouring whatever they can find, even to the leather of the
                    water vessels. They appear in the air at a distance like clouds of smoke; and
                    their near approach, accompanied as by a sound of falling water, stuns the
                    inhabitants with astonishment and dread. They alight upon a field, and its
                    verdure disappears,—the lofty palms are stript or their long shadow-casting
                    leaves,—and pulse and all other succulent crops are voraciously devoured. Grain,
                    however, if ripe, usually escapes, in consequence of its hardness and aridity.
                    The Bedouins of Sinai are frequently driven to despair by the multitudes of
                    these flying vermin, which remain for a period of a month or six weeks before
                    they finally disappear. The time of their arrival is towards the end of the
                    month of May, when the Pleiades are setting,—a coincidence which leads the
                    natives to imagine that locusts entertain a dread of that beautiful
                    constellation. Although a few are visible every year, the great flights are
                    inflicted only every fourth or fifth season. Most of the Arabs, except those of
                    Sinai, are in the habit of eating these insects. “In almost every town there are
                    shops where they are sold by measure. In preparing them, the cook throws them
                    alive into boiling water with which a good deal of salt has been mixed. After a
                    few minutes they are taken out and dried in the sun; the head, feet, and wings
                    are then torn off; the bodies are cleansed from the salt, and perfectly dried,
                    after which they are put up into sacks or bags. Sometimes they are broiled in
                    butter, and spread on the unleavened bread used at breakfast. The Jewish Arabs
                    believe that the food of which the Israelites ate so abundantly in the desert
                    was showers of locusts.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and are even exported as articles of commerce. The elytra and wings are first
                    cut off, and then the bodies are preserved in brine. M. Miot, in his translation
                    of Herodotus, has observed that the numerous carcasses of <hi rend="italic"

                    inches and a half in length. Its usual colour is green, obscurely spotted, the
                    elytra pale brown, marked with black. The mandibles are likewise black, and the
                    thorax is marked by a slightly elevated crest. This species is common in Poland,
                    but occasionally extends its ravages into other European countries. It was very
                    destructive in Provence sb lately as the year 1819. It is well known in the
                    Levant, in Barbary, and Egypt. These countries produce another species, likewise
                    found in the south of France, the <hi rend="italic">A. lineola,</hi> Lat. It is
                    of a reddish-brown colour. The crest of the thorax is intersected by three
                    impressed transverse lines; there is a conical pectoral point between the
                    anterior legs, almost as long as the haunches; and the posterior legs are
                    furnished with reddish spines, black at their extremity. This species is eaten
                    in Barbary. Another kind, native to Senegal and other parts of Africa, of a
                    yellow colour, spotted with black (it is figured by both Shaw and Denon, in

                    exotic species are characterized by the superior portion of the thorax being
                    greatly elevated, much compressed, and forming a sharp: crest, rounded and
                    prolonged backwards to a point. Of this kind, though of smaller dimensions, is

                <p>The insects of this order have neither mandibles nor maxillae properly so called.
                    Their mouth is fitted for suction, and is composed of a tubular articulated
                    rostrum, cylindrical or conical, curved inferiorly, or directing itself along
                    the breast, and, when extended, presenting the appearance along its upper
                    surface of an elongated groove or canal, in which are lodged three delicate
                    pointed bristles, covered at their base by a ligula. These bristles form by
                    their union a needle-like sucker, of which the tubular piece just mentioned
                    forms the sheath, in which they are retained by means of the ligula or
                    triangular basal portion. The inferior bristle is in fact composed of two, which
                    unite together not far from their origin, so that the sucker itself consists of
                    four pieces. Savigny is of opinion that the two superior bristles are analogous
                    to the mandibles, and that the inferior represent the maxillae<note

                <p>The elytra of a great portion of the hemipterous order are of a coriaceous
                    texture throughout their principal extent, with their terminations membranous.
                    They thus partake of the nature of both elytra and wings, and the order, as
                    formerly mentioned, derives its name from that peculiarity. Among the Cicađae
                    and the Aphides, however, all the four wings are membranous, and frequently
                    quite clear and transparent. In <hi rend="italic">Tettigonia, Membracis,
                    plαtlα,</hi> &amp;c. they are of a denser consistence; while in <hi
                    rend="italic">Aleyrοdxs</hi> they are farinaceous, and of a milky translucence.
                    Certain kinds are apterous, as the bed-bug, some species of <hi rend="italic"

                    from the hemipterous order, to which the structure of the mouth shows them to
                    belong.</p>
                <p>The composition of the thorax in these insects begins to experience some
                    modifications, which exhibit their relation to the ensuing orders. The first
                    segment, or prothorax, in certain cases resembles in extent that of the
                    Coleoptera; but in others it is much more minute, and becomes incorporated with
                    the second segment, which is then manifest or exposed. The scutellum is
                    sometimes extremely small, or altogether imperceptible; while in certain genera,
                    such as <hi rend="italic">Scutellera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Membracis,</hi>
                    it is greatly dilated, and covers the entire upper surface of the body,
                    concealing the elytra and wings.</p>
                <p>The sucker, regarded as a sting, and so named by the ancient naturalists, is
                    adapted only for the extraction of animal or vegetable matter in a fluid state.
                    The delicate parts of which it is composed penetrate various organic substances,
                    the nutritive juices of which are forced to flow into the interior canal by
                    successive compressions, till they reach the oesophagus.</p>
                <p>The antennae of the hemipterous tribes are frequently very small, and of
                    difficult detection. In <hi rend="italic">Psylla,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cimex,</hi><hi rend="italic">Τhrips,</hi> and others, they are very obvious; in
                    <hi rend="italic">Cicada</hi> they are short, simple, setaceous threads; in <hi
                    rend="italic">Fulgora</hi> they are still shorter and subulated; while in <hi
                    rend="italic">Nepa, Ranαtra,</hi> &amp;c. they are placed beneath the eyes, and
                    so abbreviated as to be rendered visible only by reversing the insect.</p>
                <p>The eyes are rather large, and between them, on the upper part of the head, in
                    many species, there are two or three of the stemmatic kind, or ocelli, called
                    <hi rend="italic">yeux</hi><hi rend="italic">lisses</hi><hi rend="italic

                <p>The nature and amount of the tarsal articulations differ according to the genera
                    or tribes; but the greater number of hemipterous insects are characterized by
                    three divisions of the tarsi. In some the anterior tarsi are composed of only a
                    single piece, which is bent upon the leg in the form of a pincer; while in the
                    aquatic genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Nαucοris</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Notonecta,</hi> the posterior legs are oar-shaped, with the tarsi composed of
                    two articulations.</p>
                <p>All hemipterous insects pass as usual through three stages of mutation. But their
                    metamorphosis is not in any case complete, and their changes consist rather in
                    the development of the organs of flight, and the increased bulk of the body,
                    than in any very decided or obvious transformation. Their anatomical structure
                    exhibits a stomach with a rather solid and muscular coat, a small intestine of
                    medium length, succeeded by a large intestine, divided into various swellings,
                    and of a small number of biliary vessels, inserted at some distance from the

                <p>The species of this genus, known as <hi rend="italic">wood-bugs,</hi> and under
                    other names, are extremely numerous. They occur in every region of the world,
                    and under various temperatures. The species proper to the warmer countries of
                    Africa, America, and the East Indies, attain-to a considerable size, and are
                    adorned by brilliant colours. The larvae of these insects do not greatly differ
                    from the perfect state, except in having neither wings nor elytra. The nymphae
                    possess these organs in a rudimentary state, inclosed in sheaths. Their changes
                    of condition are accompanied by a general casting of the skin. In their various
                    states they exist on vegetable juices, which they seem as it were to pump up by
                    means of their suckers. Some species, however, have been seen to attack insects,
                    even those of their own kind, and suck their softer parts. Almost all of them
                    exhale a disagreeable and penetrating odour, <pb break="no"

                    to whatever substance the insect touches. The eggs are deposited on the stalks
                    of plants, regularly disposed, and made to adhere by means of a remarkably
                    tenacious liquid. They are not unfrequently adorned by extremely agreeable
                    colours.</p>
                <p>A pleasant and curious narrative is given by Degeer, relating to the female of a
                    species of this genus, the <hi rend="italic">Cimex griseus</hi> of Linn. He
                    found on a birch tree several of these females, each followed by a little troop
                    of thirty or forty young ones, which accompanied their mother as chickens do a
                    hen. The parents seemed to watch over them with the greatest solicitude. This is
                    a singular fact in the history of insects, which for the most part are not
                    personally regardful of the welfare of their offspring, although they seldom
                    fail instinctively to deposit their eggs in situations the best adapted for the
                    sustenance and preservation of the future larvae. Several of the generic groups
                    proposed by Fabricius, as derivable from the genus Pentatoma of Olivier, are not
                    adopted by Latreille; while, on the other hand, several genera proposed by more
                    recent writers have been adopted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    or the sweepings of apartments, and, thus disguised, lies in wait in some
                    obscure corner for its prey. No sooner °es a fly or other feeble insect approach
                    within a calcu-ated distance, than it suddenly darts upon it, and sucks it to
                    death. Sometimes it may be seen approaching its victim by slow and cautious
                    steps, till the fly, thrown off hs guard by this insidious show of peace, is
                    instantaneous-y captured by one deadly spring. Its bite is so severe as produce
                    the immediate death of its captive; and in-θed we are informed that our

                    disguise themselves in the manner just mentioned. Entomologists are acquainted
                    with a great many species of this genus, few of which, however, are native to

                    CCXXIX∙ fig. 8.) Their bodies are narrow, thin, linear. Their eyes are large and
                    globular, and are placed towards the centre of the lateral parts of the muzzle,
                    or rather muzzle-shaped head. The best known species is <hi rend="italic"

                <p>These insects have elongated bodies, are usually of a blackish colour, and are
                    met with on the surface of still waters, on which they advance as it were by
                    starts. Their under surface seems covered by a peculiar coating, of a black or
                    silvery hue, according to the position in which the insect is held, and which
                    probably protects it from the influence of the subjacent liquid. They appear
                    rather to row than to walk upon the surface. The species are insectivorous, and
                    prey upon such of their own class as they can master, and especially upon any
                    land species that have fallen accidentally into the water, and are naturally
                    inactive in that element. These they immediately seize upon with their anterior
                    feet. The <hi rend="italic">G. lacustris,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Hydrometra lacustris,</hi> Fab.), figured on the plate above referred to, is
                    of a blackish-brown colour, greenish above. The feet are brown. The body is
                    terminated by a projection. This species presents some peculiarities worthy of
                    notice. There are two varieties of it, one of which is winged, the other
                    apterous. The former of these constitute the <hi rend="italic">punaises

                    spring, and which have without doubt passed the winter beneath the ice, or under
                    cover of the frozen banks, are all apterous, but resemble perfect insects in
                    every other part of their structure. Sexual intercourse takes place among them.
                    It was this latter circumstance which induced Geoffroy to believe that they
                    offered a remarkable exception to a general rule, and that fecundation took
                    place in the state of nymph or larva. Degeer, in combating this opinion,
                    maintained that these apterous insects were of a distinct kind, and perfect in
                    their way. Μ. Auđouin, on the other hand, is or opinion that they may be
                    regarded as individuals of the ordinary kind, proceeding from larvae of the
                    preceding year, of which the development has been checked by the rigours of the
                    winter season, and the consequent condition of torpidity. He conceives that the
                    wings are not, in these aquatic insects, organs of the first importance, and
                    that the influence of surrounding causes is on that account the more likely to
                    prove effectual, and that thus they remain rudimentary, when the other parts of
                    the body, and the generative system in particular, have at-1 tained the maximum
                    of their development. He illustrates this point by reference to the genera <hi

                    >lus,</hi> in which (in the females) the organs of flight of the perfect insects
                    are scarcely if at all more developed than in the larva state, while all the
                    interior parts of structure are fully and functionally completed. The apterous
                    individuals, then, of <hi rend="italic">G. lacustris,</hi> which are observed to
                    fulfil the offices of the perfect insect, are larvae only so far as regards the

                    the minute insects of which they make their prey, and which they seize with
                    their anterior feet. Their eggs are of an oval form, and, when examined with a
                    microscope, are seen to be crowned by an aigrette of seven small threads.
                    Swammerdam anatomized these insects, and has given us some curious details
                    regarding the arrangement of the eggs in the ovaries. 1hey are so disposed that
                    the crown-like threads of the one which is next the orifice embraces the one
                    which follows, and so on consecutively. The generative system of the male is
                    singular, and very complicated. The larvae leave the eggs in midsummer. They
                    differ from the perfect insects chiefly in wanting the wings and setae. The
                    nymphs acquire, as usual, rudimentary wings inclosed in sheaths, and placed on
                    each side of the body. The perfect insect frequently quits its subaqueous abode
                    during the dewy night, and flies about with great agility. The genus is by no
                    means numerous in species, although these seem pretty extensively distributed
                    over the waters of the earth.</p>

                    present a peculiar organ, which the French observer regards as a kind of
                    pectoral trachea, communicating with those of the ordinary kind. It forms in <hi

                    >panaches,</hi> or feather-like bunches, of a pearly whiteness, composed of
                    numerous little branches, and situated in the centre of the muscular mass of the
                    breast. In <hi rend="italic">N. cinereα</hi> the pectoral tracheae appear to
                    offer the vestiges of a pulmonary organ. They consist of two oblong bodies,
                    placed immediately below the region of the scutellum, clothed by a fine
                    membrane, smooth, and white as satin. They are almost as long as the chest, free
                    except at their extremities, and are filled with a substance like tow, which,
                    when examined under the microscope, presents a homogeneous tissue, formed by
                    vascular arbusculae. The nervous system appears to consist of two large
                    ganglions, the one placed beneath the oesophagus, the other in the chest betwixt
                    the first and second pair of feet, and throwing out two remarkable cords,
                    divided into two or three threads at their extremities. Only two biliary vessels
                    have been yet observed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Genus Ranatra,</hi> Fab. differs from the preceding chiefly
                    in the linear form of the body, in the rostrum being directed forwards, and in

                    and elongated.</p>
                <p>These insects do not excel as swimmers. They frequently leave the water in the

                    cinerous, with a yellow tinge; the abdomen reddish beneath. It measures about an
                    inch in length, and the setaceous appendages are as long as the body. The
                    aigrette upon the eggs of this species consists of only two setae. The genus is
                    by no means numerous in species, but it occurs in the East Indies and America,
                    as well as in Europe.</p>

                    thickish, or less depressed than in the preceding tribe. Their posterior legs
                    are much ciliated, and resemble oars. They are terminated by two small
                    indistinct hooks. They swim or row with great swiftness, and frequently turn

                <p>These insects are of an elongated form, the body somewhat flattened, the head

                    transversely than in a longitudinal direction, but prolonged backwards to a
                    point. They walk defectively, but swim and fly well. We think they never swim
                    upon their backs, like the species of the following genus, but are usually seen
                    as it were suspended by their extremity from the surface of the water, and
                    prepare to dive instantly on the approach of danger. When seized they endeavour
                    to pierce the skin of the captor with their sharp-pointed rostrum; and if they
                    succeed in that effort, pain accompanied by swelling not unfrequently ensues.
                    The genus is not extensive. We may here name, as the most frequent in the fresh
                    waters of Europe, the <hi rend="italic">C. striata (Notonecta striata,</hi>

                    likewise of the latter colour.</p>

                <p>The Notonectae properly so called are characterized by the singular practice of
                    swimming upon their backs, with their bodies somewhat inclined, their heads
                    being elevated during their upward progress, and the contrary while they either
                    rest suspended at the surface or descend towards the bottom of the pool. When
                    these insects are in the act of swimming, they make use only of the middle and
                    posterior pairs of legs, the anterior being applied closely to the chest; but
                    when they walk at the bottom, or over the herbage of aquatic plants, in search
                    of insect prey, they then bring the latter into active service, and merely trail
                    the former after them, or alongside. The females deposit their eggs, which are
                    long and white, on the stalks and foliage of water-plants. The young are
                    produced in spring, and resemble the perfect insects, except in the want of
                    wings. The nymphae are equally active, and exhibit these organs in a rudimentary
                    state. They are all, of whatever sex, age, or condition, predaceous in their
                    disposition, and, in the absence of more ordinary food, will seize upon and
                    cruelly devour their own species. We are acquainted with about a dozen of the
                    genus, of which about a third inhabit Europe. The others occur in Asia, Africa,

                    legs are large. The form of the body, and texture of the elytra, likewise

                <p>In this second great division of the hemipterous order the rostrum or sucker
                    originates from the inferior part ol the head, close upon the chest, or even
                    from between the two anterior legs. The elytra (almost always inclined) are
                    semimembranous, and of the same consistence through· out. They are sometimes
                    scarcely distinguishable in their texture from the inferior wings. The three
                    component segments of the thorax are united as it were <hi rend="italic"

                    first is always shorter than the one following.</p>
                <p>The genera of this section are quite dissimilar in their habits to those with
                    which we have been previously engaged. They feed on the juices of plants. Many
                    of the females are provided with a scaly sheath or ovipositor (called <hi
                    rend="italic">oviscapte</hi> by M. Marcel de Serres). This is usuali) composed
                    of three dentated blades, lodged in a bivalvular groove. They use it as a kind
                    of saw, with which tc produce notches or other excavations in various plants,
                    for the purpose of depositing their eggs in safety.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I—CICADARIAE.</p>
                <p>The genera composing this family present three articulations in the tarsi,—the
                    antennae are usually very small, conical or awl-shaped, and consist of from
                    three to six portions, including the attenuated seta by which they are
                    terminated. We owe to MM. Ramdhor, Marcel de Serres, Leon Dufour, and Straus,
                    many excellent observations on the internal structure of these insects.
                    According to Dufour, the stomach, or chylific ventricle, is of remarkable
                    length. It commences by an oblong dilatation, either curved or straight, and
                    decreases into’ an intestini-form canal, which returns upon itself, and opens
                    near the origin of the ventricle, alongside the insertion of the hepatic
                    vessels, and not far from the origin of the intestine. They are all provided
                    with four biliary vessels. In the Cicadae the ventricle has what Dufour calls
                    “la forme d’une anse,” the right portion being dilated into a large lateral, and
                    frequently plaited pouch. Its superior extremity is united to the oesophagus by
                    an upper ligament, and the other leads to the narrow, tubular, very long,
                    reflexed prolongation, with the form of an intestine, which, after its
                    circumvolutions, re-ascends to unite with the pouch near the insertion of the
                    hepatic vessels. This truly singular disposition of the chylific ventricle,
                    which, after several convolutions, finally disgorges into itself, by the
                    completion of a circle traversed throughout by the alimentary fluid, is
                    doubtless a circumstance not easily explained in a physiological point of view.
                    It is, however, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747871?mode=fullsize"

                <p>Antennae composed of six articulations. Three simple eyes. This division includes

                    generally vitreous. A large scaly operculum covers a cavity on each side of the
                    base of the abdomen in the males.</p>
                <p>These insects differ from those that follow, not only in the structure of the
                    antennae and the amount of the simple orstemmatic eyes, but also in their being
                    all destitute of the faculty of leaping. The males are musical, that is, during
                    the heat of summer, they produce, by a peculiar structure, a loud and continuous
                    cry or stridulation, called by courtesy a song. When we examine the lateral base
                    of the abdomen of a male Cicada, we perceive two large scaly plates of a rounded
                    figure, approaching that of a demi-oval cut through its smaller axis; so that
                    each plate presents a side which is rectilinear, while the remaining portion
                    exhibits a rounded outline. It is by the straight side that each plate is fixed
                    without articulation, on the metathorax, of which it forms a portion. When we
                    lift up these plates we discover a cavity on each side of the abdomen, divided
                    into two principal chambers by a horny triangular septum. When viewed from the
                    side of the abdomen, each cell presents anteriorly a white and plaited membrane;
                    and lower down there is another membrane, thin, light, and transparent as glass,
                    called Ze <hi rend="italic">miroir</hi> by Réaumur. Some authors have regarded
                    this as a kind of drum or tambour, and the seat of sound; but that organ has yet
                    to be described. If we open the mirror from above, we perceive on each side of
                    it another plaited membrane, moved by a very powerful muscle, composed of a
                    great number of straight parallel fibres, and arising from the horny septum.
                    This latter membrane is the tymbal or drum, on which the muscles act by
                    contraction and relaxation, alternately tightening and restoring it to its
                    original state. This is the true origin of the sound, which in fact may be
                    produced even after the death of the insect, by jerking the muscle.<note

                    Chabrier has perceived a stigmatic opening, not noticed by Réaumur, at the
                    inferior junction of the mesothorax and metathorax; while Latreille has
                    discovered on the posterior part of each tymbal a distinct hđle, which, he
                    thinks, serves for the egress of the air. Chabrier, however, is of opinion that
                    the air makes its escape through the two stigmata placed at the base of the
                    opercula before mentioned.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    investigation will probably show that the analogues of this singular structure
                    exist in other insects. Indeed, the principal pieces have been already
                    recognised, though much more feebly developed, not only in the female Cicadae,
                    but also in certain species of the orthopterous genera <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Cicadae dwell on shrubs and trees, of which they suck the juices. 1he
                    females, which are provided with ovipositors, lay their eggs in holes, which
                    they form in the small branches or twigs of trees. The parts thus attacked are
                    easily recognised by little irregularities, formed by a portion of the wood
                    which has been raised. These elevations are placed in a row, one after the
                    other, upon the same side of the branch. The different holes have a diameter
                    nearly equal. Their depth is from three to four lines. They commence in an
                    oblique direction; but as soon as they reach the pith, they become nearly
                    parallel with the twig itself. The ovipositor does not pierce be- , yond the
                    pith; and the number of eggs placed in each lιole varies from four to ten. They
                    are white, oblong, and pointed at both ends. The larvae are white, and furnished
                    with six feet. They soon quit their sylvan nurseries, and make their way under
                    ground, where they gnaw the roots of plants. Their anterior legs are short, with
                    strong dentated thighs, and are well adapted for digging. They increase rapidly
                    in size, and are ere long transformed into nymphs. These are of a dingy-white
                    colour, and are chiefly remarkable for their very short and inflated fore legs,
                    which are dentated, and serve them to penetrate the earth. After living for
                    about a year in this state, they leave the groupd during the prevalence of warm
                    weather, and, climbing up the stems of trees, their skin first hardens, and then
                    bursts all along the centre of the dorsal line. The perfect insect then escapes
                    from its exuviae. It is at first very soft, and of a greenish colour; but it
                    soon attains a firmer consistence, and various external markings make their
                    appearance, according to the characteristic aspect of the different kinds.</p>
                <p>These insects were well known to ancient writers, and their so-called song has
                    been celebrated by poets from the highest antiquity. To ourselves it appeared
                    monotonous and fatiguing, although heard not seldom among the leafy groves which
                    shadow the fair white walls of the “Etrurian Athens.” The Cicada is the insect
                    so frequently and fondly commemorated by the Greek poets under the name of
                    r⅛mξ,—which our translators have generally though erroneously construed <hi
                    rend="italic">grasshopper.</hi> Linnaeus, with his accustomed propriety, applied
                    the term <hi rend="italic">Gryllus</hi> to the locust and grasshopper tribes,
                    and that of Cicada to the “beloved of the Athenians.” The name of tree
                    grasshopper, however, which is sometimes used, applies with sufficient accuracy
                    to the latter, and indicates one of its characteristic habits, that of usually
                    perching upon trees. The true grasshoppers are ground insects. The Cicadae are
                    scarcely known in Britain, although the species attached to ash-trees (ċľ. <hi
                    rend="italic">orni)</hi> is recorded as an English insect, in common with <hi
                    rend="italic">C. hoematodes.</hi> They abound in Italy and other southern parts
                    of Europe. The Italians call them <hi rend="italic">Cicale</hi> and the French
                    <hi rend="italic">Cigales,</hi> both words being no doubt derived from the
                    Latin. They are frequently mentioned by the modern Italian poets; and Lord Byron
                    somewhere alludes to the “shrill Cigala, people of the pines,” thus recognising
                    their <hi rend="italic">arboreous</hi> disposition. Although held in the highest
                    estimation as <hi rend="italic">children of the soil</hi> by the Athenians, who
                    used to wear golden images of them in their hair, there is no doubt that they
                    were also regarded by the Greek nations under a less intellectual aspect.
                    Aristotle mentions that they were used as food, and that they were particularly
                    esteemed just before <pb break="no" facs="nls:193747884?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-7884-0202"/> the conclusion of the nympha state. The insect
                    which he mentions under the name of <hi rend="italic">Tettigometra,</hi> or
                    mother of the Cicadae, is in fact merely that intermediate condition of nymph,
                    prior to the development of the organs of flight. In that state, as well as when
                    under the.form of larva, it lives upon the ground, or even beneath it, feeding
                    on herbage and the roots of plants;.but when about to undergo its final
                    metamorphosis, it climbs a tree, its outer garment bursts asunder and is thrown
                    off as exuviae, the wings expand their folds “voluminous and vast,” and we have
                    then the perfect insect or tree grasshopper, the Cicada of the Latins, and
                    Tettix of the Greeks, so beautifully addressed by Anacreon :— . ,</p>
                <p>We deem thee blest, thou grasshopper, as on the highest trees, Having sipp’d a
                    little dew, thou sitťst, like a monarch, at thine ease;</p>
                <p>For every thing before thee, whate’er the fields produce, And the fruits of every
                    season, are intended for thy use. Thou art the friend of husbandmen, since
                    harmless are thy ways; By mortals held in reverence, sweet seer of summer
                    days.</p>
                <p>The muses love thee dearly, to Phoebus art thou dear, Who with that voice hath
                    gifted thee, so musical and clear. Song-skilled, earth-born, song-loving one,
                    old age to thee’s no load; Fleshless, bloodless, passionless, thou almost art a
                    god.</p>
                <p>A great variety of opinion seems to prevail regarding the musical accomplishments
                    of these celebrated insects. Virgil accused the Italian Cicadae of bursting the
                    very shrubs with their noise—“Et cantu querulae rumpent arbusta Cicadae;” and Dr
                    Shaw in his Travels calls it, alluding to its shrilly cry, “the most troublesome
                    and impertinent of insects.” Kirby and Spence tell us that in some countries it
                    is execrated for its deafening din. Yet some one who desired to compliment
                    Plato, asserted that his voice was as sweet as a grasshopper’s; and we may all
                    remember the story of the rival musicians (Eunomus and Ariston), one of whom
                    gained the victory in consequence of a Cicada settling on his harp, and
                    supplying the place of a broken string. Even at this day the song of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tettigonia</hi><hi rend="italic">Tibicen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> Surinam is supposed so greatly to resemble the sound of a musical
                    instrument, that the insect itself is called the <hi rend="italic">Harper.</hi>
                    The following is Mr Elton’s translation of Meleager’s invocation.</p>
                <p>0 shrill-voiced insect! that with dew drops sweet, Inebriate, dost in desert
                    woodlands sing;</p>
                <p>Perched in the spray-top with indented feet, Thy dusky body’s echoings harp-like
                    ring: Come, dear Cicada! chirp to all the grove, The Nymphs and Pan, a new
                    responsive strain; That I, in noonday sleep, may steal from love, Reclined
                    beneath the dark o’erspreading plane.</p>
                <p>We shall here conclude our general sketch of these insects by observing that the
                    substance used in medicine, and known by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >manna,</hi> is an exudation from certain species of ash <hi rend="italic"
                    >(^Fraxinus</hi><hi rend="italic">rotuηdifolia</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ornus^</hi> which flourish in the south of Europe. It has been
                    observed to be frequently produced by the puncturing of the Cicadae, which feed
                    on the juices of those saccharine trees. The largest insect of the genus in
                    Europe is <hi rend="italic">C. plebeia</hi> of Linn. Its cry is very strong and
                    shrill; and as it is well known in Italy, there can be no doubt of its being the
                    species mentioned by Virgil. If identical with the Athenian Cicada, its voice
                    does certainly by no means correspond in musical intonation to what might be
                    inferred from its recoιded character as a lyrist among the ancient Greeks. The
                    pleasure produced may however depend upon association; for, as Cowper says/</p>
                <p>Sounds inharmonious in themselves, and harsh, <hi rend="italic">Yet heard in
                    scenes where peace for ever reigns, And only there,</hi> please highly for their
                    sake.</p>
                <p>It is said that the males alone are musical, which may perhaps be one reason for
                    their continued cheerfulness; for, as the Rhodian Xenarchus has it,</p>
                <p>Happy the Cicadas’ lives,</p>
                <p>Since they all have voiceless wives.</p>
                <p>The amount of species in the genus Cicada is considerable. They are spread over
                    almost all the regions of the earth, especially in the warmer latitudes.<note

                    The <hi rend="italic">Cicada Orni</hi> is a European insect, common in France
                    and Italy. It is about an inch long, yellowish, paler beneath, but mixed with
                    black on the upper portions. The margins of the abdominal segments are reddish.
                    There are two rows of blackish spots on the upper wings, those next the inner
                    margin being the smallest. Its voice is hoarse, and does not extend so far as
                    that of several other species. This is the kind which, by wounding the tree from
                    which it derives its specific name (a species of wild ash), causes a peculiar
                    and honey-like fluid to flow from it. It afterwards dries and hardens, and in
                    that state is used medicinally under the name of manna. The C. <hi rend="italic"

                    found in France. It is black, with some spots on the first segment of the
                    thorax, its posterior margin, the raised and arched portions of the scutellum,
                    and several veins on the elytra, reddish: Its cry is strong and shrill. The <hi

                    legs spotted. The edges of the abdominal segments, and the reticulations of the
                    elytra, are red. This species occurs in the south of France, but is rare in the
                    vicinity of Paris, lts voice is weaker than that of the preceding species.

                    dwell on trees, but their special manners are but slightly known. We shall here
                    indicate a few of the more noted species.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">F. laternaria,</hi> Linn, is a large and remarkable insect from
                    South America, drawn and described in most illustrated works on entomology. Its
                    muzzle is nearly straight as to its direction from the head, but it is vesicular
                    and inflated, or swollen out and rounded, at the sides and extremity. The ends
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the under wings are pleasantly varied with black and
                    yellow, in the form of an expanded spot, resembling the eye of a peacock’s
                    feather. Madame Merian informs us, that from the head or front of this species a
                    light is seen to shine during the darker hours, so clear and brilliant that it
                    is easy to read by its rays. She adds, that during the day it is transparent as
                    a bladder, and radiated with red and green. The indefatigable and accurate
                    Réaumur, desirous to ascertain by anatomical investigation the proximate cause
                    of this curious phenomenon, opened one of these vesicular expansions, buthe
                    found it empty, except of air, and containing no organic structure. We must bear
                    in mind, however, that the individual examined was in a state <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> desiccation. The species is common at Guadaloupe and Cayenne, where it
                    is known by the name of fire-fly. It flies well, and hovers habitually about the
                    summits of the tallest trees. Its luminous faculty has been sometimes called in
                    question, especially by M. Richard, who captured many at Cayenne, but never saw
                    them shine. Yet the testimony of Madame Merian, and the general application to

                <p>These singular insects are distinguished from those of the preceding family by
                    the tarsi, which have only two articulations, and by the antennae, filiform or
                    setaceous, longer than the head, and composed of from six to eleven
                    articulations. Such as possess organs of flight have always two elytra and a
                    pair of wings. The species are usually very small,—their bodies generally of a
                    soft consistence, the elytra and wings nearly alike, or differing merely in size
                    and thickness. They lay a prodigious number of eggs, and their mode of
                    production is in other respects very remarkable.</p>
                <p>In some the antennae consist of from ten to eleven articulations, of which the
                    last is terminated by a couple of setae. These are leaping insects, and compose

                    Aphides after mentioned. They live on trees and various plants, by the juices of
                    which they are nourished. Both sexes are winged. The body of the larvae is
                    usually very flat, the head large, the abdomen rounded posteriorly. Their feet
                    are terminated by a small membranous vesicle, furnished beneath with a couple of
                    hooks. The nymphs are distinguishable by four broad flat dorsal portions, which
                    constitute the sheaths of the incipient wings and elytra. Several species are

                    genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Livia</hi> upon a species which dwells among rushes
                    (Plate CCXXIX. fig. 17). The antennae are much thicker near the base than
                    towards the extremity.</p>
                <p>In other Aphidii the antennae have only from six to eight articulations, of which
                    the last is not terminated by a couple of setae. .</p>
                <p>Some have the elytra and wings linear, fringed with hairs, and placed
                    horizontally upon the body, which is of an almost cylindrical form. The rostrum
                    is very small or indistinct. The tarsi are terminated by a vesicular article,
                    unfurnished with hooks. The antennae consist of eight granular articulations.
                    Such are the species which form the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Thrips</hi> of
                    Linn. (Plate CCXXIX. fig. 18). These insects are very small, extremely active,
                    and seem to leap rather than fly. When teazed, they raise and recurve the
                    extremity of the abdomen, after the manner of the Staphylinidae. They live among
                    flowers and other parts of plants, and beneath the bark of trees. We may add,
                    that although Latreille did not perceive in the organization of the mouth of
                    these insects any characters essentially different from such as distinguish that
                    organ among the other component parts of the homopterous Hemiptera,-yet M.
                    Straus, who has studied the subject very laboriously, and with his wonted
                    intelligence, is of opinion that the genus Thrips belongs in fact to the
                    orthopterous order.</p>
                <p>Others have the elytra and wings oval or triangular, without fringe, and inclined
                    or tectiform. The rostrum is distinct. The tarsi are terminated by two hooks.
                    The antennae consist of from six to seven articulations. Such are the species
                    which compose the great genus <hi rend="italic">Aphis of</hi> Linn, which is now
                    divisible as follows.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Aphis</hi> properly so called, the antennae are
                    longer than the thorax, of seven articulations, of which the third is elongated.
                    The eyes are entire, and the abdomen is furnished with two horn-like projections
                    at its posterior extremity. The species dwell together in society on various
                    trees and plants, of which they suck the juices. They walk very leisurely, and
                    cannot leap. The two horn-like processes just mentioned are hollow tubes, from
                    which a drop of transparent liquid frequently exudes. It partakes of the
                    property of sugar, and is much sought after by ants, who suck it with avidity
                    from the living Aphides. This curious fact was first noticed by M. Boissier de
                    Sauvages, and has since been amply confirmed by Μ. P. Huber. The desired liquor
                    seems to be given out voluntarily by the aphis, when solicited so to do by a
                    gentle tap from the ant’s antennae. A single aphis may be sometimes seen
                    surrounded by three or four ants, all <hi rend="superscript"> ln</hi> the act of

                    females first mentioned; which broods consist of apterous females, differing
                    from their progenitors in requiring impregnation prior to the continuance of
                    their kind. They lay <hi rend="italic">eggs</hi> soon after the sexual

                    producing living young, without assistance from each other. “L’influence ďune

                    juices, and the obstruction of the natural pores, is consequently great. Réaumur
                    calculates, that in the course of five generations, a single mother may be the
                    means of producing 5,904,900,000! But fortunately they are liable to the attacks
                    of numerous enemies, and are greedily devoured by many other insects. The larvae
                    of the genus <hi rend="italic">Henιero∙ bins,</hi> those of different dipterous
                    species, and of the <hi rend="italic">Coccinellae</hi> or lady-birds, make the
                    helpless Aphides their constant prey. We cannot here describe the species, but
                    shall content ourselves by naming a few familiar examples. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aphis rosoe</hi> (Plate CCXXIX. figs. 19 and 20) is a small green species, very
                    abundant on the younger shoots of roses, the flowering of which it seems to
                    damage or destroy. Its hordes may be killed by dipping the affected branch into
                    soapy water. <hi rend="italic">A. quercus</hi> occurs on the oak, and is
                    remarkable for the great length of its beak, which is at least three times as
                    long as the body. It is of a brown colour. <hi rend="italic">A.fagi</hi> is
                    attached to the beech tree, and covers itself, as do many other species, with a
                    white and cotton-like down, which exudes from its body. Including the genus <hi

                    enclosed in an envelope, so that its transformations differ from those of its
                    congeners. Indeed the somewhat anomalous character of this insect has been the
                    cause of its being described under a great variety of names.<note

                    only nine in the males of the species described by M. Dalman. These creatures

                <p>We may frequently perceive on the branches of various trees multitudes of small
                    oval or rounded bodies resembling scales, adhering closely to the wood, and
                    presenting no indications of any external organs. These aiae insects of the
                    genus Coccus, the <hi rend="italic">progallinsectes</hi> of Réaumur. Their
                    history was for a long period extremely obscure, and the species employed in
                    commerce was even at one time regarded as a kind of grain. It was only towards
                    the termination of the seventeenth century that Μ. Plumier clearly established
                    their insect origin. We are indebted to Réaumur for a complete history of the
                    life and transformations of the European kinds. The larvae of both males and
                    females, on first quitting the egg, are tolerably active, and run about among
                    the leaves and branches. They are, however, so extremely small at that period,
                    as not to be distinctly discernible without the aid of a microscope. They are
                    flat, ovular, apterous, with short and indistinctly articulated antennae. The
                    males have no apparent organs of manducation, although the females are furnished
                    with a small, extremely short, almost conical beak, inserted between the first
                    and second pair of feet, nearly perpendicular in its direction, and composed of
                    a four-jointed sheath containing a sucker of three pieces. It is with this
                    instrument that they pump the juices of the leaves and tender stems. They also
                    fix themselves from time to time for the purpose of changing their skin, and
                    after arriving at a certain size, they become definitely fixed in some chosen
                    spot, usually at the bifurcation of a branch, where they form a little nest,
                    protected by a tapestry of cotton. They then attain the perfect state, and are
                    apterous (we speak of the females) even in that otherwise complete condition.
                    Their head is semicircular, their mouth is still formed of the beak which
                    existed in the larva state, and the eyes are small. The thorax is not easily
                    distinguished from the abdomen, the segments of which are distinct. When the
                    insect has attained its full growth, its abdomen is found filled with a
                    multitude of minute eggs. The larvae of the males, though by no means rare, are
                    much less numerous than those of the other sex. Their mode of sustenance, owing
                    to the want of the sucker, is not distinctly known; but they increase in size,
                    and after a time their skin hardens, and serves as a cocoon, in which they
                    undergo their transformation to the nympha state. In the latter condition they
                    are remarkable for the anterior pair of legs being directed forwards. Towards
                    the beginning of spring these eocoons open at their posterior portion, and the
                    perfect male insect comes forth stern foremost. It is of a more elongated form,
                    with a round head furnished with two small eyes and a pair of rather long
                    antennae. The thorax is rounded, and has attached to it a pair of long wings,
                    folded horizontally one over the other, and very delicately veined. (For a male
                    Coccus see Plate CCXXIX. fig. 16; the fe male is shown by figures 21 and 22).
                    The male is less thank the female, and more active, although it uses its wings
                    very! sparingly. As soon as it attains the perfect state, it sets off in search
                    of the other sex, which still remains fixed in <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>
                    the nest, as formerly mentioned. The oviposition of the female is another
                    remarkable peculiarity in the history of these insects. Though excluded from the
                    body, the eggs do not appear externally, but are made to pass beneath the
                    abdomen, and between it and the cotton tapestry above alluded to. In proportion
                    as the insect becomes empty, the lower surface of the abdomen approaches the
                    upper one, so as to leave beneath the body a kind of arch or cavity for the
                    reception of the eggs. The perfect female never stirs a step in the course of
                    her life, but having laid her eggs she dies, and her body shŗivels up and
                    hardens, and thus forms a coeoon or covering for the incipient young. These, as
                    soon as hatched, work their way from beneath the dead body of their parent,
                    making their escape by its posterior extremity.</p>
                <p>These curious insects are certainly hurtful to vegetation, by causing a too
                    abundant transudation of their juices; and they consequently excite the jealousy
                    of those who cultivate the finer trees, sueh as the peach, the orange, the
                    olive, and the fig. Certain species attack also the roots of plants. But, upon
                    the whole, the advantages which we derive from this genus of insect amply
                    counterbalance whatever injuries it may occasionally inflict upon us. The
                    species are very numerous. We shall here notice only a few of the more
                    remarkable.</p>
                <p>Of the kind called Kermes, is that known to naturalists by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Coccus</hi><hi rend="italic">Ilicis,</hi> of which the female
                    attains to the size and form of a pea. It is of a violet-black colour, covered
                    by a whitish powder. This species is common over the south of Europe on the
                    evergreen oak, and appears to be widely distributed over many of the
                    southeastern countries of the ancient world. It occurs abundantly in Spain,
                    where it attaches itself chiefly to the twigs and leaves of a small species of
                    spiny-leaved oak, frequent in the southern parts of that romantic kingdom,
                    especially on the slopes of the Sierra Morena. Many of the inhabitants of Murcia
                    have no other means of subsistence than those procured by collecting the Kermes.
                    Women are usually so employed, and they scrape the adhesive insects from the
                    trees by means of their nails. Though supplanted over the greater portion of
                    Europe by the introduction of the more famous cochineal (Cbcm <hi rend="italic"

                    applied to it during the middle ages, when its insect origin came to be

                    French term <hi rend="italic">cramoisi</hi> is evidently from the Arabic. It is
                    supposed to have been by means of this substance that the curtains of the

                    identical with that of cochineal, but combined with some astringent matter
                    derived from the tree on which it feeds. _</p>
                <p>The substance called <hi rend="italic">lac</hi> is also the produce of an insect
                    of the Coccus kind. It is collected from various trees in India, where it is
                    used in the fabrication of beads, rings, and other ornaments of female attire.
                    When mixed with sand it forms grindstones; and, added to ivory black, and
                    previously dissolved in water with a little borax, it composes an ink which,
                    when dry, is said to be capable of resisting a considerable degree of damp or
                    moisture. In this country, according to the different states in which it is
                    imported, it is called stick-lac, seed-lac, lump-lac, or shell-lac. It is
                    chiefly used in the making of varnishes, japanned ware, and sealing-wax,
                    although during late years it has been applied to a still more important
                    purpose, as originally suggested by Dr Roxburgh, that of a substitute for
                    cochineal in dyeing scarlet. The first preparations from it with this view were
                    made in consequence of a hint from Dr Bancroft; and large quantities of a
                    substance termed <hi rend="italic">lαe-lαhe,</hi> consisting of the colouring
                    matter of stick-lac, precipitated from an alkaline lixivium by alum, were
                    manufactured at Calcutta, and sent to this country, where at first the
                    consumption was so considerable, that in the three years previous to 1810 the
                    sales at the India house equalled in point of colouring matter half a million of
                    pounds weight of cochineal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    saved in a few months L.14,000 in the purchase of scarlet cloths dyed with this
                    colour and cochineal conjointly, and without any inferiority in the colour

                    it was capable of imparting as brilliant a scarlet as that dye, and one perhaps
                    more permanent. It must be borne in mind, however, that as ten or twelve pounds
                    of kermes contain no more colouring matter than a single pound of cochineal, the
                    latter at its ordinary price is, after all, the cheapest.</p>
                <p>Several other curious and valuable products arc obtained from insects belonging

                    great quantities in the vicinity of Madras; but Dr Pearson’s experiments do not
                    countenance the idea, at one time rather sanguinely entertained, that it might

                <p>Before closing this branch of our subject, we must devote a few lines to the
                    cochineal insect properly so called, the <hi rend="italic">Coccus cacti</hi> of
                    naturalists (Plate CCXX1X. figs. 16, 21, 22). This species, so important in a
                    commercial point of view, and in relation to our arts and manufactures, is a
                    native of Mexico, where it was assiduously cultivated at a period long anterior
                    to the European conquest of that country. We shall not describe its appearance,
                    as that will be better understood by an inspection of the figures just referred
                    to. There are several varieties, named in general from the provinces where they
                    are bred; and of these, that called Mastique or Mêsteque is regarded as the
                    best. It is cultivated on a tree called Nopal by the Indians <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Cactus cochenilifer,</hi> Linn.) and its colour is by some attributed to the
                    juices of that plant. It is the female insect that is so highly valued for the
                    incomparable beauty of its colour. It is imported to Europe in the form of a
                    little grain, convex on one side, concave on the other, and exhibiting traces of
                    the abdominal segments. In the year 1736 there was sent to Europe about 700,000
                    pounds weight of this minute creature, a quantity worth L.700,000 sterling.
                    Humboldt states the quantity imported about the period of his inquiries to have
                    been 32,000 arrobas, worth in South America L.500,040 sterling,<note

                    Great Britain at about 750 bags, or 150,000 pounds weight,—worth L.375,000
                    sterling at recent prices. The natives of those districts in which the cochineal
                    is reared form plantations of the nopal tree near their dwellinghouses. It grows
                    freely from cuttings, and the latter are fit for the reception of the insect in
                    eighteen months. Eight orten females are put into a small nest formed of tufts
                    of a thread-like substance collected from a species of palm, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193747962?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7962-0208"/> or of any
                    other cottony matter. These nests are attached to the spines of the nopal, upon
                    the side facing the rising sun, and the insects are placed in them about the
                    middle of October, a period at which good weather usually commences in Mexico
                    after the rains. The eggs are soon laid and hatched, and the progeny spread in
                    vast numbers over the plant, each female producing upwards of a thousand young.
                    According to Μ. Thierry de Menonville,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    generations are produced in a year, and they might be collected at all seasons,
                    buζ for the destruction produced among them by the periodical rains. The first
                    collection takes place about the middle of December, and the last in the month
                    of May. They are detached by means of a knife with the edge blunted, to prevent
                    injury to the nopal tree. When the first gathering is made, the nests are taken
                    away, and the dead females (those placed on the nopal in October) are likewise
                    picked off. These are lighter and less valuable than such as are taken off alive
                    and full of young; the former losing three fourths, the latter two thirds,
                    during the process of drying. As soon as dried, however, both kinds may be kept
                    for any length of time, without any further loss of either weight or colour.
                    They are killed by different processes. Some put them in a basket, which they
                    dip in boiling water, and afterwards dry them by exposure to the sun; others
                    place them in an oven, or on plates of heated iron. The various external colours
                    of the insect, as we afterwards see it in Europe, depend upon the mode of
                    putting it to death. Those which have been killed by being dipt in hot water
                    (the method regarded as the best), lose a portion of the white powder with which
                    they were previously invested, and acquire a brownish-red colour. When so
                    treated, they pass under the name of <hi rend="italic">renagrida.</hi> When
                    killed in an oven they retain the white powder, remain externally of a grey
                    colour, and are <hi rend="italic">caWĉAjarpeada.</hi> Such as are placed on
                    plates of heated iron become of a blackish hue, and are then named <hi
                    rend="italic">ηegra.</hi> When cochineal insects are forced from the tree, they
                    speedily die, even if no further violence is offered them; because their sucker,
                    being fixed in the wood, is unavoidably dislocated and broken off by the act of
                    removal. It is necessary, however, to put them to death, because they might
                    otherwise live for a short time, and meanwhile produce their young, the loss of
                    which would diminish the quantity of colouring matter.</p>
                <p>The other most frequent variety of cochineal is called <hi rend="italic"
                    >sylvester</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> on account of its being
                    commonly collected from a species of cattus which grows wild, or without
                    culture. It is of smaller size, and much less valuable in relation both to the
                    amount and quality of the colour which it yields. We have not yet ascertained to
                    our own satisfaction whether it is a mere variety or a distinct species.
                    Although it occurs naturally upon a wild spiny cactus, it is also cultivated
                    upon the nopal or garden species, for the sake of the greater facility of
                    collection. So great indeed is the difference in this point, that in one day a
                    single labourer will gather from the latter a quantity which, when dry, will
                    amount to the weight of three pounds,—whereas from the former the most
                    persevering hand will not obtain in that time much more than a couple of ounces.
                    Moreover, when cultivated on the garden nopal, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sylvester</hi> cochineal attains to as large a size as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mastique.</hi></p>
                <p>Various attempts have been made to introduce the culture of the cochineal into
                    our eastern possessions, although these, so far as we are informed, have not yet
                    been attended with any marked success. The old Spanish government manifested
                    great jealousy on the subject; and we are not aware that the true kind has been
                    yet imported, although the court of directors at one period offered a reward of
                    L.6000 to whoever should effect its introduction to India. Colonel Bory St
                    Vincent informs us that attempts have recently been made, and with a fair
                    prospect of success, to effect its cultivation near Malaga, in Spain.<note

                    We shall conclude our sketch by observing that considerable care is requisite to
                    preserve these insects from the attacks of their natural enemies, of which one
                    of the chief is the larva of a species of Coccinella, which sucks them to death,
                    and leaves nothing but the skin. A very destructive foe is also described as
                    being a caterpillar, of an inch in length, and the thickness of a crow-quill,
                    whieh, it is said, would soon destroy the race if allowed to continue its
                    attacks without any interference on the part of the higher powers.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We scarcely think that the
                    creature above alluded to can be a caterpillar properly so called, that is, the
                    larva of a lepidopterous insect.</p></note> It is said that a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Ptinus</hi> also feeds upon them freely. Besides these direct
                    enemies, there is another insect, with the exact nature of which we are not
                    acquainted, which lives in common with the cochineal upon the juices of the
                    nopal, and by so doing greatly interferes with the health and progress of the
                    more valuable species. Among its larger, if not more formidable enemies, we may
                    mention a mouse, which is said always to prefer the mastique or finer cochineal
                    to the Sylvester or wild species, because the cottony matter with which the

                <p>Distinguished by four naked or transparent wings, reticulated or interlaced by a
                    delicate network, and usually of the same size as well as texture. The mouth is
                    adapted for mastication, that is, furnished with mandibles and true maxillae,
                    and never assumes the tubular form. The abdomen does not possess a sting, and is
                    rarely provided with an ovipositor. The antennae are usually setaceous, and
                    composed of numerous articulations. The head is furnished with two or three
                    simple eyes. The thorax is formed of three segments, intimately united to each
                    other, though perceptibly distinct from the abdomen; the first of these segments
                    is usually very short, and in the form of a collar. The number of joints of the
                    tarsi varies. The form of the body is for the most part elongated, and its
                    texture rather soft and delicate. The abdomen is always sessile. Many of the
                    species are carnivorous, both in the larva and perfect state.</p>
                <p>This beautiful and very varied order has been divided into two by Mr Kirby, by
                    the separation of the genus <hi rend="italic">Piιryganea</hi> of Linn., which
                    the English naturalist raises to the rank of an order under the name <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Trichoptera.</hi> It might also have simplified the characters
                    of the order if we had left in it only those which possess reticulated wings;
                    but as some of the latter exhibit a difference in the texture of the organs of
                    flight, it is difficult to assign rigorous characters to the neuropterous
                    tribes, if we attach a high importance to the wings. “Of all the Linnaean
                    orders,” says Mr Kirby, “this appears to consist of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193747975?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-7975-0209"/> the most
                    discordant tribes; so that it seems next to impossible to construct a definition
                    that will include them all unless indeed we admit M. Latreille’s idea, adopted
                    by Mr Macleay, that a varied metamorphosis is its essential character; or, to
                    speak more largely, variety itself seems the characteristic of the insects
                    composing it in every state, and there is scarcely a common distinctive
                    character in their perfect state, upon detecting which in any individual, you
                    may exclaim—this is a neuropterous insect.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    from the orthopterous and hemipterous kinds by the greater difference of
                    consistence in the two latter between the upper and under wings. The
                    Hymenoptera, again, have generally much longer maxillae—serving rather to suck
                    the juices than to bruise .the more solid portions of the substances on which
                    they feed. The scale-covered wings of the lepidopterous order prevent their
                    being confounded with our present subjects; while the Diptera are easily
                    distinguished by the absence of the lower wings, and the different structure of
                    the organs of manducation.</p>
                <p>The mouth in the neuropterous order is generally composed of a labrum and a
                    labium, of two mandibles, and a pair <hi rend="italic">of</hi> maxillae. The
                    latter organs are very sharp and strong among the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lihellulce,</hi> which prey on other insects, but extremely small or almost
                    imperceptible in the <hi rend="italic">Ephemeral,</hi> which, as their name
                    implies, are very short-lived, and take no nourishment in the perfect state. The
                    palpi are very short in the former tribes, but exceedingly long among the <hi
                    rend="italic">Aĩyrmeleones.</hi> Although the antennae, in the majority, are
                    filiform or setaceous, they are terminated by an elongated club in those last
                    named; while in the genus <hi rend="italic">Ascalaphus</hi> they are very long
                    and slender, and terminate in a little button, resembling those of many
                    Lepidoptera. The wings are sometimes tectiform or incumbent, sometimes stretched
                    out horizontally. Though frequently alike in size, they occasionally differ from
                    each other. Thus in the genus <hi rend="italic">Eemoptera</hi> the under pair
                    are very long and narrow, while in some Ephemerae they are almost
                    obliterated.</p>
                <p>In the larva and nympha states these insects are either terrestrial or aquatic,
                    according to their kinds. In the former case some dwell beneath the bark of
                    trees, others move about on twigs and branches, making an unresisting prey of
                    Aphides; while a certain number inhabit sandy soils, where they excavate
                    insidious pit-falls, and seize upon whatever insects venture within the circle
                    of their treacherous toils. The aquatic species dwell in their earlier states in
                    ponds and marshes, and in the shallower and more sheltered parts of lakes and
                    rivers. They then respire by means of organs which exhibit a strong analogy to
                    the gills of fishes, but which Latreille recognises only as exterior tracheal
                    appendages, named false branchia. Many construct very ingenious cases of small
                    stones, shells, and twigs of water-plants, in which they move about m their
                    watery element.</p>
                <p>Ihe Neuroptera are, in general, insects ofan extremely elegant deportment. They
                    fly with great facility, and are not unfrequently adorned by agreeable and
                    varied colours. . Though almost all carnivorous as larvae, their habits differ
                    greatly in the perfect state. Some undergo a semi-metamorphosis,—others are
                    completely changed, —-but all the larvae are provided with six-hooked feet,
                    which they usually employ in their search for food. La-tιeιlle divides the order
                    into three families, which present the following succession of natural
                    affinities, <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">st,</hi> Carnivorous
                    insects, subject to a semi-metamorphosis, with aquatic larvae; 2√, carnivorous

                    reticulated, and which bear a resemblance to Phalenae or Tineites.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I—SUBULICOHNES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Lat.</hi></p>
                <p>These consist <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Odonata</hi> of
                    Fabricius, and the genus <hi rend="italic">Ephemera.</hi> The antennae are
                    subulate or awl-shaped, scarcely longer than the head, and consist at most of
                    seven articulations, of which the last is setiform. The mandibles and maxillae
                    are entirely covered by the labrum and labium, or by the anterior or prolonged
                    portion of the head. The wings are always much reticulated, separate, sometimes
                    horizontal, sometimes raised perpendicularly. The inferior pair, though often as
                    large as the superior, are in some instances much less, or even entirely
                    wanting. The real eyes are large and projecting, and have from two to three
                    stemmatic eyes placed between them. They feed on living prey, and pass their
                    earlier states beneath the waters. The larvae and nymphs exhibit a form somewhat
                    similar to that of the perfect insects, and respire by particular organs placed
                    along the sides or at least the extremity of the abdomen. They creep up the
                    stalks of plants, or otherwise leave their moist abodes, before undergoing their
                    final transformation.</p>
                <p>In the great genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Libellula</hi> of Linn. (Plate CCXXX.
                    figs. 1, 2, 3, 4, 6), the mandibles and maxillae are corneous and very strong,
                    and are covered by the labrum above and by the labium below. The tarsi have
                    three articulations. The wings are nearly of equal size, and the posterior
                    extremity of the body is terminated simply by hooks or by foliaceous
                    appendages.</p>
                <p>The light and graceful form of these insects, their beautiful and varied colours,
                    their large and lustrous wings, and the hawk-like velocity with which they
                    pursue their flying prey, render them objects of our frequent attention, and
                    easy to be recognised. Our present observations apply to all the component parts
                    of the great and unrestricted genus just named. We shall afterwards give the
                    specialities of the minor groups. The eyes of the Libellulae, or dragon-flies in
                    general, are large and lateral; the stemmata are placed upon the vertex. The
                    antennae are inserted on the front, behind a vesicular elevation, and are
                    composed in the greater number of from five to six articulations, or at least of
                    three, of which the last is composite, and attenuated in the form of a style.
                    The labrum is arched and semicircular; the mandibles are of a scaly texture,
                    very strong and toothed; the maxillae are terminated by a piece of the same
                    consistence, dentated, spinous, and ciliated on the inner side, with a palpus of
                    one articulation on its back, representing what is called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >galea</hi> in the orthopterous tribes. The labium is large, arched, and
                    trifoliate, the two lateral foliae being in fact palpi. There exists a kind of
                    epiglottis, or vesicular and longitudinal tongue, in the interior of the mouth.
                    The abdomen, always considerably elongated, varies in its contour, being in some
                    cylindrical, in others compressed, and occasionally flattened. It is terminated
                    in the males by tw o lamellar appendages, which likewise vary in fortn according
                    to the species. The legs are short, and directed forwards. “Le dessous du second

                    ces insectes s’opère différemment que dans les autres. Le mâle, planant d’abord
                    au-dessus de sa femelle, la saisait par le col, au moyen des crochets de
                    l’extrémité postérieure de son ventre, et s’envole ainsi avec elle. Au bout d’un
                    temps, plus ou moins long, celle-ci se prêtant a ces désirs, courbe en dessous
                    son abdomen, et en applique l’extrémité sur les parties du male, dont le corps
                    est alors courbé en forme de boucle. La copulation a souvent lieu dans les airs,
                    et quelquefois encore sur les corps où ces insectes sont posés.”<note

                <p>The larvae and nymphs are aquatic. The former have no wings, the latter exhibit
                    them in a rudimentary state (Plate CCXXX. figs. 1, 3). The head in these early
                    stages is remarkable for the singular piece which corresponds to the labium. It
                    assumes the form of a mask, and covers the mandibles, the maxillae, and almost
                    all the under parts of the head. It is composed of, 1s(, a principal triangular
                    piece, sometimes arched, sometimes flat, named <hi rend="italic"
                    >mentonnière</hi> (or chin-cloth) by Réaumur, which articulates by means of a
                    hinge with a pedicle or kind of handle attached to the head; 2&lt;Z, of two
                    other pieces inserted at the lateral and inferior angles of the preceding,

                    plates, resembling shutters in their nature, and the mode in which they close
                    the mouth, or analogous to little hooks or claws. To that portion of the mask
                    where the <hi rend="italic">mentonnière</hi> is articulated with its pedicle, or
                    the knee, and which appears to terminate it inferiorly when the mask is bent or
                    folded upon itself, Réaumur applied the term <hi rend="italic">mentum.</hi> The
                    insect unfolds and extends this peculiar apparatus with great promptitude, and
                    seizes its prey with the pincers of the superior portion. These creatures live
                    fór ten or eleven months in the water, during which period they several times
                    cast their skin. When the nymphs are ready to assume their final change, the
                    form and position of the wing-cases undergo an alteration. They then leave the
                    water, become dry and crisp, the skin of the thorax bursts asunder, and the
                    winged insect issues forth under a different and much more ornamental aspect.
                    The name of <hi rend="italic">Demoiselles,</hi> by which many of them are known
                    to our continental neighbours, attests the impression produced by their graceful
                    forms or elegant movements. These Demoiselles always come out of the water head
                    foremost; but no sooner have they burst their casements than they turn
                    themselves round, and hang for a time with their head downward, being prevented
                    from falling by the hinder segments of the abdomen being still entangled in and
                    adhering to the skin of the nymph. After a time the young aspirant again turns
                    round, and seizing, ťhe anterior portion of the cloven skin with its claws, it
                    finally succeeds in dragging itself forth from its former dwelling. The wings,
                    however, are as yet narrow, thick, and closely folded, just like a leaf during
                    the bursting spring. After another hour or two they become firm, consistent, and
                    extended both in length and breadth, and the gay and gorgeous creature,
                    launching buoyantly into the air, becomes the tyrant of the insect world.</p>

                    on each side upon the vertex; the other stemmatic eye is larger, and placed

                    the larvae and nymphs is also more lengthened than that of the same states in
                    Libellulae. The mask is flat, and the two pincers are narrow, with a moveable
                    nail at the end. The abdomen, in their early states, is also terminated by five
                    appendages, one of which, however, is truncated at the point. <hi rend="italic"

                    are held perpendicularly in repose, the head is transversal, and the eyes
                    distant. The form of the labium is analogous to that of AEshna, but the middle
                    lobe is divided into two as far as its base. The third joint of the lateral
                    lobes is in the form of a membranous ligula. The antennae seem to be composed of
                    only four joints. The front presents no vesicle, and the stemmatic eyes are of
                    nearly equal size, and disposed triangularly on the vertex. The abdomen is very
                    slender or even filiform, and, in some foreign species, of extraordinary length.
                    That of the female is furnished with serrated laminae at its posterior
                    extremity. The form of the body in the larva and nympha states of this genus is
                    likewise long and slender, and the abdomen is terminated by three fin-like
                    plates (ibid. fig. 3). The mask is flat, the upper extremity of the <hi

                <p>In the other Neuropteraof the famdy Subulιcornes the mouth is entirely membranous
                    or very soft, and composed of not very distinguishable parts. Their tarsi
                    consist of five joints. The inferior wings are much smaller than the upper ones,
                    and are even sometimes wanting. The abdomen is terminated by two or three setae.

                <p>In these frail and fleeting insects the body is very soft, long, and tapering,
                    and terminates as above mentioned. Their antennae are very small, and composed
                    of three articulations, of which the last is very long, and in the form of a
                    conical thread. The anterior portion of their head projects in the manner of a
                    clypeus, is frequently carinated and emarginate, and covers the mouth,-of which
                    it is difficult to distinguish the structure, on account of the slight
                    development of its parts, and the softness of their texture. The Ephemerae in
                    repose carry their wings almost always in a perpendicular position, or a little
                    inclined backwards. The legs are slender, with very short tibiae, frequently
                    confounded with the tarsi, which often exhibit only four joints, owing to the
                    evanescence of the first; the two hooks of the last are much compressed into the
                    form of a little pallet. The two anterior legs are much longer than the others,
                    inserted almost beneath the head, and extended forwards. These insects usually
                    make their appearance in the winged state towards the evening in fine summer
                    weather, and sometimes in such abundance, that in certain districts of France
                    cart-loads of them have been gathered from the ground, and employed as manure.
                    <hi rend="italic">E. albipennis,</hi> in particular, a species, as its name
                    implies, remarkable for the whiteness of its wings, sometimes rises and falls in
                    such quantities by the banks of rivers, as to thicken the air and whiten the
                    surface of the ground,—reminding one, even in the verdurous and leafy summer,

                <p>The flaky weight of winter’s purest snows.</p>
                <p>The males are distinguished from the females by a pair of articulated hooks, and
                    their fore legs and caudal appendages are likewise longer. Although strictly
                    ephemeral in their final state, they have rather a more extended term of life
                    than usual in their subaqueous abodes, where they are said to live and prosper
                    for two or three years. In the larva state the antennae are longer than
                    afterwards; the stemmatic eyes are wanting; the mouth presents two horn-like
                    projections, which are regarded as mandibles; the abdomen is furnished on each
                    side with a range of laminae or leaflets, usually united at the base in pairs.
                    These last-named parts are a kind of false branchia, on which the tracheal
                    ramifications are extended, and which serve not only for the purposes of
                    respiration, but also for those of locomotion. The tarsi have only a single hook
                    at their extremity. The abdomen is terminated by setae, of the same amount as in
                    the perfect insect. The nymphs differ from the larvae chiefly in being possessed
                    of little sheaths or wing-cases (Plate CCXXX. fig. 10). When <hi rend="italic"
                    >ripe,</hi> they leave the waters, and undergo their final transformation,
                    pretty much after the manner of the Libellulae already described, although more
                    rapidly. One singular characteristic, however, attends their winged condition,
                    from which the other tribes are free; they cast off a complete envelope or skin,
                    including that even of the limbs, setae, and antennae, almost immediately after
                    they have attained the perfect state, or at least what Mr Curtis has well named
                    the <hi rend="italic">pseudo-imago.</hi> While following the delightful pursuit
                    of angling, both along our own unrivalled streams, and by the banks of foreign
                    waters, we have frequently had our fishing panier and the rims of our hat
                    covered by a pearly layer of these ghost-like exuviae, and it proved extremely
                    interesting to witness what we had often previously perused in the accurate
                    pages of Réaumur. Swammerdam, who had long ago observed and described this
                    singular moulting, seems to think that the male sex is alone subjected to it.
                    The manners and metamorphosis of these insects have been minutely detailed by
                    the laborious author just named, in his <hi rend="italic">Biblia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Naturoe,</hi> as well as by Réaumur and Degeer, in their
                    respective <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> on the natural history of insects.
                    The angler recognises them under the name of May-flies,—an imitation of which,
                    during the early part of the trouting season, is deemed a lure not to be
                    resisted by the finny race. We cannot here describe the species in detail. We
                    have figured several different kinds on Plate CCXXX. Some have four wings, figs.
                    5 and 9; others have only two, fig. 7. Of the latter the eyes are sometimes very
                    singularly constructed, being double, or two on each side, one above the other,
                    as shown by fig. 8 of the same plate.</p>
                <p>FAMILY II—PLANIPENNES.</p>
                <p>Latreille here includes those neuropterous species of which the antennae, always
                    composed of a great number of articulations, are considerably longer than the
                    head, without being styliform or awl-shaped. The mandibles are very distinct,
                    and the under wings, almost equal to the superior ones, are extended, or simply
                    folded beneath at their inner margin. The wings are very generally much
                    reticulated and naked, with the maxillary palpi for the most part filiform, or a
                    little larger at the extremity, shorter than the head, and composed of from four
                    to five articulations. These insects are divisible into five sections, which
                    compose, in relation to their natural habits, an equal number of small
                    sub-families, as follows.</p>

                    extremity of the head prolonged and narrowed, in the form of a beak or
                    proboscis. These constitute the old genus <hi rend="italic">Panorpa</hi> of
                    Linn., commonly called scorpion-flies, probably from the peculiar turning up of
                    their tails (Plate CCXXX. figs. 13 and 20). The antennae are setaceous and
                    inserted between the eyes. The clypeus is prolonged into a corneous lamina,
                    arched beneath for the reception of the mouth. The mandibles, maxillae, and
                    labium, are almost linear (Plate CCXXX. fig. 16). The palpi, varying in number
                    from four to six, are filiform; those of the maxillae do not distinctly present
                    more than four joints. The body is elongated, the head vertical, the first
                    segment of the thorax usually very small, and in the form of a collar. The
                    abdomen is conical or almost cylindrical. In several species the sexes are very
                    dissimilar. Naturalists do not as yet appear to have acquired any knowledge of
                    their transformations. They are now divided into the following genera: <hi

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section 2d, Myrmeleonides,</hi> Lat.</p>
                <p>These are also characterized by five articulations to all the tarsi; but they
                    differ from the preceding in not having the head prolonged in the form of a beak
                    or proboscis. The antennae are gradually enlarged, or have a globular or
                    button-like termination. The head is transverse, vertical, and exhibits no
                    stemmatic eyes. The ordinary organs of vision are round and projecting. The
                    mouth is furnished with six palpi, of which the labial are usually longer than
                    the others, and somewhat inflated at the extremity. The palate of the mouth is
                    raised in the toιm of an epiglottis. The first segment of the thorax is small.
                    The wings are equal, elongated, tectιform, or incumbent. The abdomen is
                    generally long and cylindrical, with two projecting appendages at the extremity
                    in the male sex. The legs are short.</p>
                <p>These insects affect warm places, and are consequently more frequent in the
                    southern countries of Europe than in the chilly regions of the north. They rest
                    on plants, and generally remain quiescent during the day. The nymphs are
                    inactive; but the generality of the perfect insects are well endowed with the
                    power of flight. They form the old genus <hi rend="italic">Myrmeleon</hi> of
                    Linn., which Fabricius and La-treĩlle have divided into two.</p>

                    antennae are short, gradually thickened or almost fusiform, and hooked at the
                    extremity. The abdomen is long and linear. The singular larva of one of these
                    insects (ibid, fig. 14) has been attentively studied by Poupart, Vallisnieri,
                    Roesel, Réaumur, and others. It is rather more than half an inch in length, of
                    an oval depressed form and greyish colour. It feeds chiefly on Solomon’s emblem
                    of industry, and has hence received the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Formica-Leo</hi> or lion-ant. Its head is very small, but armed with two strong
                    and lengthened mandibles, serrated on the inner side, and pointed at the end.
                    These parts look rather like a pair of horns than organs of manducation; but it
                    is with them that the larva seizes upon its prey; and as they are pierced at the
                    extremity, they no doubt also act as suckers. As its form does not admit of
                    active locomotion, nature has made amends by endowing this insect with admirable
                    instinctive skill and cunning. It constructs, in a dry or sandy soil, a
                    funnel-shaped excavation, the sides and edges of which are loose and crumbling,
                    and at the bottom of which, with body closely covered, but with ever-reađy jaws
                    projecting upwards, the insidious larva lies concealed. No sooner does an
                    industrious ant, laden perhaps with its republican provision, approach the edge
                    of the unsuspected slope, to it as dangerous as a volcanic crater or avalanche
                    of snow, than the finely poised sand immediately gives way, and the persevering
                    citizen, rolling to the bottom, is instantly seized and sucked to a shadow by
                    the lurking tyrant. The dead body is ere long tossed by a jerk of the head
                    beyond the immediate boundaries of the dwelling, probably because it is by this
                    time useless, or, as some French naturalist has expressed it, “pour que son
                    cadavre n’épouvante pas les autres fourmis qu’il attend.” There are tartars,
                    however, among Myrmeleons as well as men; and it sometimes happens that a large
                    and vigorous winged insect, such as a wasp, bee, or beetle, tumbles head
                    foremost into the pit. “When Greek meets Greek, then comes the tug of war;” and
                    when a lion-ant has the tail of a wasp in his mouth, there is no sayino∙ exactly
                    how the combat may end. The one is furnished with jaws tenacious as well as
                    strong,—but he bears no “charmed life ;” while the other is armed with a weapon
                    which the dews of heaven cannot rust, and compared with the keenness of which
                    the brightest sword in Damascus is as a broken foil. In these doubtful, though,
                    to one or other of the parties, eventually disastrous circumstances, the result
                    at last is, that either the lion-ant is dragged out of his den and stung to
                    death, or dropped upon the ground and left a prey to birds, or that the winged
                    insect is maimed, disabled, drawn into the sand, and slain. If an insect
                    incapable of flight, or from its situation unable to use its wings, but of
                    larger size than the Myrmeleon deems it prudent at once to seize upon, chances
                    to fall into the snare, it is overwhelmed in its attempts to re-ascend, by
                    repeated showers of sand, which its enemy directs upon it with unerring aim. No
                    sooner, however, is the strength of the toiling and exasperated Sisyphus at
                    least in part exhausted, than he too is seized upon, and sucked to death. The
                    lion-ant makes use of its head as a catapult or instrument of war, with which to
                    shower the sand upon its astonished prey. This singular larva is capable of
                    enduring a very long-continued fast. When it has attained to the natural term of
                    its increase, which requires the lapse, it is said, of nearly a couple of years,
                    it weaves a white cocoon, by means of two spinners placed at the posterior
                    extremity of the body, of a rounded form and satin lustre, but covered with
                    grains of sand. In this it undergoes its transformation to the nympha state
                    (Plate CCXXX. fig. 15). The perfect insect bursts from its silken tomb in the
                    course of from fifteen to twenty days. We are acquainted with many species of
                    the genus. Besides the one of which we have just now sketched the history, and

                    occurs in the south of France. It is a very large insect, measuring from four to
                    five inches between the tips of the extended wings, and was described as <hi

                    insects, and of all belonging to the genus, is slow and heavy. They seldom fly
                    far, and seem to end their lives near the places where they had their birth,—
                    even to the last “loving the spots which once they gloried in.” They are unknown

                <p>The larvae are terrestrial, that is, not aquatic. They wander about from place to
                    place, committing great havoc among Aphides, their favourite food,—for which

                    mandibles, and speedily suck to death. Some of the perfect insects are
                    exceedingly beautiful, especially a well-known British species called <hi
                    rend="italic">Hemerobius</hi><hi rend="italic">perla,</hi> which is of a pale
                    yellowish green, with delicately transparent yet lustrous wings, and brilliant
                    golden eyes. Its flight is feeble. The females lay their eggs on leaves, to the
                    number of twelve or sixteen in a group. They are whitish and oval, and are
                    supported and secured by a long hair-like stalk or pedicle, which some
                    botanists, less versed in edible fungi than Dr Greville, have mistaken for a
                    species of <hi rend="italic">mushroom!</hi> (See Plate CCXXX. fig. 21.)</p>
                <p>Other allied species have the first segment of the thorax large, with the wings
                    usually placed upon the body in a horizontal position. The palpi are filiform,
                    with the last article conical, or almost cylindrical, and frequently shorter
                    than the preceding. The larvae are aquatic. These insects were placed by

                    are active and carnivorous, or rather omnivorous gnawers, in all their states.
                    With the exception of the Mantispae, which, in regard to thcir anterior legs,
                    resembling those of the Mantides, are peculiar in their order,—the tarsi have at
                    most four articulations, in which they differ from the preceding genera of the
                    family with which we are still engaged. The mandibles are always corneous and
                    strong.</p>
                <p>Some possess tarsi consisting of from five to three articulations, with very
                    distinct and projecting labial palpi. The antennae are generally composed of
                    more than ten joints, the prothorax is large, in the form of a corselet, and the
                    wings are of equal size, and much reticulated.</p>

                    all the tarsi have five articulations, and the anterior legs, like those of

                    eyes large, the prothorax very long, thickened anteriorly, and the wings

                    four articulations. The wings are incumbent when at rest, the head elongated,
                    and narrowed posteriorly, the thorax long, narrow, and almost cylindrical. The
                    abdomen of the female is terminated by a long exterior oviduct, formed by a
                    couple of laminae. The species figured on the plate referred to is well known in
                    Britain. It lives in woods. Both the larva and imago feed on other insects. The
                    former is lively in its movements when disturbed. It lives in the fissures of
                    trees, and has the form of a little serpent. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Termes,</hi> which contains the famous white ant (Plate CCXXX. figs. 17, 18,
                    and 23), the tarsi are likewise composed of four joints, but the wings are very
                    long, and are horizontally spread upon the body. The head is rounded, and the
                    thorax almost square or semicircular. The body of these insects is depressed,
                    and the antennae, at least in the females, are short, and formed like a chaplet.
                    The mouth resembles that of the orthopterous order, and the labium is quadrifid.
                    There are three ocelli, one of which, placed upon the front, is indistinct, and
                    the other two are placed laterally, near the internal margin of the ordinary
                    eyes. The wings are usually rather transparent, colourless, with fine and
                    closeset nervures, but not very distinctly reticulated. There are two small
                    conical biarticulated points at the extremity of the abdomen. The legs are
                    short. A good monograph of this singular and destructive genus is still a
                    desideratum in Entomology. Several species, inhabiting widely distant countries,
                    have been described under the general name of <hi rend="italic">Termes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fatale,</hi> but we have still an insufficient knowledge of their
                    actual and distinguishing characteristics. So confused was the acquaintance of
                    our immediate predecessors with these insects, that the larvae of <hi
                    rend="italic">T. flavwolle,</hi> Fab. were placed by Linnaeus among his <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">IIemerobius.</hi> These Termites are for the most part
                    peculiar to countries placed between or near the tropics. The individuals named
                    neuters or labourers among the white ants (commonly so called) are the wingless
                    larvae (fig. 17), and in that state their powers of destruction are quite
                    appalling. They live together in assemblages so vast as almost to defy
                    calculation, and excavate galleries under ground, in trees, tables and all kinds
                    of furniture, as well as in the timber of dwelling-houses. Dr M <hi

                    λVhatever ligneous bodies are mined by them, retaining little but a superficial
                    bark, soon crumble into dust; and where the roof of a house, or heavy lintel
                    stone, depends on such support, the insecurity may be as easily imagined as
                    described. They sometimes construct external tunnels or covered ways, which
                    conceal them from view while passing to and from their subterranean dwellings.
                    Sometimes their habitations are raised pyramidally above the surface, in other
                    instances they resemble turrets, with an eave like expansion on the top. Some
                    are broader and extremely solid; and when constructed, as they often are, in
                    groups, they exhibit the appearance of a little village. They are so strongly
                    built, that when raised to only half their height, they are capable of
                    supporting such wild bulls as mount upon them to act as sentinels while the rest
                    of the flock is feeding. λVhen at their full height of ten or twelve feet, they
                    are used by men as stations from which to look across the country, the grass
                    itself being in those regions of equal height. Sιneathman, to whom we owe a
                    curious and often-quoted narrative of their history, has frequently stood with
                    four companions on the top of one of their buildings, employing it as a
                    watch-tower by the shore, from which to obtain sight of whatever vessels might
                    heave in sight. Besides the larvae or workers, we find another set of
                    inhabitants, of which the nature is not yet clearly known, although their
                    functions are obvious. They are known by the name of soldiers or neuters, and
                    were erroneously regarded by Fabricius as the nymphs. They defend the
                    habitation. When a breach is effected with a pick-axe, they make their
                    appearance, and snap about in all directions with their mandibles,—apparently in
                    a state of considerable indignation. λVhen the attack has ceased, the soldiers
                    retire, and are succeeded by the labourers, who speedily repair the breach. They
                    are still attended, however, by a few soldiers, who seem to act as
                    superintendents of the work. The nymphs bear the rudiments<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193748040?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-8040-0214"/> of wings; in
                    other respects they resemble the larvae. No sooner do they become perfect, by
                    acquiring the organs of flight, than they wing their way from their original
                    dwellings, during the evening, or the stillness or night, and in incalculable
                    numbers. At sunrise, however, by a singular law of nature, they lose their
                    wings, which dry up, become shrivelled, and fall to the ground. In this
                    defenceless state they become the prey of many reptiles, and of insect-eating
                    birds. Indeed they seem not to be despised in that respect even by man himself;
                    for not only are they greedily devoured by Hottentots and negroes, but have been
                    often eaten by Europeans with delight. Mr Smeathman found them “delicate,
                    nourishing, and wholesome, without sauce or other help from cookery, than merely
                    roasting them in the manner of coffee.” He indeed discoursed with various
                    friends on the taste of white ants, and on comparing notes, they agreed that
                    these insects were “delicious and delicate eating.’ One gentleman compared them
                    to sugared marrow, while another thought they tasted like “sugared cream and a
                    paste of sweet almonds.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    this migratory instinct, such are their vast powers of fecundity, that old
                    colonies are soon replenished, or new ones formed. According to Smeathman, the
                    provident larvae seize upon all the winged couples they can find, and shut them
                    up in a roomy cell or nuptial chamber, where they supply them with abundant
                    food; “mais j’ai lieu de présumer,” says LatreiHe, “que l’accouplement a lieu,
                    comme celui des fourmis, dans l’air ou hors de l’habitation, et que les femelles
                    occupent seules l’attention des larves, dans le but de former une nouvelle
                    colonie.” The abdomen of the pregnant female (Plate CCXXX. fig. 23) becomes so
                    greatly dilated as to exceed the rest of her body by 1500 or 2000 times, and she
                    is then about a thousand times heavier than her husband. Indeed well she may,
                    if, as is reported, she is endowed with the power of laying <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Certain Termites <hi rend="italic">(T.</hi><hi rend="italic">arborum)</hi> live
                    on trees, where they build nests as large as sugar casks, and from seventy to
                    eighty feet above the ground. These are formed of particles of gnawed wood
                    cemented by a gluten either secreted by themselves, as silk is by caterpillars,
                    or gathered from gummiferous trees. They are so strongly attached to their
                    supporting branches as to resist the violence even of those tornadoes which so
                    often in tropical countries level alike the palaces of kings, and “huts where
                    poor men lie.” Indeed they cannot be detached except by being hewn in pieces.
                    The genus Termes is not unknown in Europe. <hi rend="italic">T.</hi><hi

                    occurs in the southern provinces of France, where it dwells in the interior of
                    various trees. It has so greatly multiplied in the workshops and storehouses of
                    the navy-yard of Rochefort that it cannot be extirpated, and is the cause of
                    constant damage. <hi rend="italic">T. Jlavicolle</hi> proves extremely injurious
                    to the olive trees in Spain. Our “favoured isle” is fortunately free from these

                <p>The remaining Termitinae are characterized by their biarticulate tarsi, and their
                    short and indistinct labial palpi. The antennae consist of about ten joints; the
                    anterior seg- ' ment of the thorax is very small; and the inferior wings are
                    less than the superior. They form the genus Psocus of Latreille, which consists
                    of very small species with short soft bodies, often hunched or inflated, with a
                    large head, setaceous antennae, projecting maxillary palpi, and incumbent wings,
                    slightly reticulated or but simply veined. These are active insects, living
                    beneath the bark of trees, in wood, straw, &amp;c. Some occur among books and in

                    made of a great variety of substances, according to the species. Latreille
                    regards them as simply herbivorous, although other authors maintain that, in
                    addition to aquatic plants, they prey upon the larvae of gnats and
                    dragonflies.</p>
                <p>We shall conclude our sketch of this order by observing that the characters and
                    habits of the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Phryganea</hi> being very peculiar, the
                    species have in recent times been separated from the neuropterous tribes, and
                    erected into an additional order, <hi rend="smallcaps">Triciioptera,</hi> Kirby,

                    before it casts its exuviae; and for this purpose the antennae and the four
                    anterior legs are not confined under the general envelope, though each has its
                    peculiar integument, so that the animal can use them when the time comes for it
                    to emerge from the water, and commence a denizen of the air. The imago exhibits
                    few or none of the characters of the other <hi rend="italic">neuropterous</hi>
                    genera. The wings are veined in a peculiar manner, without reticulations, in
                    some degree like those of <hi rend="italic">Lepidoptera.</hi> The antennae
                    resemble much those of the Tinea tribe, and the tibiae of many of them are armed
                    with the two pair of spurs observable in so many of the moths; but they have no
                    spiral tongue, the wings, though hairy, have no scales, the under wings are
                    folded longitudinally, and the head, besides the usual compound eyes, has three
                    stemmata. If these remarks appear to entomologists well founded, and it be

                <p>This order, of more direct utility to man than many others, in as far as it
                    contains the species which yield us wax and honey, is characterized, like the
                    preceding one, by the possession of four membranous and naked wings. Γhe mouth
                    consists of mandibles, maxillae, and an under and an upper lip. The organs of
                    flight, however, differ from those of the Neuroptera, in being simply veined
                    rather than reticulated; and the upper wings are always somewhat larger than the
                    under pair. The abdomen of the female is terminated either by an ovipositor or
                    sting.</p>
                <p>esiđes the ordinary visual organs, these insects are all provided with three
                    small stemmatic eyes. The antennae are variable, not only in different genera,
                    but in different sexes of the same species. In the majority, however, they are
                    filiform or setaceous. The maxillae and the labium are generally long and
                    narrow, fixed in a deep cavity of the head by lengthened muscles, semi-tubular
                    it their lower portion, often folded at their extremity, md serving rather for
                    the transmission of nutritive juices than for mastication properly so called.
                    Indeed in several these parts unite to form a kind of trunk or sucker. The
                    ligula is membranous, whether widened at the extremity, or long and filiform,
                    with the pharynx at its anterior base, and frequently covered by a kind of
                    sub-labrum or epipharynx. The palpi are four in number, two labial and two
                    maxillary. The thorax as usual consists of three segments, of which the foremost
                    is very short, and the two remainder are intimately united. The wings cross each
                    other horizontally over the body, and the upper pair have a little rounded
                    convex knob at their base. The abdomen is composed of from five to nine
                    segments, the number being frequently six in the females and seven in the males.
                    It is usually suspended, as it were, to the thorax by a small and slender
                    pedicle; in which case its second articulation seems to be the first, the latter
                    being in fact confounded with the metathorax. The ovipositor and the sting (both
                    being constructed on the same model) are composed, in the generality, of three
                    long and slender pieces, two of which serve as a sheath for the third, which is
                    itself, when under the form of ä sting, composed of a pair of pieces joined in
                    one The tarsi are composed of five articulations, none of which is divided.</p>
                <p>The structure of the wings of Hymenoptera has served as the basis of a noted
                    method for their classification, made known by M. Jurine.<note anchored="true"

                    number of the nervures of the wings, and of the cells or intermediate diaphanous
                    spaces formed by their ramification. The nature of our present treatise, which
                    we have already extended to the proposed limits (and we are still far from our
                    conclusion), will not, however, admit of our entering fully into such
                    details.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>When we examine
                    a hymenopterous insect with a glass, or even by means of the unaided sight, we
                    shall observe that the external or anterior margin of the upper wings presents
                    two strong approximate parallel nervures, deriving their origin from the thorax,
                    and united by means of a strong expansion of the membrane of the wing. The
                    external nervure is called the <hi rend="italic">radius,</hi> fig. 1, <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the internal the cubitus, fig. 1,
                    δ. Each of these terminates in a dark-coloured expansion called the stigma, fig.
                    1, <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> Besides these larger nervures, which some call <hi
                    rend="italic">primitive,</hi> several others spring lil ewise from the base of
                    the wing, and are named <hi rend="italic">brachial,</hi> fig. 1, <hi
                    rend="italic">g.</hi> All these principal branches give rise to. shorter
                    intersecting nervures, the interlacement of which partitions the wing as it were
                    into membranaceous departments, designated by the name of cells. Several of
                    these, by reason of their constancy of disposition in each genus of
                    hymenopterous insects, have been used with advantage by Jurine for the purposes
                    of classification. A nervure, called the <hi rend="italic">radial</hi> (fig. 3,
                    <hi rend="italic">a),</hi> usually springs from the middle of the stigma, and
                    attaining the tip or anterior angle of the wing, leaves between itself and the
                    anterior margin a membranous space, known as the <hi rend="italic">radial
                    cell</hi> (fig. <hi rend="italic">4, a).</hi> If there should, moreover, spring
                    from the stigma a lesser nervure, dividing the cell into two parts, we recognise
                    a pair of ιadial ce s. to this case, however, the larger nervure does not derive
                    its origin from the central line of the stigma, but farther back, or from its
                    ⅛asal portion (fig. 1, <hi rend="italic">d).</hi> It sometimes also happens that
                    the radial nervure, proceeding from the stigma, encounters, before it gains the
                    margin of the wing, a small intersecting nervure, itself proceeding from that
                    margin. The radial cell is then said to be appen- <hi rend="italic"

                    subscript"> j ct</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi></p><p>Another range of cells, of
                    some importance, has received the name of <hi rend="italic">cubital</hi> (fig.
                    1, e)∙ It is formed by the posterior e ge o e adιal nervure, and by another
                    nervure named the <hi rend="italic">cubital,</hi> which~springs from the
                    extremity of the cubitus, near the stigma, and <pb corresp="kp-eb0709-8066-0216"
                    xml:id="pbn7216"/> directs itself towards the tip of the wing (fig. 3, δ). This
                    range is frequently divided into two, three, or four lesser cells, by means of
                    intersecting nervures (fig. 4, e, and fig. 1, e). If two of these cells are much
                    developed, and the second one, on the contrary, is so circumscribed that it
                    cannot reach the margin of the radial nervure, we have then a peculiar
                    character. The two developed cells, instead of being separated from each other
                    by the entire interval of the second cell, are kept apart, for a space, only by
                    a simple nervure, the length of which is proportional to the curtailment of the
                    second cell; and in this way the latter has no other connection with the radial
                    cell above it, than that it adheres to, or depends from it, as it were, by a
                    kind of pedicle or stalk,—for which reason it is then named <hi rend="italic"
                    >ρ&lt;Λiοlated</hi> by Jurine (fig. 2, δ). If it happens that the cubital
                    nervure does not attain to the extreme margin of the wing, the spaces which it
                    partly forms are regarded as <hi rend="italic">incomplete.</hi></p><p>It has
                    been already stated that, besides the large nervures named cubitus and radius,
                    Jurine has distinguished others, which also spring from the base of the wing, as
                    at fig. <hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">,g.</hi> These produce others
                    of a secondary kind, which mount towards the cubital cells, sometimes attaining
                    to the first and second, sometimes to the second and third, and sometimes only
                    to a single cell. These have received the name of recurrent nervures (fig. 1,∕).
                    By anastomosing among themselves, and with the cubitus, the brachial nervures
                    and their branches form several cells, which Jurine has named the <hi
                    rend="italic">humeral</hi> (fig. 4, 7ı, ⅛, 7z, 7«, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >7i).</hi> Of these Latreille distinguishes a» <hi rend="italic">discoidal,</hi>
                    such as are situated in the centre of the wing (fig. 2, i, i). The recurrent
                    nervures always concur in their formation. Among lepidopterous insects, the cell
                    situated in the centre of the wing is prolonged uninterruptedly as far as the
                    base.</p><p>Since we have entered into these details, we may here also mention
                    briefly a few additional particulars, relating chiefly to the nomenclature oí

                <p>The digestive systeţn of Hyn ’ ιenoptera consists in general of two stomachs, of
                    which the second is elongated; of a short intestine, terminated by a widened
                    cloaca; and of numerous biliary vessels, inserted near the pylorus. In regard to
                    their tracheal apparatus, M. Leon Dufour has remarked, that all the Hymenoptera
                    which he has examined exhibit a greater degree of perfection in that part of
                    their structure than any other order of insects. Instead of being composed of
                    cylindrical and elastic vessels, of which the diameter decreases by successive
                    divarications, they present constant dilatations, or determinate vesicles,
                    favourable to the greater or less continuance of air, and capable of being
                    distended or otherwise, according<pb corresp="pbn7216"

                    quantity of their contents. On each side ot the base of the abdomen there is a
                    large oval vesicle of the kind alluded to, of a dull milky white, giving rise
                    here and there to radiating bundles of vascular tracheae, which distribute
                    themselves to the neighbouring organs. On entering the thorax it becomes
                    restricted, is again dilated, and ends insensibly in a tube, of which the
                    subdivisions are lost in the head. Behind these two abdominal vesicles the
                    respiratory organ is prolonged in the shape of two filiform tubes, which give
                    off an infinity of little air-bearing branches, and become confluent towards the
                    anal extremity.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Hymenopterous insects undergo a complete metamorphosis. Most of the larvae
                    resemble little worms, unprovided with feet. At least those of the second and
                    following families answer that description. Those of the first family, however,
                    have six fcct, furnished with hooks; and besides these they frequently possess
                    from twelve to sixteen others of a simply membranous texture. These latter
                    larvae are named by the French <hi rend="italic">fausses</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >chenilles.</hi> Both kinds are provided with a scaly head, with mandibles,
                    maxillae, and a labium, at the extremity of which is a <hi rend="italic"
                    >spinner</hi> for the passage of that silky substance which is ere long employed
                    in the construction of the nymph’s cocoon. Some live on vegetable substances;
                    others, and these are the footless or apodal kinds, feed on insects, with which
                    they are supplied by the provident attention of their mothers, which either
                    carry food to their admirably constructed dwellings, or, as among the
                    Ichneumonides, deposit their eggs at once on living larvae, of which the
                    excluded young soon become the tenacious and destructive parasites. Among bees a
                    vast number of individuals of ambiguous or undeveloped sex are charged, among
                    other arduous labours, with the sustenance of the helpless young, a task
                    performed with a propriety and precision which, with their many additional
                    attributes of instinctive skill, render their proceedings worthy to be classed,
                    if not as standing miracles of nature, at least as deserving the careful
                    contemplation of the wisest minds.</p>

                <p>In the winged or perfect state, hymenopterous insects generally oecur on flowers,
                    and they may be regarded as more abundant in southern than in northern regions.

                    intention to notice all the more remarkable historical facts, in our sketch of
                    the principal tribes and genera. We shall merely remark, that notwithstanding

                    Latreille, Walkenaer, and others, the hymenopterous order still presents a vast

                    The females have an ovipositor <hi rend="italic">(tariere),</hi> generally in
                    the form of a saw, and which serves not merely for the deposition of the eggs,
                    but also for the construction of a proper place for their reception. The larvae
                    have always six scaly feet, and frequently several others which are membranous.
                    This family forms two tribes.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 1st, Tenthredinetae, or Saw-flies.</hi></p>
                <p>Of these the mandibles are lengthened and compressed. The ligula is divided into
                    three, as if digitated. The ovipositor is composed of two plates, toothed like a
                    saw, pointed, united, and lodged in a groove of the posterior extremity. The
                    maxillary palpi are always composed of six articulations, and the labial of
                    four. The latter are always the shorter. Both pairs of wings are divided into
                    numerous cells. This tribe corresponds to the great genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tenthredo</hi> of Linnaeus.</p>
                <p>The abdomen of these insects is cylindrical, rounded posteriorly, composed of
                    nine segments, and so united to the thorax as to appear almost like a uniform
                    continuation of that part. The wings appear as if rumpled, and there are two
                    little grain-like coloured bodies behind the scutellum. The form and composition
                    of the antennae vary. The mandibles are strong and toothed. The extremity of the
                    maxillae is almost membranous, or at least of a less coriaceous consistence than
                    the base. The palpi are filiform, or nearly setaceous, and composed of six
                    articulations. The ligula is straight, rounded, divided into three parts, of
                    which the central is the narrowest; its sheath is usually short. The abdomen of
                    the female is provided at its lower extremity with a double moveable ovipositor,
                    scaly, serrated, pointed, and enclosed within two other concave plates, which
                    serve it as a sheath. It is by the action of the teeth of this instrument that
                    the insect perforates the stalks and other parts of plants, in which she lays
                    her <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> Sa <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> ∙ These she
                    afterwards imbues with a peculiar frothy liquor, which seems to prevent the
                    parts of the plant from reuniting, and even causes the formation of a concave
                    chamber, or of ligneous parts resembling galls, in which the excluded larvae
                    dwell, either in a state of solitude, or m company, according to their kind.
                    After undergoing its final metamorphosis, the perfect insect makes its escape by
                    gnawing a circular overture. The larvae of many species, however, live exposed
                    upon the foliage of trees and plants. They bear a great resemblance to
                    caterpillars in their general form and colouring, but they present either from
                    eighteen to twenty-two feet, or only six; whereas in caterpillars properly so
                    called, these parts range merely from ten to sixteen. They frequently continue
                    in the larva state for several months, or throughout the winter, and remain but
                    a short time in the nympha state, previous to the assumption of which they spin
                    a cocoon. We shall briefly notice the principal genera into which these insects
                    are now divided.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>For the

                    the antennae are alike in both sexes, and terminate in a button-like expansion.
                    The larvae have twenty-four feet, and some of them when tormented will spout out
                    a greenish liquid to the distance of a foot. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Hylotoma,</hi> Lat. (ibid, fig. 2), the antennae exhibit only three distinct
                    articulations, of which the last is in the form of an elongated prismatic or
                    cylindrical club, more slender, ciliated, and sometimes forked in the males. A
                    well-known species (figured as above), the <hi rend="italic">Temthredo
                    rosaecA</hi> Linn, belongs to this genus. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Tentiiredo</hi> properly so called (ibid. fig. 3), the antennae are composed of
                    nine articulations, which are simple in both sexes. The larvae have from
                    eighteen to twenty-two feet. In the perfect insects the number of teeth of the
                    mandibles varies from two to four. The amount of radial and cubital cells of the
                    wings also varies in different species. Hence the formation of the genera <hi

                    other naturalists. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cladi-</hi> us of Klug has
                    also nine joints in the antennae, but those parts are pectinated on one side in
                    the males. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Athalia</hi> of Leach the body is short and
                    thick, as in Hylotoma, but the antennae, simple in both sexes, have from ten to
                    fourteen articulations. The genus <hi rend="italic">Pterygoρhorus</hi> of Klug
                    are remarkable for their antennae, composed at least of sixteen articulations,
                    being pectinated or fanshaped in the males, and serrated in the females. In
                    LoPHYRUS of Lat. (Plate CCXXXI. fig. 4) the antennae are doubly pectinated in
                    the males, and resemble a triangular plume (fig. 5); they are shortly serrated

                <p>The insects of this tribe arc distinguished from those of the preceding by their
                    mandibles, which are short and thick, by their liguìa, which is entire, and by
                    the ovipositor of the female, which is sometimes projecting and composed of
                    three thread-like parts, sometimes spirally rolled within the abdomen, and of a
                    capillary form. They compose the old genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Sirex</hi> of
                    Linn.</p>
                <p>The antennae of these insects are filiform or setaceous, vibratory, and composed
                    of from ten to twenty-five articulations. The head is rounded and nearly
                    globular, the labrum very small, the maxillary palpi filiform, consisting of
                    from three to five articulations, and the labial of three, of which the last is
                    largest. The body is almost cylindrical. The anterior or posterior tarsi, and in
                    several species the colour of the abdomen, differ according to the sexes. The
                    females deposit their eggs in ancient trees, generally in those of the pine
                    tribe. The ovipositor is lodged at the base of the abdomen, between two valves,
                    which form a protecting groove.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Oryssus,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXXI. fig. 9), the
                    antennae are inserted near the mouth, the mandibles are without teeth, the
                    maxillary palpi are long and five-articulate, the posterior extremity of the
                    body is almost rounded and slightly prolonged, and the ovipositor is capillary
                    and spirally rolled in the interior of the abdomen. There are only two species
                    found in Europe, both of which are exceedingly active, and occur on trees in
                    spring. We have figured <hi rend="italic">0.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    8, the antennae, inserted near the front, consist of from thirteen to
                    twenty-five articulations, the mandibles are toothed on their inner side, the
                    maxillary palpi are very small, almost conical, of two articulations, and the
                    extremity of the last segment of the abdomen is prolonged in the form of a tail.
                    The ovipositor consists of three threads. These insects are of rather large
                    size. They inhabit more particularly forests of pine and fir, in cold and
                    mountainous countries, and during flight produce a buzzing noise, like that of
                    an humble-bee. The larvae have six feet, with the posterior extremity of the
                    body terminating in a point. It lives in the interior of wood, where it spins a
                    cocoon, and undergoes its metamorphosis. Our most noted species is the <hi
                    rend="italic">S. gigas</hi> of Linn. The male has a yellow abdomen, with a black
                    extremity; the female is black, with a yellow spot behind each eye, and the
                    second and three terminal rings of the abdomen also of the latter colour. Owing
                    to the disparity of aspect of the sexes, they have been not unfrequently
                    described by naturalists as distinct species.</p>
                <p>FAMILY II—PUPIV01lA.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From

                    bodies, which usually destroy the pupae.</p></note></p>
                <p>The various groups which compose this family are distinguished by the abdomen
                    being attached to the thorax by a simple portion of its transverse diameter, or
                    even in many instances merely by a slender thread or pedicle, so that its mode
                    of insertion is distinct and obvious, and admits of a separate movement. The
                    larvae are apodal, and for the most part parasitical and carnivorous. Latreille
                    divides them into six tribes, as follows.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 1st, Evaniales.</hi></p>
                <p>In these the wings are raised, and the upper at least are areolated. The antennae
                    are filiform or setaceous, and composed of from thirteen to fourteen
                    articulations. The mandibles are dentated on the inner side. The maxillary palpi
                    consist of six, and the labial of four articulations. The abdomen is implanted
                    on the thorax,—i∏ some, just beneath the scutellum. The ovipositor is usually
                    projecting, and composed of three setae.</p>
                <p>The following are the principal genera: <hi rend="smallcaps">Evania,</hi> Fab.

                <p>In these the wings are also veined, and the superior always exhibit on their disc
                    closed or completed cells. The abdomen takes its rise between the two posterior
                    legs. The antennae are generally filiform or setaceous (very rarely clubbed),
                    and composed of a great number of articulations. In the majority the mandibles
                    have no tooth on the inner side, and terminate in a bifid point. The maxillary
                    palpi, always apparent or projecting, have usually not more than five
                    articulations. The ovipositor consists of three threads or setae.</p>
                <p>Such is a brief exposition of the technical characters of a tribe of insects
                    which embraces almost the whole of the great genus <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ichneumon</hi> of Linnaeus, and of which the natural economy and habits are so
                    remarkable that we shall here take leave to extend our observations on their
                    history. Perhaps we could not better illustrate the complex nature of the modern
                    science of Entomology than by stating, that what we must here pass over in the
                    space of a few columns, and which, even in the publications of comparatively
                    recent writers, does not form a very important or greatly enlarged feature,
                    occupies, in a work to which we have lately devoted our attention, upwards of
                    2800 pages.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>We allude to
                    the complete and careful <hi rend="italic">Ichneumonologìa Europoea</hi> of

                    1829.</p></note></p>
                <p>The general term Icħneumonides comprehends an extensive series of insects,
                    important on account of the purposes to which they are subservient in the
                    economy of nature, and deriving considerable interest from the peculiar manner
                    in which these purposes are effected. They differ from most of the other members
                    of the class to which they belong, in their mode of providing for their young,—
                    presenting this peculiarity, that they deposittheireggs in the living bodies of
                    other insects. In a tribe of such extent, considerable variety of external
                    appearance necessarily prevails; but a genuine Ichneumon may in general be known
                    by its elongated form, attenuated, and in most cases petio-lated abdomen,
                    terminated frequently in a long fissile seta; and by its filiform, porrected,
                    often recurved and annulated antennae, to which a constant vibratory motion is
                    imparted. The European species vary in size from a fraction of a line to fifteen
                    lines; those of tropical countries, however, greatly exceed these dimensions, a
                    few of them ranking even among the largest insects. Upwards of 1300 species have
                    been described as natives of Europe, of which number a great many hundreds exist
                    in Britain.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In the <hi

                    -transformations, have secured some degree of attention for this tribe, even
                    from the earliest periods. The word Ichneumon occurs in the natural history of
                    Aristotle, by whom it is applied to a species of Spbex. Ray appears to be the
                    first who used it to designate the tribe of insects to which it has ever since
                    been restricted. Little, however, was known regarding the structure or habits of
                    these creatures till the time of Frisch, who subjected them to an anatomical
                    examination, and described the parts of the mouth, and formation of the wings,
                    with great accuracy and minuteness. He was the first who employed the form and
                    relative position of the cells of the latter to assist in distinguishing genera.
                    Much valuable information resulted from the observations and experiments of
                    Réaumur, whose work may be referred to for many interesting details regarding
                    the manners and habits of the Ichneu-ιnonides.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> tome ii. iv.
                    et vi.</p></note> Degeer also contributed materially to elucidate thcir history,
                    and proposed a new arrangement of the family, characterized by his usual
                    accuracy of discrimination.</p>
                <p>In the numerous works on Entomology which appeared during the latter half of the
                    eighteenth century, our knowledge of these insects kept pace with the increased
                    zeal manifested towards the study of natural history during that important
                    period. Linnaeus, Scopoli, Fabricius, Schrank, Panzer, and others <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> inferior name, applied themselves successfully to
                    investigate their history—reducing the information derived from their
                    predecessors to a more systematic form, and greatly increasing the amount of
                    known species. In 1807 Jurine published his new method for the classification
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Hymenoptcra, already mentioned. The application of his
                    principles to the Ichneumonides afforded less satisfactory results than in most
                    of the other tribes. Like all systems founded on a partial view of organic
                    structure, it led, in many instances, to the violation of natural order, by
                    separating cognate species, and associating others having no positive affinity.
                    But though Jurine failed to establish an efficient mode of arrangement, he
                    rendered important service to subsequent inquirers, by describing minutely, and
                    furnishing with a suitable terminology, the variously modified forms of the
                    organs of flight, which are found to afford characters of considerable value for
                    the discrimination of genera. Latreille at different times published
                    arrangements of this tribe, and by the number of his sectional divisions,
                    generally founded on obvious characters, greatly facilitated the identifying of
                    species.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    rend="italic">of</hi> these had increased to such an extent, and they were found
                    to approximate so closely to each other in external characters, that a
                    comprehensive division, and a more detailed description of specific difference,
                    became indispensable. This desideratum has recently been supplied by the
                    publication of an extensive and elaborate work on the Ichneumonides by Professor
                    Gravenhorst; an individual eminently qualified to unravel the complexities of
                    this difficult tribe. An extensive intercourse with men of science enabled him
                    to amass a large collection <hi rend="italic">of</hi> these insects from all
                    parts of &lt; Europe; while habits of minute observation and patient <hi

                    arrangement, and an accurate perception of the affinities of conι secutive
                    groups, qualified him to employ to the best advantage the ample materials thus
                    obtained. The result or his labours appeared in 1829, as specified in a note on
                    &lt; our preceding page. The arrangement adopted is funda- 1 mentally the same
                    as that previously published by himself and Nees ab Esenbeck.<note

                <p>The body <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the Ichneumons is more or less elongated, and
                    in most instances naked and shining, seldom rough or impressed with punctures.
                    It is occasionally covered, particularly on the head and thorax, with a
                    pubescence composed of slender erect hairs, or it is somewhat sericeous and
                    opaque, with a soft decumbent pubescence. The prevailing colours are rufous,
                    black, and yellow, variously intermingled with lines and patches of white. In
                    the great majority of species, there are one or two spots of the latter colour
                    on the thorax, at the insertion <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the wings. The
                    scutellum is most frequently white. The feet are very often of a reddish colour,
                    at times red and black; but they are never entirely black, the anterior femora
                    being always, pale on the under side. The head is prominent, generally
                    orbiculate or subovate anteriorly, in many instances a little narrowed towards
                    the neck, and nearly of the same breadth as the thorax. The forehead is
                    sometimes armed with one or two short erect horns, placed between the antennae
                    and stemmata. The latter are three in number, and disposed in a triangular form.
                    The antennae in the greater number of species are shorter than the body; in a
                    few they are of the same length, very rarely longer, porrected, generally curved
                    or involuted after death, especially in the females, filiform or setaceous,
                    sometimes slightly compressed at the middle, as in some species of <hi

                    fourth very short, rather stout, and often so closely united that they may be
                    regarded as one joint; the fourth always shorter than the third, which is at
                    times very inconspicuous; the fifth long, cylindrical; the remainder gradually
                    decreasing in length, so that the apical joints often appear transverse. Such is
                    the general appearance of the antennae; but they are liable to numerous
                    modifications. The mandibles are corneous, more or less arcuate, generally
                    broadest at the base, and narrowed towards the apex; in a few instances they are
                    straight, and in others linear, or even dilated at the extremity, where they are
                    furnished with two teeth, except in a very few species, which have the apex
                    entire or tridentatc. The maxillae consist <hi rend="italic">of</hi> two parts,
                    of which the basal portion, or stipes as it has been called, is usually of a
                    corneous consistence and somewhat lanceolate form; the other portion (mala) is
                    of a membranaceous substance, and bifid or bipartite. The palpi are four in
                    number, elongate, filiform, and unequal; the maxillary are rather long, and
                    consist of five joints, very rarely of four. They have been described by
                    Fabricius and Panzer as having six joints. The third joint is generally the
                    longest; the first, second, and fourth, very short; sometimes, however, one or
                    other of these, or the fifth, is longest, and in a very few cases the third is
                    shortest; in some species all the articulations are of equal length. The labial
                    palpi are rather short, and consist of five joints, very rarely of three.</p>
                <p>The Ichneumonides, like the rest of the Hymenoptera, are provided with four
                    wings, composed of thin membrane, and <hi rend="italic">of</hi> corneous ribs.
                    These ribs are generally denominated nerves or nervures; and the various spaces
                    into which the wing is divided by their intersection are called <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193748118?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-8118-0220"/> cells or
                    areolets. The base of the wing <hi rend="italic">(radix),</hi> or that portion
                    of it which is inserted into the thorax, is of a substance intermediate between
                    corneousand membranaceous, and is always more or less coloured. It is partially
                    covered with a hard convex scale <hi rend="italic">(squamula),</hi> which,
                    however, may more properly be regarded as an appendage of the thorax. The
                    anterior wings (fig. A) are longer than the posterior, narrow throughout a
                    considerable portion of their length, and gradually dilated towards the
                    extremity. The <hi rend="italic">stigma</hi> (a) is distinctly marked, and
                    varies much in size. The thick rib of the anterior margin, extending between the
                    stigma and the dorsal angle of the wing, is called the <hi rend="italic">radius
                    (b).</hi> By the anastomosing of the nerves, ten or eleven cells are formed, of
                    which the three at the base of the wing are named humeral <hi rend="italic"
                    >(humerales),</hi> 1, 2, 3; one radial <hi rend="italic">(radialis),</hi> 4; two
                    or three cubital <hi rend="italic">(cubitales),</hi> 5, 6, 7; two lying under
                    these discoidal <hi rend="italic">(discoidales),</hi> 8, 9; and two towards the
                    margin posterior <hi rend="italic">(posticae),</hi> 10, 11. When the cells are
                    viewed in relation to the breadth of the wing, the three situate at the apex or
                    posterior margin are said to be external (5, 8, 10); those next the humeral
                    cells internal (7, 11); and those between the external and internal cells
                    intermediate (6, 9). Of the humeral cells, that which lies next the radius is
                    named the external (1), that next the margin the internal (3), and that which
                    lies between these two the intermediate (2). The intermediate cubital cell (6)
                    is generally denominated the areolet, and is important on account of the
                    distinctive characters it affords. The interior cubital cell (7) is very large,
                    in consequence of the nerve which ought to divide it into two parts, at least
                    which does so in the other Hymenoptera, having become obsolete. In many species,
                    however, a portion of this nerve is visible <hi rend="italic">(z)</hi>; and in
                    some instances it extends nearly to the centre of the cell; but it is usually
                    very short, or a projecting angle alone indicates the point whence it ought to
                    issue; and in the less typical species all traces of it are obliterated. The
                    areolet likewise is occasionally awanting; different individuals of the same
                    species have it or have it not; and examples occur in which it is distinctly
                    formed in one wing and awanting in the other. In general, however, it is
                    present, and may readily be distinguished from the other cells by its inferior
                    size and angular form. It is either five-angled or quadrangular, triangular or
                    orbiculate. But all these forms are liable to numerous modifications, and one
                    passes into another. The posterior wings (B) are shorter and narrower than the
                    anterior, and nearly of equal breadth throughout. By the anastomosing of the
                    nerves, seven cells are formed, of which the three at the base of the wing are
                    named inter-ĭ nal (1, 2, 3), and four at the posterior margin external <hi
                    rend="subscript"> r</hi> (4, 5, 6, 7). In the sub-genus <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pezomachus</hi> the wings are generally absent, and when present are extremely
                    imperfect, and usually unfit for the purposes of flight, although their
                    structure, as far as it can be traced, exactly corresponds to that of the more
                    perfect species. The abdomen, which is very variable in form, is composed of
                    seven or eight segments, the eighth being more or less concealed, and often
                    entirely obsolete. This imperfect development of some of the segments has led
                    authors to give various accounts of their number. In addition to the seven
                    usually enumerated, Audouin is of opinion that there is another of very small
                    size, which unites the abdomen to the thorax. According to Blainville, there are
                    never fewer than ten segments, of which the two at the apex are always
                    concealed. The first or basal segment bears on each side of it a small tubercle,
                    more or less distinct, which forms the outlet to a spiracle. When the tubercles
                    are placed very near the base, and the anterior part of the basal segment is not
                    much narrower than the following segments, and these nearly correspond to the
                    breadth of the thorax, the abdomen is said to be sessile; the posterior part of
                    the first segment being so short that it can with difficulty be distinguished,
                    and the anterior part consequently appearing to adhere immediately to the
                    thorax. If this segment, or the posterior part of it, be gradually contracted
                    towards the base, the abdomen is said to be sub-sessile or sub-petiolate. When
                    the posterior part is narrow and elongated, linear or filiform, that part is
                    called the petiole or footstalk, and the abdomen is said to be petiolate.</p>
                <p>The sexes of these insects can with difficulty be distinguished,·—few species
                    affording any permanent external marks of sexual difference. The males in some
                    instances differ from the females in having a more slender abdomen, in others
                    the antennae are thicker, and in some species they are more slender than in the
                    females. Many of the latter are distinguished by having a white ring round the
                    antennae,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In regard,
                    however, to this distinctive character between the sexes, Gravenhorst observes
                    in his preface (page 10)- "nonnullarum mares quoque hoc ornamento
                    gaudent."</p></note> which after death become curved or spirally convoluted. The
                    males may frequently be known by having the colours with which they are adorned
                    clearer and more distinctly defined than in the opposite sex. But the most
                    certain, and often the most obvious mark of sexual distinction, is the
                    ovipositor with which the females are provided. This remarkable appendage varies
                    in its form, in fine accordance with the varied economy of different species.
                    Some Ichneumons deposit their eggs on the bodies of caterpillars; an operation
                    which they accomplish by merely piercing the skin. Others, in order to lodge
                    their eggs in a proper receptacle, are obliged to perforate the nests of
                    insects, and to penetrate to the bottom of crevices too narrow to admit of the
                    whole body. The former are furnished with a short, retractile ovipositor, seldom
                    exserted, and lodged in a groove on the under side of the abdomen. But the
                    ovipositor of the latter is often of considerable length, exceeding in some
                    instances that of the whole body. It is composed of three parts; that in the
                    centre is a slender flexile seta, of a corneoui substance, very smooth and
                    shining, generally straight and rounded, rarely arcuate and compressed, and most
                    commonly of a rufous or castaneous colour. It is provided with a longitudinal
                    central canal, through which the eggs are propelled. The apex is often
                    compressed and dilated, and impressed with transverse inequalities; it is
                    frequently compressed throughout its whole length, and occasion- <pb break="no"

                    upwards at the extremity. On each side of this central seta is placed another,
                    adapted, by the concavity of the inner surface, to enclose it as in a sheath.
                    These lateral appendages are generally punctate and pubescent externally, and
                    somewhat incrassate towards the apex. They issue from the terminal segment of
                    the abdomen; but the central tube or oviduct originates in the interior, and
                    must necessarily be connected with the viscera, to whose contents it forms the
                    outlet.</p>
                <p>When a female Ichneumon, furnished with an apparatus of the kind just described,
                    has discovered the retreat of a larva or pupa, in which she wishes to deposit
                    her eggs, she stations herself immediately over the spot, and raising her
                    abdomen to a vertical position, bends the ovipositor under her belly, and
                    thrusts it into the aperture. This operation is much facilitated by the great
                    flexibility of the instrument, and the ease with which it can be accommodated to
                    any circumstances in which it requires to be employed. It penetrates to a
                    considerable depth into the body of the larva, lest the eggs, by being placed
                    near the surface, should be thrown off when the skin is changed. Upon their
                    exclusion from the egg, the parasitical young make their way still farther into
                    the interior of the larva, consuming the fat that surrounds the muscles and
                    viscera, but carefully abstaining from doing injury to the vital organs. In this
                    state they are gregarious, and were found by Réaumur (who has given a figure of
                    a caterpillar so infested) to be arranged in regular rows in the interior of the
                    caterpillar. When they have arrived at maturity, they undergo their destined
                    change either in the body of the larva which served them as a matrix, or,
                    gnawing a passage through its skin, they construct externally their silk
                    cocoons, and are then converted into pupae, from which, after a longer or
                    shorter period, they emerge in their declared or perfect form.</p>
                <p>A still more remarkable method of rearing its offspring is adopted by the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ophian luteus</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and probably
                    by all the other species belonging to that genus.<note anchored="true"

                    Puss Moth <hi rend="italic">(Cerwa viηula),</hi> to which they firmly adhere by
                    means of an elongated pedicle or foot-stalk. When the larvae are evolved, they
                    do not enter the body of the caterpillar, but remain attached to the columnar
                    appendage, through which they extract, by suction, the juices necessary for
                    their sustenance. The caterpillar dies before it assumes the pupa state, but
                    this event in no case proves fatal to the larvae, as it either does not occur
                    till they require no further nourishment, or they avail themselves of that
                    principle of accommodation to existing circumstances, which insects possess in
                    such a remarkable degree, and undergo their destined changes as soon as their
                    supply of food begins to be withdrawn.</p>
                <p>Ichneumons are generally active and rapid in their motions; many of them,

                    flowers of umbelliferous plants. The species furnished with a long ovipositor
                    usually frequent walls and the trunks of trees, for it is in these situations
                    that they find the larvae on which a singular instinct leads them to deposit
                    their eggs.</p>
                <p>Our knowledge is obscure regarding the food of these insects in the perfect
                    state; but it appears to be derived from the vegetable rather than the animal
                    kingdom. We kept one alive, however, during the greater part of a winter on
                    calf-foot jelly. They have often been observed to examine carefully with their
                    mouths the pollen of plants; and it is probable that the pollen, or rather the
                    honey, of flowers, affords them nourishment. Indeed it is expressly affirmed by
                    Fabricius, that it is this material which forms their food. They do not seem to
                    attack or devour other insects, or larvae, or spiders, but associate with them
                    without offering the least annoyance. It is likely, therefore, that those
                    authors who assert that they are of predatory habits, mistook for Ichneumons
                    certain species of an allied group (<hi rend="italic">Spheges</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">∖</hi> to which they bear resemblance. WTιenever they attack a
                    larvae, it is not for the purpose of employing it as food, but to convert it
                    into a matrix for the reception of their young. But, though they do not devour
                    spiders, as has been asserted, that insidious tribe of creatures is by no means
                    exempted from their destructive visits,—for they oviposit either on the spiders’
                    eggs, or on the dense silky web in which these are frequently enveloped; and the
                    larvae when excluded consume the substance of the eggs, and are then changed
                    into nymphs and perfect insects within that silken chamber, so carefully
                    constructed for a far different purpose.</p>
                <p>The larvae of the Ichneumoniđes are without feet. The tissue of their cocoons is
                    of fine silk, usually of a beautiful yellow, or pure white, according to the
                    species. Some, however, are banded with brown and yellow. We have already stated
                    that their positions are various. A remarkable instance is occasionally met with
                    of a <hi rend="italic">suspended</hi> cocoon. It hangs to the leaves or twigs of
                    the oak-tree, fastened at one extremity by a silken cord. This cocoon is farther
                    remarkable for the manner in which it executes little springs, several inches in
                    height. These are no doubt occasioned by the enclosed larva, which probably has
                    space enough within to admit of its body being bent and retorted, after the
                    fashion of the little worms which we sometimes see vaulting within the hollow
                    walls of an old cheese.</p>
                <p>Several Ichneumons are apterous. These Linnaeus placed with the Mutillae. Degeer
                    describes one which proceeded from a ligneous gall which he found upon the stalk
                    of a species of Potentiíla. It first attracted his notice by two inflated
                    conical pieces, pointed at the end, attached to the upper and posterior portion
                    of the thorax, and directed backwards. They were moveable at the base, and the
                    insect worked them about in all directions while itself in motion. It was
                    extremely small, and leapt with great activity. As its hinder thighs were not
                    enlarged, Degeer inferred that its springs were produced by curving its abdomen,
                    and then pressing that part forcibly against the plane of its position.</p>
                <p>In regard to the situations most favourable for collecting Ichneumonides, we may
                    observe, that wherever other insects, especially in the larva state, abound,
                    there also we may expect to find multitudes of these parasitical depredators.
                    Having so greatly extended our general observations on this interesting tribe,
                    our limits will less easily admit of our entering into descriptive details of

                    as an anomalous fact in the history of Ichneumons, is more apparent than real,
                    and arises, in some instances, from the distinctive marks of sex being so slight
                    as to elude observation, while in others the sexes are so dissimilar that each
                    of them is received as a different species. The détermination of the sexes is
                    impeded by the difficulty of observing their intercourse. “Nunquam mihi

                <p>This insect, which is the largest of the European Ichneumonides, occurs not
                    unfrequently in many parts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Europe. It is found in
                    England; and in Scotland it has been observed in Roxburghshire, and near
                    Edinburgh. “On the first of October,” says Gravenhorst, “I observed many females
                    of this species on the decaying trunk of a willow, about to deposit their eggs.
                    They traversed with much assiduity the barkless trunk, which was perforated with
                    numerous holes, inhabited no doubt by the larvae of other insects; and so free
                    were they from apprehension, that when I touched them with my finger they did
                    not fly off, but only slightly averted their bodies. They searched out and
                    examined the holes by means of their antennae, which were vibrating incessantly,
                    and exploring on all sides. When they had selected a hole, they: stationed
                    themselves with the four anterior legs over it, and raising the body as high as
                    possible, and the abdomen perpendicularly, bent the ovipositor downward in such
                    a .manner that it passed under the belly and thorax, and entered the hole over
                    which they stood. It not unfre∙ quently happened, when the hole was sufficiently
                    large, that the whole abdomen was inserted, and the head, feet, and thorax were
                    the only parts of the insects which remained free. Frequently also a contest
                    took place between two females for the possession of a hole; but they did not
                    employ their mandibles on these occasions, their fighting consisting entirely of
                    violent concussions of their bodies, and strokes of the feet, till the weaker
                    party retreated. When a female had obtained full possession of a hole, no attack
                    could displace her; but she retained her seat even though assailed by a more
                    powerful antagonist.”</p>

                <p>These have only a single nervure on the lower wings; the upper pair offer a few
                    areolets or eells, viz. two at the base—the brachial, of which the internal is
                    usually incomplete or slightly marked,—one radial and triangular,— and two or
                    three cubital,—of which the second, in such as have three, is always very small,
                    and the third very large, triangular, and elosed by the posterior margin of the
                    wing. The antennae are either of equal thickness, or increase towards the
                    termination, but not elub-shaped, and are eomposed of from thirteen to fifteen
                    articulations, the number when different in the sexes being generally greater in
                    the males. These inseets form the old genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cynips</hi> of

                <p>Their general form is humped or gibbous, with the head small, and the thorax
                    thiek and elevated. The abdomen is compressed, carinated, or cutting inferiorly,
                    and truncated obliquely, or obtuse, at the extremity. It is furnished in the
                    females with an ovipositor, which seems to consist of only a single piece, long
                    and delicate, or capillary, spirally rolled at its base, and attached near the
                    origin of the abdomen. It is minutely described by Réaumur.<note anchored="true"

                    its eggs in the leaves and stems of various plants, and on these its punctures
                    produce those peculiar excrescences known by the name of gallnuts, so useful
                    when employed along with a solution of green vitriol, or sulphate of iron, in

                    there is never more than a single eubital eell, whieh is not elosed. The
                    antennae have not more than twelve articulations. The modern genera are very
                    numerous, though all related to the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Chalcis</hi> of
                    Fab. The species are extremely small, brilliantly ornamented with metallic
                    colours. Many of them are leapers. The ovipositor is generally composed of three
                    threads, like that of the Ichneumons, and is salient. The larvae likewise
                    resemble those of that tribe in being parasitical, and some of them are so
                    minute as to be able to dwell at large in the interior of insect eggs,
                    themselves seareely visible to the naked eye.</p>

                <p>This tribe resembles the preceding so far as concerns the want of nervures in the
                    lower wings, but the abdomen of the female is terminated by a tubular and
                    conical ovipositor, sometimes internal and exsertile, proceeding like a sting
                    from the anal extremity, sometimes permanently external, and forming a kind of
                    tail. The antennae are composed of from ten to fifteen articulations, and are in
                    some cases filiform or slightly enlarged towards the extremity, in others
                    clubbed in the females. The maxillary palpi in several are long and pendant.</p>

                    The abdomen, which in the female seems to be composed of only three or four
                    segments, is arched or plain beneath, and is capable of being applied against
                    the chest,— in which attitude the insect assumes the form of a ball. This tribe
                    includes the old genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Chrysis</hi> of Linnaeus, and is
                    remarkable for the extreme richness and brilliant lustre displayed by the
                    colouring of many species. In these respects they rival the gorgeous
                    humming-birds, and are known under the name of gilded wasps,—the <hi

                    neighbours. They are lovers of the cheerful sunshine, and during the bright days
                    of early summer may be seen moving about in a state of great vivacity, almost of
                    agitation, on walls, old timber, and other objects exposed to the gladdening
                    influence of heat and light. They are also found on flowers, “beautifying the
                    beauti-ul,” and adding to their gorgeous petals all that is wanting to complete
                    the glory of the “lilies of the field,”—a burnished or metallic lustre.<note

                <p>The body of these insects is covered by a very solid integument. Their antennae
                    are filiform, geniculate, vibra-ile, and composed of thirteen articulations in
                    both sexes. The mandibles are arched, narrow, and pointed. The maxillary palpi
                    are usually longer than the labial, filiform, and composed of five unequal
                    articulations ;—the labial consist of three. The ligula is for the most part
                    emargi-ιιate. The thorax is semicylindrical, and exhibits several impressed and
                    transverse lines. The abdomen in the greater number is semi-oval, truncated at
                    the base, and appears at first sight as if attached to the thorax by its entire
                    breadth. The terminal segment is frequently marked by large punctures, and
                    terminates in dentations.</p>

                <p>This, the second primary section of the hymenopterous order, is distinguished
                    from the preceding by the want of an ovipositor. That organ is represented by a
                    sting composed of three parts, concealed and retractile. It is characteristic of
                    the females, and likewise exists in those individuals (imperfect in a sexual
                    point of view) commonly called neuters, which constitute so important a feature
                    in the social union of the gregarious kinds. It is, however, wanting in several
                    of the ant tribe,—in which case the insect defends itself by ejecting an acid
                    liquid, elaborated and contained in special reservoirs.<note anchored="true"

                    September 1828.</p></note> Our present Hymenoptera have always simple antennae,
                    composed of a constant number of articulations, that is, thirteen in the males
                    and twelve in the females. The palpi are usually filiform; those of the
                    maxillae, which are frequently the longer, have six articulations,—the labial
                    only four. The mandibles of the males are smaller, and generally less toothed,
                    than in the others·. All the wings are veined. The abdomen, united to the thorax
                    by a thread or pedicle, is composed of seven segments in the males, and of six
                    in the females.</p>
                <p>The larvae in this family are never furnished wfith feet. Their food is supplied
                    to them by females or neuters, and varies in its nature according to the
                    different kinds. Latreille divides the section into four families.</p>
                <p>FAMILY I HETEROGYNA.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>From

                <p>The species of this family consist of individuals which differ from each other
                    not only in their sexual characters, but in the presence or absence of the
                    wings, and in other particulars. In all, the antennae are geniculate, and the
                    ligula small, rounded and hollowed, or spoon-shaped.</p>
                <p>Some live in society, and consist of three kinds of individuals, of which two,
                    that is, the males and females, are winged, and the third or neuters are
                    apterous, <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> In the two latter kinds the antennae
                    gradually increase in thickness, and the length of the first articulation equals
                    at least the third part of their total extent; the second is almost as long as
                    the third, and has the form of a reversed cone. The labrum of the neuters is
                    large and corneous, and falls perpendicularly beneath the mandibles. These
                    Hymenoptera comprise the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Formica</hi> of

                    habits of these admirable insects, so long noted for their foresight and
                    industry, we shall not occupy our remaining space by repetition, but shall
                    proceed to a brief sketch of the classification of the species, as promised at
                    the conclusion of the article just referred to. Latreille divides the genus
                    Formica as follows :—</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Formica</hi> properly
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">so</hi> called. These want the sting; the antennae are
                    inserted near the front; the mandibles are triangular, dentated, and incisive;
                    and the pedicle of the abdomen is never composed but of a single squama or
                    knot.</p>
                <p>Of the European species we may mention <hi rend="italic">F. rufa,</hi> Lat., of
                    which the workers measure about four lines in length, and are of a blackish
                    colour, with a great part of the head, the thorax, and the knot, fulvous. The
                    thorax is uneven. The stemmatic eyes are discernible. This species builds in
                    woods, and forms a dome-like or sugar-loaf shaped habitation of considerable
                    size, composed of earth and fragments of wood, &amp;c. Formic acid is obtained
                    chiefly from this insect. The winged individuals make their appearance in
                    spring. (Plate CCXXXH. fig. 4.) <hi rend="italic">F. sanguinea,</hi> Lat∙,
                    resembles the preceding in its workers; but the colour is sanguine red, with an
                    ashy-black abdomen. It likewise dwells in woods, and is one of the species named
                    Amazons or <hi rend="italic">legionnaires</hi> by Μ. Huber. <hi rend="italic">F.
                    cunicularia,</hi> Lat., has the head and abdomen of the workers black. Around
                    the mouth, the under parts of the head, the first joint of the antennae, the
                    thorax, and feet, pale fulvous. The worker of <hi rend="italic">F.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fusca,</hi> Linn., is of an ashy-black, shining, with the base of
                    the antennae and the feet reddish. The squama or knot is large, almost
                    triangular, and there is an appearance of three stemmatic eyes. Both these
                    species are attacked by the Amazons, carried off, and enslaved.</p>
                <p>2rZ, The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Polyergus,</hi> Lat. In these the sting is
                    likewise wanting; but the antennae are inserted near the mouth, and the
                    mandibles are narrow, arcuated, or strongly hooked. In this genus is placed the
                    <hi rend="italic">F. roussatre</hi> of Lat. so common in France. It is this
                    species which is more particularly named Amazon by Μ. Huber the younger.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">. 3d,</hi> The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ponera,</hi> Lat. In
                    these the workers and the females are armed with a sting. The pedicle of the
                    abdomen is formed of a single scale or knot; the antennae of the individuals
                    just mentioned are thickened towards the extremity; the mandibles are
                    triangular, and the head is also nearly of that form, without remarkable
                    emargination at its posterior extremity. <hi rend="italic">F. contracta</hi> of
                    Lat., which occurs near Paris, belongs to this division. The worker seems
                    scarcely provided with eyes, and lives under stones in not very numerous groups.
                    It is very small, black, nearly cylindrical, with the antennae and feet of a
                    yellowish brown.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Myrmica,</hi> Lat. In
                    these there is also a sting; but the pedicle of the abdomen is formed of two
                    knots. The antennae are exposed, the maxillary palpi are long, with six distinct
                    articulations, and the mandibles are triangular. Such is the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fourmis</hi><hi rend="italic">rouge</hi> of Latreille, of which the worker is
                    reddish, finely chagrined, with the abdomen smooth and shining. There is a spine
                    upon the first knot of the pedicle, and the third segment is brownish. This
                    species occurs in woods, and bites sharply.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">.bth,</hi> The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Atta</hi> of
                    Fabricius, which scarcely differs from Myrmica, except by its very short palpi,
                    of which the maxillary are composed of less than six articulations. The head of
                    the workers is usually very large. The species which serves as the type of the
                    genus in the works of Fa-J bricius, Jurine, and Latreille, is the <hi
                    rend="italic">fourmis de visite,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Atta cephalotes</hi>
                    of systematic writers. It is a foreign insect, and seems to agree with that

                    destroys every other kind of inconvenient insect. If during these predatory
                    incursions they find an intervening space which they cannot cross, a party
                    volunteer to form a chain of their own bodies linked together, over which, as by

                <p>The other Heterogyna live in solitude, and each species is composed of only two
                    kinds of individuals, winged males and apterous females,—the latter always
                    provided with a strong sting. The antennae are filiform or setaceous, vibratile,
                    with the first and third articulations elongated; the length of the former,
                    however, never equalling that of the third part of the total length of the
                    antennae. They form the genus <hi rend="italic">Mutïlla</hi> of Linnaeus, which
                    has been subdivided into <hi rend="smallcaps">Dorylus,</hi> Fab. (Plate CCXXXII.

                    >Mutïlla</hi> properly so called (ibid. fig. 5). Of the latter, <hi
                    rend="italic">Μ. Europoea,</hi> Linn., is black, with a red thorax, and three
                    white bands on the abdomen. The female is armed with a powerful sting. The
                    manners of the Mutillae seem little known. We are not ourselves acquainted with
                    the nature of their metamorphosis. They love warm sunny places, and sandy soils.
                    The females being apterous, are always found pon the ground, concealed under
                    stones, or lurking in little holes. The males are seen on flowers, or by the
                    sides of dusty paths, and other places frequented by the females. The genus is
                    extensive, Olivier and Klug having described a great many species.<note

                    provision for their young. The larvae are without feet, and spin a cocoon before

                    minor genera derived in recent times from the genus just named, are distributed
                    by Latreille into seven principal tribes.</p>

                <p>In the first two the eycs are often emarginate. The body of the males is usually

                    the legs are also short, but slender, and neither spiny nor strongly ciliated.
                    The antennae in both sexes are at least as long as the head and thorax. The body
                    is usually either smooth, or but slightly pubescent. The genera are <hi

                <p>Of this tribe a certain number have the first segment of the thorax of a square
                    form, whether transverse or longitudinal, and the abdomen is attached by a very
                    short pedicle. The inner side of the posterior tibiae is usually furnished with
                    a brush or pellet of hairs. The upper wings have three or two complete or closed

                    of which the two lateral extremities are distant from the origin of the upper
                    wings. The legs are always short, or of moderate length. The head, seen from
                    above, appears transverse, and the eyes extend as far as the exterior border.
                    The abdomen forms an elongated semi-cone, rounded on the sides, near the base.
                    1he labrum is entirely exposed, or very salient. "</p>
                <p>Of this tribe the species are characteristic of the warmer countries of the
                    earth. Their body is elongated, pointed posteriorly, almost always varied with
                    black and yellow, or reddish, and smooth. The antennae are approximate at the
                    base, slightly geniculate at the second article, and enlarged towards the
                    extremity. The mandibles are narrow, lengthened, dentated on the inner side, and
                    crossed. The tibiae and tarsi are provided with little spines or cilia, which
                    are particularly obvious on the anterior tarsi of the females. There are
                    frequently one or two raised teeth beneath the abdomen of the male. The flight
                    of these insects is extremely rapid, and they dart from flower to flower with a
                    sharp and interrupted sound. Several species smell of the odour of roses.</p>
                <p>In a certain number we find a false trunk, bent underneath, with the labrum in
                    the form of an elongated triangle.</p>
                <p>Of these, some have the palpi very short; the maxillary possessing four, the
                    labial two articulations. Such is <hi rend="italic">Bern-bex</hi><hi

                    >rostrata,</hi> Linn.), Plate CCXXXH. fig. 11, a large black insect, with
                    transverse bands of citron yellow upon the abdomen. This is a well-known
                    European species. The female digs deep holes in a sandy soil, in which she
                    places the carcasses of other insects, especially Syrphi, and other two-winged
                    flies. Among these she lays her eggs, and then places a plug in the hole.
                    Another hymenopterous insect, however, <hi rend="italic">Parnopes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">carnea,</hi> possesses a strong instinctive desire to deposit her
                    eggs in the subterraneous nest of the Bembex. As soon as the latter perceives
                    its natural enemy hovering around its dwelling, it attacks it with the greatest
                    fierceness, and endeavours to thrust its sting through its body,—an attempt,
                    however, which is seldom successful, owing to the hardness of the Parnopes’s
                    skin. Others have the maxillary palpi elongated, and with six articulations,—the
                    labial with four. Such is the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Monedula</hi> of
                    Lat.</p>
                <p>In the remainder of this family there is no false trunk, and the labrum is short
                    and rounded, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the genus Sτι-zus of Jurine.</p>

                <p>These in their general aspect resemble the preceding, but their labrum is either
                    entirely or in great part concealed, and there is a deep emargination on the
                    inner side of the mandibles,—a character which distinguishes them both from
                    those which precede and those which follow.</p>
                <p>In some the upper wings have three closed cubital cells, of which the second
                    receives the two recurrent nervures. Such are the genera <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    towards the extremity, or club-shaped. The abdomen is either oval or elliptical,
                    and broadest about the middle,—or narrowed at the base into a lengthened
                    pediele, and as if terminated by a elub.</p>
                <p>In some the antennae are inserted beneath the middle of the anterior part of the

                    a supply of little spiders, which she eloses up with moist earth. In the
                    remainder the eyes are entire. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Crabro</hi> of

                    of the anterior tibiae, resembling a slender shell, convex without and eoncave
                    within, and pervaded by a multitude of little holes, or rather of transparent
                    points. They somewhat resemble the well-known expansions on the fore-feet of the

                    feed on the neetareous juices of flowers; but the larvae are extremely greedy of
                    animal food. The female parent forms holes in the earth, in each of which she
                    deposits an egg along with the body of a captured inseet. She then, as usual,
                    eloses up the orifice, and the entombed prey, whether dead or alive, is soon
                    attacked and eaten by the young larva to which the egg gives birth. Dipterous

                    terminated by two threads capable of being withdrawn within a tube formed by its
                    base. The upper wings have only two complete cubital cells. The middle of the
                    anterior margin of the elypeus is emarginate, and receives the labrum in that
                    emargination. The genera are few in number. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Masaris</hi>
                    proper (Plate CCXXXIL fig. 17), the antennae, a little longer than the head and
                    thorax, have the first article lengthened, and the eighth forming an obconic
                    elub, rounded at the extremity. The abdomen is long. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Celonites,</hi> Lat. the antennae are scarcely longer than the head, and their
                    first two articulations are mueh shorter than the third; the eighth and
                    following form an almost globular body. The abdomen is scarcely longer than the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Tribe 2d, Vespiariae.</hi></p>
                <p>In these the antennae always exhibit distinctly thirteen articulations in the
                    male and twelve in the female, and terminate in an elongated mass, pointed, and
                    sometimes hooked (in the males) at the end; they are always genieulate, at least
                    in the females and neuters. The ligula is sometimes divided into four plumose
                    filaments, sometimes into three lobes, having four glandular points at the end,
                    one on eaeh lateral lobe, and the two others on the intermediate one, whieh is
                    larger, widened, and emarginate or bifid at the extremity. The mandibles are
                    strong and dentated.- The elypeus is large. Beneath the labrum there is a little
                    pieee in the form of a ligula, analogous to that whieh Réaumur observed in

                    in societies composed of three kinds of individuals. . .</p>
                <p>The larvae of these insects are without íeet, and each is enclosed in a cell
                    where it is fed, according to its kind, either on the bodies of insects carried
                    thither by the mother at the period of oviposition, or on the nectar of flowers,
                    the juices of fruits and of animal matter, elaborated in the stomach of the
                    parent, or in that of the workers, and carefully supplied from day to day. This
                    tribe corresponds to the genus <hi rend="italic">Vespa</hi> of Linn.</p>
                <p>The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Ceramius</hi> of Lat. differs from all the others
                    in having the superior wings stretched or extended, and in the amount of the
                    cubital cells, of which there are only two. The labial palpi are moreover longer
                    than those of the maxillae. The species occur in South Africa, and the warmer
                    regions of Europe.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                <p>In all the following genera the superior wings are folded, and present three
                    complete cubital cells.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the mandibles are much longer than broad, and approximate anteriorly in
                    the form of a rostrum. The ligula is narrow and elongate. The clypeus is nearly
                    heart-shaped or oval, with the point anterior, and more or less truncate. All
                    the species arc solitary, and each is composed of only males and females. The
                    latter provision their young both before their birth and during the continuance
                    of the larva state. Their nests are usually formed of earth, and are either
                    concealed in the holes of walls, beneath the ground, in old wood, or are
                    external, and placed on plants. Each nest contains a supply of caterpillars or
                    other larvae, which the female piles up in a circular form. She sometimes also
                    stores up spiders, which she has the precaution previously to pierce with her
                    sting.</p>
                <p>In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Synagris,</hi> Lat. the ligula is divided into
                    four long plumose filaments, without glandular points at their extremity. The
                    mandibles of some of the males are very large. The species arc few in number,
                    and characteristic of Africa. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Eumenes,</hi> Lat. the
                    ligula is divided into three portions, glandular at their extremity. The abdomen
                    in some is ovoid or conical, and thicker at the base. Such are <hi

                    rend="italic">Mémoires,</hi> vi. xxxvi. I-10.</p></note> The female perforates
                    deep holes in sand, or in the plaster of walls, at the orifice of which she
                    forms an outer tube, at first straight, afterwards recurved, and composed of an
                    earthy paste, arranged in thick contorted threads. In the cavity of the interior
                    cell she heaps up trom eight to twelve little green larvae of the same age,
                    disposing them in beds one above another, in a circular form. After depositing
                    her egg, she closes the mouth of the hole, and destroys the outward scaffolding.
                    The abdomen in others has its first segment narrow and elongat’d in the form of
                    a pear, and the second bell-shaped. Such <hi rend="superscript"> ιs t</hi> hθ

                    u</hi> a is short, or but slightly elongated. The clypeus is most square. These
                    insects constitute the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Vespa, γ</hi> wasps properly
                    so called. They unite in numerous as- <hi rend="superscript"> cι</hi> atιons,
                    composed of males, females, and neuters. The last two kinds detach particles of
                    old wood or bark with their mandibles, reduce and moisten them to the
                    consistence of a paste resembling paper or pasteboard in its nature, and
                    construct nests containing horizontal combs suspended from above by one or more
                    pedicles; on the inferior side there is a range of vertical cells in the form of
                    hexagonal and truncated pyramids. These cells serve solely as lodgings for the
                    isolated larvae and nymphs. The amount of combs forming the same nest varies;
                    and the nest itself is sometimes open or exposed, sometimes surrounded by an
                    envelope, pierced by a common and almost always central opening, which
                    corresponds with a string of holes for the purposes of internal communication,
                    if the edges of the combs adhere to the inner side of the external covering.
                    These singular constructions are sometimes suspended to the branches of plants
                    in the open air, sometimes concealed beneath the earth or in the hollows of old
                    trees. Their form likewise varies according to the species.</p>
                <p>The females commence their labours in spring, and in the first place in a state
                    of solitude. In a nest of small dimensions they deposit the eggs of neuters or
                    workers, which, as soon as they are hatched and attain maturity, enlarge the
                    dwelling, and assist in rearing additional members of the body politic. For a
                    considerable time the society consists only of the original founder of the
                    colony, that is, the female parent, and of neuters. Towards the end of summer or
                    beginning of autumn, young males are hatched, along with additional females. But
                    all such larvae and nymphs as have not completed their final metamorphosis
                    before the month of November are murdered by the neuters, and torn from their
                    cells. These destroyers are themselves ere long destroyed, in common with the
                    males, by the first frosts of winter. The latter sex never work. A few females
                    alone survive the rigours of the winter season, and these again, on the return
                    of spring, become each the founder of a new but equally transitory empire. Of
                    the death and desolation which is so soon to overtake their busy race, the <hi

                <p>All that this world is proud of; and hymenopterous and human kingdoms, alike
                    decay and perish. The polity of wasps, we may observe, is not so exclusively
                    monarchical as that of bees. It partakes rather of the republican order, as many
                    females dwell together in amity during the autumnal season. These Vespae are
                    almost omnivorous. They prey on other insects, on flesh and fruits of every
                    kind, especially when ripe and sweet. They appear to an uninstructed eye as very
                    gluttonous; but their apparent greed becomes more excusable, when wc consider
                    that they are catering, not f&lt;)ζ themselves, but for a numerous and otherwise
                    unprovided offspring. The larvae, in consequence of the peculiar position of the
                    opening of their cells, lie in a reversed position, with their heads downwards.
                    When about to pass into the nympha state, they shut up their cells, and
                    fabricate a cocoon.</p>
                <p>In several species, that portion of the inner margin of the mandibles which is
                    beyond the angle, and terminates it, is shorter than that which precedes the
                    angle. The central part of the front of the clypeus is pointed. Ί hese belong to

                    Aug. St Hilaire, who brought it from the interior of Brazil. Its combs contain
                    an excellent honey, resembling in consistence that of our own domestic species,
                    but possessing at times the singular quality of rendering those who eat it
                    furious, or void of reason. It has been known from ancient times that common
                    honey is occasionally possessed of very deleterious properties, arising probably
                    from the nature or condition of the flowers from which it is collected. The
                    naturalist just named, and two men by whom he was accompanied, nearly perished
                    in consequence of eating of the Brazilian honey in its poisonous state.</p>
                <p>In other wasps the superior portion of the inner margin of the mandibles, or that
                    which succeeds the angle, is as long if not longer than the other portion of
                    that margin. The central part of the front of the clypeus is widely truncated.
                    The abdomen is always ovoid or conical. These constitute the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vespa</hi> properly so called, of Latreille. The French
                    entomologist here places the <hi rend="italic">V.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >crabro,</hi> Linn., which we call the <hi rend="italic">hornet.</hi> (Plate
                    CCXXXH. fig. 18.) It builds its nest in sheltered places, such as barns, old
                    walls, wooden posts, and hollow trees. It is of a roundish shape, composed of
                    coarse materials, and resembles an old leaf in colour. This species devours
                    other insects, and robs bees of their honey. Though a well-known English insect,
                    it has not yet been found in Scotland. The common wasp, <hi rend="italic">V.
                    vulgaris</hi> (ibid. fig. 19), forms a somewhat similar nest; but it is composed
                    of finer paper, contains a greater number of combs, and is sheltered in a hole
                    in the earth. <hi rend="italic">V. media,</hi> Lat. is intermediate as to size
                    between the two preceding. It hangs its paper dwelling beneath the branch of a

                    a brief record. It is almost globular, pierced at the top, and enclosed beneath
                    in a kind of saucer. It is sometimes observed abroad, in barns, or attached to
                    the beams of garrets, and has even been found in hives. It is not unknown in
                    Britain.</p>

                    remarks that the parasitical species are not possessed of this faculty;—but the

                    parts being merely destitute of the hairs or brushes.</p></note> This character
                    distinguishes our present groups from those of every other family of insects.
                    The first articulation of the tarsi of the hinder legs is very large,
                    compressed, and in the form of a square pallet, or of a reversed triangle. The
                    maxillae and the labium are usually very long, and constitute a kind of trunk.
                    The ligula is generally shaped like the head of a lance, or resembles a
                    lengthened filament, of which the extremity is silken or hairy. The larvae are
                    fed exclusively on honey, or the fecundating pollen of flowers. The perfect
                    insects restrict their own diet to the nectareous juices of flowers, and (when
                    Flora’s kingdom has fallen before the approach of winter) to the secretion which
                    they form from these, which we call honey. These Hymenoptera, embracing tlιe
                    great genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Apis</hi> of Linnaeus, are divided by Latreille
                    into two sections.</p>

                    heart-shaped or lance-shaped, shorter than the sheath, and bent upwards in some,
                    almost straighι in others. They correspond to the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The Andrenetae are solitary insects, and consist of onl males and females. Their
                    mandibles are simple, or termi nated at most by two dentations. The labial palpi
                    resem ble the maxillary, and the latter have six articulations. The ligula is
                    divided into three portions, of which the lateral are short, and in the form of
                    auricles. The nιajorit&gt; of the females collect the pollen of plants by means
                    of th hairs of their hinder legs, and mixing it with a little honey they thus
                    form a paste for the nourishment of their young They form holes in the ground,
                    frequently even in firmly-trodden places by the sides of roads, or in fields,
                    and o’ considerable depth. In these they place their paste, anc depositing an

                <p>Some have the middle division of the ligula widened at the extremity, almost

                    >Hylaeus,</hi> Fab. which is now partitioned into two. In the first, or <hi

                    body is smooth, the second and third joints of the antennae of almost equal
                    length, and the upper wings present only two complete cubital cells. Tin

                    the walls are endued with a gummy liquid, <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> which has
                    been compared to the viscous and shining slime left by slugs on the places over

                <p>Other Andrenetae are distinguished from the preceding by the form of the ligula,
                    which is lanceolate. In some of these, that part is folded on the superior side

                    the latter have the first joint of the tarsi very long, beset with lengthened
                    hairs after the manner of a little feather. The upper wings in both these genera
                    have only two cubital cells. The <hi rend="italic">Andrenafiessae of</hi>

                    the latest of the preceding genera in their labial palpi, composed of slender
                    linear joints, placed end to end, almost entirely similar to those of the
                    maxillary palpi, and which are six in number. The labrum is always short. The
                    females have no brush on the abdomen; but their posterior legs are clothed or
                    garnished with tufts of hair, which serve them to collect the pollen of flowers.
                    Some have the mandibles narrow, contracted towards the extremity, terminated in
                    a point, and, in common with the labrum, smooth. Such are the genera <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sys-tropha,</hi> Illig. <hi rend="smallcaps">Rophites,</hi>
                    Spinola, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Panurgus,</hi> Panzer. Others have the
                    mandibles, in the females, almost spoon-shaped, very obtuse, carinated or
                    grooved, and bidentated at the end. The labrum is very hard, and ciliated above.
                    The antennae are strongly geniculate and filiform. The upper wings have three
                    complete cubital cells, the first intersected by a little transparent line, the
                    second triangular, the third the largest, and receiving the two recurrent
                    nervures. The genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Xylocopa,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXX∏. fig.
                    22), resemble large humble-bees. Their body is usually black, sometimes covered
                    in part with a yellow down, and the wings are frequently adorned by brilliant
                    tints of violet, copper, and green. The males of Several species differ greatly
                    from the females. Their eyes are large, and more approximated superiorly. Their
                    anterior legs are dilated and ciliated. The species figured, Jvhich is the <hi

                    transparent. The maxillary palpi are always very short, and have not
                    unfrcquently fewer than six articulations. The labrum in a great number is
                    lengthened, inclined upon the mandibles, sometimes in the form of an elongated
                    square, sometimes of a lengthened triangle.</p>

                    as their name implies, in this, that the abdomen of the female is almost always
                    furnished with numerous short, close-set hairs, which form as it were a silky
                    brush. The labrum is as long or longer than broad, and of a square form. The
                    rqandibles of the females are strong, incisive, triangular, and toothed. The
                    paraglossae are always very short, in the form of scales, pointed at the end. Of
                    all the genera which compose this group, that called <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ceratina</hi> approaches most closely to that of which we last figured an
                    example; and, according to Maximilian Spinola, the habits of the females are

                    articulations to the maxillary palpi, and two complete cubital cells. In the six
                    genera next ensuing, the abdomen is obviously furnished beneath with a silky
                    brush. The species belonging to <hi rend="smallcaps">Chelosto-ma,</hi> Lat. and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Heriades,</hi> Spin, form their habitations in the hollows

                    maxillary palpi are composed of only two articulations, the abdomen is plain
                    above, and susceptible of being raised upwards,—thereby enabling the female to
                    use her sting over her body. This genus contains several singular insects, of
                    which the habits have been well described by Réaumur and other observers.<note

                    >Mémoire»,</hi> t. iv.</p></note> JZ. <hi rend="italic">muraria</hi> is one of
                    the largest of the genus. The female is black, with dark wings tinted with
                    violet; the male is covered with reddish hairs, the terminal segments of the
                    abdomen being black. The former sex constructs her little nest on walls and
                    stones in sunny places. It is made of fine earth worked into a kind of mortar,
                    which drying, becomes very hard and durable. On this account the term <hi
                    rend="italic">mason-bee</hi> is applied to this insect, and to several other
                    species of analogous habits. The interior of these nests contains about a dozen
                    cells, in each of which the provident parent deposits an egg and a piece of
                    paste. The perfect insect is not produced till the spring of the ensuing year.
                    Another species, <hi rend="italic">Μ.</hi><hi rend="italic">sicula,</hi> Lat. is
                    black and hairy, with the front, the upper part of the thorax, and the legs,
                    bright yellow. The female constructs a hard and spherical nest, of rather more
                    than an inch in diameter, which she attaches to the branches of heath and other
                    plants. This insect occurs both in Egypt and the south of Europe, and was lately
                    noticed in Corsica by Μ. Payraudeau. The habits of other Species of the genus
                    Megachile are very different from those just noted. They are known by the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">leaf-eating bees</hi> (Plate CCXXXH. fig. 23), on account
                    of their employing in the construction of their nests perfectly oval or circular
                    pieces of leaves, which they cut out with the most remarkable dexterity. These
                    pieces are conveyed to their straight cylindrical holes, which they previously
                    excavate in the earth, or sometimes in walls, or the decayed trunk of an old
                    tree. They line the bottom of the cavity with these cuttings, and form a
                    thimble-shaped cell (ibid. fig. 27), in which they deposit the honeyed provision
                    on which the larva is destined to feed. After laying an egg, they close the cell
                    by means of a flaŧtish or slightly concave lid, also formed of a portion of
                    leaf. These little cells are repeated one over the other till the hole is filled
                    up. To this division of the genus belongs the <hi rend="italic">Μ. du

                    clypeus, which are probably of use in the construction of their nests. These are
                    concealed in the earth, in chinks of walls, door-posts, and old wood, and
                    sometimes even in the shells of snails <hi rend="italic">{Helices).</hi> One of

                    of a silky brush. They are parasitical, and their bodies are almost smooth and
                    coloured like those of wasps, sometimes partially clothed or hairy. The labrum
                    assumes the form of a lengthened and truncated triangle, or is short and almost
                    semicircular. The mandibles are narrow, ending in a point, and at most
                    uni-dentated on the inner side. The paraglossae are often long, narrow, and
                    setiform. The scutellum in several is emarginate or bidentated; in others it is
                    tubercular. These insects correspond to tlιe <hi rend="italic">Nomadae</hi> of
                    Fabricius. Several appear in those countries to which they are indigenous,
                    flitting about in spring partly near the ground, or on walls exposed to
                    sunshine. They are then employed in searching for the nests of other Apiariae,
                    in which they, cuckoolike, deposit their eggs. It was in reference to this habit

                    Nomada is the richest in British species. The genus occurs in Asia, Africa, and
                    America, although the majority are characteristic of, if not peculiar to,
                    Europe. The genus Melecta is not unknown in Britain.</p>

                <p>The concluding subdivision of the solitary bees is characterized by the first
                    article of the posterior tarsi being dilated inferiorly on the outer side, so
                    that the following articulation is inserted nearer to the internal angle of its
                    extremity than to the opposite onc. The outer side of that first angle, as well
                    as the corresponding part of the tibiae, is furnished with thick and close-set
                    hairs, forming, especially in several exotic species, a sort of brush or tuft,—
                    and thence the name of <hi rend="italic">Scopulipedes,</hi> bestowed on this
                    division by Latreille. The under part of the abdomen is naked, or at least
                    unprovided with a silken brush. The number of cubital cells is three, with few
                    exceptions, and each of the last two cells receives a recurrent nervure.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the maxillary palpi consist of from four to six articulations.</p>
                <p>In a certain number the mandibles exhibit only a single tooth on the inner side.
                    These species fly with great rapidity from flower to flower, and with a buzzing
                    sound. They construct their nests either under ground, or in the clefts of old
                    walls. Several prefer ground which has been cut perpendicularly, and exposed to
                    the sun. Those species in which the two lateral portions of the ligula are as
                    long as the labial palpi, and setaceous, and of which the antennae of the males
                    are lengthened, form the genus <hi rend="italic">Eu∙ cera</hi> properly so
                    called (Plate CCXXXH. fig. 25). The male of a British species <hi rend="italic"
                    >{Apis longicorηis,</hi> Linn.) is black, with the labrum and the anterior
                    extremity of the head yellow; its upper portion, thorax, and two first segments
                    of the abdomen, are covered by a reddish down. The female (at one time described
                    by Fabricius as a distinct species, under the name of <hi rend="italic">Apis
                    tuberculata)</hi> has short antennae. The maxilla and labium form at their base
                    a slight projection. The abdomen is marked by grey stripes, with a reddish
                    termination. Several other species occur in Britain. Spinola has detached
                    certain species, of which the maxillary palpi have only five distinct
                    articulations, and the superior wings only two cubital cells. These he names <hi

                    >Insecten,</hi> applies the same title to a dipterous genus.</p></note> The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Melipodes</hi> of Lat. may be defined as American Eucerae, with
                    but four joints to the maxillary palpi, and three cubital cells to the superior
                    wings. In the other Apiariae of this subdivision, the paraglossae are much
                    shorter than the ligula, and always exhibit three cubital cells. In <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Melitturga</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Anthophora,</hi> Lat.
                    (of both of which several species are indigenous to Britain), the maxillary
                    palpi have six articulations. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Saropoda,</hi> Lat.,
                    likewise known among ourselves, the maxillary palpi have only five
                    articulations, and those of the labium are continuous. Lastly, in the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ancy-loscelis,</hi> Lat., of which the species are native to
                    Brazil, the maxillary palpi offer only four articulations.</p>
                <p>In others the mandibles have several dentations on the inner side, and the
                    maxillary palpi, as in the preceding genus, have four articulations. Such is the
                    American genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Centris</hi> of Fab.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the maxillary palpi consist of only a single very small articulation,
                    which even becomes imperceptible in certain species. The paraglossae are very
                    short, and the mandibles dentated. Such are the genera <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Epicharis</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Acanthopus</hi> of Klug.<note

                <p>Our second principal division of the Apiariae is constituted by many interesting
                    insects, such as the garden and humble bees, so remarkable for their peculiar
                    <hi rend="italic">regime,</hi> and the gregarious habits of the species, each of
                    which consists of three kinds of individuals—males, females, and neuters, as the
                    workers are often called. The posterior tibiae of these last named are furnished
                    on their external face with a smooth depression called the basket, in w hich
                    they place the pollen <pb break="no" facs="nls:193748313?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0709-8313-0235"/> , collected from flowers by means of the silky
                    down or brush with which the inner face of the first joint of the posterior
                    tarsi is provided. The maxillary palpi are very small, and consist of a single
                    articulation. The antennae are geniculate.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the posterior tibiae are terminated by two spines, as in the genus <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Euglossa,</hi> Lat. (Plate CCXXXIL fig. 26), which has the
                    labrum square, and the false proboscis, or prolonged parts of the mouth, as long
                    as the body. The labial palpi terminate in a point formed by the two other
                    articulations. The species are peculiar to South America. Latreille supposes
                    that we owe to the one which we have here figured <hi rend="italic">[E.
                    dentata),</hi> and to that called <hi rend="italic">E. cordata,</hi> the green
                    honey so much esteemed in the Antilles. We are still ignorant of the habits of
                    these insects. In the genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Bombus</hi> (ibid. fig. 29),
                    the species of which we recognise in this country as <hi rend="italic"
                    >humble-bees,</hi> the labrum is transverse, and the proboscis obviously shorter
                    than the body. The second articulation of the labial palpi terminates in a
                    point, bearing the two others on its outer side. There are few associations of
                    our childhood more deep and lasting than those connected with the pursuit and
                    capture of these beautiful creatures, some of which are remarkable for their
                    size, and the rich contrast which they exhibit of velvet black and crimson, with
                    bars of brilliant yellow. This splendid attire, however, saves them not from
                    being rudely handled; and we remember the day when an artificial <hi
                    rend="italic">biηk,</hi> that is, a little box made of clay, with a piece of
                    glass at one end, and a sprinkling of sugar at the other, contained as many
                    captives in proportion to its size, as the black-hole of Calcutta. But the
                    practice of <hi rend="italic">blobbing</hi> was one we never patronized,
                    although we know it is pursued in this country, just as it seems to be, judging
                    from the following quotation, by the youth of the <hi rend="italic">Great

                <p>Be this as it may, the species of the genus Bombus inhabit &gt;ubterra∏ean
                    dwellings, assembled together in social groups amounting to from fifty to sixty
                    individuals, or even in certain cases to between two and three hundred. These
                    unions, owever, differ from those of the honey or garden-bee in this, that they
                    are dissolved, like those of wasps, on the approach of winter. They consist of
                    <hi rend="italic">males,</hi> distinguished by the smallness of their size,
                    their feebler heads, their narrower mandibles, terminated by two dentations, and
                    bearded, as we11 as by their frequent difference of colour; of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jemales,</hi> which are larger than the other individuals, and have
                    spoon-shaped mandibles; and of <hi rend="italic">workers,</hi> of which the
                    mandibles are likewise spoon-shaped, and the size intermediate between the two
                    preceding kinds. Of these workers, Réaumur was the first to distinguish two
                    varieties,-—one comparatively large and strong, the other smaller, but more
                    lively and active. This curious fact was afterwards verified by Huber the
                    younger. According to the observations of the Genevese observer, several of the
                    workers born in spring couple during the month of June with males sprung from a
                    common mother, and soon afterwards deposit eggs, from which, however, males
                    alone are produced. These latter couple with the females which are born towards
                    the end of the season, and which continuing through the winter in a pregnant
                    state, become each the founder of a colony in spring. In the mean time, all the
                    others perish, without excepting even the smaller females. The workers, then,
                    though, in common with those of the garden-bee, often called neuters, are in
                    fact females, but of smaller size than the more regular mothers, and with the
                    productive faculty imperfectly developed. No sooner has the genial influence of
                    spring penetrated the mossy cells where these more ponderous matrons have
                    enjoyed their winter sleep, than they rouse themselves from their repose, and
                    wing their dubious flight in search of the first opening crocus, or other garden
                    flower; or, if remote from man, and destined to boom amid wild uplands or other
                    pastoral wastes, the flowering <hi rend="italic">saughs [Salix</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">caprea),</hi> which so often skirt the edges of our mountain
                    streams, and beautify the crystal waters by the reflection of their golden
                    blossoms, afford them a sufficing food. The lover of nature knows how, even
                    among sterile solitudes, a few bright sunny days call into life and beauty many
                    fragrant flowers, not long unvisited by these glad labourers, who ere long
                    settle in some fit abode, and lay the foundations of a future city.</p>
                <p>The nests of humble-bees are generally formed beneath the earth, and at a depth
                    of one or two feet. Dry plains, fields, sloping banks, and the sides of hills,
                    are their common localities. These subterranean cavities are of considerable
                    extent, wider than high, and in the form of a dome. The ceiling is constructed
                    of earth and carded moss, carried thither fibre by fibre. The inner walls are
                    plastered over by a coating of coarse wax. Sometimes a simple opening serves as
                    a passage to the foot of the nest; sometimes a tortuous road, of one or two feet
                    in length, leads to the habitation. The bottom of the cavity is lined with a
                    layer of leaves, for the reception of the brood. The female first places in it
                    masses of brown irregular wax, called <hi rend="italic">pâtée</hi> by Réaumur,
                    and compared to truffles by that naturalist, on account of their shape and
                    colour. Their cavities arc destined to contain the eggs and larvae. The latter
                    live together in society until such time as they are ready to assume the nympha
                    state; they then separate and spin ovoid silken cocoons, vertically fixed
                    against each other. The nymph is always found in a reversed position, or with
                    the head downwards, like those of the females of the honey-bee; and the cocoons
                    are uniformly pierced at their lower end when the perfect insect escapes from
                    its prison. Réaumur asserted that the larvae fed upon the wax which formed the
                    walls of their habitations; but these, according to Μ. Huber, merely serve as a
                    protection from cold and moisture; and the actual food consists of an ample
