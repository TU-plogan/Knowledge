                    city in the island of Euboea, and the son of Socles; but of his private history
                    we are almost entirely ignorant. It is supposed that Lycophron began to be
                    distinguished in the beginning of the reign of Philadelphus, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 280, and continued to rise in reputation till <hi

                    a period of thirty years. If we be correctly informed respecting the mode in
                    which he acquired the friendship and favour of Ptolemy Philadelphus, who then
                    held his court at Alexandreia, it is not much to the credit of Lycophron. It is
                    said that he owed it to the flattering compliments he contrived to convey to the
                    prince through ingenious anagrams. Thus, from ∏τo- <hi rend="italic"

                    Lycophron is included amongst those seven poets who from their number were
                    called the Pleias. They were all contemporary, and all graced the court of
                    Philadelphus. Their names were, Homerus, Sositheus, Lycophron, Alexander
                    (AEtolus), Philiseus, Sosiphanes or Dionysides, and AEantides. Lycophron was the
                    author of sixty-four, or, according to others, of forty-six, tragedies (Tzetzes
                    <hi rend="italic">adLyc.</hi> p. 270). Suidas gives the names of nineteen of
                    them. They have all however disappeared, and the only fragment of them that has
                    been preserved is a verse of four lines of his tragedy entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Pelopidae,</hi> by Stobaeus. The idea is beautiful, and is
                    expressed with great simplicity. “The unhappy call upon death to relieve them
                    while he is at a distance; but when the last moments of life approach, we are
                    anxious to live. Man is never tired of life.” Lycophron is also said to have
                    been the author of satires, one of which, directed against Menedemus, and where
                    he ridiculed the frugal table of this founder of the Eretrian school, has been
                    particularly mentioned. <hi rend="italic">(Athen,</hi> x. p. 420; xi. p. 55.) He
                    also wrote some books on comedy; but the work which has been preserved, and for
                    which he is best known, is entitled <hi rend="italic">Alexandra</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">Cassandra,</hi> from the daughter of Priam, who had two
                    appellations, like her brother Paris. The poem consists of 1474 lines. Cassandra
                    had acquired by a trick the power of prophecy from Apollo; but, having refused
                    to fulfil her engagement, the god prevented any credit being attached to her
                    words, and caused her to be regarded as mad. She is shut up in a tower by Priam,
                    that she may not alarm the city, and from the summit of the tower she observes
                    the vessel depart which bore Paris to the shores of Greece. This spectacle
                    excites her prophetic powers, and a servant who overhears her words repeats them
                    to Priam. She commences by deploring the fate which she foresees must inevitably
                    overtake her native city, and then proceeds to foretell the various calamities
                    which will arise out of the Trojan war. She first recounts those which will
                    befall Helen, her parents, brothers, and sisters; and then notices the fates of
                    the different Grecian leaders, such as Ajax, Diomede, Menelaus, Agamemnon, and
                    Idomeneus. This causes her to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209301?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9301-0606"/> refer to the numerous wars which had been carried
                    on at various times between the inhabitants of Europe and Asia. She begins with
                    the rape of Io and Europa, and, giving an historical sketch of the Argonauts,
                    the Amazons, the Trojans, Midas, and Xerxes, she brings down her history to the
                    time of Alexander the Great. Besides, there are many episodes scattered
                    throughout the work, such as the Labours of Hercules, the Deluge of Deucalion,
                    the Wanderings of AEneas, and the colony planted in Latium. This work of
                    Lycophron is one of the most obscure which antiquity has handed down to us, and
                    it appears that the author exerted all his ingenuity to render it so. He has
                    succeeded principally by the employment of unusual modes of syntax, of rare and
                    obsolete words, of expressions far removed from the common dialect, of confused
                    metaphors, and of periods so involved that the reader loses himself in a
                    labyrinth of words. There have been many commentaries on the Alexandra, but the
                    best is that by Tzetzes. The best edition is that of Potter (Oxford, 1697,1702),
                    in which the text is accompanied by the scholia of Tzetzes, the remarks of
                    Canter and Meursius, and a valuable index. Reichard (Lip. 1788), rejecting the
                    commentaries of Tzetzes, Meursius, and Potter, published the simple text and
                    notes of Canter, adding a continued paraphrase like that which is found in the
                    editions of the classics ad usum Delphini. The Scholia have been published
                    separately by Müller (3 vols. Lips. 1811), Royston translation.</p>
