                <p><label type="entry">LOTTERY</label>, a kind of public game at hazard, in’order to
                    raise money for the service of the state, being with us appointed by the
                    authority of parliament, and managed by commissioners appointed by the Lords of
                    the Treasury for that purpose. It consists of several numbers of blanks and
                    prizes, which are drawn out of wheels, one of which contains the numbers, and
                    the other the corresponding blanks or prizes.</p>
                <p>The Romans invented lotteries in order to enliven their Saturnalia. This festival
                    began by the distribution of tickets which gained some prize. Augustus made
                    lotteries which consisted of things of little value; but Nero established some
                    for the people, in which a thousand tickets were distributed daily, and several
                    of those who were favoured by fortune got rich by means of them. Heliogabalus
                    invented some very singular ones, in which the prizes were either of great value
                    or of none at all; one gained a prize of six slaves, and another of six flies;
                    some got <hi rend="subscript"> -</hi> valuable vases, and others vessels of
                    common earth.</p>
                <p>The first English lottery which we find mentioned in history was drawn in the
                    year 1569. It consisted of 40,000 lots, at 10s. each lot. The prizes were plate;
                    and the profits were to go towards repairing the havens of the kingdom. It was
                    drawn at the west door of St Paul’s cathedral. The drawing began on the 11th of
                    January 1569, and continued incessantly, day and night, until the 6th day of May
                    following. (Maitland, vol. i. p. 257.) There were then only three
                    lottery-offices in London. The proposals for this lottery were published in the
                    years 1567 and 1568. It was at first intended to have been drawn at the house of
                    Mr Dericke, her majesty’s jeweller; but it was afterwards drawn as above
                    mentioned.</p>
                <p>In 1748, Dr Rawlinson showed the Antiquarian Society “A proposal for a very rich
                    lottery-general without any blankes, contayning a great number of good prizes,
                    as well of redy money as of plate and certain sorts of merchandizes, having been
                    valued and prised by the com- ∣mandment of the queene’s most excellent
                    majestie’s order, to the intent that such commodities as may chance to arise
                    thereof, after the charges borne, may be converted towards the reparations of
                    the havens and strength of the realme, and towards such other public good
                    workes.” He then goes on to say, “The number of lotts shall be foure hundred
                    thousand, and no more; and every lott shall be the summe of tenne shillings
                    sterling, and no more. To be filled by the feast of St Bartholomew. The shew of
                    prizes are to be seen in Cheapside, at the sign of the Queene’s Armes, the house
                    of Mr Dericke, goldsmith, servant to the queene.”</p>
                <p>In the reign of Queen Anne, it was thought necessary to suppress lotteries as
                    public nuisances. Since that time, however, they have been licensed by act of
                    parliament, under a variety of regulations. The act passed in 1778 restrains any
                    person from keeping an office for the sale of tickets, shares, or chances, or
                    for buying, selling, insuring, or registering, without a license; for which
                    license each office-keeper must pay L.50, to continue in force for one year, and
                    the produce to be applied towards defraying the expense of the lottery. And no
                    person is allowed to sell my share or chance less than a sixteenth, on the
                    penalty of L.50. All tickets divided into shares or chances are to be deposited
                    in an office, to be established in London by the commissioners of the Treasury,
                    who are to appoint a person to conduct the business thereof; and all shares are
                    to be stamped by the said officer, who is to give a receipt for every ticket
                    deposited with him. The numbers of all tickets so deposited are to be entered in
                    a book, with the names of the owners, and the number of shares into which they
                    are divided. All tickets deposited in the office are to remain there three days
                    after the drawing. Any person keeping an office, or selling shares, or who shall
                    publish any scheme for receiving moneys in consideration of any interest to be
                    granted in any ticket in the said lottery, without being in possession of such
                    ticket, shall forfeit L.500, and suffer three months imprisonment. No business
                    is to be transacted at any of the offices after eight in the evening, except on
                    the evening of the Saturday preceding the drawing; and no person is to keep any'
                    office for the sale of tickets in Oxford or Cambridge, on penalty of L.20.
                    Before this regulating statute was passed, there were upwards of four hundred
                    lottery - offices in and about London only; but the number for all Britain, as
                    appears by the list published by authority, afterwards amounted to’not more than
                    fifty-one. Subsequently, however, they increased greatly in number.</p>
                <p>Some further regulations to prevent the frauds committed by insurances were made
                    in 1793. In 1808 the reports of a committee of the House of Commons disclosed a
                    dreadful scene of vice and misery brought on by lotteries, and recommended their
                    abolition, or at least that they should be put under other regulations. The
                    gross sum received by government from the lottery was estimated at L.750,000 per
                    annum, of which L.500,000 was for tickets, and the remainder for postages,
                    stamps, &amp;c. At length, lotteries, which had proved eminently prejudicial to
                    public morals, by fostering among the people a propensity to gambling, and
                    which, in a fiscal point of view, had yielded but a trifling amount of revenue
                    to the state, were put an end to by a Treasury minute, which provided, that,
                    from and after the 18th of October 1826, they should cease and determine; and
                    this abolition was accompanied with a prohibitory declaration against all
                    attempts on the part of individuals to revive or continue them in any mode or
                    form whatsoever. Some years ago, however, a bill was brought into parliament for
                    disposing, in this sort of way, of some property in Glasgow; and, as the
                    obnoxious denomination of lottery was carefully excluded, general terms alone
                    being employed in the bill, it accidentally escaped notice, and thus passed into
                    a law. But it is well understood that this took place <hi rend="italic"
                    >per</hi><hi rend="italic">incuriam,</hi> and that any' future attempt of a
                    similar description will certainly prove unsuccessful.</p>
