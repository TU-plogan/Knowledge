                <p><label type="entry">LYSIMACHUS</label>, one of the generals of Alexander, was
                    (Son of Agathocles, one of the king’s body guard, but of noble descent. He
                    appears to have been one of the noblest characters that the age of Alexander, so
                    fertile in great men, produced. He was the pupil of the philosopher
                    Callisthenes, who attended Alexander in his expedition; and when the king
                    ordered Callisthenes to be put to death for some slight offence, by the most
                    cruel tortures, Lysimachus enabled his friend to escape by furnishing him with
                    poison. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Callisthenes.)</hi> It might have been
                    expected that Alexander would have admired such conduct, but it was far
                    otherwise. He ordered Lysimachus to be exposed to the fury of a lion, and that
                    he should suffer a death somewhat resembling that which had been intended for
                    his friend. The bravery of Lysimachus saved him: wrapping his cloak round his
                    arm, he pushed it into the throat of the lion, and laid it dead at his feet.
                    Alexander forgave him, and attached him more particularly to his own I person.
                    This story, which is told by Justin (xv. 3), Pliny (viii. 16), and Seneca <hi
                    rend="italic">{De Ira,</hi> 3, 17, et <hi rend="italic">De Clem.</hi> 1, 25), is
                    <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> called fabulous by Curtius (viii. 1, 22), and is
                    said to have originated from the circumstance of Lysimachus having been attacked
                    by a lion in the forests of Syria, and having ' killed it without assistance.
                    From this moment Alexander treated Lysimaehus as his friend, and was so fond of
                    him, that having accidentally wounded him on the forehead as he was dismounting,
                    he took.off his diadem and bound up his head with his own hands, presaging, as
                    Justin remarks, the royal rank to which he would afterwards attain. History is
                    then silent respecting Lysimachus till the death of Alexander <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 323), when we find him receiving, as his share of
                    the kingdom, Thrace, and the countries placed along the coast of the Euxine
                    (Justin, xiii. 4). But Seuthes occupied Thrace with a powerful army, and it was
                    found necessary to conquer him before he could take possession of the kingdom.
                    In this he was successful, and also in 'repressing a rebellion which had broken
                    out at Callatia, on the coast of the Black Sea (Diodor, xviii. 14; xix. 73). No
                    sooner did he feel secure of his dominions, however, than he began to attack the
                    Odrysae, Getae, and other nations around; but he was defeated and taken
                    prisoner, according to some historians, though, according to others, it was his
                    son. Be this as it may, his daughter was given in marriage to the king of the
                    country for releasing the captive (Pausan. i. ix.). The ambition of Antigonus
                    began to alarm the other successors of Alexander, and a league was entered into
                    by Ptolemy, Cassander, and Lysimachus, to reduce his power within due bounds.
                    The war was carried on with various success for several years. Lysimachus
                    proceeded to Asia <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 302) to attack Antigonus, who
                    was then at Antigonea in Syria, and in his passage subdued Phrygia, Lydia, and
                    other districts, taking possession of many strong fortresses, where Antigonus
                    had collected much treasure. He was joined by Seleucus, who arrived from Babylon
                    with a considerable body of troops, and a decisive battle was fought <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 301) at Ipsus, where Antigonus was defeated and
                    killed (Justin, xv. 4). In addition to Thrace, Lysimachus obtained Bithynia, and
                    some countries along the Hellespont. Yet Demetrius, son of Antigonus, did not
                    lose courage, but made constant attempts to recover his dominions. A league was
                    formed against him by Lysimachus and Pyrrhus king of Epirus, and he was driven
                    from the greater part of Macedonia; but the two allies afterwards disagreed, and
                    Pyrrhus having been defeated, Lysimachus assumed the title of king of Macedonia,
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 286. In his latter years he put to death his son
                    Agathocles, at the suggestion of his second wife, who was afraid that she
                    herself and her children would fall into the hands of Agathocles on the death of
                    Lysimachus. Seleucus, taking advantage of the odium which this act brought upon
                    him, attacked Lysimachus, and having given him battle,</p>
                <p>Lysimachus was killed, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 281 (Pausan. i. x.;
                    Justin, xvii. 1, 2).</p>
