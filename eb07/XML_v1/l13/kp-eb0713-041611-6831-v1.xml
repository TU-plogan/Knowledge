                <p><label type="entry">LOG</label>, in the Jewish antiquities, a measure which
                    contained a quarter of a cab, and consequently five sixths of a pint. There is
                    mention made of a log (2 Kings, vi. 25) under the name of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fourth part of a cab.</hi> But in Leviticus the word log often signifies the
                    measure of oil which lepers were to offer at the temple after they were cured of
                    their disease. Dr Arbuthnot thinks that the log was a measure of liquids, the
                    seventy-second part of the bath or ephah, and*the twelfth part of the hin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Log,</hi> a nautical term, signifying a small piece of
                    timber, of a triangular, sectoral, or quadrantal figure, generally about a
                    quarter of an inch thick, and five or six inches from the angular point to the
                    circumference. It is balanced by a thin plate of lead, nailed to the arch, or
                    circular side, so as to swim perpendicularly in the water.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">LoG-Line,</hi> a little cord or line, fastened to the log by
                    means of two legs, one of which passes through a hole at the corner, and is
                    knotted on the opposite side, whilst the other leg is attached to the arch by a
                    pin fixed into another hole, so as to draw out occasionally. By these legs the
                    log is suspended in equilibrio; and the line thus annexed to it is wound round a
                    reel, fixed for that purpose in the gallery of the ship.</p>
                <p>The use of the log and log-line is to keep account and make an estimate of the
                    ship’s way or distance run, which is done by observing the length of line
                    unwound in half a minute’s time, told by a half-minute glass; for so many knots
                    as run out in that time, so many miles the ship sails in an hour. Thus, if there
                    be four knots veered out in half a minute, the ship is computed to run four
                    miles an hour. The author of this device for measuring the ship’s way is not
                    known; and no mention of it occurs till the year 1607, in an East India voyage
                    published by Purchas; but from that time its name occurs in other voyages
                    amongst his collections, and henceforward it was noticed both by our own authors
                    and by foreigners; as by Gunter in 1623, Snellius in 1624, and by almost all the
                    succeeding writers on navigation.</p>
                <p>The log is a very precarious mode of computation, and must always be corrected by
                    experience, much uncertainty arising from the motions of the ship, the winds of
                    variable force, the friction of the reel, and the lightness of the log in the
                    course of the current. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Navigation.</hi><hi
