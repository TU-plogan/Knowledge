                    celebrated Latin poet, who vas born at Corduba, now Cordova, a city of Baetica,
                    the southern province of Spain, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 38, the year
                    after the accession of the Emperor Caligula. He was the son of Annaeus delà, a
                    Roman knight of considerable reputation, and the &gt;rother of the philosopher
                    Seneca. The young Lucan, edu- ’ ated at Rome in the doctrines of the Stoic
                    philosophy by knnaeus Cornutus, displayed at an early age great poetical <hi
                    rend="superscript"> l</hi> alents. His uncle Seneca, the preceptor of Nero, made
                    im acquainted with that prince, who, admiring his nume-ous acquirements, raised
                    him to the quaestorship before he usual age, loaded him with favours, and even
                    honoured im so far as to enter the lists of literary competition gainst him.
                    Lucan sung the descent of Orpheus to the ιfernal regions, Nero jhe metamorphosis
                    of Niobe; and it <hi rend="italic">i</hi> said that Lucan, forgetful of his
                    duties as a courtier, cared off the palm of victory, and thereby lost the favour
                    of lie emperor (Stat. <hi rend="italic">Silv.</hi> ii. 7, 58). It is impossible
                    to fix ∣ae period when he composed those adulatory verses which isgrace the
                    beginning of the Pharsalia; but, from their tsgusting servility, we might be
                    inclined to suppose that ιey were addressed to a tyrant who was well known and
                    <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> ared. According to an ancient tradition, one of
                    these ftrses had already prepared the emperor to take umbrage I any thing that
                    had the appearance of an insult. Nero i)uinted, and was deeply offended at the
                    verse,</p>
                <p>Unde tuam videas obliquo sidere Romam.</p>
                <p>All these various circumstances excited the wrath of the rant; and when Lucan,
                    having composed a poem on the lrning of Troy and on that of Rome, requested
                    permission it read it at the public theatre, according to the custom of tbse
                    times, this favour was denied him. Such persecution i∣itated the poet, and
                    induced him to join a conspiracy ífâinst the emperor, which was composed of all
                    the best ¢izens of Rome. It was, however, discovered before it add be carried
                    into execution; and many of the conspirais were arrested and put to the torture.
                    It is said that llcan, on promise of his life, denounced his associates, and vrs
                    base enough even to name his own mother.</p>
                <p>Such conduct, however, does not appear to have pro-cred for him forgiveness, as
                    the only favour granted was tie choice of his mode of death. In his last moments
                    Luca recovered his firmness of mind, and, opening his veins iιa warm bath,
                    allowed himself to bleed to death, whilst h is said to have repeated his own
                    description <hi rend="italic">(Pharsali,</hi> iii. 637) of the death-seene of a

                <p>I <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> ucan was the author of many works which have not
                    cijtιe down to us, particularly the Burning of Troy, the Bτning of Rome, the
                    Descent of AEneas to the Infernal Rgions, Ten books of Sylvae, Medeia an
                    imperfect trage- d⅛ and Epistles, one of which, in praise of Calpurnius ⅛, has
                    been preserved; but the work for which he is ∞*t celebrated is his poem entitled
                    <hi rend="italic">Pharsalia,</hi> in ten books, wich he did not live to finish.
                    The subject of the poem is thnwar between Caesar and Pompey, from its
                    commencement to the siege of Alexandria. Lucan adheres closely to chronological
                    order in his narrative, and scarcely deviates from historical truth in his
                    account of the various transactions. From the little scope he allows to his
                    imaginative powers, some critics have thought that Lucan should not be
                    considered as an epic poet, but ranked amongst historians. His poetical merits
                    have in all ages been fiercely contested; some considering him equal to Virgil
                    and Ovid, whilst others have placed him in the lowest rank of poets. The
                    judgment of posterity, however, is without appeal, and it has long stamped the
                    character of the poem as cold and declamatory, notwithstanding that there are
                    many passages full of genuine poetry. The style is by no means uniform, and even
                    the political sentiments of the author vary in different parts of the work. In
                    the first three books his love of freedom is scarcely to be discovered, and
                    every opinion is suppressed which was likely to have offended Nero. In the
                    remainder of the poem, as his hatred increased against Nero, we can trace his
                    aspirations after freedom gradually growing stronger. There seems no good reason
                    for believing that the poet had any great moral end in view, except perhaps that
                    he wished to excite in the breasts of his countrymen a love of freedom, by
                    exhibiting before their eyes the last contest which their ancestors had
                    maintained in its defence. He wished also, perhaps, like the historian Livy, to
                    forget the fearful images of the present, by occupying his mind with, and
                    dwelling on, the past. His want of a glowing imagination and of inventive genius
                    is somewhat counterbalanced by powerful and energetic language, by a disdain of
                    every thing that is mean or grovelling, and by noble thoughts, which are uttered
                    with all the dignified seriousness of a Stoic. There are many editions of this
                    work, but one of the best is that of Burmann (Leyden, 1740), and the last is
                    that by C. F. Weber, in 3 vols., the last of which contains some valuable
                    scholia (Leipzig, 1828).</p>
