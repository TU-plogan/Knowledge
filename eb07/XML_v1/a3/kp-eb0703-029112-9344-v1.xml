                <p><label type="entry">APOSTLE</label> properly signifies a messenger or person sent
                    by another upon some business; and hence, by way of eminence, denotes one of the
                    disciples commissioned by Jesus Christ to preach the gospel.</p>
                <p>Christ selected twelve out of the number of his disciples to be invested with the
                    apostleship. Their names were Simon Peter, Andrew, James the greater, John,
                    Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James the less, Jude, surnamed Lebbeus or
                    Thaddcus, Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot. Of these, Simon, Andrew,
                    James the greater, and John, were fishermen, and Matthew a publican, or receiver
                    of the public revenue; of what profession the rest were we are not told in
                    Scripture, though it is probable they were fishermen.</p>
                <p>Our Lord’s first commission to his apostles was in the third year of his public
                    ministry, about eight months after their solemn election; at which time he sent
                    them out by two and two. They were to make no provision of money for their
                    subsistence in their journey, but to expect it from those to whom they preached.
                    They were to declare that the kingdom of heaven, or the Messiah, was at hand;
                    and to confirm their doctrine by miracles. They were to avoid going either to
                    the Gentiles or to the Samaritans, and to confine their preaching to the people
                    of Israel. In obedience to their Master, the apostles went into all the parts of
                    Palestine inhabited by the Jews, preaching the gospel and working miracles. The
                    evangelical history is silent as to the particular circumstances attending this
                    first preaching of the apostles, and only informs us that they returned and told
                    their Master of all that they had done.</p>
                <p>Their second commission, just before our Lord’s ascension, was of a more
                    extensive and particular nature. They were now not to confine their preaching to
                    the Jews, but to “go and teach <hi rend="smallcaps">all</hi> nations, baptizing
                    them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.”
                    Accordingly they began publicly, after our Lord’s ascension, to exercise the
                    office of their ministry, working-miracles daily in proof of their mission, and
                    making great numbers of converts to the Christian faith. This alarmed the Jewish
                    Sanhedrim; whereupon the apostles were apprehended, and being examined before
                    the high-priest and elders, were commanded not to preach any more in the name of
                    Christ. But this injunction did not terrify them from persisting in the duty of
                    their calling; for they <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099357?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9357-0292"/> continued daily, in the temple, and in private
                    houses, teaching, and preaching the gospel.</p>
                <p>After the apostles had exereised their ministry for , twelve years in Palestine,
                    they resolved to disperse themselves in different parts of the world, and agreed
                    to determine by lot what parts each should take. According to this division, St
                    Peter went into Pontus, Galatia, and other provinces of the Lesser Asia; St
                    Andrew had the vast northern eountries of Scythia and Sogdiana allotted to his
                    portion; St John’s was partly the same with Peter’s, namely, the Lesser Asia; St
                    Philip had the Upper Asia assigned to him, with some parts of Scythia and
                    Colchis; Arabia Felix fell to St Bartholomew’s share; St Matthew preached in
                    Chaldea, Persia, and Parthia; St Thomas preaehed likewise in Parthia, as also to
                    the Hyrcanians, Bactrians, and Indians; St James the less continued in
                    Jerusalem, of whieh ehureh he was bishop; St Simon had for his portion Egypt,
                    Cyrene, Libya, and Mauritania; St Jude, Syria and Mesopotamia; and St Matthias,
                    who was chosen in the room of the traitor Judas, Cappadoeia and Colehis. Thus,
                    by the dispersion of the apostles, Christianity was very early planted in a
                    great many parts of the world. We have but very short and imperfect aceounts of
                    their travels and actions.</p>
                <p>In order to qualify the apostles for the arduous task of converting the world to
                    the Christian religion, they were, in the first place, miraculously enabled to
                    speak the languages of the several nations to whom they were to preach; and, in
                    the second place, were endowed with the power of working miracles, in
                    confirmation of the doetrines they taught; gifts whieh were unnecessary, and
                    therefore ceased, in the after-ages of the ehureh, when Christianity eame to be
                    established by the civil power.</p>
                <p>St Paul is frequently called the <hi rend="italic">apostle</hi> by way of
                    eminenee; and the <hi rend="italic">apostle of the Gentiles,</hi> because his
                    ministry was ehiefly made use of for the conversion of the gentile world, as
                    that of St Peter was for the Jews, who is therefore styled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >apostle of the circumcision.</hi> The several apostles are usually represented
                    with their respective badges or attributes: St Peter with the keys; St Paul with
                    a sword; St Andrew with a cross or saltier; St James minor with a fuller’s pole;
                    St John with a cup, and a winged serpent flying from it; St Bartholomew with a
                    knife; St Philip with a long staff, whose upper end is formed into a cross; St
                    Thomas with a lance; St Matthew with a hatehet; St Matthias with a battle-axe;
                    St James major with a pilgrim’s staff and a gourd bottle; St Simon with a saw;
                    and St Jude with a club.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apostle</hi> was also used among the Jews for a kind of
                    officer anciently sent into the several parts and provinces in their
                    jurisdiction, by way of visitor or commissary, to see that the laws were duly
                    observed, and to receive the monies collected for the reparation of the temple,
                    and the tribute payable to the Romans.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apostle,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Grech liturgy,</hi>
                    is particularly used for a book containing the epistles of St Paul, printed in
                    the order in which they are to be read in ehurches through the course of the
                    year. Another book of the like kind, containing the Gospels, is ealled
                    Euαyyελ∕ov, <hi rend="italic">Gospel.</hi> The Apostle, of late days, has also
                    contained the other canonical epistles, the Acts of the Apostles, and the
                    Revelation. Henee it is also.ealled <hi rend="italic">Acts of the Apostles,</hi>
                    ∏gαξασotfroλog; that being the first book in it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Apostle</hi> is also thought by many to have been the
                    original name for bishops, before the denomination <hi rend="italic">bishop</hi>
                    was appropriated to their order. Thus Theodoret says expressly, the same persons
                    were anciently ealled promiscuously both bishops and presbyters, while those who
                    are now called bishops were ealled <hi rend="italic">apostles.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Apostles’</hi><hi rend="italic">Creed, a</hi> formula or
                    summary of the Christian faith, drawn up, according to Ruffinus, by the apostles
                    themselves, as a rule of faith, and as a <hi rend="italic">word of
                    distinction,</hi> by whieh they were to know friends from foes. Baronius and
                    some other authors conjecture that they did not eompose it till the second year
                    of the reign of Claudius, little before their dispersion. As to their manner of
                    composing it, some fancy that each apostle pronounced his article, whieh is the
                    reason of its being called <hi rend="italic">symbolum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >apostolicum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> it being made up of sentenees jointly
                    contributed, after the manner of persons paying each their club <hi
                    rend="italic">(symbolum)</hi> or share of a reckoning.</p>
                <p>But there are reasons whieh may induce us to question whether the apostles
                    composed any such creed as this. For, first, neither St Luke in the Acts, nor
                    any other ecclesiastical writer before the 5th eentury, makes any mention of an
                    assembly of the apostles in order to the composing of a ereed. Secondly, The
                    fathers of the first three eenturies, in disputing against the heretics,
                    endeavoured to prove that the doctrine contained in this creed was the same
                    whieh the apostles taught; but they never pretend that the apostles composed it.
                    Thirdly, If the apostles had made this creed, it would have been the same in all
                    ehurehes and in all ages; and all authors would have cited it after the same
                    manner. But the case is quite otherwise. In the second and third ages of the
                    church there were as many ereeds as authors, and one and the same author sets
                    down the ereed after a different manner in several places of his works, which is
                    an evidence that there was not at that time any creed whieh was reputed the
                    production of the apostles. In the fourth eentury Ruffinus eompares together the
                    three ancient ereeds of the churches of Aquileia, Rome, and the East, whieh
                    differ very considerably in the terms. Besides, these creeds differed not only
                    in the terms and expressions, but even in the articles, some of whieh were
                    omitted in one or other of them, sueh as those of the <hi rend="italic">descent
                    into hell,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">communion of the saints,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">life everlasting.</hi> From these reasons it may be gathered, that
                    though this creed may be said to be that of the apostles in regard to the
                    doctrines contained therein, yet it is not to be referred to them as the authors
                    and first composers of it. Who was the true author of it, it is not easy to
                    determine, though its great antiquity may be inferred from this, that the whole
                    form, as it now stands in the English liturgy, is to be found in the works of St
                    Ambrose and Ruffinus, both of whom flourished in the fourth century.</p>
