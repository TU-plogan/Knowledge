                <p><label type="entry">ANTIOCH</label>, a city of Syria, in Asia, situated on the
                    river Orontes, in long. 36. 5. E. lat. 36. 10. N. It was built by Seleucus
                    Nicator, founder of the Syro-Maceđo-nian empire, who made it his capital. It
                    stood on the above-mentioned river, about 20 miles from the place where it falls
                    into the Mediterranean, being equally distant from Constantinople and Alexandria
                    in Egypt, that is, about 700 miles from each. Seleucus called it <hi
                    rend="italic">Antioch,</hi> from his father’s name according to some, or from
                    that of his son according to others. He built sixteen other cities bearing the
                    same name, of which one, situated in Pisidia, is probably that where the name of
                    Christians was first given to the followers of Jesus Christ. But that situated
                    on the Orontes by far eclipsed not only all the others of this name, but all the
                    cities built by Seleucus. Antigonus, not long before, had founded a city in that
                    neighbourhood, which from his own name he had called Antigonia, and designed it
                    for the capital of his empire; but it was razed to the ground by Seleucus, who
                    employed the materials in building his metropolis, and also transplanted the
                    inhabitants thither.</p>
                <p>Antioch was afterwards known by the name of Tetrapo-lis, being divided as it were
                    into four cities, each surrounded with its proper wall, besides a common one
                    which inclosed the whole. The first of these cities was built by Seleucus
                    Nicator, as already mentioned; the second by those who flocked thither on its
                    being made the capital of the Syro-Macedonian empire; the third by Seleucus
                    Callinicus; and the fourth by Antiochus Epiphanes. About four or five miles
                    distant stood a place called Daphne, which was nevertheless reckoned a suburb of
                    Antioch. Here Seleucus planted a grove, and in the middle of it built a temple,
                    which he consecrated to Apollo and Diana, making the whole an asylum. To this
                    place the inhabitants of Antioch resorted to indulge in amusements and impure
                    pleasures, by which it became at last so infamous, that “to live after the
                    manner of Daphne” was used as a proverb to express-the most voluptuous and
                    dissolute life.</p>
                <p>Though Antioch continued to be, as Pliny calls it, ⅛e queen of the East, for near
                    1600 years, yet scarcely any city mentioned in history has undergone such
                    calamities, both from the attacks of its enemies, and its being in a remarkable
                    degree subject to earthquakes. The first disaster mentioned in history which
                    befell the Antiochians happened about 145 years before Christ. Being at that
                    time very much disaffected to the person and government of Deme, trius their
                    king, they were continually raising tumults and seditions. Wearied with their
                    turbulence, he at last solicited assistance from the Jews, and was furnished by
                    Jonathan, one of the Maccabees, with 3000 men. With this reinforcement believing
                    himsclf sufficiently strong to reduce the mutineers by force, he ordered them
                    immediately to deliver up their arms. This unexpected order caused a great
                    uproar in the city. The inhabitants ran to arms and invested the king’s palace,
                    to the number of 120,000, with a design to put him to death. All the Jews
                    hastened to his relief, fell upon the rebels, killed 100,000 of them, and set
                    fire to the city. On the destruction of the Syrian empire by the Romans, Antioch
                    submitted to them, and continued for a long time under their dominion. About the
                    year 115, in the reign of the emperor Trajan, it was almost entirely'ruined by
                    one of the most dreadful earthquakes mentioned in history. Trajan himself
                    happened to be there at the time, on his return from an expedition against the
                    Parthians; so that the city was then full of troops and strangers from all
                    quarters, either out of curiosity or upon business and embassies. The calamity
                    was consequently felt almost in every province of the Roman empire. The
                    earthquake was preceded by violent claps of thunder, unusual winds, and a
                    dreadful noise under ground. The shock was so terrible, that great numbers of
                    houses were overturned, and others tossed to and fro like a ship at sea. Those
                    who happened to be in their houses were for the most part buried under their
                    ruins; those who were walking in the streets or in the squares were, by the
                    violence of the shock, dashed to the ground, and most of them either killed or
                    dangerously wounded. The earthquake continued, with some small intermission, for
                    several days and nights. Trajan was much hurt, but escaped through a window. As
                    an eyewitness of this terrible calamity, he would very probably contribute
                    largely towards the re-establishment of Antioch in its ancient splendour. Its
                    good fortune, however, did not continue long; for in 155 it was almost entirely
                    burnt by accidental fire, when it was again restored by Antoninus Pius.</p>
                <p>When the Roman empire began to decline, Antioch became a bone of contention
                    between it and the eastern nations; and accordingly, on the breaking out of a
                    Persian war, it was almost always sure to suffer. In 242 it was taken and
                    plundered by Sapor; and though he was defeated by Gordian, it underwent the same
                    misfortune in the time of Valerian, about 18 years after; and subsequently to
                    the defeat and captivity of Valerian, being taken by the Persian monarch a third
                    time, he not only plundered it, but levelled all the public buildings with the
                    ground. The Persians, however, being soon driven out, this unfortunate city
                    continued free from any remarkable calamity till about the time of the division
                    of the Roman empire by Constantine in 331. It was then afflicted with so
                    terrible a famine, that a bushel of wheat was sold for 400 pieces of silver.
                    During this grievous distress, Constantine sent to the bishop 30,000 bushels of
                    corn, besides an immense quantity of all kinds of provisions, to be distributed
                    among the ecclesiastics, widows, orphans, &amp;c. In the year 347 Constantine
                    II. caused a harbour to be made at Seleucia, for the conveniency of Antioch.
                    This was effected at great expense; the mouth of the Orontes, where the <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193098850?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-8850-0253"/>
                    port was made, being full of sands and rocks. When the 'emperor Julian set out
                    on his expedition against the Persians, he made a long stay at Antioch, which
                    then suffered severely from a famine. In 381, in the reign of Theodosius the
                    Great, Antioch was again visited by a famine, aeeompanied by a grievous plague.
                    In 387 Theodosius, finding his exchequer quite drained, and being obliged to be
                    at an extraordinary expense in celebrating the fifth year of the reign of his
                    son Arcadius, and the tenth of his own, an extraordinary tax was laid upon all
                    the people in the empire. Most of the cities submitted willingly to this; but
                    the people of Antioch assailed their governor, broke some of the emperor’s
                    statues, and dragged others through the city, uttering the most injurious and
                    abusive expressions against him and his whole family. They were dispersed by a
                    body of archers, and the governor proceeded against the offenders with the
                    utmost cruelty, exposing some to wild beasts in the theatre, and burning others
                    alive. Many fled from the city and never returned. On hearing the news of the
                    tumult, Theodosius was so much enraged that he commanded the city to be
                    destroyed, and its inhabitants to be put to the sword without distinction; but
                    this order was revoked before it could be put into execution, and he contented
                    himself with inflicting severe punishments on individuals. In the year 458
                    Antioeh was again almost entirely ruined by an earthquake, which happened on the
                    14th of September; scarcely a single house being left standing in the most
                    beautiful quarter of the city. It experienced a similar misfortune in 529,
                    during the reign of the emperor Justin; and in 15 years after, being taken by
                    Chosroes, king of Persia, that insulting and haughty monarch gave it up to his
                    soldiers, who put all they met to the sword. The king himself seized on all the
                    gold and silver vessels belonging to the great church, and caused all the
                    valuable statues, pictures, &amp;c. to be taken down and conveyed to Persia,
                    while his soldiers carried off every thing else. The city being completely
                    plundered, he ordered his men to set fire to it; and this was done so
                    effectually, that none of the buildings even without the walls escaped. Such of
                    the inhabitants as escaped slaughter were carried into Persia and sold as
                    slaves. The city, however, was again restored, but in a short time underwent its
                    usual fate, being almost entirely destroyed by an earthquake in 587, by which
                    30,000 persons lost their lives. In 634 it fell into the hands of the Saracens,
                    who kept possession of it till the year 858, when it was surprised by one
                    Burtzas, and again annexed to the Roman empire. The Romans continued masters of
                    it for some time, till the civil dissensions in the empire gave the Turks an
                    opportunity of mastering it, as well as the whole kingdom of Syria. From them it
                    was again taken by the crusaders in 1098. In 1262 it was again taken by Bibaris,
                    sultan of Egypt, who put a final period to its glory.</p>
                <p>Antioch, called by the Arabs <hi rend="italic">Antahia,</hi> is now a ruinous
                    town, whose houses, built with mud and straw, and narrow and miry streets,
                    exhibit every appearance of misery and wretchedness. These houses are situated
                    on the southern bank of the Orontes, at the extremity of an old decayed bridge:
                    they are covered to the south by a mountain, upon the slope of which is a wall
                    built by the crusaders. The distance between the present town and this mountain
                    may be about 400 yards, which space is occupied by gardens and heaps of rubbish,
                    but presents nothing interesting. Antioch was better calculated than Aleppo to
                    be the emporium of the Europeans. By clearing the mouth of the Orontes, which is
                    six leagues lower down, oats might have been towed up that river, though they
                    could n at have sailed up, as Pococke has asserted, its current being too rapid.
                    The natives, who never knew the name Orontes, call it, on account of the
                    swiftness of its stream, <hi rend="italic">El Aasi,</hi> that is, the rebel. Its
                    breadth at Antioch is about forty paces. Seven leagues above that town it passes
                    by a lake abounding in fish, and especially in eels. A great quantity of these
                    are salted every year, but not sufficient for the numerous fasts of the Greek
                    Christians. The plain of Antioch, though the soil of it is excellent, is
                    uncultivated, and abandoned to the Turcomans; but the hills on the side of the
                    Orontes, particularly opposite Serkin, abound in plantations of figs and olives,
                    vines and mulberry trees. Seleucus Nicator, who founded Antioch, built also at
                    the mouth of the Orontes, on the northern bank, a large and well-fortified city,
                    which bore his name, but of which at present not a single habitation remains;
                    nothing is to be seen but heaps of rubbish, and works in the adjacent rock,
                    which prove that this was once a place of very considerable importance. In the
                    sea also may be perceived the traces of two piers, which are indications of an
                    ancient port, now choked up. The inhabitants of the country go thither to fish,
                    and call the place <hi rend="italic">Souaidia.</hi> Antioch is situate in long.
