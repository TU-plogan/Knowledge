                    chief town of a district or government of the same name, in Persia, situated on
                    a large lake, also of the same name, in the province of Azerbijan. It is an
                    ancient city, which, according to Sir Robert K. Porter, once bore the name of
                    Thebarma; and is mentioned as a place of some consequence by Strabo. It is
                    surrounded with walls and towers, which are at present in a very ruinous state,
                    though, with a shallow ditch, they constitute its only means of defence. It is,
                    however, beautifully situated amidst the most extensive and luxuriant gardens,
                    producing almost every European and Asiatic fruit in the greatest plenty and
                    perfection. The town contains, according to Frazer, about 20,000 inhabitants,
                    who are of disorderly habits, being mostly the immediate retainers of chiefs
                    who, having their property in the neighbourhood, reside in large palaces within
                    the town. The latter have constant feuds with each other, in which their
                    retainers take part; and the governor, who is a chief of the Affshar tribe,
                    being quite unable to restrain them, more murders are committed in the town of
                    Ouroomia than in any other city of Persia. It is sixty miles west of Tabreez.

                    water, about 100 miles in length, stretching nearly north and south, and about
                    forty miles in breadth. It is surrounded by picturesque mountains, and valleys
                    which are fertile and well filled with villages. It lies to the south-east of
                    Koiy, at no great distance from the city; and is generally considered as the
                    Spauto and Marcianus of Strabo and Ptolemy. Its waters, like those ofthe%ea,
                    appear of a dark blue colour, streaked with green, according as the light falls
                    on them; they are perfectly clear, and intensely salt. According to an
                    experiment by the late Mr Brown, they were found to contain one third more salt
                    than the sea. A great quantity of salt is also deposited on the shores, and on
                    the bottom, which is seen fora considerable distance, from the clearness of the
                    water. In some places there is an incrustation of salt towards the margin, from
                    under which, when broken, thick concentrated brine rushes out; and the
                    deposition of salt and saline efflorescence extends in some places many hundred
                    yards from the water’s edge, encircling it with a belt of glittering white. No
                    fish or living thing, says Frazer, as far as is known, has been found in this
                    fine lake. Within the last twelve or fourteen years, the same traveller was
                    informed that the watershad gone back, and left the shore dry, in some places,
                    to a distance of full 500 yards. From the village of Sheraff-Khaneh, built upon
                    a bank once overhanging the water, it has retired, leaving a mud beach, covered
                    with salt or saline efflorescence, of many hundred yards in breadth. A finer
                    subject for inland navigation than this lake and its tributary streams can
                    scarcely be conceived. The country fromTa-breez to its bank is level, and the
                    river Adjai, which passes the town, could easily be converted into a canal, or
                    made to feed one; and by this channel the valuable produce of all the districts
                    around the lake ofOuroomia might be brought to the capital at a trifling
                    expense. But the spirit of enterprise in Persia is broken under the influence of
                    a despotic andunstable government; and hence it is in vain to expect that
                    capital will ever be employed in any useful improvement. So little disposition
                    is there to take advantage of thislake for inland navigation, that thereis not a
                    single boat upon it. There were formerly two; but one was wrecked, with the loss
                    of eight men, and the other was allowed to rot. The district or government of
                    Ouroomia contains, according to Frazer, 400, and to Sir Robert K. Porter, 700
                    villages. It has been ruled by the present governor and his family for 200
                    years. Its revenue amounted for twenty-five years to 7000 tomaums, or about L.
                    15,000 annually. But since the rivalry of certain noblemen with each other for
                    the government, it has been increased to L.100,000, which is wrung from the poor
                    peasantry by the most cruel extortion.</p>
