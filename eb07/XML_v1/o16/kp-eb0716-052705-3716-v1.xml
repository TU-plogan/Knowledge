                <p><label type="entry">ORESTES</label>, the only son of Agamemnon and Clytemnestra,
                    was seven years old at the period of his father’s murder, when he was saved by
                    his sister Electra, who sent him secretly to Strophius, prince of Phocis, who
                    had married the sister of Agamemnon. Here he was educated with Pylades the son
                    of Strophius, and afterwards proceeded to Athens. Eight years after the murder
                    of his father he returned to Mycenae, and, with the assistance of Pylades and
                    Electra, put to death AEgisthus and Clytemnestra (Hom. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Od.</hi> i. 298; iii. 303-310; Hygin. 117). For this barbarous deed he was
                    brought to trial, but was allowed to escape on account of his father. Tyndareus,
                    father of Clytemnestra, was his accuser (Hygin. 119), or, according to another
                    tradition, Perilaus, son of Icarius, and cousin of Clytemnestra (Paus, viii. 33,
                    2). He fled to Epirus, and there founded the city Argos Oresticon; but the
                    district of Orestias is more properly in Macedonia (Strab. vii. 326). Suffering
                    extremely from the stings of his conscience, he consulted the oracle of Delphi
                    how he might best expiate his crime, when he was commanded to proceed to Tauris
                    and to bring back the statue of Artemis or Diana Tauropolos. There was a law in
                    that country that all strangers should be sacrificed to the goddess; and when
                    Orestes and Pylades were found by some shepherds, they were brought to Thoas,
                    king of Tauris, who ordered them to be delivered up to the priestess of Artemis,
                    that they might be sacrificed. Iphigenia, the sister of Orestes, had been
                    rescued from the altar when she was on the point of being sacrificed by orders
                    of her father, and transferred by Artemis to be priestess in her temple in
                    Tauris. Iphigenia <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563729?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-3729-0528"/> discovered on inquiry that the strangers were her
                    own brother and his friend, and assisted them in carrying off the statue (Hygin.
                    120). Upon their return they are said to have passed through Cappadocia, and to
                    have instituted the worship of Artemis or Diana at Comcna and Casta-bela (Strab.
                    xii. 535, 537). Another tradition made him be expiated by the Troezenian (Paus.
                    ii. 31, 11). On the death of Menelaus, Orestes became king of Lacedaemon; andon
                    the failure of the royal line of Megephenthes at r∖rgos, he annexed that city to
                    Mycenae. He also acquired a great part of Arcadia, and was assisted by the
                    Phocians (ii. 18, 5). In the latter part of his life he retired to Arcadia, and
                    probably died by the bite of a serpent (Schol. Lycoph.) at Megea, whence his
                    bones were afterwards transferred, in the reign of Anaxandrides, to Sparta (iii.
                    11, 8; Herodot. i. 67). He was married to Hermione, daughter of Menelaus and
                    Helen, by whom he had Tisa-menos, who succeeded him (Hygin. 122); and by
                    Erigone, daughter of AEgisthus and Clytemnestra, he had Penthilus (Schol.
                    Lycoph. 1374).</p>
