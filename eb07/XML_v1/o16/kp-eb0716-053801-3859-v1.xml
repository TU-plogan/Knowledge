                <p><label type="entry">ORISSA</label>, an extensive province of Hindustan, in the
                    Deccan, between the sixteenth and twenty-third degrees of north latitude. It has
                    Bengal for its boundary to the north, to the south the river Godavery, to the
                    east the Bay of Bengal, and to the west the province of Gundwana. It may be
                    estimated from north-east to southwest at 530 miles in length by ninety in
                    average breadth. Orissa was formerly an independent Hindu kingdom. It was first
                    conquered by the Afghans, and afterwards by the Moguls towards the end of the
                    sixteenth century. It was in ancient times divided into five districts, namely,
                    1. Jella-sir, comprising Midnapoor and the British possessions lying north and
                    east of the river Subunrceka; 2. Buddruck (now Cuttack); 3. Cuttack; 4. Kulling
                    or Cicacole; and, 5. Rajamundry. The principal modern subdivisions of this
                    extensive province, independently of other petty states and large zemindaries,
                    are, 1. Singhboom; 2. Kunjeur; 3. Mohurbunge; 4. Balasore; 5. Cuttack; 6.
                    Khoordah.</p>
                <p>This province, in the interior, is of a rude and barbarous aspect, consisting for
                    the most part of rugged hills, uninhabited jungles, and deep water-courses. It
                    is surrounded by pathless deserts, forests, or valleys; and the atmosphere is
                    pestilential. There are only two passes in the great mountainous ridge that
                    extends from the Godavery to the Mahanuddy; the one direct, from Chandah to
                    Cicacole; the other oblique, from Choteesghur by the way of Kaluhindi, and both
                    uniting at the pass of Saloor or Saure-acca. But though Orissa is, generally
                    speaking, a barren country, the south-eastern or maritime parts are equal in
                    fertility to most parts of India.</p>
                <p>At present the British rule over nearly one half of this extensive region, and
                    the remaining part is possessed by tributary zemindars, called ghurjauts or
                    hill-chiefs, who pay a fixed rent to the British, under whose jurisdiction they
                    live. The woody and interior division of the country belongs to them; whilst the
                    other division, belonging to the British, comprehends all the low lands
                    extending along the coast, a tract generally plain and fertile, but not well
                    cultivated or peopled. But the country occupied by the natives, though a barren
                    tract of rock, forest, and jungle, and thinly inhabited, produces a surplus of
                    grain beyond the consumption of its inhabitants. The British portion of the
                    country produces, as its chief staples, rice and salt, the former of which is an
                    article of export. Every sort of grain and vetch is cultivated, and the country
                    is improving under its present administration; whilst the portion that is still
                    under its native chiefs presents a scene of oppression and decay. The low lands
                    along the Bay of Bengal abound with wild animals, such as hogs, deer, tigers,
                    and jackalls; and the high lands are infested by such numbers of wild animals,
                    that in many places they are regaining possession of the country from which they
                    were driven by the progress of cultivation. Fish swarm in the rivers, which are
                    also infested with reptiles and alligators; andin the plains and junglesare
                    innumerable noxious insects. The chief rivers are the Godavery, Mahanuddy,
                    Byturnee, and Subunreeka, besides innumerable mountain streams of a short
                    course.</p>
                <p>The country between the rivers Gaintee and Bamoni is peculiarly fertile, and is
                    inhabited by an industrious class of persons, weavers, chiefly of coarse muslins
                    for turbans, and sanaes, which are a staple manufacture. The districts to the
                    west of Bengal are mountainous, and inhabited by a savage race of Hindus, who
                    are still called Oureas. They <hi rend="italic">go</hi> nearly naked, and are
                    armed with bows and arrows, and are nominally subject to the Mahrattas, though
                    they pay but little revenue. They are naturally a fierce people, possessing
                    personal courage in a great degree. They arc great enemies of the Mahrattas, who
                    plunder and oppress them; but those under the British dominion are a mild and
                    tractable people, and the palanquin-bearers in Calcutta are mostly from that
                    country. These bearers have high and proud notions: they pretend to be of a
                    higher caste than the bearers from Bahar, and are very fastidious about
                    performing their duties.</p>
                <p>In the ancient history of the Hindus, Utcala or Odra-desa, implying the great or
                    famous country of Cala, was nearly co-extensive with the modern Orissa; but the
                    martial race by whom it was inhabited were at last extirpated by the karnas or
                    kings of Magadha. A race of Hindu princes governed the country in 1592, and were
                    conquered by the viceroy of Akbar, to whose dominion the country was annexed as
                    a dependent government. It then measured 600 miles along the sea coast by forty
                    in medium breadth, extending from Tumlook on the banks of the Great Ganges, to
                    Rajamundry on the Lesser Ganges; and was inhabited by the 0ureas, a race of
                    Hindus, of peculiar and distinct language, manners, and religion. From
                    disjointed fragments of its history, and from existing relics, it appears to
                    have been a flourishing empire, even before the Mahommedan invasion; but it soon
                    afterwards fell into decay. When the Afghans were expelled from Bengal by the
                    Moguls in the sixteenth century, they took refuge in Orissa, and retained
                    possession of part of it, including the celebrated temple of Juggernaut, till
                    near tire year 1615. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.)</hi></p>
