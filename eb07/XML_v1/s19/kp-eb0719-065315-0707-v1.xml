                    born at Rotherham, in Yorkshire, on the 19th of September 1587. He was descended
                    of an ancient family, and attended the grammar-school at Rotherham, where he
                    made such wonderful proficiency in the languages, that at thirteen it was judged
                    proper to send him to Lincoln College, Oxford. In 1608 he was appointed logic
                    reader in the same college. He took orders in 1611, and was promoted
                    successively to several benefices. Archbishop Laud recommended him to Charles I.
                    as a profound casuist; and that monarch, who seems to have been a great admirer
                    of casuistical learning, appointed him one of his chaplains in 1631. Charles
                    proposed several cases of conscience to him, and received so great satisfaction
                    from his answers, that at the end of his month’s attendance he told him that he
                    would wait with impatience during the intervening eleven months, as he was
                    resolved to be more intimately acquainted with him, when it would again be his
                    turn to officiate. The king regularly attended his sermons, and was wont to say
                    that he “carried his ears to hear other preachers, but his conscience to hear Mr
                    Saunderson.”</p>
                <p>In 1642 Charles created him regius professor of divinity at Oxford, with the
                    canonry of Christ Church annexed. But the civil wars prevented him until 1646
                    from entering on the office; and in 1648 he was ejected by the visitors which
                    the parliament had commissioned. He must have stood high in the public opinion;
                    for in the same year in which he was appointed professor of divinity, both
                    houses of parliament recommended him to the king as one of their trustees for
                    settling the affairs of the church. The king, too, reposed great confidence in
                    his judgment, and frequently consulted him about the state of his affairs. When
                    the parliament proposed the abolition of the episcopal form of church
                    government, as incompatible with monarchy, Charles desired him to take the
                    subject under his consideration, and deliver his opinion. He accordingly wrote a
                    treatise entitled Episcopacy, as established by Law in England, not prejudicial
                    to Regal Power. At taking leave, the king advised him to publish Cases of
                    Conscience. He replied that “he was now grown old, and unfit to write cases of
                    conscience.” The king said, “It was the simplest thing he had ever heard from
                    him; for no young man was fit to be a judge, or write cases of conscience.”
                    Walton, who wrote the life of Dr Saunderson, informs us, that in one of these
                    conferences the king told Saunderson, or one of the rest who was then in
                    company, that “the remembrance of two errors did much affect him, which were his
                    assent to the Earl of Strafford’s death, and the abolishing of Episcopacy in
                    Scotland; and that if God ever restored him to the peaceable possession of his
                    crown, he would prove his repentance by a public confession and a voluntary
                    penance, by walking barefoot from the Tower of London, or Whitehall, to St
                    Paul's Church, and would desire the people to intercede with God for his
                    pardon.”</p>
                <p>Dr Saunderson was taken prisoner by the parliament’s troops, and conveyed to
                    Lincoln, in order to procure in exchange a Puritan divine named Clark, whom the
                    king’s army had taken. The exchange was agreed to, on condition that Dr
                    Saunderson’s living should be restored, and his person and property remain
                    unmolested. The first of these demands was readily complied with; and a
                    stipulation was made, that the second should be observed; but it was impossible
                    to restrain the licentiousness of the soldiers. They entered his church in the
                    time of divine service, interrupted him when reading prayers, and even had the
                    audacity to take the common-prayer book from him, and to tear it to pieces.</p>
                <p>Mr Boyle, having read a work of Dr Saunderson’s, entitled <hi rend="italic">De
                    Juramenti Obligatione,</hi> was so much pleased that he inquired at Bishop
                    Barlow, whether he thought that it was possible to prevail on the author to
                    write Cases of Conscience, if an honorary pension was assigned him to enable him
                    to purchase books and pay an amanuensis. Saunderson told Barlow, “that if any
                    future tract of his could be of any use to mankind, he would cheerfully set
                    about it without a pension.” Boyle, however, sent him a present of L.50,
                    sensible, no doubt, that, like the other royalists, his finances could not be
                    great. Upon this Dr Saunderson published his book <hi rend="italic">De
                    Conscientia.</hi></p>
                <p>When Charles II. was reinstated in the throne, he recovered his professorship and
                    canonry, and soon afterwards was promoted to the bishopric of Lincoln. During
                    the two years and a half in which he possessed this new office, he spent a
                    considerable sum in augmenting poor vicarages, and in repairing the palace at
                    Budgen. He died on the 29th of January 1662-63, in his seventy-sixth year.</p>
                <p>He was a man of great acuteness and solid judgment. “That staid and well-weighed
                    man Dr Saunderson,” says Dr Hammond, “conceives all things deliberately, dwells
                    upon them discreetly, discerns things that differ exactly, passeth his judgment
                    rationally, and expresses it aptly, clearly, and honestly.” Being asked, what
                    books he had read most, he replied, that “he did not read many books, but those
                    which he did read were well chosen and frequently perused.” These, he said, were
                    chiefly three, Aristotle’s Rhetoric, Aquinas’s <hi rend="italic">Secunda
                    Secundae,</hi> and Cicero’s works, especially his Offices, which he had not read
                    over less than twenty times, and could even, in his old age, recite without
                    book.” He added, that “the learned civilian Dr Zouch had written <hi
                    rend="italic">Elementa Jurisprudentia,</hi> which he thought he could also say
                    without book, and that no wise man could read it too often.” He was not only
                    conversant with the fathers and schoolmen, with casuistical and controversial
                    divinity, but he was well acquainted with all the histories of the English
                    nation, was a great antiquary, had searched minutely into records, and was well
                    skilled in heraldry and genealogy.</p>
                <p>It will now be proper here to give a short account of his works. 1. In 1615 he
                    published <hi rend="italic">Logicae Artis compendium,</hi> which was the system
                    of lectures he had delivered in the university when he was logic reader; 2.
                    Sermons, amounting in number to thirty-six, printed in 1681, folio, with the
                    author’s life by Walton; 3. Nine Cases of Conscience resolved, first collected
                    in one volume in 1678, 8vo; 4. <hi rend="italic">De Juramenti Obligatione,</hi>
                    which was translated into English by Charles I. while a prisoner in the Isle of
                    Wight, and printed at London in 1665, in 8vo; 5. <hi rend="italic">De
                    Obligatione conscientia;</hi> 6. Censure of Mr Antony Ascham his book of the
                    confusions and revolutions of government; 7. <hi rend="italic">Pax
                    Ecclesia,</hi> concerning Predestination, or the five points; 8. Episcopacy, as
                    established by Law in England, not prejudicial to the Regal Power, in 1661.
                    Besides these, he wrote two Discourses in defence of Usher’s writings.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Saunderson,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr Nicholas,</hi> was born
                    at Thurlstone, in Yorkshire, in 1682, and may be considered as a prodigy for his
                    application and success in mathematical literature, in circumstances apparently
                    the most unfavourable. He lost his sight by the small-pox before he was a year
                    old. But this disaster did not prevent him from searching after that knowledge
                    for which nature had given him so ardent a desire. He was initiated into the
                    Greek and Roman authors at a free school at Penniston. After spending some years
                    in the study of the languages, his father, who had a place in the excise, began
                    to teach him the common rules of arithmetic. But he soon surpassed his father,
                    and could make long and difficult calculations without having any sensible marks
                    to assist his memory. At eighteen he was taught the principles of algebra and of
                    geometry by Mr Richard West of Undoorbank, who, though a gentleman of fortune,
                    yet, being strongly attached to mathematical learning, readily undertook the
                    education of so uncommon a genius. Saunderson was also assisted in his
                    mathematical studies by Dr Nettleton. These two gentlemen read<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=709" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0709-0655"/>
                    books to him and explained them. He was next sent to a private academy at
                    Attercliff near Sheffield, where logic and metaphysics were chiefly taught. But
                    these sciences not suiting his turn of mind, he soon left the academy. He lived
                    for some time in the country without any instructor; but such was the vigour of
                    his own mind, that few instructions were necessary. He only required books and a
                    reader.</p>
                <p>His father, besides the place he had in the excise, possessed also a small
                    estate; but having a numerous family to support, he was unable to give him a
                    libcral education at one of the universities. Some of his friends, who had
                    remarked his perspicuous and interesting manner of communicating his ideas,
                    proposed that he should attend the university of Cambridge as a teacher of
                    mathematics. This proposal was immediately put in execution, and he was
                    accordingly conducted to Cambridge in his twenty-fifth year, by Mr Joshua Dunn,
                    a fellow-commoner of Christ’s College. Though he was not received as a member of
                    the college, he was treated with great attention and respect. He was allowed a
                    chamber, and had free access to the library. Mr Whiston was at that time
                    professor of mathematics, and as he read lectures in the way that Saunderson
                    intended, it was naturally to be supposed he would view his project as an
                    invasion of his office. But, instead of meditating any opposition, the plan was
                    no sooner mentioned to him than he gave his consent to it. Saunderson’s
                    reputation was soon spread throughout the university. When his lectures were
                    announced, a general curiosity was excited to hear such intricate mathematical
                    subjects explained by a man who had been blind from his infancy. The subject of
                    his lectures was the <hi rend="italic">Principia Mathematica,</hi> the Optics,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">Arithmetica Universalis,</hi> of Sir Isaac Newton. He
                    was accordingly attended by a very numerous audience. It will appear at first
                    incredible to many that a blind man should be capable of explaining optics,
                    which requires an accurate knowledge of the nature of light and colours; but we
                    must recollect that the theory of vision is taught entirely by lines, and is
                    subject to the rules of geometry.</p>
                <p>While thus employed in explaining the principles of the Newtonian philosophy, he
                    became known to its illustrious author. He was also intimately acquainted with
                    Halley, Cotes, Demoivre, and other eminent mathematicians. When Whiston was
                    removed from his professorship, Saunderson was universally allowed to be the man
                    best qualified for the succession. But to enjoy this office it was necessary, as
                    the statutes direct, that he should be promoted to a degree. To obtain this
                    privilege, the heads of the university applied to their chancellor the Duke of
                    Somerset, who procured the royal mandate to confer upon him the degree of master
                    of arts. He was then elected Lucasian professor of mathematics in November 1711.
                    His inauguration speech was composed in classical Latin, and in the style of
                    Cicero, with whose works he had been much conversant. He now devoted his whole
                    time to his lectures and the instruction of his pupils. In 1728, when George II.
                    visited the university of Cambridge, he expressed a desire to see Professor
                    Saunderson. In compliance with this desire, he waited upon his majesty in the
                    senate-house, and was there, by the king’s command, created doctor of laws. He
                    was admitted a member of the Royal Society in 1736.</p>
                <p>Saunderson was naturally of a vigorous constitution, but having confined himself
                    to a sedentary life, he at length became scorbutic. For several years he felt a
                    numbness in his limbs, which in the spring of 1739 brought on a mortification in
                    his foot; and, unfortunately, his blood was so vitiated by the scurvy, that
                    assistance from medicine was not to be expected. When he was informed that his
                    death was near, he remained for a little space calm and silent; but he soon
                    recovered his former vivacity, and conversed with his usual ease. He died on the
                    19th of April</p>
                <p>1739, in the fifty-seventh year of his age, and was buried at his own request in
                    the chancel at Boxworth. He married the daughter of Mr Dickens, rector of
                    Boxworth, in Cambridgeshire, and by her had a son and a daughter.</p>
                <p>Dr Saunderson was rather to be admired as a man of wonderful genius and
                    assiduity, than to be loved for his amiable qualities. He spoke his sentiments
                    freely of characters, and praised or condemned his friends as well as his
                    enemies without reserve. This has been ascribed by some to a love of defamation;
                    but it has with more propriety been attributed by others to an inflexible love
                    of truth, which urged him upon all occasions to speak the sentiments of his mind
                    without disguise, and without considering whether this conduct would please, or
                    the reverse. His sentiments were supposed to be unfavourable to revealed
                    religion. It is said that he alleged he could not know God, because he was
                    blind, and could not see his works; and that upon this Dr Holmes replied, “Lay
                    your hand upon yourself, and the organization which you will feel in your own
                    body will dissipate so gross an error.” On the other hand, we are informed that
                    he had desired the sacrament to be given him on the evening before his death. He
                    was however seized with a delirium, which rendered this impossible.</p>
                <p>He wrote a system of algebra, which was published in two volumes 4to, at London,
                    after his death, in the year</p>
                <p>1740, at the expense of the university of Cambridge.</p>
                <p>Dr Saunderson had invented for his own use a Palpable Arithmetic, that is, a
                    method of performing operations in arithmetic solely by the sense of touch. It
                    consisted of a table raised upon a small frame, so that he could apply his hands
                    with equal case above and below. On this table were drawn a great number of
                    parallel lines, which were crossed by others at right angles; the edges of the
                    table were divided by notches half an inch distant from one another, and between
                    each notch there were five parallels, so that every square inch was divided into
                    a hundred little squares. At each angle of the squares where the parallels
                    intersected one another, a hole was made quite through the table; and in each
                    hole were placed two pins, a large and a small one. It was by the various
                    arrangements of the pins that Saunderson performed his operations.</p>
                <p>His sense of touch was so perfect that he could discover with the greatest
                    exactness the slightest inequality of surface, and could distinguish in the most
                    finished works the smallest oversight in the polish. In the cabinet of medals at
                    Cambridge he could single out the Roman medals with the utmost correctness; and
                    he could also perceive the slightest variation in the atmosphere. One day, while
                    some gentlemen were making observations on the sun, he took notice of every
                    little cloud that passed over his disk and served to interrupt their labours.
                    When any object passed before his face, even though at some distance, he
                    discovered it, and could guess its size with considcrable accuracy. When he
                    walked, he knew when he passed by a tree, a wall, or a house. He had made these
                    distinctions from the different ways his face was affected by the motion of the
                    air.</p>
                <p>His musical ear was so remarkably acute, that he could distinguish accurately to
                    the fifth of a note. In his youth he had been a performer on the flute, and he
                    had made such proficiency, that if he had cultivated his talents in this way, he
                    would probably have been as eminent in music as he was in mathematics. He
                    recognised not only his friends, but even those with whom he was slightly
                    acquainted, by the tone of their voice; and he could judge with wonderful
                    exactness of the size of any apartment into which he was conducted.</p>
