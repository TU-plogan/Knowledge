                <p><label type="entry">POLYBIUS</label>, a celebrated Greek historian, was the son
                    of Lycortas, a native of Megalopolis, in Arcadia, who succeeded Philopoemen in
                    the chief direction of the AEhaean league. His father, therefore, must have been
                    one of the most distinguished men of his time; and we find him accordingly
                    taking part in the principal transactions of his country. The exact date of his
                    birth is unknown, but it is generally believed that it took plaee between <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> e. 210-200; and his death was, therefore, not earlier
                    than <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 129, as he lived to the advanced age of
                    eighty-two. Plutarch tells us that the character of Polybius was formed under
                    the eye of Philopoemen; and that at the funeral of that general he carried the
                    urn whieh contained his ashes, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> e. 182. The
                    following year he was, along with his father and the son of the celebrated
                    Aratus, appointed as ambassador, to return thanks to Ptolemy Epiphanes for the
                    assistance whieh he had offered to the AEhaeans; but the death of that prinee
                    took place before the ambassadors left the Peloponnesus. In the war which arose
                    between the Romans and Perseus king of Macedonia, the opinion of Polybius and
                    his father Lycortas was, that the AEhaeans should observe a striet neutrality;
                    but they were overruled, and the AEhaeans were implicated in the ruin of
                    Perseus. To break the spirit of the AEhaeans, and to prevent any further
                    attempts at insurrection, more than a thousand of the principal citizens were
                    sent to Rome, and afterwards dispersed throughout the different cities of Italy.
                    Polybius was one of these exiles; but he was so far favoured that he was allowed
                    to remain in Rome, where he resided for sixteen years, from <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b. c.</hi> 167 to 151. He beeaιne the intimate friend and instructor of Seipio
                    the younger, at that time only eighteen years old, and who afterwards showed how
                    mueh benefit he had derived from the care Polybius bestowed on his education. At
                    last, through the influence of Scipio and Cato, the senate was prevailed on to
                    allow the AEhaean exiles to return to their country; but of the original
                    thousand only three hundred survived to enjoy the permission thus granted to
                    them. Polybius seems now to have employed his time ehiefly in travelling, with
                    the view of acquiring more accurate notions of geography. He examined with great
                    eare and minuteness the passes of the Alps, that he might be enabled to give a
                    eorreet aeeount of the passage of Hannibal. He afterwards visited Gaul, Spain,
                    and Africa, to whieh latter country he accompanied, Scipio, B. c. 146, when that
                    general took and destroyed Carthage. But the calamities of his own unhappy
                    country called him away, and he hurried to the Peloponnesus, where his presence,
                    however, was unable to save Corinth from the fate which had overtaken Carthage.
                    He did all in his power to prevail on his countrymen to submit to a fate whieh
                    they only made worse by resistance; and the Roman deputies felt such reliance on
                    his good intentions, that they appointed him to the offiee of judge in all
                    disputes, that might arise in any part of the Peloponnesus. . He gradually
                    acquired the esteem of his countrymen, and many of the cities of Greeee erected
                    statues to his honour. He subsequently extended his travels into Egypt, whieh he
                    visited in the reign of Ptolemy Physeon. Whether he was present with Seipio at
                    the siege of Numantia, B. e. 134, we are nowhere told; but he left behind him a
                    work on the subject. He also wrote a biographieal sketeh of Philopoemen, a work
                    on Military Taetics, and another on the Equatorial Regions.</p>
                <p>His principal work, however, was entitled General History, though it referred
                    more particularly to a space of fifty-three years (from 220 to 168 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> e.), from the commencement of the seeond Punie war,
                    where the historian Timaeus, and Aratus of Sieyon, had stopped, to the defeat of
                    Perseus, king of Macedonia, by the Romans. It was divided into forty books, of
                    whieh we now only possess the first five entire, and rather long fragments of
                    most of the others. The first two books are occupied with introductory matter,
                    giving a sketch of the events that happened anterior to the second Punie war. He
                    explains the eauses which gave rise to the first Punie war, and then relates the
                    various events which took place during the twenty-four years it lasted. He gives
                    also some account of the contest which arose between the Carthaginians and their
                    stipendiaries. The seeond book contains the wars of the AEolians, Illyrians,
                    AEhaeans, the expeditions of the Romans against the Illyrians and Gauls, and the
                    transactions of Antigonus king of Macedonia, and Cleomenes king of Sparta,
                    occupying a period of seventeen years, from <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 237
                    to 220. The third book enters into what is more properly the subject of his
                    history, and, after explaining what he considers to be the true eauses of the
                    second Punie war, follows the path of Hannibal’s victories as far as the battle
                    of Cannae, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> e. 216. Yet it would appear that he was
                    defective in method, as the fourth book carries us back to anterior events,
                    which had happened in 220, 219, 218, <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. After a
                    sketeh of the people of the East during the reign of Philip, son of Demetrius
                    king of Macedonia, of Ariarathes king of Cappadoeia, of Antiochus king of Syria,
                    and Ptolemy Philopator king of Egypt, this book traces the history of wars and
                    seditions in Greeee. In the fifth book we have the victories of Philip, the wars
                    in Syria between Antiochus and Ptolemy, and the confederated arms of Greece
                    turned against Rome. It would be useless to give any detailed account of the
                    fragments of the thirty-five books that have been preserved; but we know that
                    the thirty-ninth book ended with the destruction of Corinth, <hi

                    been many editions of this work, but the most critical is that of J.
