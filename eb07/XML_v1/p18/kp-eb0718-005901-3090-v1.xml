                    rend="smallcaps">Secundus,</hi> C., a celebrated Roman orator, was the son of L.
                    Caecilius, and PΓmia, the sister of Pliny the elder, and born in the village of
                    Como, in Cisalpine Gaul, though others have considered Verona as the place of
                    his birth. He was born <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 62, in the eighth year of
                    the reign of Nero, the same year in which the poet Persius died; and there seems
                    every reason to believe that he died <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 107, in the
                    forty-fifth year of his age, and in the tenth year of the reign of Trajan.
                    Having been left fatherless at an early age, he was adopted by his uncle; and,
                    through his care and that of Virginius Rufus, received the best education that
                    Rome could furnish. Amongst others, he derived much advantage from the talents
                    of Quintilian; and he seems at a very early age to have devoted his attention to
                    poetry. In his fourteenth year he had already written a Greek tragedy, though he
                    does not venture to affirm that it was of much value. He had no sooner finished
                    his youthful studies than we find him in Syria, acting as military tribune; and
                    in his eighteenth year, <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 80, he was living with
                    his uncle at Misenum, in Campania, where he was commander of the fleet at the
                    moment of the eruption of Vesuvius, which proved fatal to him. Of the calamity,
                    and the phenomena attendant on it, he gives a very affecting and beautiful
                    account, in two letters to the historian Tacitus. On his return to Rome he
                    commenced his career as an orator, and soon became one of the most distinguished
                    ornaments of the Roman bar. He rose gradually through different ranks till hc
                    reached the office of praetor; but towards the end of the reign of Domitian, hc
                    drew upon himself the indignation of that monarch, by his able defence of
                    Helvidius, whom Domitian had doomed to destruction; and he was only saved from
                    sharing the fate of many others by the death of the emperor. About the period of
                    Nerva’s accession <hi rend="smallcaps">(a. d.</hi> 96) he lost his wife, the
                    step-daughter of Vectius Proculus, and the following year married Calpurnia, of
                    an illustrious family, with whom he lived very happily, though by neither of his
                    wives had he any children. Trajan raised him, A. D. 100, to the rank of consul
                    suffectus, upon which occasion he delivered that celebrated panegyric on the
                    emperor which has been preserved to us.</p>
                <p>The second year after his consulship he was appointed by Trajan to the
                    administration of the province of Bithynia; and it was whilst he was in this
                    office that he wrote that letter to the emperor which bears such honourable
                    testimony to the Christian religion, and which induced Trajan to mitigate the
                    laws which bore so heavily on those who professed that faith. On his return from
                    his province he seems only to have survived a few years, which were probably
                    spent in retirement in his magnificent villas, of which he possessed several in
                    different parts of Italy.</p>
                <p>He was of the most amiable disposition, kind to his inferiors, generous and
                    hospitable to his friends, amongst whom he numbered Quintilian, Suetonius,
                    Silius Italicus, Martial, and Tacitus. He was the active and zealous patron of
                    learning, dividing his time between his professional employments and the
                    pursuits of literature. He has been accused of being jealous of the reputation
                    of some of his friends; and there is no doubt that he was vain of his own
                    acquirements. Next to Cicero there is certainly no orator so distinguished; yet
                    of his numerous orations not one has been preserved except his Panegyric on
                    Trajan, in which he returns thanks for having raised him to the consulship. It
                    was reccivcd with great applause, and is without doubt one of the most beautiful
                    specimens of Roman eloquence that we possess. He exhibits before us Trajan,
                    invested, not merely with the majesty of a prince and commander, but with all
                    the virtues which dignify a private character. His noble spirit, his integrity,
                    his love of learning, arc all beautifully pourtrayed; but in his praise hc
                    sometimes exceeds the bounds of propriety, so as to give it the appearance of
                    flattery. He has also too great fondness for antithesis, and too constant a
                    repetition of particular expressions. In his language, also, we have sometimes
                    to regret the simplicity which distinguishes the works of an earlier age.</p>
                <p>His epistles are addressed to different persons, upon a variety of occasions, and
                    are divided into ten books, of which the last contains only those to Trajan,
                    with his answers. As Sidonius Apollinaris speaks only of nine books, some have
                    thereby been induced to consider the tenth as not the genuine production of
                    Pliny; and indeed others have also refused to include the ninth. The
                    subject-matter of these letters is of a very pleasing character. The reader is
                    interested not more by the variety of circumstances presented to the mind, than
                    by the agreeable manner in which they are told. They possess also great
                    historical value, from being memorials of a period of which we have only a few
                    unimportant hints. We refer more particularly to the two letters on the life and
                    death of Pliny the elder, and that to Trajan on the character of the Christians.
                    As the letters of Cicero are of great value in elucidating the events of the
                    later years of the republic, and in making us more intimately acquainted with
                    the leading statesmen of that time, so those of Pliny are equally valuable in
                    admitting us to an acquaintance with the very different times of the empire.</p>

                    Leipzig, 1805, two vols. 8vo.</p>
