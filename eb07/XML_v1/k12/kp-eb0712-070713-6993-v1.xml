                <p><label type="entry">KHORASSAN</label> is, strictly speaking, a province of
                    Persia. In its more extended sense, however, it comprehends <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192947006?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-7006-0708"/> an extensive
                    tract of country, of which the boundaries have been differently defined, and
                    indeed have greatly varied. In the great revolutions which have occurred in
                    Asia, Khorassan has been the centre of a great empire, and the seat of mighty
                    monarchs, and more frequently the dependency of a fallen state, and the scene of
                    invasion, rebellion, and anarchy. It was a constant subject of dispute between
                    the independent monarchs, whose territories lay respectively on the east and on
                    the west; and it sometimes fell into the power of one, and sometimes of the
                    other. In these circumstances, its political boundaries were continually
                    varying, as the fortune of war inclined to one or other of the surrounding
                    potentates. At one time they comprehended the whole country to the mouth <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> the Oxus, including the steppe of Khaurezm, Balkh, and all
                    the intervening country to the east; on the south-east, not only the cities and
                    dependencies of Herat, but those of Subzawur, Furrah, Geeresh, and even Candahar
                    itself; on the south it was always bounded by Kerman and Seistan; on the west it
                    included the district of Yezed, but its salt desert was bounded in that
                    direction by the districts of Ispahan, Cashan, and Rhe, in the vicinity of
                    Semnaun; and beyond the Elburz Mountains, the districts of Astrabad and of
                    Goorgaun were also considered as the dependencies of this vast territory. If
                    Khorassan be merely considered as a province of Persia, its extent would be very
                    inconsiderable indeed. But if, with Fraser, we take into consideration the
                    natural features of the country, the following boundaries may be assigned.
                    According to this traveller, a line, skirting the districts of Ispahan and
                    Cashan, and meeting the Elburz Mountains near Dehnimmuck, will divide Khorassan
                    from Irak on the west. This line prolonged eastward to the desert on the eastern
                    side of the Caspian Sea, in the steppe of Khaurezm, will form its northern
                    boundary; and we cannot positively decide, nor is exactness in this matter of
                    great importance, in what part of the great desert that occupies the whole space
                    between the foot of the Elburz range and the Oxus, this boundary should be
                    placed. In a political view, it does not extend at present beyond the base of
                    the Elburz Mountains. To the eastward it may properly be allowed to include the
                    districts of Serrukhs, Hazarah, and Balai Moorghaub; and a line running between
                    these and the dependencies of Balkh, in east longitude 63°, in a direction
                    nearly south, including the district of Herat, and touching Seistan, would be
                    the boundary of Khorassan on the east; whilst on the south it is bounded by
                    Kerman and Fars.</p>
                <p>The surface of this extensive country is, like other parts of Persia, much
                    diversified by plains and mountains; a very large proportion is quite unfit for
                    the habitation of man, and consists of arid rocks, destitute of vegetation or
                    fresh water, and deserts either of salt-land or sand, among which may be found a
                    few spots, like islands in the sea. The following is a more particular
                    description, chiefly compiled from Fraser’s <hi rend="italic">Narrative of a
                    Journey into Khorassan.</hi></p>
                <p>The Elburz range of mountains, which is connected with the great chain of
                    Caucasus, runs, in an easterly course, through the northern parts of Khorassan,
                    sending forth various ramifications to the southward. From the base <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> these mountains a desert of barren sand, chiefly level,
                    stretches northward to an immense extent, including the steppe of Khaurezm, and
                    forming a part of that mighty plain which extends eastward as far as the
                    Jaxartes and the Oxus. In this plain are found many fertile districts; but in
                    that portion which is included in the limits now assigned to Khorassan, there is
                    no permanent habitation, and the scanty sprinkling of population which it
                    possesses consists of a few tribes of wandering Toorkomans. These mountains,
                    though they present their loftiest face to the desert, still sweep down in a
                    manner so gradual, as to enclose rich and well-watered valleys, which were
                    formerly well peopled and cultivated, and once contained several towns, which
                    are now in ruins, from the continued attacks of the Toorkoman plunderers. The
                    only place of any consideration that remains is Serrukhs, 120 miles from Mushed,
                    a very ancient town, the remains of which are now inhabited by Toorkomans and
                    Usbecks. To the south, the Elburz Mountains send forth ramifications which
                    penetrate the plain to the distance of from sixty to one hundred miles. Beyond
                    this is the vast salt desert, which extends southward, with occasional fertile
                    tracts, very nearly to the Persian Gulf. This desert varies very much in its
                    nature in different parts. In some places the surface is dry, and even produces
                    a few of those plants that thrive in a salt soil; in others it consists of a
                    crackling crust of dry earth, covered with a saline efflorescence. There are
                    extensive marshy tracts, in the lower parts of which water accumulates during
                    the winter months, which is evaporated by the summer sun, leaving a quantity of
                    salt in cakes, upon a bed of mud. In some places the soil is a hard-baked and
                    perfectly barren clay; again, in certain districts, extensive plains of sand are
                    found, which is occasionally heaped up in hillocks in the form of waves, and
                    frequently so light as to be raised aloft by the winds in clouds, under which
                    travellers are frequently buried, as in the Arabian deserts. The saline desert,
                    however, according to Fraser, predominates in Khorassan. It is of a considerably
                    higher level than the desert to the north of the Elburz Mountains; but still
                    this traveller is of opinion that they are connected. The only fertile parts of
                    Khorassan are where the country is penetrated by the Elburz Mountains; and in
                    the north-east corner of Khorassan there is a long stripe of country, consisting
                    <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> lower parts of these mountains, from ten to twenty
                    miles in breadth, which bear some inconsiderable traces of cultivation, and give
                    shelter to a few miserable hamlets, but contain no village of any consequence.
                    The valley of Mushed, amongst the Elburz Mountains, is of great length. It
                    commences ten or twelve miles to the north-west of Sheerwan, extends, without
                    interruption, for fifty miles beyond Mushed, and continues for the greater part
                    of the way to Herat. It varies from twelve to thirty miles in breadth, and
                    contains in its extent, besides the city of Mushed, the towns of Chinnaran,
                    Radcan, Kabooshan or Cachoon, Sheerwan, and their dependencies, with a great
                    extent of cultivated land. The road from Mushed to Herat must also pass through
                    several well-peopled and well-cultivated districts. The extensive valley here
                    spoken of contains a considerable portion of the district known by the
                    appellation of Koordistan, being inhabited by Koordish colonies. The country
                    which we have described above, under the title of Khorassan, may be estimated to
                    extend between 500 and 600 miles east and west, and between 300 and 400 miles
                    north and south.</p>
