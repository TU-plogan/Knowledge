                <p><label type="entry">RAJEMAL or Rajemahal</label>, an extensive but unproductive
                    district of Bengal, situated about the twenty-fifth degree of north latitude. It
                    has on the north Purneah and Dinagepoor, on the south the large zemindary of
                    Raujeshy, on the east Dinagepoor and Raujeshy, and on the west Monghir and
                    Purneah. It is situated on the western bank of the Ganges, and comprises a great
                    extent of waste and mountainous territory, inhabited in many parts by the
                    aborigines of the country, who speak a distinct language, and differ entirely
                    from the Hindus of Bengal in their manners, as they eat without scruple all
                    kinds of animals. They are mostly low in stature, but strong and well
                    proportioned. There are many of them under five feet ten inches, and more under
                    five feet than above it. They have generally flattened noses, and lips thicker
                    than the inhabitants of the plains. The country is for the most part barren and
                    sandy. The soil in the vicinity of Rajemahal is said to be composed of a mixture
                    of granite rock, which is not to be found lower down the river. The plains
                    produce wheat and barley, and the villages abound with mango-trees of excellent
                    quality. Indian corn and other grains form part of the crops, as well as rice,
                    the mulberry tree, and the indigo plant. The castor-oil plant is raised in great
                    quantities in the field; and in the jungles, which occupy large tracts of the
                    country, the grass grows to the height of eight or ten feet, and is adorned at
                    the top with a beautiful white down, resembling swans’ feathers. These jungles
                    afford shelter to numerous tigers, bears, and other wild beasts. It was in this
                    district that the experiment was first tried of granting lands to the native
                    invalid officers and soldiers, on condition of their residing upon them and
                    cultivating them. In this manner was formed in the wilds the village of
                    Sicli-gully; and this measure has been attended with the best effects, so that
                    the traveller now passes with as much safety from human foes, in this district,
                    as in any other part of the country. The territory is separated from Bahar by a
                    range of hills, the Rajemahal Hills, compared by Bishop Heber to the hills of
                    Cheshire, and consisting of a coarse granite. Through these hills are several
                    passes, the chief of which is Terriagully, up a narrow winding road, where there
                    is a ruined gateway and fort, which formerly commanded the high road leading
                    from Moorshedabad to Patna, and was considered as the key of Bengal. The roads
                    are generally indifferent, owing to the force of the torrents during the rains,
                    which bar up the bridges, and carry devastation throughout the country. The
                    principal articles of traffic are common Hindustanee bedsteads, wood, planks,
                    charcoal, cotton, honey, plantains, and sweet potatoes, which are exchanged for
                    salt, tobacco, rice, cloth, iron heads for arrows, hatchets, crooks, and iron
                    instruments. Their domestic animals are hogs, goats, and fowls, besides cats and
                    dogs. The people of these mountains, observes Bishop Heber, and of all tile
                    hilly country between Sicligully and Burd-wan, are a distinct race from those of
                    the plain, in features, language, civilization, and religion. They have neither
                    castes nor Hindu deities, and are even said to have no idols. They are still
                    more naked than even the Hindu peasants, and live chiefly by the chase, pursuing
                    their game witll bows and arrows. Some few of them have fire-arms. Until within
                    the last fifty years, a deadly feud existed between them and the cultivators of
                    the neighbouring lands, upon which they were continually making forays; and
                    being both thieves and murderers, they were shot without mercy by the zemindars,
                    in the same manner as tigers or other wild beasts. But by the wise and
                    benevolent management of an excellent young man, judge and magistrate of
                    Boglipoor, these rude tribes were reclaimed from their barbarous habits by just
                    and merciful treatment, all violence on the part of the zemindars being
                    forbidden, and promptly punished. He took other methods of conciliating their
                    favour, and engaged sevcral of them to enter his service; he established bazaars
                    at the villages nearest them, and encouraged them to bring for sale game,
                    millet, wax, hides, and honey, which are produced abundantly in their hills; he
                    gave them wheat and barley for seed; and, finally, he raised amongst them a
                    corps of Sepoys, who were established at Sicligully, and gave the command of
                    them to a native chief, named Jow-rah, who, Bishop Heber remarks, was the Rob
                    Roy, or more properly the Roderick Dhti, of the Rajemalials, but who fully
                    justified the judgment and discrimination of Mr Cleveland’s choice. “This good
                    and wise man,” adds Bishop Heber, a pattern himself of the same qualities, “died
                    in 1784, at the early age of twenty-nine. In honour of his memory, a monument,
                    in the form of a pagoda, was erected by the zemindars and others, at the expense
                    of government.” The principal towns are Rajemal and Maulda, and the chief river
                    the Ganges, but it is intersected by a variety of smaller streams in all
                    directions.</p>

                    the capital of the above district, is situated on the western bank of the
                    Ganges, at the foot of a range of hills. The modern town consists only of one
                    street, composed of stone, generally two stories in height, with the ruins of a
                    palace, which has been much injured by the encroachments of the river. Its empty
                    halls, marble porticoes, and half-decayed vaults, still presentimages of its
                    former grandeur. An inconsiderable traffic continues to be carried on with the
                    inhabitants of the hills; and there are quarries which supply the neighbourhood
                    with flags anti millstones. This place decayed from various causes, namely, an
                    inundation of the Ganges, which swept away a con<pb break="no"

                    />siderable part of it; a conflagration, which destroyed another portion of it;
                    and, lastly, the transfer of the seat of government to Dacca. There is a
                    tradition that this city was in very ancient times the seat of a Hindu
                    government. It is first mentioned by Mahommedan historians in 1576, under the
                    name of Agamallel, or the house of fire. In the reign of Akbar, about 1591,
                    Rajah Mause Singh, on his return from the conquest of the Afghans of Orissa,
                    fixed upon this city for the capital of Bengal, the name of which he changed to
                    Rajamahal. He erected a palace, and surrounded the town with a rampart of brick
                    and other fortifications. The city suffered considerable injury from the troops
                    of Aurungzebe, who took it after a short siege. It was afterwards the residence
                    of the military collector of the district, which contributed to its support; but
                    since the union of the district with Boglipoor, and the transfer of the public
                    offices to that town, it has fallen into decay. It is seventy miles
                    north-north-west from Moorshedabad. Long. 87. 43. E. Lat. 25. 2. N.</p>
