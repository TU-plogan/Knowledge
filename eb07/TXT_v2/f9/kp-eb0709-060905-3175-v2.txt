FITCHES, in Husbandry, a sort of pulse, more generally known by the name of chick-pea. Fitches are cultivated either for the purpose of feeding cattle or improving the land. They are a wholesome and nourishing food, whether given in the straw or thrashed out. When sown only to improve the soil, they are ploughed in just as they begin tÎ¸ blossom, by which means a tough clay soil is much enriched.
