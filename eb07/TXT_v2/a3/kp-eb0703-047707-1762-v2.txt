ARDEBIL, or Ardebeel, a town of Persia, in the province of Azerbijan, on a river which runs into the Aras or Araxes. It is situated on the southern side of the desert plain of Ardebil, which is 60 miles in length by 40 in breadth. The town contains about 500 or 600 families, and appears to have been built from some former city. It is surrounded by a ruinous wall of mud, flanked with towers in a like state of decay. It has a fort, which is a regular square, with bastions at the corners, fortified ac[7:3:478]cording to the European fashion. The only objects of interest are the tombs of Sheik Suffee, the ancestor of the Suffanean kings, and his descendants. It is still held in veneration as having been the residence of that royal prince.
