CABINET, the most retired place in the finest part of a building, set apart for writing, studying, or preserving any thing that is precious.

Cabinet also denotes a piece of joinerâ€™s workmanship, being a kind of press or chest, with several doors and drawers. There are common cabinets of oak or of chestnut varnished, cabinets of China and Japan, cabinets of inlaid work, and cabinets of ebony, or other precious woods.

Cabinet is also used in speaking of the more select and secret councils of princes. Thus, we say the secrets, the intrigues of the cabinet. To avoid the inconveniences of a numerous council, the policy of Italy and the practice of France first introduced cabinet councils.

Cabinet-Making. See Joinery.
