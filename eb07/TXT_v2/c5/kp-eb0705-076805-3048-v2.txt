CACHUNDE, the name of a medicine, highly celebrated among the Chinese and Indians, and composed of several aromatic ingredients, perfumes, medicinal earth, and precious stones. They make the whole into a stiff paste, and, according to their fancy, form out of it several figures, which are dried for use; these are principally used in the East Indies, but are sometimes brought over to Portugal. In China the principal person's usually carry a small piece in their mouths, which is a continued cordial, and gives their breath a very sweet smell.
