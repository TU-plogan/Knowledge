NO, or No- Ammon, a considerable city of Egypt, dedicated to Ammon or Jupiter. The Septuagint translate [7:16:234]the name in Ezekiel, Diospolis, or the City of Jupiter. Bochart takes it to be Thebes in Egypt, which, according to Strabo and Ptolemy, was called Diospolis. Jerome, after the Chaldaic paraphrast Jonathan, supposes it to be Alexandria, named thus by way of anticipation; or an ancient city of that name which is supposed to have stood on the spot where Alexandria was afterwards built.
