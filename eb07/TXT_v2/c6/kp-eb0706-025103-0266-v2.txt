CAUKING, or Cavlking of a Ship, is driving a quantity of oakum, or old ropes untwisted and drawn asunder, into the seams of the planks, or into the intervals where the planks are joined together in the shipâ€™s decks or sides, in order to prevent the entrance of water or leakage. After the oakum is driven very hard into these seams, it is covered with hot melted pitch or rosin, to keep the water from rotting it. Among the ancients, the first who made use of pitch in caulking were the inhabitants of Phaeacia, afterwards called Corsica. Wax and rosin appear to have been commonly used previously to that period; and the Poles at one time used a sort of unctuous clay for the same purpose on their navigable rivers.
