                <p><label type="entry">VICENZA</label>, a delegation or province of Austrian
                    Lombardy, within the government of Venice. It is bounded on the north-west by
                    the Tyrol, on the north-east by Belluno, on the east by Treviso, on the
                    south-east by Padua, and on the south-west by Verona. It extends over 836 square
                    miles, is divided into thirteen districts or circles, and these into 113
                    communes, containing 297,547 inhabitants, who arc all of the Italian race,
                    except those who live in seven of the Alpine districts, who are Germans; but all
                    adhere to the Catholic religion. The land is generally level, but some spurs of
                    the western Alps project themselves into the plain on the northern side. It is
                    watered by several streams, which unite near the capital, and there assume the
                    name of Bachiglione. This river is then navigable to the Brenta below Padua, and
                    with it enters the Adriatic sea. The soil is generally good, and for the most
                    part well cultivated, and the face of the country excites the highest
                    gratification to one who travels through it with an agricultural eye. Maize is
                    the chief corn crop. Wheat and rye are likewise cultivated, but are far less
                    productive than maize, which forms almost exclusively the food of the peasantry.
                    Flax and hemp are grown, but not extensively. The chief object of the farmers is
                    the mulberry tree, whose number is rapidly increasing, as well as that of the
                    silk worms that are fed with the leaves. The vines are mixed with the trees, and
                    trained in festoons from one to the other. This has a most charming effect, but
                    is said not to be favourable to the produce of wine, which article is in general
                    of bad quality. A great number of sheep and oxen is fed near the streams or
                    meadows, which are mowed three or four times in the year. The wool is fine, and
                    that, with the cheese, forms a valuable portion of rural wealth.</p>
