                <p><label type="entry">VICTOR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sextus Aurelius</hi></label>, a
                    Latin historian, lived in the age of Constantius and Julian. From the terms in
                    which he speaks of Africa, describing it as “decus terrarum,” it has been
                    conjectured that he was a native of that region. According to his own account,
                    he was born in the country, and was the son of a poor and unlettered father. We
                    learn from Ammianus Marcellinus that the emperor Constantius having seen Victor
                    the historian at Sirmium, afterwards appointed him prefect of Pannonia Secunda,
                    and honoured him with a brazen statue. At a subsequent period, as we learn from
                    the same authority, the office of prefect of the city was likewise conferred
                    upon him. He is supposed to have been the same individual who in 369 was consul
                    along with Valentinian.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        8vo.</p></note> It has been inferred that he was not a Christian.</p>
                <p>Aurelius Victor appears to have been the author of a work “De Viris Illustribus
                    Urbis Romae,” which has repeatedly been printed under the names of Cornelius
                    Nepos, Suetonius, and the younger Pliny. The first of his illustrious men is
                    Procas king of the Albani, the last Sextus Pompeius. Of this work, his tract “De
                    Caesaribus” is to be regarded as a continuation. It commences with Augustus, and
                    terminates with Julian. This tract first appeared in an edition of the author’s
                    works published by Andreas Schottus, Antverp. 1579, 8vo. Here we likewise find
                    the earliest impression of the tract entitled “Origo Gentis Romanae but whether
                    it is a genuine production of the same author, has been considered as extremely
                    doubtful. Another work commonly ascribed to him bears the title, “De Vita et
                    Moribus Imperatorum Romanorum; excerpta ex libris Sexti Aurelii Victoris, a
                    Caesare Augusto usque ad Theodosium Imperatorem." This title is not applicable
                    to a work composed by Victor, but to one compiled from his writings. The
                    materials appear to be borrowed from Suetonius, Eutropius, Ammianus, and
                        Victor.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Vossius de

                <p>Of the entire works ascribed to this author there are several editions,
                    accompanied with the notes of various critics. Among these we may specify that
                    of Leyden, Lugd. Bat. 1671, 8vo. An edition “in usum Delphini” was published by
                    Madame Dacier, Paris. 1681, 4to. For another edition we are indebted to
                    Pitiscus, Traj. ad Rhen. 1696, 8vo. But the best edition of Victor is that of
                    Amzenius, Amst. 1733, 4to.</p>
