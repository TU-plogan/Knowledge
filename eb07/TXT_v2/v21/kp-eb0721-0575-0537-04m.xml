                    whom, according to Voltaire, France was indebted for the science of medals, and
                    Louis XIV. for one half of his cabinet, was born at Beauvais on the 24th of May
                    1632. At the age of three, he lost his father, and the charge of his education
                    was undertaken by one of his maternal unclcs. This uncle, who belonged to the
                    magistracy, and who had destined him for his successor, died after bequeathing
                    him his name and a part of his fortune; and being thus left to follow his own
                    inclination, he relinquished the study of law for that of physic, and took a
                    doctor’s degree. He engaged in practice at Beauvais, but was accidentally drawn
                    into a new department of study, which he prosecuted with great ardour during the
                    remainder of his life. A farmer of that vicinity had found a great quantity of
                    ancient coins, and Vaillant at first inspected them in a cursory manner; but
                    perceiving that they bore a reference to events either forgotten or inaccurately
                    detailed by historians, he was induced to resume their examination with deep
                    attention, and he succeeded in explaining them with a facility which is
                    generally the result of long experience. Having afterwards made a visit to
                    Paris, he became known to Seguin, eminent for his numismatic skill, and
                    astonished him by the extent of his knowledge. He was introduced to other men of
                    learning; and the minister Colbert proposed to employ him in travelling to
                    collect medals for the royal cabinet. He accepted of the offer, and after
                    travelling into Italy, Greece, Egypt, and Persia, he returned with so many
                    medals as made the king’s cabinet superior to any in Europe. In one of his
                    voyages, in 1674, the ship was taken by an Algerine corsair. After a captivity
                    of nearly five months, he w as permitted to return to France, and received at
                    the same time twenty gold medals which had been taken from him. He embarked in a
                    vessel bound for Marseille, and was carried with a favourable wind for two days,
                    when another corsair appeared, which, in spite of all the sail they could make,
                    bore down upon them within the reach of cannon shot. Vaillant, dreading the
                    miseries of a fresh slavery, resolved at all events to secure the medals which
                    he had recovered at Algiers, and therefore swallowed them. But a sudden change
                    of the wind freed them from this adversary, and cast them upon the coast of
                    Catalonia; and after expecting to run aground every moment, they at length fell
                    among the sands at the mouth of the Rhone. He reached the shore in a skiff, but
                    felt himself extremely incommoded with the medals he had swallowed, which might
                    weigh altogether five or six ounces, and therefore did not pass like Scarborough
                    waters. He had recourse to a couple of physicians, who were a little puzzled
                    with the singularity of his case; however, nature relieved him from time to
                    time, and he found himself in possession of the greatest part of his treasure
                    when he arrived at Lyon. Among his collection was an Otho, valuable for its
                    rarity. He was much caressed on his return; and when Louis XIV. gave a new form
                    to the Academy of Inscriptions in 1701, Vaillant was first made associate, and
                    then pensionary. In the course of his researches, he had twelve times visited
                    Italy, and twice England and Holland. He was successively married to two
                    sisters; having obtained a dispensation from the pope, upon condition <pb

                    at St. Peter’s church in Rome. He died on the 23d of October 1706, in the
                    seventy-fifth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Vaillant possessed great knowledge and skill as an antiquary, and published
                    various works, of which the following are the most important. Numismata
