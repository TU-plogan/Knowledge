                <p><label type="entry">VERVEIERS</label>, a circle of the province of Liege, in the
                    Netherlands, containing six cantons, divided into twenty-nine communes. The
                    capital is the city of the same name, finely situated on the river Besdre,
                    partly in a valley, and partly on the declivity of some hills. It is well built,
                    and a place of the most active industry in the kingdom. The chief trade is that
                    of making fine woollen cloths, which are celebrated in every part of the
                    continent, especially from the brilliant colours, to which the quality of the
                    water is said greatly to contribute. There are also some chemical manufactures,
                    producing aquafortis, vitriol, and soaps. The wealth and number of the
                    inhabitants have rapidly increased since the peace of 1814. The population then
                    was 9960, and in 1831 was 19,592.</p>
