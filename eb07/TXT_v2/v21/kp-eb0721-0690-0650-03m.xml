                <p><label type="entry">VILLACH</label>, a circle in the Austrian government of
                    Laibach in Illyria. It is bounded on the north by the Upper Ens, on the east by
                    Klaganfort, on the south by Laibach and Venice, and on the west by Tyrol. It
                    extends over 2200 square miles, and comprehends four cities, eleven market
                    towns, and 1147 villages, with 112,980 inhabitants. It is mostly an alpine
                    district, with lofty mountains covered with snow, but intermixed with valleys of
                    great beauty and fertility, and several picturesque lakes and waterfalls. The
                    chief occupation is mining, by which some little silver and less gold is
                    obtained, but more considerable quantities of lead, copper, antimony, and
                    quicksilver. There are also many valuable quarries, yielding marbles of great
                    beauty. The capital is the city of the same name, on the river Drove. It is well
                    built and strongly fortified, contains two churches, 360 dwelling-houses, and
                    4820 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in converting the minerals into
                    common utensils. Lat. 46. 35. Long. 13. 42. E.</p>
