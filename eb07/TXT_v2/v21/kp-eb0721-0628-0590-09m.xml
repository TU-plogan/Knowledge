                    by which several thin slices or leaves of fine wood, of different kinds, are
                    applied and fastened on <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=629" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0629-0591"
                    />a ground of some common wood. There are two kinds of inlaying; the one, which
                    is the more ordinary, goes no farther than the making of compartments of
                    different woods; the other requires much more art, and represents flowers,
                    birds, and the like figures. The first kind is what we properly call <hi
                        rend="italic">veneering;</hi> the latter we have already described under <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Marquetry.</hi></p>
                <p>The wood intended for veneering is first sawed out into slices or leaves, about a
                    line thick. In order to saw them, the blocks or planks are placed upright in a
                    kind of vice or sawing press, the description of which may be seen under the
                    article just referred to. These slices are afterwards cut into slips, and
                    fashioned divers ways, according to the design proposed; then the joints being
                    carefully adjusted, and the pieces brought down to their proper thickness, with
                    several planes for the purpose, they are glued down on a ground or block of dry
                    wood, with good strong English glue. The pieces being thus joined and glued, the
                    work, if small, is put in a press; if large. It is laid on the bench, covered
                    with a board, and pressed down with poles, or pieces of wood, one end of which
                    reaches to the ceiling of the room, and the other bears on the boards. When the
                    glue is quite dry, they take it out of the press and finish it; first with
                    little planes, then with divers scrapers, some of which resemble rasps, which
                    take off dents left by the planes. When sufficiently scraped, the work is
                    polished with the skin of a sea-dog, wax, and a brush and polisher of
                    shave-grass.</p>
