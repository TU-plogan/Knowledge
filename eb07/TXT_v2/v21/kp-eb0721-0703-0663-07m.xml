                <p><label type="entry">VOLHYNIA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Wolhynia</hi></label>, a
                    government, or stad-holderate, of the Russian empire, extending in north
                    latitude from 49’ 28' to 52° 3', and in east longitude from 23° 30' to 29° 14'.
                    It is bounded on the north-west by Grodno, on the north by Minsh, on the east by
                    Kieu, on the south by the Austrian kingdom of Gallicia, and on the west by the
                    kingdom of Poland. This province belonged to Poland till the great dismemberment
                    of that kingdom by Russia, Austria, and Prussia, when it was transferred to the
                    first of those powers. It extends over 30,660 square miles, divided into twelve
                    circles, and containing 139 cities and towns, and 2591 villages, with 1,394,600
                    inhabitants. The nobility and traders are for the most part of the Polish
                    nation, but many of the peasants are of a Russian origin, and there are also
                    many Jews. The major part of the population adheres to the Greek church, at
                    whose head is a bishop of that sect. The Catholics are next in number, and
                    mostly Poles, who have a bishop at Luzk as head of their church, and they still
                    have many monasteries. The Jews have their own synagogues and their separate
                    schools.</p>
                <p>The face of the country is a high level plain, which extends northward from the
                    Carpathian mountains. At the north there are few or no hills, but many morasses,
                    and the elevated land between them is covered with woods of excellent timber.
                    The southern part is undulating, and has many spurs projecting from the
                    Carpathians, though few of them exceed 400 feet in height. Their summits are
                    mostly covered with trees.</p>
                <p>The soil is cither a loam or clay, occasionally sandy, but generally mixed with
                    marl, and covered with a thick coating of vegetable mould. Although in the north
                    there are large tracts of moors and marshes, yet, by draining, they are
                    converted into profitable meadows and com fields. Although the process of
                    cultivation is little better conducted than in Poland, yet there are fewer
                    unproductive seasons, and none in which a surplus of corn is not produced. Flax,
                    hemp, rape, and tobacco are cultivated; and some oil is made from the seed, but
                    merely for home consumption. Hops, saffron, mustard, and capsicum are grown, but
                    on a limited scale. The converting the forests into timber and charcoal affords
                    considerable occupation to the labouring classes. The manufactures are solely
                    for domestic use, and consist of linen and woollen cloth, the spinning of which
                    is performed by hand by the females; and families buy the yarn and have weavers
                    who go from house to execute their part of the work. Though Volhynia is nearly
                    equal in extent to Ireland and has a better soil, yet, from want of that
                    stimulus which access to good markets gives. It is enabled to support, and that
                    in a wretched manner, scarcely one-fifth of the same number of human beings. The
                    little trade that exists is in the hands of the Jews, who, by legal means, or by
                    smuggling, send into the Austrian and Prussian territory, corn, brandy, live
                    cattle, especially horses, and some salted meat, and also honey and bees’
                    wax.</p>
