                <p><label type="entry">VESTALS</label>, among the ancient Romans, were priestesses
                    of the goddess Vesta, and had the perpetual fire committed to their charge. They
                    were at first only four in number, but afterwards increased to six; and it does
                    not appear that their number ever exceeded six, among whom was one superior to
                    the rest, and called <hi rend="italic">vestalis maxima.</hi> The vestals were
                    chosen from six to ten years of age, and obliged to strict continency for thirty
                    years; the first ten of which were employed in learning the ceremonies of
                    religion, the next ten in the performance of them, and the last ten in teaching
                    them to the younger vestals. The habit of the vestals consisted of a head-dress,
                    called <hi rend="italic">injula,</hi> which sat close to the head, and from
                    whence hung certain laces called <hi rend="italic">vitta;</hi> a kind of
                    surplice made of white linen, and over it a purple mantle with a long train to
                    it.</p>
