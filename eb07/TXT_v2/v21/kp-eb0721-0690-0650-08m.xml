                <p><label type="entry">VILLENAGE</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Law.</hi> The
                    folk-land, or estates held in villenage, was a species of tenure neither
                    strictly feudal, Norman, nor Saxon, but mixed and compounded of them all; and
                    which also, on account of the heriots that usually attend it, may seem to have
                    somewhat Danish in its composition. Under the Saxon government, there were, as
                    Sir William Temple speaks, a sort of people in a condition of downright
                    servitude, used and employed in the most servile works, and belonging, both
                    they, their children, and effects, to the lord of the soil, like the rest of the
                    cattle or stock upon it. These seem to have been those who held what was called
                    the <hi rend="italic">folk-land,</hi> from which they were removeable at the
                    lord’s pleasure. On the arrival of the Normans. It seems not improbable that
                    they who were strangers to any other than a feudal state, might give some
                    measure of enfranchisement to such wretched persons as fell to their share, by
                    admitting them, as well as others, to the oath of fealty, which conferred a
                    right of protection, and raised the tenant to a kind of state superior to
                    downright slavery, but inferior to every other condition. This they called <hi
                        rend="italic">villenage,</hi> and the tenants <hi rend="italic"
                        >villeins.</hi></p>
                <p>These villeins, belonging principally to lords of manors, were either villeins
                        <hi rend="italic">regardant,</hi> that is, annexed to the manor or land; or
                    else they were <hi rend="italic">in gross,</hi> or at large, that is, annexed to
                    the person of the lord, and transferable by deed from one owner to another. They
                    could not leave their lord without his permission; but if they ran away, or were
                    purloined from him, might be claimed and recovered by action, like beasts or
                    other chattels. They held indeed small portions of land by way of sustaining
                    themselves and families, but it was at the mere will of the lord, who might
                    dispossess them whenever he pleased; and it was upon villein services, that is,
                    to carry out dung, to hedge and ditch the lord’s demesnes, and any other the
                    meanest offices; and their services were not only base, but uncertain both as to
                    their time and quantity. A villein could acquire no property either in lands or
                    goods; if he purchased either, the lord might seize them to his own use, unless
                    be contrived to dispose of them again before the lord had seized them, for the
                    lord had then lost his opportunity</p>
                <p>In many places a fine was also payable to the lord, if the villein presumed to
                    marry his daughter to any one without leave from the lord; and by the common
                    law, the lord might also bring an action against the husband for damages in thus
                    purloining his property; for the children of villeins were also in the same
                    state of bondage with their parents; whence they were called in Latin <hi
                        rend="italic">nativi,</hi> which gave rise to the female appellation of a
                    villein, who was called a <hi rend="italic">neife.</hi> In case of a marriage
                    between a freeman and a neife, or a villein and a free woman, the issue followed
                    the condition of the father, being free if he was free, and a villein if he was
                    villein, contrary to the maxim of the civil law, <hi rend="italic">partus
                        seguitur ventrem.</hi> But no bastard could be born a villein, because by
                    another maxim of our law, he is <hi rend="italic">nullius filius;</hi> and as he
                    can <hi rend="italic">gain</hi> nothing by inheritance. It were hard that he
                    should <hi rend="italic">lose</hi> his natural freedom by it. The law however
                    protected the persons of villeins against atrocious injuries of the lord; for he
                    might not kill or maim his villein, although he might beat him with
                    impunity.</p>
                <p>Villeins might be enfranchised by manumission. In process of time they gained
                    considerable ground on their birds; and in particular they strengthened the
                    tenure of their estates to that degree, that they came to have in them an
                    interest in many places fully as good, in others better than their lords. For
                    the good-nature and benevolence of many lords of manors having, time out of
                    mind, permitted their villeins and their children to enjoy their possessions
                    without interruption, in a regular course of descent. the common law, of which
                    custom is the life, now gave them title to prescribe against their lords; and,
                    on performance of the same services, to hold their lands in spite of any
                    determination of the lord’s will. For though in general they are still said to
                    hold their estates at the will of the lord, yet it is such a will as is
                    agreeable to the custom of the manor; which customs are preserved and evidenced
                    by the rolls of the several courts-baron in which they are entered, or kept on
                    foot by the constant immemorial usage of the several manors in which the lands
                    lie. And as such tenants had nothing to show for their estates but those cus <pb
                        break="no" facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=691"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0721-0691-0651"/> toms, and admissions in pursuance of them,
                    entered on these rolls, or the copies of such entries witnessed by the steward,
                    they now began to be called <hi rend="italic">tenants by copy of court
                        roll,</hi> and their tenure itself a <hi rend="italic">copyhold.</hi></p>
