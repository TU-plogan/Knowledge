                <p><label type="entry">VARRO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marcus Terentius</hi></label>, a
                    very learned and very miscellaneous writer, was born at Rome about the year
                    116</p>
                <p>before the Christian era. He received what was then considered as the best
                    education that could be obtained. Having studied at Rome under Stilo, he
                    proceeded to Athens, and became the disciple of Antiochus, an Academic
                    philosopher. Returning to his native city, he began to take some share in the
                    business of the forum, but he does not appear to have acquired much reputation
                    as an orator. He successively filled the office of triumvir, and tribune of the
                    people. When he was about forty-nine years of age, Pompey entrusted him with the
                    command of a Greek fleet, employed in the war against the pirates. In a naval
                    engagement which took place near the coast of Cilicia, he acquitted himself with
                    so much courage, that he was the first that boarded one of the enemy’s ships;
                    and in honour of this exploit, Pompey presented him with a rostral crown. For
                    some time he acted as governor of Cilicia, apparently by virtue of an
                    extraordinary appointment.</p>
                <p>During the civil war which ensued, Varro adhered to Pompey, and was employed as
                    his lieutenant in farther Spain. He was however advanced in years, and,
                    according to Caesar’s account, was disposed to follow the turns of fortune. The
                    affairs of his own party having assumed a more promising aspect, he pursued
                    measures of greater decision; and having embodied two legions, with thirty
                    irregular cohorts, he made vigorous preparations for defending the province, but
                    the speedy approach of Caesar rendered all his plans abortive. One of his
                    legions revolted, and the inhabitants evinced no disposition to make the quarrel
                    their own. Varro now adopted the resolution of marching towards Italy; but
                    finding that this attempt was impracticable, he offered to deliver the remaining
                    legion to any one whom the victorious general should nominate. Having
                    accordingly delivered it to Sextus Caesar, he presented himself to Julius Caesar
                    at Corduba, and made a surrender of all his treasure, ships, and stores. After
                    this unfortunate termination of his military services, he appears to have
                    devoted himself with great ardour and perseverance to the pursuits of
                    literature; and, as his life was extended beyond the usual term, he produced a
                    great number of works, and on a great variety of subjects. He cultivated a
                    particular intimacy with Cicero, who inscribed to him his Academica, as he
                    inscribed to Cicero a portion of his treatise “De Lingua Latina.”</p>
                <p>When Caesar returned to Rome after having subdued all his enemies, Varro
                    entertained some apprehension for his personal safety, and thought it prudent to
                    withdraw from the city; but his fears were soon removed, and their hostility was
                    at length converted into friendship. Caesar committed to him the charge of
                    forming and superintending a public library; a charge for which he was eminently
                    qualified by his very extensive and variegated learning. After the death of this
                    ruler of the world, he was again exposed to danger: he was included in the same
                    proscription which proved fatal to his friend Cicero; but, even on this
                    occasion, his good fortune did not desert him. His wealth, as well as his
                    political connexions, must have contributed to mark him for destruction. He was
                    sheltered and concealed by Calenus, and his name was at length erased from the
                    list of the proscribed. He was the possessor of several villas; and in the mean
                    time one of these had been seized and plundered by Antony. The loss of his
                    valuable library, including some of his own writings, was one of the
                    contingencies to which he was exposed at this unhappy crisis. He however
                    survived for many years, and continued his studies with unabated ardour. At the
                    age of seventy-eight, as we learn from Aulus Gellius, he had composed 490 books.
                    According to Pliny, he still continued to write at the age of eighty-eight. His
                    death is referred to the year 27 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.;</hi> and, according
                    to the computation from this date and the supposed date of his birth, he must
                    have attained the age of eighty-nine. It is not however improbable<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=601" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0601-0563"
                    /> that he may have exceeded this age by a few years.</p>
                <p>Varro has very frequently been described as the most learned of the Romans; and
                    it has already been stated that he wrote on an immense variety of subjects.<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Fabricii Bibliotheca
                            Latina, tom i. p. 124-132 edit. Ernesti, where very many of his lost
                            works are enumerated.</p></note> His works were partly in prose, and
                    partly in verse. One of them, a Menippean satire, consisted of an intermixture
                    of verse with prose, of Greek with Latin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>See Casauboni de Satyrica Graecorum Poesi et Romanorum
                            Satira libri duo, p. 258. Paris. 1606, 8vo.</p></note> Some of them
                    related to grammar and rhetoric, others to history and philosophy, others again
                    to politics and theology. He seems indeed to have embraced almost every topic of
                    human speculation. But of all these treasures of ancient learning. It is deeply
                    to be regretted that only a very inconsiderable remnant has escaped the ravages
                    of time. Of his twenty-four books “De Lingua Latina,” the first three have all
                    perished except a few inconsiderable fragments. The fourth, fifth, and sixth,
                    relating to the origin of Latin words, and inscribed to Cicero, and the seventh,
                    eighth, and ninth, relating to the analogy of the language, are however
                    preserved, though not without some mutilations. Of the other books, scarcely a
                    vestige remains. Even in this mutilated state, the work is both curious and
                    valuable. His editor Scaliger has however shewn that his etymologies are not
                    unfrequently erroneous; and another very learned critic, Salmasius, has remarked
                    that his reluctance to admit Greek derivations often leads him very far
                    astray.</p>
                <p>His three books “De Re Rustica,” have reached us in a better condition. It
                    appears from the exordium, that he undertook the composition of this work at the
                    age of eighty; and that his wife Fundania, to whom it is addressed, had
                    purchased a demesne which she wished him to manage in the most advantageous
                    manner. Some inconsiderable fragments of his other works, in prose and verse,
                    have been preserved, and have been collected with due care.<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>His poetical fragments were very
                            laboriously collected by R. Stephanus, Fragmenta Poetanim Veterum
                            Latinorum, quorum Opera non extant, p. 305-364. Excudebat H. Stephanus,
                            1564, 8vo. These fragments were collected by the father, and digested by
                            the son.</p></note></p>
                <p>Of the work “De Lingua Latina,” an edition, considered as the first, is in
                    quarto, without place or date, but supposed to have been printed at Rome by G.
                    Lauer, about the year 1471. The editor was Pomponius Laetus. There arc other
                    three very early editions, likewise without dates, but conjectured to have been
                    printed, the first at Venice about 1472, the second in the same city in 1474,
                    and the third at Rome about the same time. The first two are in quarto, the
                    third is in folio. After this period, the work was inserted in various
                    collections of the Latin grammarians. Several editions of it bear the name of
                    Michael Bentinus. One of them is that of Paris, 1530, 8vo. This edition likewise
                    contains the spurious <hi rend="italic">Origines</hi> ascribed to Cato. An
                    edition was publised by Antonius Augustinus, afterwards archbishop of Tarragona,
                    Romae, 1554, 8vo. The same edition, which contains marginal emendations, but no
                    commentary, is generally to be found with the date of 1557, and it then includes
                    several additions; at the beginning of the volume, “Dubia et Varia,” “Doctorum
                    Virorum Nomina qui hujus libri emendationi operam dederunt,” and more than two
                    pages of <hi rend="italic">Emendata;</hi> and at the end, seventy-two unnumbered
                    leaves, occupied with various indices. This edition of Varro was reprinted among
                    the works of the editor, Augustini Opera, tom. vii. p. 425-524. The next edition
                    was that of Vertranius Maurus, Lugd. 1563, 8vo. It was followed by the very
                    elaborate and valuable edition of Joseph Scaliger, Paris. 1565, 8vo. And soon
                    afterwards appeared “Adriani Turnebi Commentarii et Emendationes in libros
                    Varronis de Lingua Latina.” Paris. 1566, 8vo. This was a posthumous work, and
                    laboured under the usual disadvantages of such publications. Here we must not
                    overlook another learned labour, “Ad M. Ter. Varronis Assertiones Analogiae
                    Sermonis Latini, Appendix Henrici Stephani.” Exc. H. Stephanus, 1591, 8vo. An
                    edition of Varro’s work was published by Scioppius, Ingo1stadii, 1605, 8vo.
                    Another separate edition appeared after a very long interval, Biponti, 1788, 2
                    tom. 8vo. This very useful edition, which also includes the fragments of Varro’s
                    works, is illustrated with the notes of Augustinus, Tumebus, Scaliger, and
                    Popma. It was followed by the critical edition of L. Spengcl, Berolini, 1826,
                    8vo∙ And last of all appeared “M. Terentii Varronis de Lingua Latina librorum
                    quae supersunt, emendata et annotata a Carolo Odofredo Muellero.” Lipsiae, 1833,
                    8vo. This is an edition of no small value; and we add, with much regret, that
                    the editor has been prematurely arrested in the midst of a very distinguished
                    career. He died at Athens on the first of August 1840.</p>
                <p>Varro’s treatise “De Re Rustica” has been printed in the numerous editions of the
                    “Scriptores Rei Rusticae.” the earliest edition of this collection is supposed
                    to be that printed by Jenson, Venet. 1472, fol. Two editions issued from the
                    Aldine press in 1514 and 1533. A critical edition was published by Victorins,
                    Lugd. 1541-2. It consists of four parts; of which the first three contain the
                    text of the different writers, and the fourth, dated in 1542, bears the title of
                    “Petri Victorii Explicationes suarum in Catonem, Varronem, Columellam
                    Castigationum.” This part, consisting of 144 pages, is sometimes to be found as
                    a separate publication. And here we must likewise notice a learned work of
                    Fulvius Ursinus, “Notae ad M. Catonem, M. Varronem, L. Columellam de Re
                    Rustica.” Romae, 1587, 8vo. For a very elaborate and valuable edition of the
                    “Scriptores Rei Rusticae,” we are indebted to Gesner, Lipsiae, 1735, 2 tom. 4to.
                    Lips. 1773-4, 2 tom. 4to. And another edition, described as the best, was more
                    recently published by Schneider, Lips. 1794-7, 4 tom. 8vo. Of Varro’s treatise
                    on agriculture, an English translation was published by the Rev. T. Owcn, Lond.
                    1800, 8vo.</p>
                <p>Of both works of Varro there are several editions, and the earliest is that of
                    Scaliger. Exc. H. Stephanus, 1569, 8vo. It was reprinted at Paris in 1573, 1581,
                    and 1585. A collective edition of these two works, and the fragments of his
                    other works, was published by Ausonius Popma, Lugd. Bat. 1601, 8vo. the same
                    editor had previously made a collection of the Fragmenta, Franequerae, 1589,
                    8vo. Another edition of all his works was published not long afterwards,
                    Durdrechti, 1619, 8vo. Some copies of the same edition exhibit the imprint of
                    Amsterdam, 1623. (x.)</p>
