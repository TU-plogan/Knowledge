                <p><label type="entry">VALDO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Waldo, Peter</hi></label>,
                    frequently described as the Lyonese reformer of the twelfth century, appears in
                    contemporary documents under the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Valdes.</hi>
                    In the earliest existing documents he is called <hi rend="italic">Valdes</hi>
                    (by W. Mapes,) and <hi rend="italic">Valdesius</hi> (by the Chronicler of Laon),
                        <hi rend="italic">Valdesius, Valdius, Valdensis, Waldius,</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Walderιsis.</hi> Unless he derived his name from some
                    locality, Valdes or Valdo was his right appellation. The latter is of very
                    common occurrence in Gallic and Germanic documents, from the ninth to the
                    twelfth century, and <hi rend="italic">W</hi> is the Germano-Burgundian
                    spelling. It is uncertain why or where he was first named <hi rend="italic"
                        >Peter.</hi> His praenomen <hi rend="italic">Petrus</hi> occurs, we believe
                    for the first time, in a Latin book of Peter de Polichdorf, written during the
                    last half of the fourteenth century.</p>
                <p>Contemporary and documentary history is silent as to the place and date of
                    Valdo’s birth, and the events of his earlier days; but tradition states that he
                    was bom in a place which, by some, has been called Vaud, Vaux, Vaudram; by
                    others Walden and Val-Grant. There is still a village near Lyon called Vaux, and
                    another in the mountain region, between Mont Dauphiné and Briançon, called Vaux
                    de Rame. The first authentic mention of the Gallic reformer appears in the
                    Chronicle of Laon, under the year 1173. He is there introduced to our notice as
                    a citizen of Lyon, who, having amassed considerable wealth by usurious
                    practices, had his conscience alarmed in a very remarkable manner. One Sunday,
                    in the year 1173, hearing a Troubadour in the streets of the city, reciting
                    passages from the Romaunt called the “Life of Alexis,” Valdo invited him home,
                    and listened with earnest attention to the whole of the poem. Alexis, as the
                    legend tells us, was a saint of eminent piety, who was so dead to all the
                    attractions of this world, that he fled from the house of a wealthy father, and
                    left his young bride on the day of his marriage, to devote himself to a fife of
                    poverty and mortification. After seventeen years of self-imposed exile, he
                    returned to the paternal abode, in the character of a mendicant, and for many
                    years received daily relief at his father’s door, without making himself known.
                    At his death a written paper revealed his secret. The narrative made a deep
                    impression on the mind of Valdo, of which the Troubadour<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In those days, many of the jongleurs and
                            wandering troubadours often combined the several characters of pedlars,
                            poets and religious Instructors. They were a privileged order, whose
                            harp, and song, and news, obtained for them admission into the castles
                            of the lierons, and the houses of the citizens. They would oftentimes
                            begin by diverting their hearers, and. after touching some string which
                            roused devout feelings, they would launch into sacred subjects, produce
                            transcripts of Scripture, and converse on the deepest points of sacred
                            truth.</p></note> failed not to take advantage. Moved by the serious
                    discourse of his guest, Valdo went the next morning to unburthen his mind to a
                    priest of great reputation in the city, and consulted him as to what he should
                    do for the attainment of Christian perfection. “If thou wouldest be perfect,”
                    was the answer, “Go, sell all thou hast, and give to the poor.” Valdo resolved
                    to obey the injunction to the very letter. He converted his property into money;
                    he placed his two daughters in the convent of Fontevrault;<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In Poitou. A fraternity, called “The Poor
                            of Christ,” was settled here in 1103, under the government of a woman;
                            an institution which has been severely attacked by Bayle.</p></note> he
                    distributed largely to the poor; he fed all who came to him three days in the
                    week; and on the festival of the assumption of the Virgin Mary, he publicly
                    proclaimed his intention of abandoning the service of mammon for that or God <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">,</hi> and invited his fellow-citizens to follow his
                    example. His wife, alarmed by these proceedings, implored the archbishop of Lyon
                    to check the imprudent zeal of her husband, and that prelate and his suffragan,
                    the bishop of Bourg-en-Bresse, gave Valdo some advice upon the occasion. Nothing
                    however could damp his ardour; he persevered in his system of self-denial, and
                    gained over a number of followers, who imitated his example, by embracing
                    voluntary poverty, and by ministering bountifully to the wants of the poor.</p>
                <p>A severe famine, which desolated the whole of Gaul at this time, gave them full
                    opportunities of exercising the virtue of almsgiving, and they did so to the
                    very utmost. Forming themselves into a fraternity, under the name of “Poor Men
                    of Lyon,” Valdo and his disciples at first made themselves conspicuous, by the
                    sanctity of their lives only, but they soon began to attract further notice, by
                    rebuking the rapaciousness and corrupt manners of the ecclesiastical and monkish
                    orders. Here indeed was ample room for complaint: the ignorance and profligacy
                    of the clergy, with some few bright exceptions, were the scandal of the church;
                    and we require not the evidence of her adversaries—that of churchmen is quite
                    sufficient—to establish this fact. It was a long course of wickedness in high
                    places, and inefficiency on the part of those who called themselves the
                    successors of the apostles, and the lawfully appointed ministers of Christ,
                    which prepared the way for such a work as Valdo had to perform. But though he
                    was one of the most eminent of early reformers, he was not the first to rouse
                    Christendom from her unholy slumbers, and to say to those who slept, “awake !”
                    Even before the scenes at Orleans in 1017, described by Glaber, voices had been
                    heard, almost simultaneously, from Germany, France, and Italy, protesting
                    against ecclesiastical corruptions; and we have the testimony of Bernard of
                    Clairvaux, Peter of Clugny, and Evervinus of Cologne, who flourished between
                    1120 and 1150, to prove that, in that age, zealous and holy men were to be
                    found, who declaimed against the vices and errors of the clergy, and proposed
                    schemes of reformation.</p>
                <p>By degrees, Valdo and the Poor Men of Lyon took upon themselves to exhort and to
                    admonish, in fact to preach both in public and private. “Coeperunt paulatim,”
                    says the Chronicle of Laon, “tam publicis quam privatis admonitionibus sua et
                    aliena culpare peccata.” This was no slight matter of exasperation to a powerful
                    body of men, whose priesthood was disgraced by priestcraft; but another
                    proceeding of the reformer called forth their fiercest animosity. Valdo employed
                    his time and property on one of the most useful and sacred objects to which a
                    Christian could dedicate himself, the translation and circulation of Scripture
                    in the vernacular tongue of the country, and for this he has never been forgiven
                    by the successors of Hildebrand. To lock up Scripture, or to refuse the free use
                    of it, was one of the novelties of an imperious and jealous church, and a
                    disproof of the infallibility of popes and councils. In 841, the third council
                    of Tours decreed, in its seventh canon, that bishops should promote scriptural
                    instruction by translations of certain homilies and psalms in the vulgar tongue,
                    “in rusticam Romanam linguam aut Theotiscam.” In the twelfth and thirteenth
                    centuries, a new light broke in upon Christian hierarchs, or they began to
                    prefer darkness to light, and it was forbidden by councils<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=584" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0584-0546"
                    /> to turn Scripture into vernacular languages for the use of the people. The
                    manner in which Valdo set about his work, attests the soundness of his judgment,
                    as well as the devotedness of his zeal. In the first place, he obtained the
                    assistance of three eminent scholars, who had a critical acquaintance with the
                    sacred writings; Bernard of Ydros, who was afterwards held in great estimation
                    by the Dominican order; Stephen of Ansa or Empsa, eminent as a grammarian and
                    linguist, who was promoted in course of time to a benefice in the city of
                        Lyon;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stephen de

                    the head of a religious congregation in Lombardy. The latter was the only one of
                    the three who remained faithful to the cause of Valdo, and the silence of the
                    two former, after they deserted him, as to any spots in his moral character, is
                    a strong attestation in his favour. Stephen translated into the Gallo-Provençal
                    language, John examined authorities and corrected the translations, and Bernard
                    transcribed the version so prepared for the use of the copyists, who were to
                    multiply copies for general circulation. But not satisfied with these means for
                    procuring correct translations of the Bible, Valdo also collected sentences of
                    the ancient fathers, particularly of Ambrose, Augustin, Gregory, and Jerome<note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Moneta contra
                            Valdenses, lib. v. c. 1.</p></note>? in illustration of the b∞ks of
                    Scripture, of which copies were to be made; and these, too, he put in
                    circulation to serve as notes or comments for the help of his Scripture readers.
                    This being done, the master and his disciples committed many passages of
                    Scripture to memory, and thus armed with the word of God, they went forth into
                    the streets and the houses of Lyon, and into the villages of the neighbourhood,
                    and delivered the gospel message with so much ardour and success, as largely to
                    increase the number of their adherents. In some few places the churches were
                    open to them by consent of the secular clergy; and where they could not have
                    access to the sanctuaries, they preached and expounded Scripture in the streets
                    and highways. It is uncertain how many books of the Bible were translated and
                    circulated by the Lyonese Reformer, and the Poor Men of Lyons. Walter Mapes
                    says, that the volume of Valdo which was presented to Pope Alexander, contained
                    the text and a gloss of the <hi rend="italic">Psalms,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >of many books</hi> of the Old and New Testament. Reiner leads us to
                    believe, that the whole of the New Testament was circulated by them, in the
                    vulgar tongue. Stephen de Borbone speaks only of <hi rend="italic">many
                        books</hi> of the Bible, without designating them. The effect produced by
                    the gospel tidings, as they were delivered by these new expounders, was felt
                    like an electric spark throughout the whole of the province and diocese of Lyon.
                    The common people heard them gladly, for now, for the first time in their lives,
                    they listened to preachers who spoke in the language of Scripture, and pointed
                    to the sacred page, in confirmation of every doctrine which they urged.</p>
                <p>After persevering in this course for five years, Valdo found that the increasing
                    enmity of the monks and clergy of Lyons had become dangerous to him. In 1178, he
                    therefore took the bold and honest step of going to Rome, to make his views
                    known to the sovereign pontiff Alexander III. and to request the papal sanction
                    to his proceedings.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                            ><p>Chronicle of Laon. See Bouquet, vol. xiii. p. 680.</p></note> In
                    fact, he asked the pope to recognize his fraternity of the “Poor Men of Lyon” as
                    an ecclesiastical order of authorised preachers, and licensed circulators of
                    Scripture. Never did the founder of a religious community experience a better
                    reception from prince or pontiff. The pope embraced Valdo, “Valdesium amplexatus
                    est papa, approbans votum quod fuerat voluntariae paupertatis, &amp;c.” says the
                    faithful narrator whom we have before cited.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>Ibid.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> He approved of the order of the “Poor Men of
                    Lyon” as professors of voluntary poverty; but while he gave them a limited
                    license as preachers, he forbade them to exercise it without the especial
                    permission of the regular priesthood. Up to this period the conduct of Valdo and
                    his disciples had been irreproachable even at Rome, or the pope would not have
                    shown him such favour. In fact, all his proceedings hitherto had been strongly
                    characteristic of one who acted as a dutiful member of the holy Catholic church.
                    It was a church-legend which first made a serious impression upon him; it was to
                    a priest that he first went for spiritual counsel, after his conscience had been
                    awakened. The adviser whom he next consulted was a bishop; so closely did he
                    observe the canon of Ignatius, “nihil sine episcopo.” He placed his daughters in
                    a convent; an act which savoured of the most rigid adherence to ecclesiastical
                    customs. The holy book on which the church builds its faith was his constant
                    study; and his chosen fellow-labourers in the work of transcribing and
                    translating, were members of the sacerdotal order. So blameless was his career,
                    and so conscious was he himself of the purity of his motives, that he sought, as
                    we have shewn, an interview with him who was called the supreme Head of the
                    Church, and was received with indulgence and honour. The childlike submission
                    and meekness of this exemplary Christian were carried to such an extent, that
                    for a time he obeyed the pope, and forbore to preach, except on the terms
                    imposed upon him. At length however his ardent zeal, sharpened by the opposition
                    of the clergy, who hated the spirituality and fervour which condemned their own
                    negligence, could no longer be restrained, and he preached without their
                    permission. He and his disciples were commanded by episcopal authority not to
                    speak at all, nor preach in the name of Jesus; they answered as Peter and John
                    had done before the council at Jerusalem. They were accused of a presumptuous
                    usurpation of the apostolic office, and were again admonished to be silent, on
                    pain of the severest ecclesiastical censure. They however persevered, and from
                    disobedience, says one of our historical witnesses, they fell into contumacy,
                    and from contumacy, into the penalty of excommunication.<note anchored="true"

                    ® The fearful sentence, which was meant to deprive them of all the ordinances of
                    religion, to exclude them from the church and the altar, to deny baptism to
                    their children, burial to their dead, marriage to their betrothed, and to banish
                    them from Lyon, was passed by John de Bellesmains, archbishop of Lyon, in 1181.
                    Pope Lucius confirmed the excommunication in 1184. In the Lateran council of
                    1215, the same dread sentence was again fulminated against ali who should
                    embrace their doctrines, or receive them into their houses. They were driven
                    ignominiously from their homes; and seeing no hope of producing a reformation in
                    the bosom of the imperious church, out of which they had been cast, or of being
                    received back into it, without doing violence to their consciences, Valdo and
                    his followers had no other alternative than to form themselves into a community,
                    in which persons, selected from their own body, were appointed to perform the
                    offices of religion, and administer the sacraments.<note anchored="true"

                            corruptions of the Latin church. Monets, the most dispassionate of all
                            their accusers, states that Valdo “ordinem habuit ab universitate
                            fratrum suorum,” and that a Lombard separatist was his authority for
                            this statement. Moneta contra Valdenses, lib. v. c. 1.</p></note> Thus
                    Valdo and the “Poor Men,” or “Valdenses of Lyon" were not voluntary seceders
                    from the dominant church, but they were thrust out of her, and Rome, contrary to
                    her usual policy, which is to turn enthusiasm to account <pb break="no"

                    which rent from her communion some of the most devout Christians of France, and
                    of several other countries, in which the doctrines of the Lyonese reformers
                    gradually found recipients.</p>
                <p>The “Poor Men of Lyon,” exiled from their native city, found refuge in the
                    secluded parts of Provence and Lombardy, and were hospitably received there by
                    persons who held kindred opinions. The document, which states this, points to
                    religious communities on each side of the Cottian Alps, to the territorial
                    Waldenses of ecclesiastical history, whose situation providentially enabled them
                    to maintain in safety opinions at variance with those of Rome. A remarkable
                    passage in the authority which gives us this information, adds that the exiles
                    imbibed the errors of these subalpine heretics, and became, when they mingled
                    with them, the most determined enemies of the church.<note anchored="true"

                <p>From this time the “Poor Men of Lyon,” and the Val-denses (territorially so
                    called) of the Cottian Alps, became mixed up in ecclesiastical history, as if
                    they were one and the same. But the former, after their exile from Lyon, were
                    never gathered together in any one district or province as a distinct people,
                    but were scattered among the nations; and those who embraced their tenets,
                    sometimes adhered to them openly, sometimes secretly, but never in sufficient
                    numbers, or local strength, to constitute a church. When or where Valdo died,
                    remains in obscurity, but his name was given to almost every sect who protested
                    against papal usurpation.</p>
                <p>A happier destiny was reserved for the subalpine Valdenses. They were the
                    inhabitants of a mountain tract of country, where they constituted the majority
                    of the population; and at this hour the remains of them form an established
                    church, and a well known and intelligent religious community in a region of
                    Piedmont.</p>
                <p>The persecutions which, for 200 years, swept Europe of all who were called
                    Valdenses, except in the subalpine territories, were an outrage upon humanity,
                    and have fixed an indelible stigma on the church of Rome. Her offended pride was
                    satisfied with nothing short of death, whenever she could cause it to be
                    inflicted on those who dared to dispute her authority; and Stephen de Borbone
                    relates, without a breath of compunction, that he was present when eighty of
                    Valdo’s sect were condemned to the flames. Albericus the chronicler states the
                    number to have been 182, and speaks of it as a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling
                    savour acceptable to the Lord,—“Holocaustum placabile Domino.” But with all the
                    animosity of the early persecutors of Valdo and his disciples, they have not
                    recorded one well authenticated accusation of immorality against them. It is a
                    singular attestation to the moral and religious character of Valdo, that none of
                    those calumnies, which were afterwards circulated by Roman catholic writers,
                    were advanced against him during his lifetime. The chronicle of Laon briefly
                    mentions his disobedience in preaching without permission, and the ruin and
                    scandal which it occasioned.</p>
                <p>Walter Mapes, who was present at Rome when Valdo appealed to the pope, indulges
                    in a vein of irony against the Valdesii, who wanted to reform the church; he
                    ridiculed them as a parcel of “houseless,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    the vulgar tongue, and the estimation in which they held those of their sect who
                    embraced a life of poverty, and believed in justification by faith. We may
                    therefore consider that all the licentious tales which have been told at the

                    is not improbable; but we have no contemporary evidence in proof of their having
                    departed from the strictest rules of moral and religious purity, or of their
                    having been guilty of any other than the unpardonable offence of disobeying a
                    spiritual authority, which had become as tyrannical in the exercise of its
                    power, as it was remiss in the discharge of the sacred trusts committed to it.
