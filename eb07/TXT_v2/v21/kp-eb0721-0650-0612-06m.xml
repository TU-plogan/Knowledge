                <p><label type="entry">VESUVIUS</label>, a celebrated volcano of Italy, six miles
                    east from the city of Naples. This mountain has two tops; one of which only goes
                    by the name of <hi rend="italic">Vesuvius,</hi> the other being now called <hi
                        rend="italic">Somma;</hi> but Sir William Hamilton is of opinion, that the
                    latter is what the ancients called <hi rend="italic">Vesuvius.</hi> The
                    perpendicular height of Vesuvius is only 3700 feet, though the ascent from the
                    foot to the top is three Italian miles. One side of the mountain is well
                    cultivated and fertile, producing great plenty of vines, but the south and west
                    sides are entirely covered with cinders and ashes; while a sulphureous smoke
                    constantly issues from the top, sometimes attended with the most violent
                    explosions of stones, the emission of great streams of lava, and all the other
                    attendants of a most formidable volcano. The first of these eruptions recorded
                    in history took place in the year 79; at which time the two cities of Pompeii
                    and Herculaneum were entirely buried under the stones and ashes thrown out.
                    Incredible mischief was also done to the neighbouring country, and numbers of
                    people lost their lives, among whom was the elder Pliny.</p>
                <p>It is the opinion of the best judges, however, that this eruption was by no means
                    the first that had ever happened. The very streets of those cities which were at
                    that time overwhelmed, are said to be partly paved with lava. Since that time
                    thirty different eruptions have been recorded, some of which have been extremely
                    violent. In the year 1538, a mountain, three miles in circumference, and a
                    quarter of a mile in perpendicular height, was thrown up in the course of one
                    night.</p>
                <p>The first great eruption taken notice of by Sir William Hamilton was that of
                    1767, which, though very violent, was mild in comparison with that of 1538. From
                    this time Vesuvius never ceased for ten years to send forth smoke, nor were
                    there many months in which it did not throw out stones, scoriae, and cinders;
                    which, increasing to a certain degree, were usually followed by lava; so that
                    from the year 1767 to 1779 there were nine eruptions, some of them very
                    considerable. In the month of August that year, an eruption took place, which,
                    for its extraordinary and terrible appearance, has been generally reckoned among
                    the most remarkable of any recorded concerning this or any other volcano. We
                    cannot, however, afford room for any description of it here, or of the various
                    eruptions which have since taken place. See <hi rend="smallcaps"
