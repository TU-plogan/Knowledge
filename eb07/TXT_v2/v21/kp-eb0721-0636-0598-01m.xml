                        Air.</hi> —Doors and windows, the only sources for the ingress of air in
                    ordinary apartments, should be avoided as a means of introducing air in all new
                    buildings, and independent apertures and flues provided, entirely under the
                    control of valves, by whose action the amount of ingress can be regulated with
                    precision. Further, in every apartment foul air should be led from the greatest
                    altitude by similar independent flues. The ordinary construction often
                    interferes seriously with ventilation, foul air descending sometimes in one and
                    escaping in another. Analteration in the structure of houses, introducing one
                    principal chimney, in which the flues from all the apartments ultimately join,
                    would be a great improvement in this respect; and even for whole streets and
                    districts one large shaft would be sufficient. To any who studies attentively
                    the movement of currents of air, numerous other changes will present themselves
                    as being equally desirable in the habitations of the rich and of the poor. In
                    public buildings, the foul air, from hundreds of apartments, will be removed by
                    a single shaft.</p>
                <p>The reader who is anxious to extend his knowledge of this subject, will find much
                    information in the Parliamentary Reports, particularly on the Ventilating and
                    Acoustic arrangements of the present House of Commons, on the Ventilation of
                    Mines, in many of the Reports on Education and on Manufactures, in which the
                    health of the children has more particularly engaged attention; in the Reports
                    on Improving the Health of Large Towns, and in some Statistical Reports on the
                    Health of the Army and Navy. Tredgold on Warming and Ventilating, is a work of
                    great value, and the different memoirs and treatises of D'Arcet, present
                    numerous important details. In Dr Arnott’s work on Warming and Ventilating, a
                    full description of his stove is given; and in Hood’s, and also Richardson’s
                    treatise on the same subjects, the different varieties of hot water apparatus
                    are explained. In Dr Reid’s Chemistry of the Atmosphere, and Illustrations of
                    Warming and Ventilating, the result of numerous experiments is given on the
                    ventilation of public buildings and private dwelling-houses, and the ventilation
                    of ships, manufactories, &amp;c.</p>

                    atmosphere, the diffusion of gases, the fluctuations of the barometer, the
                    indications of the hygrometer; the <hi rend="italic">plenum movement,</hi> when
                    the pressure of the air within, from mechanical means, exceeds that without the
                    apartment ventilated; the <hi rend="italic">vacuum movement,</hi> when the
                    reverse is induced; the <hi rend="italic">downward and lateral</hi> current,
                    especially the former, which is so important in protecting works of art exposed
                    in public assemblies; the precautions necessary where it may be introduced, the
                    influence of different varieties of clothing, of medicated atmospheres, of moist
                    and dry air baths at different temperatures, and of fumigation, are all objects
                    of inquiry that bear practically on ventilation. The peculiar arrangements in
                    various mines, hospitals, and manufactories, especially where offensive vapours
                    are condensed or destroyed, likewise afford many valuable illustrations of its
                    practice. (<hi rend="smallcaps">d. g</hi>.)</p>
