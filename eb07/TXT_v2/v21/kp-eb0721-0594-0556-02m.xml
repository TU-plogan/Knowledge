                <p><label type="entry">VANDYCK, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Αντηονυ</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated painter, was born at Antwerp in the year 1599. After giving early
                    proofs of his genius, he became the disciple of the illustrious Rubens. In the
                    church of the Augustines at Antwerp, at the high altar, is a celebrated picture
                    of Rubens, representing, in one part, the Virgin Mary sitting with the child
                    Jesus in her lap, and in another part several saints, male and female, standing.
                    The breast of one of these, St. Sebastian, is said to have been painted by
                    Vandyck when he was only a disciple of Rubens. This great master being engaged
                    one day abroad, his disciples went into his painting-room, where, after having
                    been some time employed in admiring his works, they began to romp in such a
                    manner, that the breast of St. Sebastian, which was not yet dry, was brushed
                    away by a hat thrown at random. This accident put an end to their play: they
                    were very anxious to restore it, fearing that if Rubens discovered it they
                    should all be discarded. At length it was agreed that Anthony should undertake
                    to mend the saint’s breast. In short, taking his master’s pallet and brushes, he
                    succeeded so well that his companions imagined Rubens would overlook it. They
                    were mistaken; for Rubens at his return knew immediately that some one had
                    touched his performance: calling his disciples, he asked them why any one had
                    dared to meddle with his painting. They were some time doubtful whether they
                    should confess or deny the fact. Threats at length prevailed; they owned that
                    Vandyck had thrown his hat upon it. Upon this, closeting Vandyck, instead of
                    chiding him, he told him, that “it was proper and even necessary for him to
                    travel into Italy, the only school that produced excellent painters.” By this
                    advice, and with the assistance of his master, he set out for Italy, about the
                    year 1621, being then about twenty-one or twenty-two years of age. Having staid
                    a short time at Rome, he removed to Venice, where he attained the beautiful
                    colouring of Titian, Paul Veronese, and the Venetian school.</p>
                <p>After a few years he returned to Flanders, with so noble, so easy, and natural a
                    manner of painting, that Titian himself was hardly his superior; and no other
                    master could equal him in portraits. Soon after his return, he accidentally met
                    with D. Teniers, who accosted him with great politeness, and asked him whether
                    he had much business since he came from Rome? “What business, think you, can I
                    have had time to do ?” replied Vandyck: “I am only just arrived here. Would you
                    believe, that I offered to draw that fat brewer’s picture who just passed by us
                    for two pistoles, and that the looby laughed in my face, saying it was too dear?
                    I assure you, that if the cards do not turn up better, I shall make no long stay
                    at Brussels." Soon after this, he painted those two famous pictures, the
                    Nativity and a dying Christ; the first in the parish church, the second in that
                    of the Capuchins, at Termond.</p>
                <p>Vandyck, finding he could not make a fortune in his own country, adopted the
                    resolution of visiting England. Accordingly he borrowed some guineas of Teniers,
                    and set out, furnished with letters of recommendation. His superior genius soon
                    brought him into great reputation; and above all, he excelled in portraits,
                    which he drew with an <pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.12945678&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=595" xml:id="kp-eb0721-0595-0557"
                    />inconceivable facility, and for which he charged a very high price, according
                    to the instructions which had been given him on that head. It is affirmed, that
                    for some of them he received 400 guineas a-piece. He soon found himself loaded
                    with honours and riches; and as he had a noble and generous heart, he lived
                    suitably to his fortune. He married Maria Ruthven, grand-daughter of the first
                    earl of Gowrie; and though she had but little fortune, maintained her in a style
                    equal to her birth. He generally kept a magnificent equipage, and a numerous
                    retinue. He died in Blackfriars on the 9th of December 1641, at the early age of
                    forty-two, and was buried in St. Paul’s near the tomb of John of Gaunt. He left
                    a daughter, married to Mr. Stepney, the grandfather of George Stepney the poet.
                    Lady Vandyck was afterwards married to Richard the son of Sir John Pryse of
                    Newton-Averbecham, but by her second husband she had no issue,</p>
