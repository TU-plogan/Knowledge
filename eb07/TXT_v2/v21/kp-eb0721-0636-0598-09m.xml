                    of a bishop, with a cathedral of modern style; and contains nine parish
                    churches, ten monasteries, and seven nunneries, some of the first remarkable for
                    their architecture. There is also an episcopal seminary, and a grammar school.

                    silk, and in cultivating rice and other grain. Among the inhabitants are many
                    noble families, who, though poor, still retain magnificent palaces. Lat. 46. 20.
