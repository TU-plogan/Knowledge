VALVE, in Hydraulics, Pneumatics, &c. is a kind of lid or cover of a tube or vessel, so contrived as to open one way, but which, the more forcibly it is pressed the other way, the closer it shuts the aperture; so that it either admits the entrance of a fluid into the tube or vessel, and prevents its return; or admits its escape, and prevents its reentrance.
