                <p><label type="entry">XIMENA</label>, a city of Spain, in the province of
                    Andalusia, about twenty-five miles from the British fortress of Gibraltar. It is
                    utterly inaccessible for any kind of wheelcarriages. It was once a place of
                    importance, as it gave the title of king to Abou Melic, the son of the emperor
                    of Fez. In more ancient times, it was a Roman station, as is proved by the walls
                    of the castle, and by numerous inscriptions which have been found in its
                    vicinity. The town lies under the shelter of a rocky ledge, which is detached
                    from the mass of the lofty mountains, and is crowned with the ruined towers of
                    an ancient castle, which forms a picturesque view from the surrounding country.
                    Ximena is nearly a mile in length, and principally consists of two long narrow
                    streets, one extending from north to south, and the other leading up to the
                    castle: the alleys between them are in steps up the steep side of the impending
                    hill, and can only be reached on foot. The old castle, of Roman foundation, but
                    of Moorish superstructure, is accessible only on the side of the town, and in
                    former days must have been impregnable. This citadel is 400 yards in length, and
                    varies in breadth from fifty to eighty yards. It is surrounded by a turreted
                    wall, except where the scarped rock has rendered it unnecessary. It has been
                    provided with vaulted tanks and magazines, but from neglect they are in a
                    dilapidated state. It was exposed to great injury in 1811, when it was partially
                    blown up by General Ballasteros, who abandoned it on the approach of the French,
                    to seek a more sure protection under the guns of Gibraltar. The town at the
                    present day is poor, containing about 8000 inhabitants, who are chiefly occupied
                    in agriculture; but many are employed in the seductive but hazardous trade of
                    smuggling tobacco and other goods from Gibraltar into the interior of Spain. The
                    river Sogarganta runs at the foot of the place, and has on its left bank the
                    ruins of a vast building, erected sixty years ago for the purpose of casting
                    cannon-balls for the siege of the British fortress.</p>
