                <p><label type="entry">ZUINGLIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ulricus</hi>, or <hi
                            rend="italic">Ulrich Zwingli</hi></label>, an able and zealous reformer,
                    who laid the foundation of a separation from Rome in Switzerland, at the time
                    when Luther was similarly employed in Saxony, was born on the first of January
                    1504, at Wildehausen in Tockenburg, a distinct republic in alliance with the
                    Swiss confederation. He was sent to school at Basel, and afterwards at Berne,
                    where he learned the Greek and Hebrew languages. He studied philosophy at
                    Vienna, and divinity at Basel, where he took the degree of A. Μ. in 1506. While
                    he officiated as preacher at Zürich, a Franciscan sent by Leo X. came to publish
                    indulgences there; against which Zuinglius, after the example of Luther,
                    declaimed powerfully. In the course of this opposition he started a new
                    doctrine, which he called <hi rend="italic">Evangelical Truth;</hi> and from the
                    beginning of 1519 to 1523, he preached not only against indulgences, but against
                    other articles of the Romish church. But though Zuinglius made no less progress
                    than Luther, he conducted himself with more moderation; and wishing to have the
                    concurrence of the civil powers, procured two assemblies to be called at Zürich.
                    By the first, he was authorized to proceed as he had begun; and by the second,
                    the outward worship and ceremonies of the church of Rome were abolished. During
                    these transactions, Zuinglius published several books in defence of his
                    doctrines; but treating of the eucharist, and prescribing a form of celebrating
                    the Lord’s Supper different from Luther, he was involved in violent disputes
                    with the rest of his reforming brethren. Respecting the divine decrees, the
                    opinion of Zuinglius and his followers differed very little from that of the
                    Pelagians; and instead of declaring, with Calvin, that the church is a separate
                    independent body, vested with the right of legislation for itself, Zuinglius
                    ascribed to the civil magistrate an absolute and unbounded power in religious
                    matters, allowing at the same time a certain subordination among the ministers
                    of the church. This was abundantly agreeable to the magistrates of Zürich; but
                    the rest of the Swiss cantons disallowing of their proceedings, the opposite
                    parties had recourse to arms; and Zuinglius, who began as a preacher, died as a
                    soldier, in 1531. His works have been published in four volumes folio.</p>
