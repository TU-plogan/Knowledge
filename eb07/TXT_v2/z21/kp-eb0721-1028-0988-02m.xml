                <p><label type="entry">ZEUXIS</label>, a celebrated painter, flourished about 400
                    years before the Christian era. He was born at Heraclea; but as there have been
                    many cities of that name, it cannot be certainly determined which of them had
                    the honour of his birth. Some learned men however conjecture that it was the
                    Heraclea near Crotona in Italy. He carried painting to a much higher degree of
                    perfection than Apollodorus had left it; discovered the art of properly
                    disposing lights and shades, and particularly excelled in colouring. He amassed
                    immense riches, and then resolved to sell no more of his pictures, but gave them
                    away; saying very frankly, that he could not set a price on them equal to their
                    value. Before this time he made people pay for seeing them; and nobody was
                    admitted to see his Helena without ready money, which occasioned the wags
                    calling his picture <hi rend="italic">Helen the courtezan.</hi> It is not known
                    whether this Helen of Zeuxis was the same with that which was at Rome in Pliny’s
                    time, or that which he painted for the inhabitants of Crotona, to be hung up in
                    the temple of Juno. This last he painted from five beautiful girls of that city,
                    copying from each her greatest excellencies. Pliny observes, that this admirable
                    painter, disputing for the prize of painting with Parrhasius, painted some
                    grapes so naturally that the birds flew down to peck them. Parrhasius, on the
                    other hand, painted a curtain so very artfully, that Zeuxis, mistaking it for a
                    real one that hid his rival’s work, ordered the curtain to be drawn aside, to
                    show what Parrhasius had done; but having found his mistake, he ingenuously
                    confessed himself vanquished, since he had imposed only upon birds, while
                    Parrhasius had deceived even a master of the art. Another time he painted a boy
                    loaded with grapes; when the birds also flew to this picture, at which he was
                    vexed, and confessed that his work was not sufficiently finished, since, had he
                    painted the boy as perfectly as the grapes, the birds would have been afraid of
                    him. Archelaus king of Macedon made use of Zeuxis’s pencil for the embellishment
                    of his palace. One of this painter’s finest pieces was a Hercules strangling
                    some serpents in his cradle, in the presence of his affrighted mother; but he
                    himself chiefly esteemed lιis Athleta, or Champion, under which he placed a
                    Greek verse that afterwards became very famous, and in which he says, “that it
                    was easier to criticise than to imitate the picture.” He made a present of his
                    Alcmena to the Agrigentines. Zeuxis did not value himself on speedily finishing
                    his pictures; but knowing that Agatharchus gloried in his being able to paint
                    with ease and in a little time, he said, “that for his part he, on the contrary,
                    gloried in his slowness; and if he was long in painting, it was because he
                    painted for eternity.” Verrius Flaccus says that Zeuxis having painted an old
                    woman, he laughed so very heartily at the sight of this picture that he died;
                    but as no other of the ancients has mentioned this particular, there is the
                    greatest reason to believe it fabulous. Carlo Dati has composed in Italian the
                    Life of Zeuxis, with those of Parrhasius, Apelles, and Protogenes. This work was
                    printed at Florence in 1667.</p>
