                <p><label type="entry">ZIEGENHAM</label>, a province of the principality of
                    Hesse-Cassel, in Germany, formerly a sovereign state, which came under the
                    Hessian family in 1540. It is bounded on the north and the north-east by Lower
                    Hesse, on the south-east by Hersfeld, on the south by Great Hesse, on the
                    south-west by Fritzlar, and on the west by Upper Hesse. It extends over 218
                    square miles, and contains six cities and towns, seventy-three villages, and
                    twenty-two hamlets, with 32,400 inhabitants. The capital is the city of the same
                    name, in a marshy situation. It is surrounded with dilapidated walls, has a
                    castle, in which the archives of the Hessian family are preserved; but only
                    contains 260 houses, with 1280 inhabitants.</p>
