                <p><label type="entry">ZOROASTER, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Zerdusht</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated ancient philosopher, said to have been the reformer or the founder of
                    the religion of the Magi. It is wholly uncertain to how many eminent men the
                    name of Zoroaster belonged. Some have maintained that there was but one
                    Zoroaster, and that he was a Persian; others have said that there were six
                    eminent founders of philosophy of this name. Ham the son of Noah, Moses, Osiris.
                    Mithras, and others, both gods and men, have by different writers been asserted
                    to have been the same with Zoroaster. Many different opinions have also been
                    advanced concerning the time when he flourished. Aristotle and Pliny fix the
                    date at so remote a period as 6000 years before the death of Plato. According to
                    Dionysius Laertius, he flourished 600 years before the Trojan war; according to
                    Suidas, 500. If, in the midst of so much uncertainty, any thing can be advanced
                    with the appearance of probability, it seems to be this, that there was a
                    Zoroaster, a Perso-Median, who flourished about the time of Darius Hystaspes;
                    and that besides him there was another Zoroaster, who lived at a much more
                    remote period among the Babylonians, and taught them astronomy. The Greek and
                    Arabian writers are agreed concerning the existence of the Persian Zoroaster;
                    and the ancients unanimously ascribe to a philosopher whom they call Zoroaster,
                    the origin of the Chaldean astronomy, which is certainly of much earlier date
                    than the time of Hystaspes. It seems therefore necessary to suppose a Chaldean
                    Zoroaster distinct from the Persian. Concerning this Zoroaster however nothing
                    more is known than that he flourished towards the beginning of the Babylonish
                    empire, and was the father of the Chaldean astrology and magic. All the writings
                    that have been ascribed to Zoroaster are unquestionably spurious.</p>
