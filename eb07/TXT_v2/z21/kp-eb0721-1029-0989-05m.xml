                <p><label type="entry">ZODIAC</label>, a broad circle, whose middle is the ecliptic,
                    and its extremes two circles parallel thereto, at such a distance from it as to
                    bound or comprehend the excursions of the sun and planets. See <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Astronomy.</hi> It is a curious enough fact, that the solar
                    division of the Indian zodiac is the same in substance with that of the Greeks,
                    and yet that it has not been borrowed either from the Greeks or the Arabians.
                    The identity, or at least striking similarity, of the division, is universally
                    known; and Montucla has endeavoured to prove that the Brahmins received it from
                    the Arabs. His opinion, we believe, was very generally admitted; but Sir William
                    Jones has adduced a variety of arguments which seem to prove that neither of
                    those nations borrowed that division from the other; that it has been known
                    among the Hindus from time immemorial; and that it was probably invented by the
                    first progenitors of that race, whom he considers, before their dispersion, as
                    the most ancient of mankind. See Asiatic Researches, vol. ii.</p>
