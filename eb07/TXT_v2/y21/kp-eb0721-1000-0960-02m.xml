                <p><label type="entry">YEMEN</label>, a large province of Arabia, comprehending its
                    finest and most fertile portion, situated partly on the Red Sea and partly on
                    the Indian Ocean. It is surrounded by the provinces of Hadramaut, Nedjed, and
                    Hedjaz. It was celebrated by the ancients under the title of Arabia Felix, but
                    modern researches do not by any means justify this appellation: some parts are
                    no doubt fertile, but in general it is barren and unproductive. It is divided
                    into two parts, differing greatly in soil and climate. The plain of the Tehama,
                    which forms a broad belt along the whole of the coast, consists almost entirely
                    of a waste of dry and unproductive sand. It is about two days’ journey in
                    breadth, and is scorched by torrid heats. The Djcbal, or mountainous district,
                    in the interior, presents in many parts a more agreeable aspect. The hills,
                    though precipitous, are fertile in many spots, and enjoy a more temperate air.
                    The lower declivities are covered with trees and aromatic shrubs, and the
                    mountain chains are divided by fine valleys, which, being watered by numerous
                    streams, can be advantageously cultivated. The natives are industrious
                    agriculturists, though their instruments are rude; and in many districts the
                    fields are cultivated like gardens. The grains chiefly raised are barley,
                    millet, and dhourra: there is not an adequate supply of water for the
                    cultivation of rice. The aromatic plants which grow upon the sides of the hills
                    are the most valuable products of this region. The coffee produced in Yemen has
                    always possessed a flavour which cannot be rivalled by that of any other country
                    to which the shrub has been transplanted from this its native region; and Mocha
                    coffee is in request all over the world. The balm of Mecca, and the tree bearing
                    incense, are also produced in Yemen, though they are found in greater perfection
                    on the opposite coast of Africa.</p>
                <p>Like the rest of Arabia, Yemen was formerly parcelled out among a number of
                    different sovereigns in unequal portions; but it has been formed into a
                    considerable monarchical state, subject to a sovereign who assumes the modest
                    title of Imam or doctor, but exercises over his subjects an authority nearly
                    absolute. He is forced however to pay respect to the pride of the aristocracy,
                    namely, the schiechs or hereditary chiefs, who here, as over all Arabia, possess
                    a high influence, and, seated in their strong castles in the interior, often set
                    his mandates at defiance. The sovereigns of Yemen were formerly reduced under
                    the Saracen power, and afterwards under the soldans of Egypt. They were since
                    menaced by the growing power of the Wahabees, who made themselves masters of all
                    the seaports except Mocha; but their power and kingdom being extinguished by
                    Mehemet Ali, this country came under his dominion. In consequence of the late
                    successful operations of the British fleet against Syria, it will revert with
                    that country to the rule of the sultan.</p>
