                <p><label type="entry">YANG-TSE-KIANG</label>, the largest river in the Chinese
                    empire, and one of the greatest in the world. Its source, which is unknown to
                    Europeans, is laid down in the Chinese maps as situated among the mountains of
                    Tibet. It flows during the first part of its course along the borders of China;
                    after which it enters the Chinese territory, and passes, in a westerly course,
                    through Sechuen, Houquang, and Kiang-nan, the central provinces, diffusing, far
                    and wide, commerce and fertility, and facilitating the internal intercourse of
                    the empire. Increased in its progress by numerous tributary streams, it becomes
                    truly magnificent when it passes the great city of Nanking, from the fleets of
                    trading craft with which it is covered; and there is thence a continued
                    succession of cities, towns, and villages, diversified by the high cultivation
                    of the intervening country. It falls into the Gulf of Tsong-ming, in the Eastern
                    Seas, about 120 miles to the east of Nanking.</p>
