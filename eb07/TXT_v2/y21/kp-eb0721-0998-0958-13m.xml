                    to extend the sails to the wind. All yards are either square or lateen; the
                    former of which are suspended across the masts at right angles, and the latter
                    obliquely. The square yards are nearly of a cylindrical surface. They taper from
                    the middle, which is called the <hi rend="italic">slings,</hi> towards the
                    extremities, which are termed the <hi rend="italic">yard-arms;</hi> and the
                    distance between the slings and the yardarms on each side is by the artificers
                    divided into quarters, which are distinguished into the first, second, third
                    quarters, and yard-arms. The middle quarters are formed into eight squares, and
                    each of the end parte is figured like the frus tum of a cone. All the yards of a
                    ship are square except that of the mizen.</p>
