PAROS, an island belonging to the Turkish empire, in the AEgean Sea. It is separated by a narrow channel from Noxia on the eastern, and from Antiparos on the western side. It extends over 104 square miles, and contains about 2000 inhabitants. It is naturally fertile, but, by the conduct of the government, the population, mostly Greeks, are very much impoverished; and there is also a scarcity of water. The chief town is Parichia, situated on the western coast, with a good haven, and about 700 inhabitants. It was once celebrated for its marbles. Long. 19. 15. E. Lat. 42. 45. N.
