                <p><label type="entry">EVANDER</label>, a king of Arcadia, said to be son, sometimes
                    of Mercury and sometimes of Echemuş, king of Arcadia, had as his mother the
                    nymph Nicostrate or Carmenta, according to the Latins. Various reasons are given
                    to account for his emigration to Italy. According to Servius (Virg. <hi
                    rend="italic">AEm.</hi> viii. 51, 130), he had killed his father by accident;
                    but Ovid says that he was compelled by civil broils to abandon his kingdom to
                    his brother Ladocos. This event is supposed to have taken place about fifty
                    years before the taking of Troy. Faunus, who then reigned in Italy, received
                    Evander and his companions with great kindness, granting to him as much land as
                    was necessary to build a city. Its foundations were laid on the Palatine hill;
                    and it was called Pallatium or Pallanteum, either in honour of his son Pallas,
                    or in remembrance of a village of the same name in Arcadia. Evander was greatly
                    annoyed by the thefts of a giant named Cacus, who dwelt on the Aventine hill;
                    but Hercules, whom he received with much hospitality, freed him from this
                    formidable enemy. At a later period Virgil introduces him to us, as forming an
                    alliance with AEneas, and furnishing him with a body of troops commanded by his
                    son Pallas. (AEŉ. viii. 154). He gave laws to his people, taught the: aborigines
                    of Italy agriculture, invented music, and introduced into his new country the
                    knowledge of letters. After his death he was by the gratitude of his subjects ,
                    ranked among the gods.</p>

                    evangelist; whilst the same apostle (Eph. iv. 11) ranks the evangelists after
                    the apostles and prophets.</p>
