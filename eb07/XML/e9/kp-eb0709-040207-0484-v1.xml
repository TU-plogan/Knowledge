                    former country of Normandy. It is bounded on the north by the department of the
                    Lower Seine, on the east by those o Oise and Seine-Oise, on the south by
                    Eure-Loire an Orne, and on the west by Calvados. The extent is 24» square miles,

                    woods, 11,931 vineyards, 18,537 meadows, 2726 gardens, 47 581 uncultivated land,
                    and the rcmaindcr roads, rivers, and the sites of towns. It is divided into five
                    arrondissements, thirty-six cantons, and 843 communes, inhabited by 421,480
                    persons. It is generally a level country, but a few hills are to be seen on the
                    borders of the Seine, the Rille, and the Eure, though none of them are more than
                    three hundred feet above the level of the sea. The soil generally consists of
                    vegetable matter, mingled with clay and sometimes marl, resting on a bed of
                    chalk or stone. The cultivation is tolerably conducted; so that, with the
                    natural fertility of the soil, the department, though rather densely peopled,
                    produces more corn than the population requires. The chief kind of corn is
                    wheat, the growth of which occupies a larger space than rye, oats, and barley
                    together. Flax is largely cultivated, and, from its length, fineness, and
                    colour, is highly esteemed. The seed of this plant is drawn cither from Flanders
                    or from Riga. Some hemp is also produced. The horses of the department, of the
                    pure Norman breed, have always been celebrated, and, though they had nearly lost
                    their high character, have .of late been more carefully bred and much improved.
                    The breed of cows is remarkably good; and the calves are much in request in the
                    neighbouring departments. Sheep have been neglected, but have recently
                    increased; and those on the coast, known as <hi rend="italic">Moutons clu Pré
                    Sale,</hi> are highly valued for their excellent meat. Of late years attempts
                    have been made to improve the wool by a mixture of merinos. Fruit is very
                    abundant, especially apples, from which much cider is made. The wine is but of
                    moderate quality, and will rarely bear to be kept longer than three years. There
                    are no mines but of iron, which yield annually 400 tons.</p>
                <p>This department is a manufacturing part of France; and cotton, linen, and woollen
                    cloths of every kind, are fabricated. There are large establishments for making
                    copper ware of all kinds, the various descriptions of paper, nails, pins, and
                    needles, glass for windows, and glass bottles, and ∣ jewellery and trinkets.
                    These employments occupy the larger portion of the inhabitants. Such goods form
                    the trade; in addition to which, fire-wood, timber, cattle, honey, wax, and
                    corn, are furnished to the districts surrounding the department.</p>
