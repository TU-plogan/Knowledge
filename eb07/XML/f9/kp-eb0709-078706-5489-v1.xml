                <p><label type="entry">FORTUNE</label> (Ttrø), a name which, amongst the ancients,
                    seems to have denoted a principle by which things came to pass, without being
                    necessitated thereto; but what that principle was, or whence it proceeded, they
                    do not seem to have precisely considered. Hence their philosophers often
                    intimate that men only conjured up the phantom of Fortune to hide their own
                    ignorance; and that thus they call Fortune whatever befals a man w ithout his
                    know ing for what purpose. Hence Juvenal <hi rend="italic">(Sat.</hi> x. ver.
                    3t(&gt;) affirms, there were men who made a deity of fortune.</p>
                <p>N ullum numen abest, si sit prudentia; sed te Nos facimus, Fortuna, deam,
                    coeloque locamus.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193755502?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0709-5502-0788"/>
                <p>According to the opinion of the heathens, therefore, Fortune was in reality only
                    the occurrence of things in a sudden and unexpected manner, without any apparent
                    cause or reason; so that the philosophical sense of the word coincides with what
                    is commonly called <hi rend="italic">chance.</hi></p>
                <p>But in religion the term had much greater force <hi rend="smallcaps">į</hi> for
                    altars and temples in great numbers were consecrated to Fortune as a deity. This
                    intimates that the heathens had personified, and even deified chance; conceiving
                    it a sort of goddess who disposed at pleasure of the fate of men. Hence the
                    invocation of Horace, <hi rend="italic">0 diva,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >gratum</hi><hi rend="italic">qua</hi><hi rend="italic">regis Antium,</hi> in
                    which he recommends Augustus, then preparing for a visit to Britain, to the
                    protection of this divinity. From all this it may be inferred that the ancients
                    at one time considered Fortune as a peremptory cause, operating in order to do
                    good to some, and evil to others; and at another as a blind inconstant cause,
                    without any view or determination at all. If, then, the word Fortune had no
                    certain meaning even amongst those who erected altars in honour thereof, much
                    less can it be ascertained what the term denotes in the minds of those who now
                    use the word in their writings. They who would substitute the term <hi
                    rend="italic">Providence</hi> instead of that of <hi rend="italic">Fortune,</hi>
                    cannot give any tolerable sense to half the phrases in which the word
                    occurs.</p>
                <p>Horace paints the goddess as preceded by Necessity, holding nails and wedges in
                    her hands, with a cramp-iron, and molten lead to fasten it, but rarely
                    accompanied with Fidelity, unless when she abandons a family, in which case
                    Fidelity never fails to depart with her, as well as friends. Fortune is
                    disrespectfully spoken of by most of the Roman writers, and represented as
                    blind, inconstant, unjust, and delighting in mischief (Ovid, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ad Liv.</hi> ver. 52, ver. 374; Hor. lib. i. od. 34, ver. 26, lib. iii. od. 29,
                    ver. 15; Statius, Theb. xii. ver. 505). However, they had a good as well as a
                    bad fortune, a constant and an inconstant fortune, the latter of which was
                    represented with wings, and a wheel beside her <hi rend="smallcaps">(Hot.</hi>
                    lib. iii. od. 29, ver. 56). Juvenal alludes to a statue of Fortune, which
                    exhibited lier under a good character, as the patroness of the poor infants who
                    were exposed by their parents in the streets <hi rend="italic">{Sat.</hi> vi.
                    ver. 605). The painters commonly represent her in a woman’s habit, with a
                    bandage over her eyes, to show that she acts without discernment; and standing
                    on a wheel, to express her instability. The Romans, says Lactantius, represented
                    Fortune with a cornucopia, and the helm of a ship, to show that she distributes
                    riches, and directs the affairs of the world. In effect, it is by such
                    characters that we see her represented upon so many medals, with the
                    inscription, <hi rend="smallcaps">Fobtuna avg. fobtuna bedvx, fobtvnae avg.</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">fob-tunae</hi> REDVcιs, and so on. Sometimes she is seen
                    pointing at a globe before her feet, with a sceptre in one hand, and holding the
                    cornucopia in the other.</p>
                <p>The Romans had a male as well as a female Fortune which were objects of
                    adoration; the <hi rend="italic">Fortuna</hi><hi rend="italic">virilis</hi>
                    being honoured by die men, and the <hi rend="italic">Fortuna</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">muliebris</hi> by the women. They appear to have derived the
                    worship of Fortune from the Greeks under the reign of Servius Tullius, who
                    dedicated to her the first temple in the public marketplace. Nero also built a
                    temple to Fortune. The Fortune worshipped at Antium was probably the most
                    exalted of any amongst the Romans, if we may judge by the account which Horace
                    gives us of the solemn processions that were made to her (Hor. lib. i. od. 35,
                    ver. 22). But the most celebrated temple of Fortune was at Praeneste; and
                    Statius speaks of several, whom he calls die <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prcenestinoe</hi><hi rend="italic">Sorores</hi> (lib. i. Sylv. iii. ver.
