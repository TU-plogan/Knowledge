                <p><label type="entry">FARS</label>, a province of Persia, bounded by Irak on the
                    north, Kerman and Laristan on the east, Kuzĩstan on the west, and on the south
                    by the Persian Gulf. This province is divided into the Germaseer and Sirhud, or
                    the warm and the cold climates. It is in general sandy and barren, though with
                    some considerable exceptions. The Γabris, formed by the junction, within a few
                    miles of the town of Zeitoon, of two streams which take their rise in the
                    mountains of Fars, is the most considerable river of the province. It divides
                    Fars from Kuzĩstan, and, eight miles below the town of Endian, falls into the
                    sea. The warm region of this district extends from the sea to the latitude of
                    Kazeroon, and runs parallel with the gulf from the banks of the Tabris to the
                    confines of Laristan. It is chiefly a sandy plain at the foot of the mountains,
                    the cultivation of which depends on the periodical rains; and when these prove
                    abundant, the country yields abundance of dry grain; but when the rains fail,
                    which too frequently happens, a famine generally ensues. The sandy plain, or the
                    Dushtistan as it is called, is divided into two districts, which are separated
                    by the projecting mountain or Bung. These two districts are thinly peopled and
                    badly cultivated; and the few mud villages which are scattered over the plain
                    bespeak but too clearly the 'vretchedness and poverty of their possessors. The
                    cold <hi rend="superscript"> e</hi> gιon comprehends most of the mountainous
                    part of Fars, extending from the latitude of Kazeroon to that of the town ot .
                    ezdckhast, situated on the bed of what appears to have been formerly a river,
                    which separates this province from Irak. The mountains are here intersected by
                    plams, which seldom exceed eight or ten miles in breadth, whilst in length they
                    vary from fifteen to a hundred. They are in general fertile, affording abundance
                    of pasturage; nor are they so deficient in water as they have sometimes been
                    represented. A few of them, such as those of Shiraz, Kazeroon, and Merdesht, are
                    tolerably well cultivated. But they are for the most part, particularly to the
                    northward and westward, destitute of inhabitants. It is mentioned by Kinneir, in
                    his Geographical Memoir of the Persian Empire, that in 1809 he travelled in this
                    country “through the most delightful valleys, covered with wood and verdure,”
                    but all was solitary, nor was the face of a human being anywhere to be seen. The
                    country, it appears, had been possessed by a predatory tribe, who, in
                    consequence of their licentious conduct, had been extirpated by the vengeance of
                    the prince, and who having in consequence fled to the lofty and inaccessible
                    mountains, lived there on the scanty fare of a sort of bread afforded by acorns,
                    and thence sallying forth on the low country beneath, robbed and plundered the
                    unwary traveller, sometimes extending their inroads to villages, the inhabitants
                    of which they either murdered, or carried away captive, to be sold for slaves in
                    an unknown and distant land. The face of the country in the eastern parts of
                    Fars is somewhat different, being open, the plains of greater extent, and of a
                    sandy soil, where water is not so plentiful. The great range of mountains seen
                    from the coast is a mere elongation of the chain of Mount Tagros, which extends
                    in a continued succession of ridges from the borders of the Persian Gulf to the
                    Caspian Sea and the Caucasus. These hills in Fars are situated at different
                    distances from the sea. At Bushire they are distant twenty-four miles. But
                    towards Bunder Reig the plain becomes contracted; and a low ridge, known by the
                    name of Kohi Bung, or the hill of Bung, and about seven or eight miles broad,
                    suddenly projects to the south, and touching the sea, separates the district of
                    Leerawee from that of Hiadouat. Beyond this hill, at the plain of Leerawee, the
                    mountains are about twenty miles distant from the sea, at which distance they
                    continue for eighteen or nineteen miles, when they again approach the south; and
                    this branch is known by the name of Zeitoon, on turning the southern point of
                    which they again abruptly retire to the northward; and at the port of Mashoor
                    they are thirty miles from the sea. The principal towns of the province are
                    Shiraz, the capital, with 40,000 inhabitants; Bushire, the chief port in the
                    Persian Gulf; Darabjerb, Bebahan, and some others. Within its confines also are
                    the ruins of the cities of Shapoor and Persepolis; the latter containing some
                    magnificent remains of antiquity.</p>
