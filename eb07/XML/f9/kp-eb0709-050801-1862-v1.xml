                <p><label type="entry">FENTON</label>, SíR <hi rend="smallcaps">Geoffrey,</hi> an
                    eminent writer and statesman during the reigns of Elizabeth and James L, was
                    brother to Edward Fenton, the navigator, who accompanied Sir Martin Frobisher in
                    his expeditions, and was afterwards sent out independently to endeavour to
                    discover a north-west passage. The time of Sir Geoffrey’s birth is uncertain,
                    but he appears to have received a liberal education, and certainly gave many
                    proofs of his acquaintance with ancient and modern learning, particularly of his
                    knowledge of the French, Spanish, and Italian languages. He is best known,
                    however, for his translation of the <hi rend="italic">History of the Wars of
                    Italy</hi> by Guicciardini, which he dedicated to Queen Elizabeth. But this was
                    his last work, as is proved by the date of the dedication (7th January 1579)
                    just mentioned. He had previously published, 1. Certain Tragical Discourses,
                    written oute of French and Latin, 1567, in 4to; 2. An Account of a dispute at
                    Paris, between two Doctors of the Sorbonne and two Ministers of God’s Word,
                    1571; 3. An Epistle, or Godly Admonition, sent to the Pastors of the Flemish
                    Church at Antwerp, exhorting them to concord with other Ministers; translated
                    from the original of Antonio de Carro, 1578; 4. Golden Epistles, containing
                    variety of Discourses, both moral, philosophical, and divine, gathered as well
                    out of the remainder of Guevara’s works, as other authors, Latin, French, and
                    Italian, 1577. The familiar epistles of Guevara had been published in English by
                    Edward Fellowes, in 1574; but Fenton’s collection consists of pieces not
                    contained in that publication, and, like his translation of Guicciardini, has
                    risen in public estimation since the language and literature of the Elizabethan
                    age have been more generally studied. In the capacity of queen’s counsellor or
                    secretary, Fenton served for a considerable time in Ireland, where his conduct
                    appears to have given great satisfaction to his royal mistress, and whence he
                    was frequently sent for to be consulted respecting Irish affairs. Nor does the
                    confidence which his sovereign had in his judgment and understanding appear to
                    have been misplaced. Maintained in office by her favour alone, he repaid her
                    kindness by communicating salutary truths, and recommending wise and liberal
                    measures. To his honour be it stated, he took every opportunity of impressing on
                    the mind of the queen the important truth, that the Irish were to be governed
                    only by a strict observance of the rules of justice, and that the safety and
                    glory of her government in that island depended on her subjects enjoying the
                    protection of equal‘laws. How much misery, and suffering, and humiliation, might
                    have been spared to Ireland, if succeeding counsellors and secretaries in that
                    country had been capable of appreciating the enlightened policy so strongly
                    recommended by Fenton! In 1603 Sir Geoffrey married his only daughter to Mr
                    Boyle, afterwards Earl of Cork, and died at his house in Dublin on the 19th
                    October 1606. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Fenton,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Elijah,</hi> an English poet of considerable note, was born at
                    Shelton, near Newcastle-under-Line, in Staffordshire, on the 20th May 1683.
                    Being the youngest of twelve children, he was destined for the church as a
                    profession; and with this view, after passing through the usual course of
                    grammatical education, he was, on the 1st July 1700, admitted a -pensioner of
                    Jesus College, Cambridge, where he prosecuted his studies with much diligence
                    and assiduity; but having refused to take the oaths to government, he was
                    obliged -to quit the university w ithout a degree, and forced to trust to his
                    abilities for a subsistence. Whatever were the difficulties and discouragements
                    which he had to struggle with, however, Fenton never descended to mean or
                    dishonourable shifts; and as his conduct was without reproach, so his name was
                    never mentioned except with commendation. His first employment promised more
                    than it afterwards realized. He accompanied the Earl of Orrery to Flanders in
                    the capacity of private secretary, and returned with his lordship to England in
                    1705. Being thus left without employment, he became assistant in a school at
                    Headley, in Surrey, and was soon afterwards appointed master of the free
                    grammar-school at Sevenoaks in Kent. In 1710 he was prevailed on to give up the
                    drudgery of teaching, for the worse drudgery of political dependence; Lord
                    Bolingbroke, who had persuaded him to take this unwise step, having, with
                    characteristic recklessness, neglected his interest, and left him disappointed
                    and in debt. But not long afterwards he was appointed tutor to Lord Broghill,
                    only son of the Earl of Orrery; and when this engagement expired, he was, on the
                    recommendation of Pope, employed to give private instructions to Mr Craggs,
                    secretary of state, who, feeling his own want of literature, was anxious, with
                    the aid of such an instructor, to supply the deficiencies of his education. The
                    sudden death of Craggs, however, disappointed the expectations which had been
                    formed from this connection, and Fenton was again thrown out of employment. His
                    next engagement was with Pope himself. The success of the translation of the
                    Iliad having induced the latter to undertake that of the Odyssey, he, in order
                    to lighten the task, resolved to engage auxiliaries; and, with this view,
                    retaining twelve books for his own share, he distributed the remaining twelve
                    between Broome and Fenton. Of these, according to Johnson and Marton, Fenton
                    translated the first, fourth, nineteenth, and twentieth; though the Earl of
                    Orrery has asserted that he translated double the number of books which Pope has
                    acknowledged.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>In a
                    letter to Mr Duncombe, Lord Orrery says, “His reward was a trifle, an arrant
                    trifle. He has even told me that he thoug Pope feared him more than he loved
                    him. He had no opinion of Pope’s heart; and declared him, in the words of Bishop

                    that the author’s profits are said to have amounted to nearly a thousand pounds.
                    The poetical merit of this tragedy is considerable; but the <pb break="no"

                    figurative and ornate for a dramatic composition, and accordingly it has not
                    retained its place on the stage. In 1727, Fenton superintended a new edition of
                    Milton’s <hi rend="italic">Poems,</hi> to which he prefixed a life, of which
                    Johnson has spoken with commendation; and, in 1729, he published a splendid
                    edition of Waller, with notes, which is accounted among the best of that poet’s
                    works. The latter part of Fenton’s life was passed in tranquillity. By the
                    recommendation of Pope, Lady Trumbull appointed him tutor to her son, first at
                    home, and afterwards at Cambridge; and when he had acquitted himself of the
                    duties of this office, she still retained him in her family as auditor of her
                    accounts, in which capacity he seems to have enjoyed his ease, and found leisure
                    to pay frequent visits to his literary friends in London. He died at East
                    Hampstead, Berkshire, on the 13th July 1730, and was interred in the parish
                    church, where his tomb bears inscribed on it an epitaph written by Pope. Fenton,
                    naturally indolent, was capable of greater things than he performed. His
                    reputation as a poet rests chiefly on his <hi rend="italic">Mariamne,</hi> and
                    his share in the translation of the <hi rend="italic">Odyssey,</hi> which the
                    readers of poetry have never been able to distinguish from the portion executed
                    by Pope himself; but to his <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Poems,</hi>
                    published in 1717, he has been indebted for a place amongst the English poets in
                    Dr Johnson’s collection. Of his morals and conversation the account is uniform.
                    “He was never named,” says Dr Johnson, “but with praise and fondness, as a man
                    in the highest degree amiable and excellent. Such was the character given of him
                    by the Earl of Orrery, his pupil; such is the testimony of Pope; and such were
                    the suffrages of all who could boast of his acquaintance.” <hi rend="smallcaps"
