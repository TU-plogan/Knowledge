                <p><label type="entry">FORDUN, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, the venerable
                    father of Scotish history, apparently derives his surname from a village in the
                    county of Kincardine, where he is supposed to have been born. He was not, as he
                    has sometimes been represented, a monk, but a secular priest; and in some
                    manuscripts of his history', he is described as a chaplain of the cathedral of
                    Aberdeen; a title which Goodall seems to have considered as equivalent to canon.
                    Bower describes him as a simple man, who had never graduated in the schools. He
                    was engaged in the composition of his work towards the close of the fourteenth
                    century. The first five books, and twenty-three chapters of the sixth book of
                    the Scotichronicon, are the composition of Fordun: for the remainder of the work
                    in its present form, we are indebted to Walter Bower, who was born at Haddington
                    in the year 1385, and was unanimously elected abbot of St Colm in the year 1418.
                    This monastery, situated in a small island in the Firth of Forth, belonged to
                    the canons regular of St Augustin. The abbot is sometimes called Bowmaker, which
                    is equivalent in signification to Bower. From 1395 to 1399 John Bowmaker appears
                    as the deputy of the bailies or of the <hi rend="italic">customaτs</hi> of
                    Haddington, at the presentation of their accounts.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Accounts of the Great Chamberlains of
                    Scotland, vol. ii. p. 290. 314. 360. 426.</p></note> As the first of these dates
                    is only ten years subsequent to the abbot’s birth, and as he was a native of
                    that town, this individual might possibly be his father or other relation. At
                    the request of Sir David Stewart of Rossyth,he undertook to transcribe the
                    papers of Fordun; but instead of executing a mere transcript, he inserted large
                    interpolations, and continued the narrative to the death of James the First,
                    having thus extended the work to sixteen books. Of this continuation the
                    principal materials had however been collected by his predecessor. Bower
                    professes to have been careful to distinguish what belonged to each; but as the
                    negligence of subsequent copyists has omitted all his marks, we must chiefly be
                    guided by the internal evidence in adjusting their respective claims. The
                    Latinity of the Scotichronicon, though certainly far from being classical, is
                    less barbarous than that of many other <pb break="no"

                    the middle ages. Winton, the author of a chronicle in Scotish verse, is perhaps
                    a more judicious writer than either Fordun or Bower, though his share of
                    credulity and superstition is by no means inconsiderable. Beyond this period we
                    have scarcely any records professedly historical, except the Chronicle of
                    Melrose, and a few other fragments, neither considerable for their value nor
                    extent.</p>
                <p>It would be endless, as Nicolson has remarked, “to compute into how many several
                    chronicles this of Fordon’s has been multiply’d: for, being in every monastery
                    of the kingdom under the anonymous title of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Scoto-chronicon,</hi> it commonly borrowed a sirname from the place to which it
                    belong’d.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Nicol sou's

                    Black Book of Paisley, were copies which obtained no small celebrity, and which
                    seem to have been commonly regarded as two distinct chronicles compiled in those
                    two monasteries. Thus, the Book of Pluscardine was a copy belonging to the
                    priory of that name. Magnus Macculloch and Patrick Russell, who are sometimes
                    mentioned as continuators, were in all probability little more than transcribers
                    of Fordun.</p>
                <p>Some portions of the Scotichronicon were inserted in the collection of Dr

                    copy, which he supposed to have belonged to Hector Boyce. In the year 1719,
                    Richard Hay, a canon regular of St Augustin, issued “Proposals for Printing the
                    Chronicle of John Fordun, with the Additions and Continuation of Walter
                    Bowmaker, Abbot of Inch-Colm, containing the memorable things which happened in
                    every year, since our first rise, to King James the First’s death; conform to an
                    authen-tick manuscript, belonging of old to one of our decay’d monasteries: with
                    several notes, for clearing the dark parts of our history.” The manuscript, “a
                    large folio, written in old, but in glorious characters,” belonged to the
                    Cistertian monastery of St Mary at Cupar in Angus: it afterwards came into the
                    possession of Hay, and is now deposited in the Advocates Library. He concludes
                    his Proposals in the following manner: “Many persons of an eminent character
                    have appeared desirous to have it printed, because what copies thereof were
                    carried to England, France, Flanders, Italy, and elsewhere, during the heat of
                    the Reformation, or our late disturbances, are properly lost for us. And what
                    remain in the country, in private hands or in particular libraries, are of no
                    use to the publick, whilst they are shut up, and as if it were hidden in obscure
                    places, where scarce any number of men of an ordinär capacity are allowed
                    access. Therefor I have been willing to publish this manuscript, with several
                    notes, for the greater intelligence of our history, and a large preface, where I
                    shall give an exact account of the fate and fortune of the most part of the
                    others, transcribed by different hands, in former ages, with whom I have
                    compared this original. The charges and expences of publishing this book will be
                    certainly considerable. So those that are pleased to further and incourage this
                    enterprize, are desired to pay ten shillings sterling at subscribing, and as
                    much at the delivery of the printed copy, which will prove a good folio, on fine
                    paper, and in good caracters, and will consist of 160 sheet and above. Their
                    names and designations shall be insert in the front, and their respective houses
                    or families shall be kindly remembered in the notes. As to the subscriptions,
                    they are to be taken by the author, at his lodging in Howison’s Land in the
                    Potterraw; by Mr John Mackenzie of Delvin, at his lodging in the Parliament
                    Close; by Mr Henry Massie, merchant, near the foot of Blackfriar-Wynd; by Mr
                    William Adams, printer, over against the Tronc-Church; by Mr Ruddiman in the
                    Advocates Library; who shall deliver to the persons concerned the author’s
                    obligation to have the compleat copy remitted to them about the end of the
                    following year, 1720, they paying ten shillings more at the time appointed.”
                    This plan was never carried into execution; but a valuable edition was soon
                    afterwards published by Hearne, under the title of “Johannis de Fordun
                    Scotichronicon genuinum, una cum ejusdem Supplemento ac Continuatione.” Oxon.
                    1722, 5 tom. 8vo. The editor proceeds upon the plan of separating the
                    interpolations of Bower from the text of Fordun. After an interval of nearly
                    forty years, another edition was published by Walter Goodall, assistant-keeper
                    of the Advocates Library: “Joannie de Fordun Scotichronicon, cum Supplementis et
                    Continuatione Walteri Boweri, Insulae Sancti Columbae Abbatis.” Edinb. 1759, 2
                    tom. fol. Goodall chiefly adheres to an excellent manuscript, written on vellum,
                    and preserved in the library of the university of Edinburgh. (x.)</p>
