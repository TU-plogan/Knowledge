                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Hannibal,</hi> three celebrated painters of the Lombard
                    school, all of Bologna. Louis was born in 1555, and was cousin-german to
                    Augustine and Hannibal, who were brothers, the sons of a tailor, who was yet
                    careful to give them a liberal education. They were both disciples of their
                    cousin Louis. Augustine gained a knowledge of mathematics, natural philosophy,
                    music, poetry, and most of the liberal arts; but, though painting was his
                    principal pursuit, he learned the art of engraving from Cornelius Cort, and
                    surpassed all the masters <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his time. Hannibal, again,
                    never deviated from his pencil. These three painters at length having reaped all
                    the advantages they could by contemplation and practice, formed a plan of
                    association, continued always together, and laid the foundation of that
                    celebrated school which has ever since been known by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Caracci</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">s Academy.</hi> Thither all the
                    young students who had a view of becoming masters resorted for instruction in
                    the rudiments of painting; and there the Caracci taught freely, and without
                    reserve, all that came. Louis’s charge <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193348719?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-8719-0132"/> was to make a
                    collection of antique statues and bas reliefs. They had designs of the best
                    masters, and a collection of curious books on all subjects relating to their
                    art; and they had a skilful anatomist always ready to teach whatever belonged to
                    the knitting and motions of the muscles, &amp;c. There were often disputations
                    in the academy; and not only painters, but men of learned professions, proposed
                    questions which were always decided by Louis. Every body was well received; and
                    though stated hours were allotted to treat of different matters, yet improvement
                    might be made at all hours from the antiquities and the designs which were
                    constantly to be seen.</p>
                <p>The fame of the Caracci reaching Rome, Cardinal Farnese sent for Hannibal
                    thither, to paint the gallery of his palace. Hannibal was the more willing to
                    go, because he had a great desire to see Raphael’s works, with the antique
                    statues and bas reliefs'. The taste which he formed there from the ancient
                    sculpture, made him change his Bolognian manner for one more learned, but less
                    natural in the design and in the colouring. Augustine followed Hannibal to
                    assist him in his undertaking of the Farnese gallery; but the brothers not
                    rightly agreeing, Farnese sent Augustine to the court of the Duke of Parma,
                    where he died in the year 1602, being only forty-five years of age. His most
                    celebrated piece of painting is that of the communion of St Jerome, in
                    Bologna.</p>
                <p>In the meanwhile, Hannibal continued working in the Farnese gallery at Rome; and,
                    after inconceivable pains and care, finished the paintings in a style of
                    perfection altogether unrivalled. He hoped that the cardinal would have rewarded
                    him in some proportion to the excellence of his work, and the time it occupied,
                    which was eight years; but he was disappointed. The cardinal, influenced by an
                    ignorant Spaniard, his domestic, gave him little more than L.200, though it is
                    certain he deserved more than twice as many thousands. When the money was
                    brought him, he was so surprised at the injustice done him, that he could not
                    speak a word to the person who brought it. This confirmed him in a melancholy to
                    which his temper naturally inclined, and made him resolve never more to touch
                    his pencil; which resolution he would undoubtedly have kept, if his necessities
                    had not compelled him to break it. It is said that his melancholy gained so much
                    upon him, that at certain times it deprived him of the use of his senses. It did
                    not, however, put a stop to his amours; and his debauches at Naples, whither he
                    retired for the recovery of his health, brought on a distemper of which he died
                    in 1609, when he was only forty-nine years of age. His veneration for Raphael
                    was so great, that his deathbed request was to be buried in the same tomb with
                    him; which was accordingly done in the Pantheon or Rotunda at Rome. There are
                    extant several prints of the blessed Virgin, and some other subjects etched by
                    the hand of this incomparable artist. He is said to have been a friendly, plain,
                    honest, open-hearted man; very communicative to his scholars, and so extremely
                    kind to them, that he generally kept his money in the same box with his colours,
                    where they might have recourse to either as they had occasion.</p>
                <p>While Hannibal Caracci worked at Rome, Louis was courted from all parts of
                    Lombardy, especially by the clergy, to paint pictures in their churches; and we
                    may judge of his capacity and facility by the great number of pictures he
                    executed, and by the preference that was given him over other painters. In the
                    midst of these employments Hannibal solicited him to come and assist him in the
                    Farnese gallery, and so earnestly, that he could not avoid complying with his
                    request. He went to Rome, corrected several things in that gallery, painted a
                    figure or two himself, and then returned to Bologna, where he died in 1619, aged
                    sixty-four.</p>
