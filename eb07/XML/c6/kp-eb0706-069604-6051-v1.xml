                <p><label type="entry">CIMBRI</label>, an ancient Celtic nation, inhabiting the
                    northern parts of Germany. They are said to have been descended from the Asiatic
                    Cimmerians, and to have taken the name of' Cimbri when they changed their old
                    habitations. When they first became remarkable, they inhabited chiefly the
                    peninsula now called Jutland, and by the ancients <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cimbrica</hi><hi rend="italic">Chersonesus.</hi> About 113 years <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> they left their peninsula, with their wives and
                    children, and joining the Teutones, a neighbouring nation, took their journey
                    southward in quest of a better country. They first fell upon the Boii, a Gaulish
                    nation situated near the IIercynian forest; but here they were repulsed, and
                    obliged to move nearer the Roman provinces. The republic being then alarmed at
                    the approach of such multitudes of barbarians, sent an army against them, under
                    the consul Papirius Carbo. On the approach of the Roman army, the Cimbri made
                    proposals of peace, which the consul pretended to accept; but having thrown them
                    into a disadvantageous situation, he treacherously attacked their camp. His
                    perfidy was rewarded as it deserved; the Cimbri flew to arms, and not only
                    repulsed the Romans, but, attacking them in their turn, utterly defeated them,
                    and obliged the shattered remains of thcir forces to conceal themselves in the
                    neighbouring forests. After this victory, the Cimbri entered Transalpine Gaul,
                    which they quickly covered with slaughter and desolation. Here they continued
                    five or six years, when another Roman army, under the consul Silanus, marched
                    against them; but this general met with no better success than Carbo had done.
                    His army was routed at the first onset, and all <hi rend="italic">Gallia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Narbonensis</hi> was in consequence exposed to the ravages of
                    these harbarians.</p>
                <p>About 105 years <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> the Cimbri began to threaten the
                    Roman empire itself with destruction; and the Gauls marched from all parts, with
                    a design to join them in the invasion of Italy. The Roman army was commanded by
                    the proconsul Caepio and the consul Mallius; but as these two commanders could
                    not agree, they were advised to separate and divide their forces. This advice
                    proved ruinous to the whole army. The Cimbri immediately fell <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193356064?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-6064-0697"/> upon a strong
                    detachment of the consular army, com- ' manded by Μ. Aurelius Scaurus, which
                    they cut off to a man, and made Scaurus himself prisoner. Mallius being greatly
                    intimidated by this defeat, desired a reconciliation with Caepio, but was
                    haughtily refused. He moved nearer the consul, however, with his army, in order
                    that the enemy might not be defeated without his having a share in the action.
                    The Cimbri imagining, by this movement, that the commanders had made up their
                    quarrel, sent ambassadors to Mallius with proposals of peace; and as they could
                    not avoid passing through Caepio’s camp, he ordered them to be brought before
                    him; but finding they were empowered to treat only with Mallius, he could
                    scarcely be restrained from putting them to death. His troops, however, forced
                    him to confer with Mallius about the proposals sent by the barbarians; but as
                    Caepio proceeded to the consul’s tent against hiş will, so he opposed him in
                    every thing, contradicted him with great obstinacy, and insulted him in the
                    grossest manner. The deputies, on their return, acquainted their countrymen that
                    the misunderstanding between the Roman commanders still subsisted; upon which
                    the Cimbri attacked the camp of Caepio, and the Gauls that of Mallius, both of
                    which were forced, and the Romans slaughtered without mercy. Eighty thousand
                    citizens and allies of Rome, with forty thousand servants and sutlers, perished
                    on that fatal day. In short, of the two Roman armies, only ten men, with the two
                    generals, escaped, to carry the news of this dreadful defeat. The conquerors
                    destroyed all the spoil, pursuant to a vow they had made before the battle. The
                    gold and silver they threw into the Rhone, then drowned the horses they had
                    taken, and put to death all the prisoners.</p>
                <p>The Romans were thrown into the utmost consternation on the news of so terrible
                    an overthrow. They saw themselves threatened with a deluge of Cimbri and Gauls,
                    numerous enough to overrun the whole country; but they did not on that account
                    despair. A new army was raised with incredible expedition, no citizen who was
                    able to bear arms being exempted. On this occasion also, fencingmasters were
                    first .introduced into the Roman camp; by which means the soldiers were soon
                    rendered in a manner invincible. Marius, who enjoyed at that time a high
                    reputation on account of his victories in Africa, was chosen commander, and
                    waited for the enemy in Transalpine Gaul; but they had resolved to enter Italy
                    by two different routes; the Cimbri over the eastern, and the Teutones and other
                    allies over the western Alps. The Roman general, therefore, marched to oppose
                    the latter, and defeated the Ambrones and Teutones with great slaughter. The
                    Cimbri, in the mean time, entered Italy, and struck the whole country with
                    terror. Catullus and Sylla attempted to oppose them; but their soldiers were so
                    intimidated by the fierce countenances and terrible appearance of these
                    barbarians, that nothing could prevent their flying before them. Rome was now
                    totally defenceless; and had the Cimbri only marched briskly forward, they would
                    undoubtedly have become masters of the city; but not having heard of the defeat
                    of their allies by Marius, they waited in expectation of being joined by the
                    Ambrones and Teutones, till the senate had time to recal him to the defence of
                    his country. By their order he joined his army to that of Catullus and Sylla,
                    and upon this junction he was declared commander-in-chief The Roman army
                    consisted of 52,300 men. The cavalry of the Cimbri were no more than 15,000, but
                    their foot seemed innumerable; for, being drawn up in a square, they are said to
                    have covered thirty furlongs. The Cimbri attacked the Romans with the utmost
                    fury; but being unaccustomed to endure the heats of Italy, they soon began to
                    lose their strength, and were easily overcome. They had put it out of their
                    power to fly; for, that they might keep their ranks the better, they had, like
                    true barbarians, tied themselves together with cords fastened to their belts, so
                    that the Romans made a terrible havoc of them. The battle therefore was soon
                    over, and the whole day employed in the most unsparing butchery. An hundred and
                    twenty thousand were killed on the field of-battle, and sixty thousand taken
                    prisoners. The victorious Romans then marched to the enemy’s camp, where they
                    had a new battle to fight with the women, whom they found even more fierce than
                    their husbands. From their carts and waggons, which formed a kind of
                    fortification, they discharged showers of darts and arrows on friends and foes
                    without distinction; and, finding themselves about to be overpowered, they first
                    suffocated their children in thqĩr arms, and then put an end to their own lives.
                    The greater part of them hanged themselves on trees. One was found hanging at a
                    cart with two of her children at her heels. Many of the men, for want of trees
                    and stakes, tied strings in running knots about their necks, and fastened them
                    to the tails of their horses, and the horns and feet of their oxen, in order to
                    strangle themselves in that way; and thus the whole multitude was destroyed.</p>
                <p>The country of the Cimbri, which, after this terrible catastrophe, was left a
                    mere desert, was again peopled by the Scythians, -who, being driven by Pompey
                    out of the space included between the Euxine and the Caspian Sea, marched
                    towards the north and west of Europe, subduing all the nations they met with in
                    their way. They conquered Russia, Saxony, Westphalia, and other countries as far
                    as Finland, Norway, and Sweden. It is pretended that Wodin, or Odin, their
                    leader, traversed so many countries, and endeavoured to subdue them, only with a
                    view to excite the people against the Romans; and that the spirit of animosity
                    which he had excited operated so powerfully after his death, that the northern
                    nations combined to attack the empire, and never ceased their incursions until
                    it was totally subverted.</p>
