                <p><label type="entry">CAMROOP</label>. This country, which formerly constituted an
                    indepcndent kingdom of the Hindoos, is 300 miles in length by 100 in breadth. It
                    lies to the north-east of Bengal, and occupies both banks of the Brahmapootra
                    river, extending from the Candar Chokey in Ootrecole to the province of Dehrung.
                    Its capital is Kungamutty, on the north side of the Brahmapootra. Part of this
                    country is now included in Bengal, and the remainder, 100 miles in length by 40
                    in breadth, is reduced to a province of Assam, the principal places of which are
                    Cotta and Gow-hattee. A military causeway, now in a state of decay, extends from
                    Cooch Bahar, to the north of this and other districts, to the utmost limits of
                    Assam. This province <pb break="no" facs="nls:193347692?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-7692-0053"/> is well watered, being intersected in various
                    directions by rivers flowing from the mountains, and by the tributary streams of
                    the Brahmapootra.</p>
                <p>This country was invaded and overrun by an army of Mahommedans from Bengal in the
                    year 1205; but after advancing towards Bootan they were compelled to retreat,
                    and were so harassed that few of them escaped. They were afterwards repulsed in
                    various other attempts to subdue the country; and they in consequence believe
                    that the inhabitants are endowed with supernatural powers for their own defence.
                    But they merely availed themselves of the natural obstacles which the country
                    presented to the progress of an invading army, retiring with their families into
                    the jungles, until the rains inundating the country, and the pestilential nature
                    of the climate, forced the enemy to retreat. The English had been thirty-four
                    years in possession of Bengal before they were permitted to enter into this
                    country. In 1791 the rajah, being terrified by a serious rebellion, applied to
                    the British for military aid; after which a commercial treaty was concluded
                    between Colonel Welsh and the Assam ministers in September 1793, since which
                    period a profitable commercial intercourse has been maintained from Bengal, and
                    large quantities of silk, with European commodities, have been exported, in
                    return for pepper, ivory, cotton, and gold. The chief impediments to trade arise
