                <p><label type="entry">CIRCUMCISION</label>, the act of cutting off the prepuce; a
                    ceremony of the Jewish and Mahommedan religions, in which is cut off the
                    foreskin of the males, who are to profess the one or the other law.</p>
                <p>Circumcision commenced in the time of Abraham, and was the seal of a covenant
                    stipulated between God and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356168?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-6168-0705"/> him. It was in the year of the world 2178 that
                    Abraham, by divine appointment, circumcised himself and all the males of his
                    family; from which time it became an hereditary practice among his
                    descendants.</p>
                <p>The ceremony, however, was not confined to the Jews. Herodotus and Philo Judaeus
                    observe, that it obtained also among the Egyptians and Ethiopians. Herodotus
                    says, that the custom was very ancient among each people: so that it was
                    impossible to determine which of them borrowed it from the other. The same
                    historian relates, that the inhabitants of Colchis also used circumcision; and
                    hence he concludes that they were originally Egyptians. He adds, that the
                    Phoenicians and Syrians were likewise circumcised; that they borrowed the
                    practice from the Egyptians; and, lastly, that a little before the time when he
                    wrote, circumcision had passed from Colchis to the people living near Thermodon
                    and Parthenius.</p>
                <p>Marsham is of opinion that the Hebrews borrowed circumcision from the Egyptians,
                    and that God was not the first author of the practice; citing Diodorus Siculus
                    and Herodotus as evidences on his side. This latter proposition seems directly
                    contrary to the testimony of Moses, who assures us that Abraham, though
                    ninety-nine years of age, was not circumcised till he had received the express
                    command of God for the performance of the rite. But as to the former position of
                    Marsham, it will admit of more debate. The arguments on both sides may be seen

                <p>Among the Jews, the time for performing this rite was the eighth day, that is,
                    six full days after the child was born. The law of Moses ordained nothing with
                    respect to the person by whom, the instrument with which, or the manner how, the
                    ceremony was to be performed; the instrument however was generally a knife of
                    stone. The child was usually circumcised at home, where the father or godfather
                    held him in his arms, while the operator taking hold of the prepuce with one
                    han,d, cut it off with the other; a third person held a porringer, with sand in
                    it, to catch the blood; then the operator applied his mouth to the part, and,
                    having sucked the blood, spat it into a bowl of wine, and threw a styptic powder
                    upon the wound. This ceremony was usually accompanied with great rejoicings and
                    feasting; and at this time the child was named in presence of the company. The
                    Jews invented several superstitious customs at this ceremony, one of which
                    consisted in placing three stools; one for the cir-cumcisor, the second for the
                    person who held the child, and the third for Elijah, who, as they supposed,
                    assisted invisibly at the ceremony.</p>
                <p>The Jews distinguished their proselytes into two sorts, according as they were
                    circumcised or not; those who submitted to this rite were looked upon as
                    children of Abraham, and obliged to keep the laws of Moses; the uncircumcised
                    were only bound to observe the precepts of Noah, and were called <hi
