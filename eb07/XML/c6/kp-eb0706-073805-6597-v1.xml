                    rend="smallcaps">le,</hi> a celebrated writer and universal scholar, was born at
                    Geneva in 1657. After he had passed through,the usual course of study at Geneva,
                    and had lost his father in 1676, he went to France in 1678; but returning the
                    year after, he was ordained with the general applause of all his examiners. In
                    1682, Le Clerc visited England with the view of learning the language of that
                    country. He preached several times in the French churches in London, and visited
                    several bishops and men of learning; but the smoky air of the town not agreeing
                    with his lungs, he returned to Holland within the year, where he at length
                    settled. He preached before a synod held at Rotterdam by the remonstrants in
                    1684, and was admitted professor of philosophy, polite literature, and the
                    Hebrew tongue, in their school at Amsterdam. The remainder of his life affords
                    nothing but the history of his works, and of the controversies in which he was
                    engaged; but these would lead into too extensive a detail. He continued to read
                    lectures regularly; and because he found no single author full enough for his
                    purpose, he drew up and published his Logic, Ontology, Pneumatology, and Natural
                    Philosophy. He published <hi rend="italic">Ars Critica</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> a Commentary on the Old Testament; a Compendium <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> Universal History; an Ecclesiastical History of the two first
                    Centuries; and a French Translation of the New Testament. In 1686, he began,
                    jointly with Μ. de Crose, his <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Universelle et
                    Historique,</hi> in imitation of other literary journals; which was continued
                    till the year 1693 inclusive, in 26 volumes. In 1703 he began his <hi
                    rend="italic">Bibliothèque Choisie,</hi> and continued it to 1714, when he
                    commenced another work on the same plan, called <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque
                    Ancienne et Moderne,</hi> which he continued to the year 1728; all of them
                    justly deemed excellent stores of useful knowledge. In 1728 he was seized with a
                    palsy and fever; and having spent the last six years of his life in a state of
                    mental imbecility, he died in 1736.</p>

                    in 1637. After having learned designing, lie applied himsclf to mathematics, and
                    became engineer to the Marshal de la Ferté. He went to Paris in 1665, where he
                    applied himself to designing and engraving with such success, that Μ. Colbert
                    gave him a pension of 600 crowns. In 1672 he was admitted into the royal academy
                    of painting and sculpture; and in 1680 he was made professor of geometry and
                    perspective in the same academy. Besides a great number of designs and prints,
                    he published, 1. A Treatise on Theoretical and Practical Geometry; 2. A Treatise
                    on Architecture; and other works. He died in 1714. Le Clerc was an excellent
                    artist, but chiefly in the petty style. His genius seldom exceeds the dimensions
                    of six inches. Within these limits he could draw up 20,000 men with great
                    dexterity. No <pb break="no" facs="nls:193356610?mode=fullsize"
