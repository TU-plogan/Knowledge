                <p><label type="entry">CALICUT</label>, a district of Hindustan, in the province of
                    Malabar, which extends along the sea coast, between the parallels of 10 and 12
                    degrees north latitude, about sixty or seventy miles, but is of inconsiderable
                    breadth. It is fertile and productive, abounding generally in all sorts of
                    Indian commodities, such as rice, cocoa nuts, betel nuts, black pepper, ginger,
                    turmeric, &amp;c. which are exported in exchange for articles of clothing. This
                    district is inhabited by the sect of the Nairs, whose habits and customs are so
                    singular. It was governed by the Tamuri rajahs until the Mussulman invasion; and
                    Calicut became a flourishing city, owing to the success which its lords had in
                    war, and the encouragement they gave to commerce. These princes were regularly
                    crowned. All the males of their family are called Tamburans, and all the females
                    Tamburetties. The children are also entitled to these appellations; and,
                    according to seniority, rise to the highest dignities that belong to the
                    families. These Tamburetties are betrothed in their infancy, and are married at
                    the age of ten; but it would be reckoned scandalous to cohabit with their
                    husbands; and they accordingly live in the houses of their brothers and mothers,
                    and cohabit with Nambu-ris, or Brahmins of high caste, whose sacred character is
                    preferred, and sometimes by Nairs of the higher rank. The husband allows his
                    wife clothes, ornaments, and subsistence; and she lives in the house of his
                    mother or brother, cohabiting indiscriminately with Brahmins and Nairs, so that,
                    according to this system of promiscuous intercourse, no man knows his own
                    father. The oldest man of the family by the female line is the Tamuri. The
                    English first began to frequent the zamorin’s dominions in 1664. In 1766 Hyder
                    Ali invaded the country in person, and the Cochin rajah quietly submitted to pay
                    tribute. But the pride of the rajah or zamorin, who pretends to be of a higher
                    rank than the Brahmins, refused any kind of submission; and after an unavailing
                    resistance, being made prisoner, he set fire to the house in which he was
                    confined, and was burned along with it; while several of his attendants who were
                    accidentally excluded when he shut the door, threw themselves into the flames,
                    and shared the fate of their master. Hyder being called away by a war in the
                    dominions of the nabob of Arcot, the rajahs embraced the opportunity, and
                    repossessed themselves of their lands, which they held for seven years. They
                    were afterwards driven into Travancore. After nine years the British entered the
                    country and took Palighat; but on the approach of Tippoo they were obliged to
                    retreat. The rajahs continued in exile until 1790; but in the war with Tippoo
                    they joined the British army; and in 1792 the country was ceded to the
                    Company.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Calicut,</hi> the capital of the preceding district, was
                    formerly a magnificent and extensive city. The ancient town has long been
                    submerged by the sea; and at very low tides the waves are said to break over the
                    tops of the highest temples and minarets. The present town stands on the
                    sea-shore, in a low and unsheltered situation, with narrow and dirty streets. It
                    is, however, populous, and the seat of a considerable trade. The port is
                    frequented by vessels from Arabia and the Red Sea for wood, which is the
                    principal commodity; as also spiceries, cardamums, piece goods, &amp;c. It was
                    at this city that Vasco de Gama arrived in May 1498, ten months and two days
                    after he had departed from Lisbon. In 1509 the Portuguese attacked Calicut with
                    3000 troops; but they were repulsed with great loss, and the general was slain
                    in the attack. This town was taken in 1773 by Hyder Ali, who expelled all the
                    merchants and factors, destroyed the cocoa-nut trees, sandal-wood, and pepper
                    vines, that the country, reduced to ruin, might present no temptation to the
                    cupidity of Europeans. It was afterwards taken and destroyed by his son Tippoo
                    Saib, who carried off the inhabitants to Beypoor. When the country was conquered
                    by the English, they returned and rebuilt the town, which, in the year 1800,
                    consisted of 5000 houses, for the most part mean edifices, inhabited by Moplays.
                    The proper name of the place is Colicodu, which means the cock-crowing; the
                    district of Colicodu being meant to include all the territory in which a cock
                    crowing in a small temple could be heard. It is 76 miles W. of Coimbetore, and
                    95 S. W. of Seringapatam. Long. 75. 50. E. Lat. 11. 15. N.</p>
