                <p><label type="entry">CHIRON</label>, a famous personage of antiquity, styled by
                    Plutarch, in his dialogue on music, <hi rend="italic">the wise Centaur.</hi> Sir
                    Isaac Newton places his birth in the first age after Deu- .calion ’ s deluge,
                    commonly called the Golden Age; and adds, that he formed the constellations for
                    the use of the Argonauts when he was eighty-eight years of age; for he was a
                    practical astronomer, as well as his daughter Hippo. Chiron may, therefore, be
                    said to have flourished in the earliest ages of Greece, as he preceded the
                    conquest of the Golden Fleece, and the Trojan war. He is generally called the
                    son of Saturn and Phillyra; and he is said to have been born in Thessaly among
                    the Centaurs, the first Greeks who acquired the art of breaking and riding
                    horses; from which circumstance the poets, painters, and sculptors have
                    represented them as a compound of man and horse: and perhaps it was imagined by
                    the Greeks, as well as the Americans, when they first saw cavalry, that the
                    horse and the rider constituted but one animal.</p>
                <p>Chiron was represented by the ancients as one of the first inventors of medicine,
                    botany, and chirurgery, which last word some etymologists have derived from his
                    name. He inhabited a grotto or cave at the foot of Mount Pelion, which, from his
                    wisdom and great knowledge of all kinds, became the most celebrated and
                    frequented school throughout Greece. Almost all the heroes of his time were fond
                    of receiving his instructions; and Xenophon, who enumerates them, names the
                    following illustrious personages among his disciples: Cephalus, AEsculapius,
                    Me-lanion, Nestor, Amphiaraus, Peleus, Telamon, Meleager, Theseus, Hippolitus,
                    Palamedes, Ulysses, Mnestheus, Diomedes, Castor and Pollux, Machaon and
                    Podalirius, Antilochus, Achilles, and AEneas. From this catalogue it appears
                    that Chiron frequently instructed both fathers and sons; and Xenophon has
                    recorded a short eulogium on each, which may be read in his works. The Greek
                    historian, however, has omitted naming several of his scholars, such as Bacchus,
                    Phoenix, Cocytus, Arystaeus, Jason and his son Medeus, Ajax, and Protesilaus. It
                    is pretended that the Grecian Bacchus was the favourite scholar of the Centaur;
                    and that he taught this master the revels, orgies, bacchanalia, and other
                    ceremonies of his worship. According to Plutarch, it was likewise at the school
                    of Chiron that Hercules studied music, medicine, and justice; although Diodorus
                    Siculus affirms that Linus was the music-master of this hero. But of all the
                    heroes who were disciples of the Centaur, none reflected so much honour upon him
                    as Achilles, whose renown he in some measure shared, and to whose education he
                    in a particular manner attended, being his grandfather by the mother’s side.
                    Apollodorus tells us, that music occupied a considerable part of the time which
                    he devoted to the instruction of his young pupil, and that he viewed it as an
                    incitement to virtuous actions, and a bridle to the impetuosity of his temper.
                    One of the best remains of antique painting now extant, is a picture on this
                    subject, dug out of the ruins of Herculaneum, in which Chiron is represented in
                    the act of teaching the young Achilles to play on the lyre. The death of this
                    philosophical musician was occasioned, at an extreme old age, by an accidental
                    wound in the knee with a poisoned arrow, shot by his scholar Hercules at another
                    person. He was placed <pb break="no" facs="nls:193354686?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-4686-0591"/> after his death by Musaeus among the
                    constellations, from respect for his virtues, and in gratitude for the great
                    services which he had rendered the people of Greece. Sir Isaac Newton says, in
                    proof of the constellations being formed by Chiron and Musaeus for the use and
                    honour of the Argonauts, that nothing later than the expedition was delineated
                    on the sphere; and, according to the same author, Chiron lived till after the
                    Argonautic expedition, in which he had two grandsons. The ancients have not
                    failed to attribute to him several writings, among which, according to Suidas,
                    are <hi rend="italic">precepts, wrο0ηxa∕,</hi> in verse, composed for the use of
                    Achilles; and a medicinal treatise on the diseases incident to horses and other
                    quadrupeds; and the lexicographer even pretends that it is from this work that
                    the Centaur derived his name. Fabricius gives a list of the works attributed to
                    Chiron, and discusses the claims which have been set up for others to the same
                    writings; at the same time giving him a distinguished place in his catalogue of
                    ancient physicians.</p>
