                <p><label type="entry">CATECHUMEN</label>, a candidate for baptism, or one who
                    prepares himself for receiving that rite.</p>
                <p>The catechumens, in church history, were the lowest order of Christians in the
                    primitive church. They had some title to the common name of Christian, being a
                    degree above pagans and heretics, though not consummated by baptism. They were
                    admitted to the state of catechumens by the imposition of hands and the sign of
                    the cross.</p>
                <p>The children of believing parents were admitted as cate- <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> chumcns whenever they were capable of receiving instruction; but at what
                    age those of heathen parents might be admitted is not so clear. As to the time
                    of their continuance in this state, there were no fixed general rules, but the
                    practice varied according to the difference of times and places, and the
                    readiness and proficiency of the catechumens themselves.</p>
                <p>There were four orders or degrees of catechumens. The first consisted of those
                    instructed privately without the church, and kept at a distance for some time
                    from the privilege of entering the church, to make them the more eager and
                    desirous of doing so. The next degree consisted of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >audientes,</hi> so called from their being admitted to hear sermons and the
                    Scriptures read in the church, but they were not allowed to partake of the
                    prayers. The third sort of catechumens included the <hi rend="italic"
                    >geηu-flectentes,</hi> so called because they received imposition of hands
                    kneeling. The fourth order was that of the <hi rend="italic">competentes et
                    electi,</hi> denoting the immediate candidates for baptism, or such as were
                    appointed to be baptized at the next approaching festival; before which, strict
                    examination was made into their proficiency in the several stages of
                    catechetical exercises.</p>
                <p>After examination, they were exercised for twenty days together, and were obliged
                    to fast and confess; some days before baptism they went veiled, and it was
                    customary to touch their ears, saying, <hi rend="italic">Ephatha,</hi> be
                    opened; as also to anoint their eyes with clay; both ceremonies being in
                    imitation of our Saviour’s practice, and intended to shadow out to the
                    catechumens their condition both before and after their admission into the
                    Christian church.</p>
