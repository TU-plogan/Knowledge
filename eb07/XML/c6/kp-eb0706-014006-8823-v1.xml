                    facetiousness, which made him agreeable to everybody. He published in 1720 a
                    little collection of poems, and in 1732 six cantatas, written and composed by
                    himself. He also composed sundry songs for modern comedies, particularly those
                    in the Provoked Husband; he wrote a farce called The Contrivances, in which were
                    several little songs set to very pretty airs of his own composition; and he also
                    composed two or three little dramas for Goodman’s Fields Theatre, which were
                    very favourably received. In 1729 he published by subscription his poems much
                    enlarged, with the addition of one entitled Namby Pamby, in which Ambrose
                    Philips is ridiculed. Carey’s talent, says his historian, lay in humour and
                    satire without malevolence. To ridicule the rant and bombast of modern
                    tragedies, he wrote one, to which he gave the strange title of
                    Chrononhotonthologos, acted in 1734. He also wrote a farce called The Honest
                    Yorkshireman. Carey was a thorough Englishman, and had an insurmountable
                    aversion to the Italian opera and the singers in it; he wrote a burlesque opera
                    on the subject of the Dragon of Wantley, and afterwards a sequel to it, entitled
                    the Dragoness, both which were esteemed a good burlesque of the Italian opera.
                    His qualities being of the entertaining kind, he was led into more expenses than
                    his finances could bear, and thus was frequently in distress. His friends,
                    however, were always ready to assist him by their little subscriptions to his
                    works; and encouraged by these, he republished in 1740 all the songs he had ever
                    composed, in a collection entitled The Musical Century, in a hundred English
                    Ballads, and in 1743 his dramatic works in a small volume 4to. With all his
                    mirth and good humour, he seems to have been at times deeply affected with the
                    malevolence of some of his own profession, who, for reasons that no one can
                    guess at, were his enemies; and this, with the pressure of his circumstances, is
                    supposed to have occasioned his untimely end; for about 1744, at his house in
                    Warner Street, Cold Bath Fields, he, in a fit of desperation, put a period to a
                    life which, Sir John Hawkins says, was without reproach. It is to be noted, and
                    it is somewhat singular in such a character, that in all his songs and poems on
                    wine, love, and such kinds of subjects, he seems to have manifested an
                    inviolable regard for decency and good maimers.</p>
