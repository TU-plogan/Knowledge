                <p><label type="entry">CHANCE</label>, a term wc apply to events, to denote that
                    they happen without any necessary or foreknown cause. Our aim is to ascribe
                    those things to <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> which do not necessarily follow as
                    the natural effects of any sufficient cause; but our ignorance and precipitancy
                    often lead us to attribute effects to <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> which
                    proceed from a determinate cause. When we say a thing happens <hi rend="italic"
                    >by chance,</hi> we really mean no more than that its cause is unknown to us;
                    not, as some vainly imagine, that <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> itself can be
                    the cause of any thing. The case of the painter, who, unable to express the foam
                    at the mouth of a horse which he had painted, threw his sponge in despair at the
                    piece, and <hi rend="italic">by chance</hi> did that which he could not before
                    do by design, is an eminent instance of the force <hi rend="italic">of
                    chance</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> yet it is obvious all we mean by <hi
                    rend="italic">chance</hi> here is, that the painter did not fore-calculate the
                    effect, or that he did not throw the sponge with a view to produce it.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Chance</hi> is frequently personified and erected into a
                    chimerical being, whom we conceive as acting arbitrarily, and producing all the
                    effects the real causes of which do not appear to us; in which sense the word
                    coincides with the <hi rend="italic">τυ∙χp,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fortuna,</hi><hi rend="italic">of</hi> the ancients.</p>
                <p>Chance is also used for the manner of deciding things, the conduct or direction
                    of which is left at large, and not reducible to any determinate rules or
                    measures, or where there is no ground for preference, as at cards, dice,
                    lotteries, and the like.</p>
                <p>The ancient <hi rend="italic">sortilege</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chance,</hi> Μ.
                    Placette observes, was instituted by God himself; and in the Old Testament we
                    find several standing laws and express commands which prescribed its use on
                    certain occasions. Hence the Scripture says, “The <hi rend="italic">lot</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">chance</hi> fell on Matthias,” when it was in question who
                    should fill Judas’s place in the apostolate; and hence also arose the <hi
                    rend="italic">sortes</hi><hi rend="italic">sanctorum,</hi> or method of
                    determining things, amdng the ancient Christians, by opening some of the sacred
                    books, and pitching on the first verse the eye rested on as a sure prognostic of
                    what was to happen. The <hi rend="italic">sartes Homericoe, Virgilianoe,
                    Proenestinoe,</hi> and the like, used by the heathens, were resorted to with the
                    same view, and in the same manner. St Augustin seems to approve of this method
                    of determining things future, and owns that he had practised it himself,
                    grounding his doing so on the principle that God presides over <hi rend="italic"
                    >chance.</hi></p>
                <p>CiīANĆE-ïlZeďZey, in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> is where one is doing a lawful
                    act, and a person is thereby accidentally killed; for if the act be unlawful, it
                    is felony. Thus, if a person, not intending harm, cast·a stone, which happens to
                    hit one, and he dies of the blow, or a schoolmaster in correcting his scholar,
                    or an officer in whipping a criminal in a reasonable manner, happens to occasion
                    his death, this is chance-medley, and misadventure.</p>
