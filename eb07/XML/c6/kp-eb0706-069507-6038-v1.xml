                <p><label type="entry">CILICIA</label>, an ancient kingdom of Asia, situated between
                    the 36th and 40th degrees of north latitude, and bounded on the east by Syria,
                    or rather by Mount Amanus, which separates it from that kingdom; on the west by
                    Pamphylia; on the north by Isauria, Cappadocia, and Armenia Minor; and on the
                    south by the Mediterranean Sea. The whole country was divided by the ancients
                    into <hi rend="italic">Cilicia</hi><hi rend="italic">Aspera</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Cilicia</hi><hi rend="italic">Campestris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the former was called by the Greeks <hi rend="italic">Petroea</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">Stony,</hi> from its abounding with stones.</p>
                <p>According to Josephus, Cilicia was first peopled by Tarshish the son of Javan,
                    and his descendants, and hence the whole country was named Tarsus. The ancient
                    inhabitants were in process of time driven out by a colony of Phoenicians, who
                    under the conduct of Cilix first settled in the island of Cyprus, and thence
                    passed into the country which, from their leader, they called Cilicia. Several
                    other colonies from different nations afterwards settled in this kingdom,
                    particularly from Syria and Greece, and hence theCilicians in some places used
                    the Greek tongue, in others the Syriac; but the former was greatly corrupted by
                    the Persian, the predominant language of the country being a dialect of that
                    tongue. We find no mention of the kings of Cilicia after their settlement in
                    that country till the time of Cyrus: to him, however, they voluntarily
                    submitted, and continued subject to the Persians till the overthrow of that
                    empire; but they were governed, till the time of Artaxerxes Mnemon, by kings of
                    their own nation. After the downfal of the Persian empire, Cilicia became a
                    province of the kingdom of Macedon; and, on the death of Alexander, it fell to
                    the share of Seleucus, and continued under his descendants till it was reduced
                    into a Roman province by Pompey. As a proconsular province, it was first
                    governed by Appius Claudius Pulcher, and after him by Cicero, who reduced
                    several strongholds on Mount Amanus, in which some Cilicians had fortified
                    themselves, and held out against his predecessor. It was on this occasion that
                    the division formerly mentioned, into <hi rend="italic">Petroea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Campestris,</hi> took place. The latter became a Roman province;
                    but the former was governed by kings appointed by the Romans, till the reign of
                    Vespasian, when the family of Tracondementus being extinct, this part also
                    became a province of the empire, and the whole was divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">Cilicia</hi><hi rend="italic">Prima,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Cilicia</hi><hi rend="italic">Secunda,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Isauria</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the first including all <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cilicia</hi><hi rend="italic">Campestris,</hi> the second the coast of <hi
                    rend="italic">Cilicia Petroea,</hi> and the last the inland parts of the same
                    division. It is now a province of Asiatic Turkey, and is called Caramania,
                    having been the lašt province of theCara-manian kingdom which held out against
                    the Ottoman race.</p>
