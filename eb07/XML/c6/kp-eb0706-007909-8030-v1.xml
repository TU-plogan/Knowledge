                    du</hi></label>, one of the most learned writers of his time, was born at Amiens
                    on the 18th December 1610. His father, who was royal provost of Beauquesnc, sent
                    him at an early age to the Jesuits’ College in Amiens, where he soon
                    distinguished himself by his application and quickness of apprehension. Having
                    completed the usual course at this seminary, he applied himself to the study of
                    law at Orleans, and afterwards went to Paris, where he was received as advocate
                    before <pb break="no" facs="nls:193348043?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-8043-0080"/> the parliament in August 1631. He frequented the
                    courts for some time; but meeting with little or no success as a barrister, he
                    returned to his native country, where he applied himself to the study of history
                    in all its branches. After the death of his father, Du Cange married, on 19th
                    July 1638, Catherine Du Bos, daughter of a treasurer of France, at Amiens; and
                    seven years afterwards, in 1647, he purchased the same office, the duties of
                    which in no degree interfered with or retarded the great literary works in which
                    he had engaged. The plague, which in 1668 desolated the city, forced him to
                    leave Amiens, and go to establish himself at Paris, where he was enabled to
                    consult charters, diplomas, titles, manuscripts, and a multitude of printed
                    documents, which were not to be met with elsewhere. Μ. d’Héronval, his friend,
                    procured for him many curious pieces, and often aided him in his researches. In
                    1688 he was seized with stranguary, and died of the effects of that malady on
                    the 23d October the same year. To the attributes of a good son, a good husband,
                    and a good father, Du Cange united those of extreme gentleness, affability, and
                    modesty. His industry was exemplary and unremitting; and notwithstanding the
                    length to which his career extended, the number of his literary works would be
                    incredible, if the originals, all written in his own hand, were not still
                    extant. In his productions are united the characters of a consummate historian,
                    an exact geographer, a profound jurist, an enlightened genealogist, a learned
                    antiquary, and one deeply versed in the science of medals and inscriptions. He
                    knew almost all languages, possessed a thorough acquaintance with the
                    belles-lettres, and from a vast number of manuscripts and original documents
                    drew much curious information respecting the manners and customs of the darkest
                    ages. The learned prefaces of his glossaries afford ample proofs of his
                    philosophical genius, and are, of their kind, models in point both of matter and
                    of style. “Where,” said Bayle, “is the learned man among the nations most
                    distinguished for their perseverance in labour, and the patience necessary for
                    copying and making extracts, who does not admire the talents of Du Cange in this
                    respect, and consider him as unrivalled in the pursuits to which he devoted
                    himself? If any one has doubts ori the subject, it is only necessary to send him
                    <hi rend="italic">ad peenam</hi><hi rend="italic">libri</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> let him turn over the leaves of these dictionaries, and, be he ever so
                    little learned, he will see that they could not have been composed, except by
                    one of the most laborious and most patient men the world ever produced.” Du
                    Cange published the following works: 1. Histoire de l’Empire de Constantinople
                    sous les Empereurs François. Paris, 1657, folio. 2. Traité Historique du Chef de
                    S. Jean-Baptiste. Paris, 1666, 4to. 3. Histoire de S. Louis, Roi de France,
                    écrite par Jean, sire de Joinville. Paris, 1668, folio. 4. Joannis Cinnami

                    2 vols. fol. 11. Chronicon Paschale à Mundo condito ad Heraclii Imperatoris
                    annum vigesimum. Paris, 1689, fol. This last work was passing through the press
                    when Du Cange died; and, on his demise, it was edited by Baluze, who published
                    it with an éloge of the author prefixed. After the death of this remarkable man,
                    his manuscript autographs, and his extensive and valuable library, passed to his
                    eldest son, Philip du Fresne, a man of information, but who died, unmarried,
                    four years after his father. Francis du Fresne, the second son, and two sisters,
                    then received the succession and sold the library, when the greater part of the
                    manuscripts was purchased by the Abbé du Champs, who made no use of them, but
                    handed them over to a bookseller called Mariette, who re-sold part of them to
                    Baron Hohendorf. The remaining part was acquired by DΗozier, the genealogist.
                    But the French government, sensible of the importance of all the writings of Du
                    Cange, succeeded, after much trouble, in collecting the greater portion of the
                    manuscript autographs of this eminent scholar; and although they had been
                    scattered in Paris, Amiens, and Vienna, very few of them were lost. Among these
                    manuscripts was one, entitled <hi rend="italic">Gallia,</hi> a work of
                    incredible erudition, being a history of France, divided into seven epochs, with
                    a number of dissertations, the greater part of which are finished and ready for
                    the press, whilst, in regard to those which are not so, abundant materials have
                    been provided for completing the author’s design. <hi rend="smallcaps"
