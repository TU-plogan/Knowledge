                    eminent of the reformers from Popery after Luther, and, from the large body of
                    Christians distinguished by his name, deemed entitled to equality with him, was
                    born at Noyou, in Picardy, in 1509. His father was a cooper in that place, and
                    bore the name of Chauvin or Cauvin, which his son afterwards latinized into
                    Calvinus, whence originated the usual appellation of Calvin, by which he has
                    ever since been distinguished. Some traits of early piety evincing themselves in
                    Calvin, he was, like Samuel, from his infancy designed by his family for the
                    church. The first benefice presented to him was in the cathedral of his native
                    place, to which was afterwards added the rectory of Pont ľEvêque. He had not as
                    yet received priest’s orders, but only the tonsure, when his father changed his
                    mind, and requested him to study the civil law. This was the more readily
                    assented to by the young divine, as he had already become disgusted with some of
                    the practices of his own church. Accordingly he repaired first to Orleans, and
                    afterwards to Bourges, to pursue his new professional career. Divinity, however,
                    was not neglected, for he still continued to cultivate it in private with
                    unslackened assiduity. His father dying, he returned to Noyou; and resigning his
                    benefice, set out for Paris, where he wrote his commentary on Seneca’s treatise
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Clementia,</hi> upon the title-page
                    of which he first assumed the name of Calvinus. IIe now began to be identified
                    with the reformers; but a storm having burst on them in Paris, he was compelled
                    to fly from that city. He repaired to Angoulême, where he subsisted some time by
                    teaching Greek; and receiving shelter in the house of a converted canon, he
                    composed the greater portion of his <hi rend="italic">Institutes.</hi> The Queen
                    of Navarre favoured his doctrines; and, under cover of her protection, he once
                    more ventured to return to Paris in 1534; buta further persecution being again
                    threatened, he finally quitted France, and retired to Basel, in Switzerland,
                    where he published his famous <hi rend="italic">Christian Institutes.</hi> This
                    work was dedicated to Francis I. in an elegant Latin epistle. It was designed to
                    give a fair view of the religious principles of the reformed, which had already
                    been confounded by their enemies with those of the Anabaptists and other sects.
                    In these circumstances, it is not surprising that it obtained immediate
                    popularity. It went rapidly through several editions, and was translated into
                    all the principal modern languages. The boldness and originality of the
                    speculations, the talent with which the work was composed, and the effects which
                    it has produced upon the religious belief of Christians, entitle it to be looked
                    upon as one of the most remarkable books that ever appeared. After its
                    publication, the author repaired to Italy on a visit to the Duchess of Ferrara,
                    a convert to his doctrines; and returning to France, took Geneva on his way,
                    where, at the urgent request of several eminent reformers, he was induced to
                    remain, filling the offices of preacher and professor of divinity. He entered
                    upon these in 1536, and soon evinced the firmness and vigourof his mind, by
                    obliging the people to abjure Popery, and swear to a code of religious belief.
                    He carried the assumption of ecclesiastical authority so far, however, that
                    resistance succeeded; and the Catholic party prevailing, he was compelled to
                    quit Geneva. He went to Strasburg, where he established a French church
                    according to his own plan, and was also preferred to the professorship of
                    divinity. Here he married the widow of an Anabaptist, and published his <hi
                    rend="italic">Commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans.</hi> He also wrote an
                    able reply to Cardinal Sadolet, who had published a work exhorting the Genevese
                    to return again to the Catholic church. In the mean time, his party at Geneva
                    having laboured assiduously for his recal, he yielded at last to their
                    entreaties, and triumphantly returned to the scene of his former labours in
                    1541.</p>
                <p>His plan of church government he now matured and established. Indeed his whole
                    system, both of doctrine and ecclesiastical discipline, was maintained and
                    promoted with all the energy, firmness, and perseverance for which he was so
                    distinguished. He formed the lofty idea of making Geneva the mother and seminary
                    of all the reformed churches; and for this purpose he established an academy,
                    the character of which was eminently sustained by his own great learning and
                    ability, as well as by that of Beza and other distinguished reformers. The
                    result realized his hopes; for every country on which the reformation had shed
                    its propitious influence sent forth a portion of its youth to study at the feet
                    of the new Gamaliel. The three great points distinguishing the system of Calvin
                    from that of the other reformed churches consisted in the independence of church
                    government of the civil power; the real though spiritual presence of the Saviour
                    in the sacrament; and the absolute decree of God by which portions of the human
                    race are predestined from all eternity to everlasting happiness or misery. W <hi
                    rend="superscript"> τ</hi> ith the same boldness which he had displayed in
                    conceiving, did he maintain his system, not only by his writings and extensive
                    influence^ which reached wherever the new opinions prevailed, but also by his
                    form of ecclesiastical discipline, and a consistorial jurisdiction which had the
                    power of inflicting canonical punishments. The latter were sometimes dispensed
                    with unpardonable severity; so much so, indeed, that many apprehended that the
                    reign of papal tyranny was to be revived under a new disguise. One or two facts
                    show that Calvin had imbibed a portion of the persecuting spirit of that church
                    which he had forsaken. His treatment of Castalio and others was .extremely
                    harsh, but his conduct to Servetus was altogether barbarous. That ill-fated
                    individual having fled from papal wrath, was seized at the instigation of
                    Calvin, and condemned to the flames. The spirit of the age was of a persecuting
                    character, and had its full influence on the mind of Calvin. Besides, religious
                    liberty was not the primary object of the reformers; it has rather been the
                    result of their labours. Thus philosophy may, to a certain extent, palliate the
                    crime, for such it must be called; but it has left a blot upon Calvin, from
                    which it will be vain for his warmest eulogist even to attempt to purify his
                    name. But though the rigour of his proceedings sometimes occasioned great
                    tumults in the city, nothing could shake his steadiness and inflexibility.
                    Amongst all the disturbances of the commonwealth, he exercised a paternal
                    solicitude for the foreign churches in England, France, Germany, and Poland; and
                    did more by his pen than his presence, sending his advice and instructions by
                    letter, and writing a number of works. After a life of incessant labour and
                    study, which, it is reasonable to believe, materially shortened his days, this
                    great reformer died in May 1564, having nearly completed the fifty-fifth year of
                    his age.</p>
                <p>Calvin possessed in an eminent degree those qualities <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193347380?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-7380-0029"/> which fit an
                    individual for being the head of a party. The leading characteristic of his mind
                    was commanding power. He had a clear and comprehensive understanding, which not
                    only enabled him with facility to unravel the tangled web of sophistry, but also
                    to construct from the wreck he had made a system of his own; and a firmness and
                    inflexibility of purpose which tended to wed him for ever to the cause he had
                    espoused, with a devotcdness which no opposition could overcome, and no
                    vicissitude could shake. There was certainly an alloy of human error and
                    weakness in his temper and character; but this is only saying that nothing human
                    reaches the standard of perfect rectitude. His faults primarily resulted from
                    those very energies which gave him pre-eminence. Indomitable firmness imparts a
                    certain sternness to the deportment, and not unfrequently degenerates into a
                    spirit of persecution. But the benefits which mankind derive from such a
                    constitution of intellect, when the moral bias is good, are generally of such a
                    magnitude as totally to counterbalance those minor defects to which the rancour
                    of party spirit would wish to give undue prominence. In this light we must view
                    Calvin; not so much a patron to be imitated in all respects, as a benefactor to
                    be revered. He must take his place beside the illustrious Luther. They are twin
                    stars, the brightest of that constellation of lights by whose effulgence was
                    dispelled the long night of darkness under the cloud of which the energies of
                    men had suffered eclipse; and having emerged, they shone forth with a brilliance
                    and glory unparalleled in the history of the world. In his principles Calvin was
                    devoutly sincere, and the purity of his “walk and conversation'’ in private life
                    is unimpeachable. His writings are numerous; for, besides the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Institutes,</hi> and many controversial productions, he published learned
                    commentaries upon most of the books of the New, and on the Prophets of the Old
                    Testament. His opinions are now, however, better known than his writings; and
                    his doctrine of predestination in particular, connected as it is with the
                    philosophy of necessity, will probably supply matter of speculative debate for
                    the controversialists of all future times.</p>
