                    de Levi, Count de,</hi> Marquis d’Esternay, Baron de Bransac, was born at Paris
                    in October 1692. He was the eldest of the two sons of John Count de Caylus,
                    lieutenant-general of the armies of the king of France, and of the marchioness
                    de Villctte. His father and mother were very careful of the education of their
                    son. The former instructed him in the profession of arms and in bodily
                    exercises; the latter watched over and fostered the virtues of his mind, and
                    this delicate task she discharged with singular success. The countess was the
                    aunt of Madame de Maintenon, and remarkable alike for the solidity of her
                    understanding and the charms of her wit. She was the author of the agreeable
                    book entitled, The Recollections of Madame de Caylus, of which Voltaire
                    published an elegant edition. The amiable qualities of the mother appeared in
                    the son, but they appeared with a bold and military air. In his natural temper
                    he was gay and sprightly, having a taste for pleasure, a strong passion for
                    independence, and an invincible aversion to the servitude of a court. Count de
                    Caylus was only twelve years of age when his father died at Brussels in 1704.
                    After finishing his exercises, he entered into the corps of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mousquetaires;</hi> and in his first campaign, in the year 1709,
                    he distinguished himself so much by his valour, that Louis XIV. commended him
                    before all the court, and rewarded him with an ensigncy in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gens-d'armerie.</hi> In 1711 he commanded a regiment of dragoons, which was
                    called by his own name, and signalized himself at the head of it in Catalonia.
                    In 1713 he was present at the siege of Fribourg, where he was exposed to
                    imminent danger in the bloody attack of the covered way. The peace of Rastadt
                    having left him in a state of inactivity ill suited to his natural temper, his
                    vivacity soon led him to travel into Italy; and his curiosity was greatly
                    excited by the wonders of that country, where antiquity is still fruitful, and
                    produces so many objects to improve the taste and to excite the admiration.
                    After a year’s absence, he returned to Paris with so strong a passion for
                    travelling and for antiquities, that he resolved to quit the army, and to devote
                    himself entirely to these pursuits.</p>
                <p>He had no sooner left the service of Louis than he set out for the Levant; and,
                    having arrived at Smyrna, proceeded to Constantinople, where he made some stay.
                    FIe next visited Greece, and other countries of the East rich in historical
                    recollections or in ancient monuments; exposed himself to fatigue, the
                    inclemency of the weather, contagion, and even the cupidity of brigands, in
                    order to gratify his desire of knowledge; visited the ruins of Ephesus,
                    including those of Colophon and the temple of Diana, under the escort of robbers
                    belonging to a troop or band called Caracayali; returned to Byzantium by the
                    Dardanelles; and lastly repaired to Adrianople, where the sultan, Mustapha I1.,
                    then resided. But in February 1717 he was recalled from the East by the
                    tenderness of his mother. From that time he only left France to make two
                    excursions to London. The Academy of Painting and Sculpture admitted him as an
                    honorary member in the year 1731; and the count, whose ambition it was to
                    deserve such a distinction, spared neither his labour, his credit, nor his
                    fortune, to instruct, assist, and animate the artists. Hc wrote the lives of the
                    most celebrated painters and engravers who had done honour to this illustrious
                    academy; and, in order to extend the limits of the art, he collected, in three
                    different works, new subjects for painting which he had met with in the works of
                    the ancients.</p>
                <p>Such was his passion for antiquity, that he wished to have had it in his power to
                    bring the whole of it to life again. He saw with regret that the works of the
                    ancient painters were effaced and destroyed almost as soon as they were drawn
                    from the subterranean mansions where they had been buried. But a fortunate
                    accident furnished him with the means of showing the composition and the colour
                    ing of the pictures of ancient Rome. The coloured drawings which Pietro S.
                    Bartoli had taken there from antique pictures happening to fall into his hands,
                    he had-them engraved; and, before he enriched the king of France’s cabinet with
                    this production, he published an edition of it at his own expense. It is perhaps
                    the most extraordinary book of antiquities that ever will appear, the whole
                    being painted with a purity and precision which are altogether inimitable. There
                    were only thirty copies published, and there is no reason to expect that there
                    will hereafter be any more.</p>
                <p>Count de Caylus was at the same time engaged in an enterprise not less
                    illustrative of Roman greatness, and still more interesting to the French
                    nation. Colbert had formed the design of engraving the Roman antiquities which
                    are still to be seen in the southern provinces of France; and by his orders
                    Mignard the architect had made drawings of them, which Count de Caylus had the
                    good fortune to recover. FIe therefore resolved to finish the work begun by
                    Colbert, and to dedicate it to that great minister; and so much had he this
                    enterprise at heart, that he was employed in it during his last illness, and
                    warmly recommended it to Μ. Mariette.</p>
                <p>In 1742 Count Caylus was admitted as an honorary member of the Academy of Belles
                    Lettres; and then it was that lie seemed to have found the place for which
                    nature designed him. The study of literature now became his ruling passion; he
                    consecrated to it his time and his fortune; lie even renounced his pleasures to
                    give himself wholly up to the object of making some discovery in the field of
                    antiquity. But amidst the fruits of his research and invention nothing afforded
                    him so much gratification as his discovery of encaustic painting. A description
                    of Pliny, too concise to give a clear view of the matter to an ordinary reader,
                    suggested the idea of this art to Μ. de Caylus. He availed himself of the
                    friendship and skill of Μ. Magault, a physician in Paris, and an excellent
                    chemist; and by repeated experiments discovered the secret of incorporating wax
                    with various tints and colours, and of rendering it manageable with the pencil.
                    Pliny has made mention of two kinds of encaustic painting practised by the
                    ancients, one of which was executed with wax on various substances, and the
                    other upon ivory with hot punches of iron. It was the former kind, however, that
                    Count de Caylus had <pb break="no" facs="nls:193350487?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0706-0487-0268"/> the merit of reviving; and Μ. Muntz afterwards
                    made many experiments in order to carry it to perfection.</p>
                <p>In the hands of Count Caylus, literature and the arts lent each other mutual aid.
                    But it would be endless to give an account of all his works. He published above
                    forty dissertations in the Memoirs of the Academy of Belles-Lettres. To the
                    artists he was particularly attentive; and in order to prevent their falling
                    into mistakes from ignorance of eostume, which the ablest of them have sometimes
                    done, he founded a prize of five hundred livres, the object of whieh was to
                    explain, by means of authors and monuments, the usages of aneient nations. In
                    order that he might enjoy with the whole world the treasures which he had
                    collected, he eaused them to be engraved, and gave a learned description of them
                    in a work whieh he embellished with eight hundred copperplates.</p>
                <p>The strength of his constitution seemed to give him hopes of a long life; but a
                    humour settling in one of his legs, entirely destroyed his health, and he
                    expired on the 5th of September 1765. His character is thus drawn by a Freneh
                    biographer:—“A severe probity, a rooted aversion to flattery, great indifference
                    about honours, a singular simplicity, perhaps sometimes a little despotism in
                    his opinions, formed the basis of his character. In him young artists found both
                    a guide and a friend; and with a discernment and a delicacy still more rare than
                    generosity, he anticipated the wants of those whose progress would have been
                    otherwise retarded by the narrowness of their means. Naturally beneficent, he
                    sometimes amused himself when he met a pauper whose appearance indicated
                    probity, by giving him a louis to get changed, and then concealing himself where
                    he could enjoy the poor creature’s embarrassment when the person from whom he
                    received the gold was not to be found. Caylus, indeed, never knew any other
                    luxury than that of liberality. His dress, in particular, was so plain that,
                    having onc day stopped before a shop on whieh a sign-painter was painting a
                    figure of St Franeis, the latter, taking him for one of his eomrades, asked his
                    opinion respecting the work, whieh Caylus instantly gave him, and which
                    delighted the painter so much, that he put the pallet and pencil into the hand
                    of his new acquaintance, and begged him to retouch the picture. Caylus mounted
                    the ladder, and having succeeded to the entire satisfaction of the painter, the
                    latter wished to take him to a neighbouring tavern, when the carriage of the
                    Count arrived, and his footman opened the door for his master. The painter of
                    saints and signs was stupefied with astonishment; but Caylus, taking him by the
                    hand, said, <hi rend="italic">Au revoir, camarade, ce sera pour la première fois
                    que nous nous rencontrerons."</hi></p>
                <p>The numerous literary works of Count Caylus may be divided into three classes;
                    humorous pieees and romances; productions relative to the fine arts; and those
                    whieh treat exclusively of antiquities. I. The first elass consists of, 1. <hi
