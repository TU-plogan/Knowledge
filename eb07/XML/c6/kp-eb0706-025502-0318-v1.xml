                    Ulster, in Irelend, is bounded by the counties of Leitrim, Fermanagh, Monaghan,
                    Louth, Meath, Westmeath, and Longford. Its form is nearly circular, with the
                    exception of the barony of Tullaghagh, which projects in a northwestern
                    direction between the two first named of the surrounding counties. It lies
                    nearly in the centre of Ireland, midway between the Atlantic Ocean and the Irish
                    Sea, its extremities being less than eighteen miles from either of these waters.
                    According to the latest and most accurate calculation, its contents are
                    estimated at 473,450 acres, or 740 square miles.</p>
                <p>The most ancient geographers speak of it as being inhabited by the tribe of the
                    Erdini. At the period of the arrival of the English, and for some centuries
                    afterwards, it was known by the name of the Brennie, Brennie O’Reylie, or
                    O’Reylie’s country. Under a commission issued by James I. for the subdivision of
                    the county, it was portioned out into seven baronies, two of which were assigned
                    to Sir John O’Reylie, three to his brother, uncle, and the representatives of
                    another of the family, while the two remaining baronies, possessed b} <hi

                    the whole county for the lord-deputy’s provision. There was also an ancient
                    subdivision of the county into small portions called polls, each containing
                    twenty-four acres. It is now divided into the baronies of Castleraghan, Clonkee,
                    Clonmaghon, Upper and Lower Loughtee, Tullaghgarvey, Tullaghagh, and
                    Tullaghonoho. At present the county rates are levied according to a peculiar
                    measurement. A certain number of town lands are united under the name of a <hi
                    rend="italic">carvaglι,</hi> of which each barony contains a thousand, making
                    eight thousand carvaghs for the whole county. Hence, if these were all of an
                    equal size, which is not the case, as they vary with the superficial contents of
                    their respective baronies, each would contain something less than sixty
                    acres.</p>
                <p>The county, according to its civil arrangements, under which the local taxes are
                    levied, eontains twenty-nine parishes, besides four parts of parishes, the
                    remaining parts of which are in the adjoining counties, three in Meath, and one
                    in Fermanagh; but, according to its ecclesiastical arrangement, into
                    thirty-three, of which twenty-nine are in the diocese of Kilmorc, three in that
                    of Ardagh, and one in that of Meath. The bishopric of Kilmorc extends over the
                    whole of the county. The seat of the see is at Kilmore, a small town nearly in
                    the centre of Cavan. According to the latest return made to parliament, the see
                    lands amounted to 47,361 acres, but no statement was then sent in as to the
                    pecuniary value of the see.</p>
                <p>The population was estimated by Beaufort in 1792 at 81,570 souls; in 1813,
                    according to the imperfect census then taken, it was supposed to be 164,000; in
                    1821, by the census of that year, it amounted to 195,076; and, according to the
                    late but imperfect census of 1831, it was 228,050, giving an increase, in forty
                    years, of 146,480 souls, or nearly double of its amount at the earliest of these
                    dates.</p>
                <p>The county sends two representatives to the imperial parliament. Before the union
                    it sent six, two for the county, and two each for the towns of Cavan and Bel
                    turbet.</p>
                <p>The surface of the country is very uneven, consisting altogether of hills and
                    valleys, without any level ground. The hills rise to a considerable elevation in
                    the interior. The highest land in the county is the mountain of Slieve Russel,
                    in the barony of Tullaghagh, on the confines of Fermanagh. In the same barony is
                    Quilca Mountain, which is held in great veneration by the inhabitants, who
                    relate many traditionary fables connected with the ancient superstitions of the
                    country. It was also the place for installing the M <hi rend="superscript">
                    i</hi> Guires, the chieftains of Fermanagh.</p>
                <p>The valleys arc, in many parts, the receptacles of lakes, which, though not of
                    very extended dimensions, arc objects of much interest, from the picturesque
                    beauties of their scenery. Lough Ramor, one of the largest, is in the southern
                    extremity of the county, near Virginia. It contains several islands, once well
                    wooded, but now mostly bare. Lough Gawnagh, in the south-west, may be considered
                    rather as a boundary between Cavan and Fermanagh, than as exclusively belonging
                    to cither county. The same observation applies to Lough Shillin. Lough Ough-ter
                    lies between the towns of Cavan and Killeshandra. Though not of very imposing
                    dimensions, the irregularity of its form, the large and beautiful islands
                    imbedded in its waters, and the many deep recesses studded with overhanging
                    woods that wind among its high banks, produce a rich variety of prospect. The
                    interest excited by its natural beauties is augmented by a circumstance of
                    historical notoriety. Bishop Bedel, when taken prisoner during the civil wars of
                    1641, was confined in Cloghoughter, one of its islands. The castle, which was
                    used as the prison of this venerable prelate, is still pointed out to strangers.
                    Becleľs remains were deposited in Kihnore church. 'The most remarkable of the
                    smaller lakes, which are to be met with in most parts of the county, is Lough
                    Swillan, in the neighbourhood of Shercock, it being considered by many as the
                    principal source of the river Erne. According to others, this river, the largest
                    in the county, derives its origin from the Lake of Scrabo, one of the minor
                    sheets of water that form Lough Gawnagh. The river itself takes a northerly
                    direction by Killcshandra and Belturbet, being enlarged during its course by the
                    Croghan, Ballyhayes, Annalee, and other streams. It enters Lough <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193350331?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0331-0256"/> Erne at its
                    most southern extremity, passes through it, and discharges itself into the
                    Atlantic at Ballyshannon, in the county of Donegal. Woodside River, which skirts
                    the county on the side of Fermanagh, falls into Lough Erne at the same place.
                    The Shannon is said by some topographers to take its rise in Quilca Mountain,
                    under the name of the Owenmore, which it changes for its more celebrated
                    appellation on its junction with the Doubally, at the point where it enters the
                    county of Leitrim, a few miles before it discharges its united streams into
                    Lough Allen.</p>
                <p>The climate of this county is chilly, and the weather often boisterous,
                    particularly in the mountainous districts. The soil is a stiff wet clay, cold
                    and spongy, producing a coarse rushy pasturage, beneath which is usually a thick
                    stratum of brown clay, resting upon a heavy yellow argillaceous substratum. The
                    soil is much improved by draining, for which its undulating surface affords
                    great facilities, and by gravelling or liming. Limestone is scarce in some
                    districts, yet much sought after; so that it is at times drawn from distances of
                    ten or twelve miles. In other parts, particularly throughout the baronies of
                    Castleraghan, Clonkee, and Clonmoghan, marl, which is met with very generally,
                    is preferred to lime, as the latter forms hard lumps when mixed with the clay
                    soil, while the former renders the soil loose and friable. A very fine kind of
                    manure, formed of decayed limestone, is found in the mountainous parts of
                    Tullaghagh. In the banks of rivers it is in great plenty; and about a mile from
                    Swadlingbar there is a large pile of it, which, when used judiciously, produces
                    most luxuriant crops.</p>
                <p>Bog of the best quality, the red ashes of which form an excellent manure, is
                    abundant. The upper part next the surface is dense and close, and makes the best
                    fuel; that immediately under is friable, and therefore less valued as fuel. The
                    bottom is solid and serviceable. In the moorish bogs, in which argillaceous
                    strata are met with throughout the peat, marl abounds, and is very easily
                    raised.</p>
                <p>A rich iron ore was raised from Quilca Mountain, and long wrought with
                    considerable profit. The ore was smelted at Swadlingbar, where mills were
                    erected for the purpose; but the works were ultimately relinquished, in
                    con-quence of the failure of timber for fuel. At Ortnacullagh, near Ballyconnel,
                    fragments of lead and silver ore are carried down the stream. Pure sulphur is
                    also found there. In this and in other parts of Tullaghagh barony, fullers’
                    earth, pipe-clay, potters’ clay, and brick-clay, are frequently met with. Fine
                    white and red transparent spars have also been occasionally picked up near
                    Fermanagh. There are indications of coal in Lugnaguilla, the most north-western
                    point of the county. It is also said that this mineral has been found in the
                    mountain of Slieve Russel, where it has been dug out of the side of the hill in
                    blocks near the surface. Another vein is said to exist at Glasleek, near
                    Shercock, of a very sulphureous quality, burning well, and emitting a bright
                    blue flame.</p>
                <p>These indications of minerals are accompanied with their usual concomitants,
                    mineral springs. The most remarkable is that of Swadlingbar, which has long
                    maintained a high character for its efficacy in restoring debilitated
                    constitutions. Its predominant ingredient is sulphur. Near the same village
                    there is a chalybeate spring. The small lake of Lough Leighs, or
                    Lough-an-Leighaghs, which signifies the healing lake, on the summit of a
                    mountain between Bailieborough and Kingscourt, is celebrated for its
                    antiscorbutic qualities. Its waters are used for drinking and bathing; but the
                    most beneficial effects are said to be produced by the mud raised from the
                    bottom of it being rubbed on the diseased part. The level of the lake never
                    varies. It has no visible supply nor vent for its discharge; neither is it ever
                    frozen or changed in temperature during the severest winters. The water at the
                    surface is clear; but within a foot downwards it becomes clogged with mud, which
                    thickens as the lake descends, to a depth hitherto unascertained. The mud is
                    drawn up for medical purposes from a depth of thirty feet, by means of a pole
                    with a hay-rope twisted round it, to which it adheres, exhibiting, when exposed
                    to the atmosphere, a greasy shining surface like tar. The water is slightly
                    chalybeate. The best season for its use is from June to August. It is said to
                    have been effectual in the cure of leprosy. Other mineral springs of inferior
                    note are those of Derrylester, containing sulphur and natron; Owen Bruen,
                    containing sulphur and calcareous nitre; and Carrickmore, containing calcareous
                    nitre, alkali, and some sulphur. The water of the last named is extremely
                    cold.</p>
                <p>The general character of the people is highly favourable. They are much inclined
                    to acts of kindliness towards each other; their hospitality to strangers is
                    proverbial, and they testify the most laudable anxiety for the education of
                    their children. Crimes of atrocity are uncommon. According to a parliamentary
                    return in 1830, the total number of individuals committed for offences during
                    that year was 171, of whom only 61 were convicted; of these thirty were for
                    illicit distillation, seventeen for larceny, and the rest for assaults,
                    cattle-stealing, and vagrancy. Domestic manufactures are generally combined with
                    agricultural occupations. The culture of flax and the fabric of linens of
                    coarser qualities formerly employed much of the time not required for the
                    external labours of the farm; but this source of profitable employment has
                    gradually declined with the general depression of the linen manufacture in
                    Ireland. The farms are small, from thirty to seven acres, the smallest being the
                    more numerous, in the proportion of ten to one. In the mountainous parts, where
                    the land is chiefly under grazing, the farms are more extensive. Wheat and
                    barley are but little cultivated. The hilly grounds are chiefly under oats, of
                    which the more elevated parts produce a very hardy species, quite black. They
                    are sown after one or two crops of potatoes; and these two vegetables form the
                    principal part of the food of the peasantry <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi>. In
                    the mountainous parts the plough is never used, in consequence of the rocky
                    nature of the ground. The loy, a kind of· spade long in the blade, with a
                    peculiar curve to prevent the adhesion of the soil, is used in its stead. With
                    this instrument the grain is trenched in high ridges. Twelve men can dig an acre
                    in a day. The undulating nature of the ground, and the copious supply of water
                    from the numerous small lakes and rivers, render the land well suited for
                    draining; but this and other modes of improvement are in many instances checked,
                    in consequence of the short and unsatisfactory tenure by which much of the land
                    in this country is held under church and school land leases. The general
                    character of the farming may be summed up in the expression, that the people are
                    by no means wanting in exertion, but their modes of culture are defective. Most
                    farmers prefer the old Irish breed of black cattle, because, though less
                    inclined to fatten, they give a larger quantity of milk. The oxen of Lough tee
                    barony arc an exception to this remark.</p>
                <p>Illicit distillation was carried on here to a great extent. The lakes afforded
                    great facilities to its practice. The grain was steeped in them, and the
                    portable and cheap apparatus employed in the process was set up close to their
                    borders; so that, in case of alarm, the whole could be flung into the water at a
                    moment’s notice, and remain concealed till raised again for future service. The
                    practice, so injurious to industry and moral improvement, is considerably on the
                    decline.</p>
                <p>The soil, in those districts not well adapted for tillage, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193350344?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0344-0257"/> is peculiarly
                    favourable for trees. Shrubs, which flourish vigorously in spi&lt;e of the
                    inclemency of the climate, spring out of the fissu∙∙es of the rock on the
                    mountainous districts. Throughout «-'he barony of Loughtee, and more
                    particularly along tl*J rich tract watered by the Erne, timber trees are to be
                    seen in great numbers. They are chiefly to be found i-∙ι demesnes, where the
                    gentry seem to vie with one anotl ’ er i∏ their cultivation; so that the
                    bareness of the landscape, too long a glaring drawback upon the natural beauties
                    of the county, is every day less observable. The seats of the resident gentry
                    are numerous and elegant. Lord Farnham has a noble mansion at Cavan. A fine
                    see-house, now building by the Bishop of Kilmore, is nearly completed. Villas of
                    much architectural and rural elegance are to be seen in various parts of the
                    county.</p>
                <p>According to the returns made under the population act in 1821, and by the

                <p>The population of the county is chiefly rural. None of its towns contains 3000
                    inhabitants, and but five contain more than 1000 each.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Cavan,</hi> the capital of the above county, has little to
                    recommend it to special notice. It is situated near the centre of the county, in
                    the parish of Urney, and barony of Upper Loughtee, on one of the tributary
                    streams of the Erne. Its situation is pleasant and healthful, being a large
                    valley, surrounded on every side by elevated grounds. A hill immediately above
                    the town, on the Dublin side, commands a very extended prospect. The town was
                    burnt down in 1791. The consequence has been that it has risen from its ashes in
                    an improved form, excepting some of the suburbs, which consist of a succession
                    of mud-built hovels, the seats of squalor and destitution too often to be seen
                    in similar situations in other country towns of Ireland. The court-house is
                    elegant in its proportions, and convenient in its internal arrangements. The
                    church, built on an elevated site, at one extremity of the town, is also an
                    elegant erection. Not far from the church is a large Roman Catholic chapel,
                    which, together with a dissenting house, was erected at the expense of Lord
                    Farnham, the proprietor of the town. In another quarter is the county infirmary,
                    to the support of which the surrounding gentry contribute liberally. Six
                    alms-houses for destitute widows have been founded by a bequest of a member of
                    the Lanesborough family. The most conspicuous building is the grammar-school,
                    one of the royal foundations of Charles I. It was rebuilt about thirty years
                    ago, at an expense of L.7500, on an eminence overlooking one of the main
                    entrances into the town. It is large and handsome, though by no means highly
                    ornamented, and is capable of accommodating upwards of one hundred resident
                    pupils. The master enjoys a salary of L.300 per annum, besides the fees from
                    pupils, with an additional allowance of L.100 for an assistant; he has also the
                    produce of ten acres of land adjoining the house. Notwithstanding these
                    advantages, the residents of the town and neighbourhood have for some years
                    reaped little benefit from this noble endowment, in consequence of the very
                    advanced age of the head master; nor have their remonstrances to the board of
                    education under whose superintendence it is, and which consists of the four
                    archbishops, and several of the bishops, nor their application to the lord
                    lieutenant, in whose gift is the disposal of the mastership, as yet been
                    effectual in procuring for them the benefits of liberal education for their
                    children contemplated by its royal founder. The sons of the neighbouring gentry,
                    and of the respectable resident inhabitants, are therefore sent, at much expense
                    and inconvenience, to distant places for their literary improvement. The county
                    jail is a substantial building, but rather small for the average number of its
                    inmates. A monastery of Dominican friars, founded by O’Reilly, chieftain of the
                    Brennie, existed here; and it was the place of burial of the celebrated Irish
                    general Owen Roe O’Neal, who died by poison at Cloghoughter in 1649. The town
                    was incorporated by a royal charter of James I., dated 15th November, in the
                    eighth year of that monarch’s reign. The population in 1821 amounted to 2320,
                    and in 1831 to 2322. (Coote’s <hi rend="italic">Statistical Survey of

                <p>CAVANILLES, <hi rend="smallcaps">Antonio Jose,</hi> a Spanish ecclesiastic, who
                    devoted himself with great assiduity to the study of botany, and has published
                    several important works, was born in 1745, at Valencia. He received his first
                    education among the Jesuits in that university, and he ever afterwards retained
                    the urbanity of character and manners characteristic of that celebrated order of
                    men. But this was, in him, accompanied with more estimable qualities of the
                    heart than are usually attributed to that order, or than any other exclusively
                    possesses. He early devoted himself to the studies of divinity and philosophy,
                    and was distinguished for diligence and ability, not only in these pursuits, but
                    in the mathematics, history, and belles-lettres. He afterwards removed to
                    Murcia, where he acquired so much credit that he was chosen by the Duke de
                    l’Infantado to superintend the education of his sons. In the house of this
                    nobleman he was perfectly domesticated; and when, after a course of years, the
                    death of his patron broke up a circle of more than usual domestic virtue and
                    felicity, at least in that elevated rank of life, the Abbé Cavanilles became
                    only a more valuable and confidential friend of the survivors. He accompanied
                    the sons of the duke, in their father’s lifetime, to Paris in 1777, where he
                    resided twelve years, adding to his various information, and particularly
                    cultivating the science of botany, with all the aids which that celebrated
                    capital was so well calculated to afford. Here he was more particularly
                    associated with the famous Jussieu, and the pupils of his school. From the
                    Linnaean botanists of Paris he was a good deal estranged; yet he acquired a
                    great inclination towards the Swedish school, and imbibed many of its good
                    principles.</p>
                <p>.The first publication of the Abbé Cavanilles was in French, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Observations</hi><hi rend="italic">sur l'article</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> ii</hi><hi rend="italic">Espagne"</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> μ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Nouvelle Encyclopédie.</hi> This pamphlet contained a defence of his country,
                    against what appeared to him an unfair attack upon it; but we know not the
                    particular subjects of the discussion. We have no difficulty in conceiving that
                    they might be manifold, and that there were few opinions upon which a man of
                    Cavanilles’ correctness and orthodoxy of character, to say nothing of his
                    patriotism, was likely to agree with the writers of the above-mentioned
                    celebrated work.</p>
                <p>He soon afterwards devoted himself to a study which promised him a less thorny
                    path. In 1785 he published at Paris his first <hi rend="italic">Dissertation
                    upon Monadelphous Plants,</hi> a <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193350357?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0706-0357-0258"/> Latin 4to,
                    containing the species of the genus <hi rend="italic">Sida,</hi> with some
                    plants nearly related thereto. The plates, uncoloured, were executed from his
                    own drawings; as were those of the rest of his numerous publications. The
                    specimens delineated in this first essay were too small and imperfect. In that
                    respect his following dissertations, making ten in all, have a considerable
                    superiority. His subsequent figures were also better engraved. The descriptions
                    are full and correct; the new species numerous; and the specific characters
                    tolerably classical, though not quite uncontaminated by the feebleness and
                    ambiguity of the French school. This work, in its beginning, not being received
                    by the Linnaean botanists of Paris, and especially by ĽHeritier, with any
                    respectful attention, the author, in an evil hour, was induced to complain, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Journal de Paris,</hi> of negleet and injustice. ĽHeritier
                    had not noticed the book in his <hi rend="italic">Stirpes Novae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> had published the same plants by different names, without
                    citing Cavanilles; and had even antedated some of his own <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fasciculi,</hi> in order to conceal, as it appeared, this literary
                    incorrectness. His reply could not, in the opinion of unprejudiced witnesses,
                    clear him of illiberal conduct; though, it is very certain, he neither did nor
                    could borrow any thing from Cavanilles. It would have been better to have
                    declared the truth, that his own plates were already engraved with different
                    names, or that he had at least chosen such as seemed to him preferable. The
                    authority of ĽHeritier’s works, by their transcendent merit, has prevailed,
                    while Cavanilles has retained all the credit due to correctness of principle and
                    intention. The ninth and <hi rend="italic">tcηihfαsciculi</hi> of Cavanilles, on
                    the <hi rend="italic">Monadelphous</hi> Plants, were indeed published at Madrid,
                    to which place the author returned in 1790. The number of plates in the whole
                    work are 296, many of which, especially in the earlier part, contain several
                    species. It cannot be denied that the merit of this work kept increasing as it
                    advanced. The abilities of the writer gained strength by exercise, and his
                    knowledge was enriched by experience. He is charged with admitting as <hi
                    rend="italic">monadelphous</hi> too many plants, the union of whose stamens is
                    very light or uncertain; but it were ungrateful to complain of any book for the
                    riches of its materials. A more real fault is, the usual one of too great and
                    artificial a subdivision of genera. This is also the fault of the school in
                    which he studied, though the grpat man at its head is perhaps as free from it as
                    any leading writer.</p>
                <p>Soon afterwards the Abbé Cavanilles began a larger and more comprehensive
                    publication, in folio, entitled <hi rend="italic">Icones et
                    Descriptiones</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum quae</hi><hi rend="italic">aut
                    sponte in Hispania crescunt, aut in Hortis hospitantur.</hi> The first volume
                    appeared in 1791, containing 100 plates, with ample descriptions. It was
                    followed by five more, of equal size and merit, the last of which came out in
                    1801. The whole work is enriched with critical remarks, and with much
                    economical, as well as what may be called picturesque and sentimental, matter,
                    respecting many native Spanish plants. The exotic part of these volumes is
                    derived from the highly valuable and novel discoveries of the Spaniards in
                    Mexico, Peru, and Chili, and the acquisitions of some voyagers to New Holland
                    and the Philippine Islands. Hence numerous very fine plants, originally
                    discovered by our own celebrated circumnavigators, but unfortunately not yet
                    published by them, have first been made known in the pages of Cavanilles.</p>
                <p>In the course of the botanical tours of our author, he collected materials for a
                    general <hi rend="italic">History of the Kingdom of Valencia,</hi> which
                    appeared in 1795, in Spanish, making two volumes. This work, which we have never
                    seen, is said to bo rich, not only in what relates to the three kingdoms of
                    nature, but likewise, in statistical and antiquarian information.</p>
                <p>Having in June 1801 been intrusted with the directorship of the royal garden at
                    Madrid, he published in 1802 another work in his native tongue, containing the
                    characters and descriptions of the plants demonstrated in his public botanical
                    lectures. To these is pre⅛ <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> d an exposition of the
                    elementary principles of the science, together with explanations of botanic
                    terms. Cavanilles wιs also a frequent and important contributor to the periodica
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>, work entitled <hi rend="italic">Anales</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de Ciencias</hi><hi rend="italic">Naturales,</hi> published at
                    Madrid. Some observations of his, translated from this journal, may be found in
                    Dr Sim’s and Mr König’s <hi rend="italic">Annals of Botany,</hi> vol. i. 409.
                    The first of these indeed, relative to certain seemingly lenticular bodies,
                    supposed to have an important share in the impregnation of ferns and mosses, he
                    has himself contradicted, as arising from an optical deception. His candid
                    avowal of this, in a letter to Dr Schwartz, is published in volume second of the
                    said <hi rend="italic">Annals,</hi> p. 587. We think him also mistaken in the
                    true stigma of the <hi rend="italic">Iris,</hi> his opinion being sufficiently
                    refuted by those of Kolreuter and Sprengel, given in a note, in the very place
                    just quoted; nor is his idea of the stamens of certain <hi rend="italic"
                    >Asclepiadea</hi> correct. If he errs, however, he errs with great
                    authorities.</p>
                <p>The subject of our present memoir undoubtedly excelled more in practical
                    observation than in physiological speculation. He is said to have prepared, and
                    partly printed, the first volume of a <hi rend="italic">Hortus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Matritensis,</hi> being a sort of sequel to his <hi rend="italic"
                    >leones</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for it was intended to contain, not merely
                    the figures and descriptions of curious or new plants from the garden, but also
                    of rare dried specimens from the museum at Madrid. This work, with any other
                    project in favour of science which he might have formed, was cut short by his
                    death, in May 1804, in the fifty-ninth year of his age. An engraved portrait of
                    the Abbé Cavanilles, at the age of forty-four, is given in Schrader’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Neues</hi><hi rend="italic">Journal,</hi> published at Erfurt in
                    1805. Dr Schwartz, in the <hi rend="italic">Annals of Botany</hi> above quoted,
                    gives this testimony to his worth, <hi rend="superscript"> ii</hi> Cavanilles
                    was, like many others, often rather hasty in his conclusions, but always eager
                    to promote science. He was, indeed, a man of a very noble mind, and of the most
                    generous communicative turn; so that I feel I have lost much by his untimely
                    decease, which I shall ever regret.” (x. x.)</p>
