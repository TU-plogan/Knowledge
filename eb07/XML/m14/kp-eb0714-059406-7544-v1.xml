                <p><label type="entry">MEROE</label>, the name of an island included between the
                    main branch of the Nile and the Astaboras or Tacazze, and also that of the
                    capital of Ethiopia, (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Ethiopia),</hi> which was
                    situated in this island. Agatharcides, Strabo, Diodorus, and others make mention
                    of Meroe, and communicate several particulars respecting it. The island is
                    stated by Diodorus tobe 375 miles in length, and 125 miles in breadth. The exact
                    distance of Meroe from Syene or Assouan, appears to have been a subject of
                    dispute even in Pliny’s time, notwithstanding that a number of travellers had
                    already visited and even penetrated beyond the capital of Ethiopia. Delion is
                    mentioned as having travelled far beyond Meroe, which was afterwards visited by
                    Aristocreon, Bion, Basilis, and Simonides the younger, who is said to have
                    written an account of the city. Timosthenes spent sixty days in making the
                    journey by water; Eratosthenes reckoned the distance 625,000, and Artemidorus
                    600,000 paces; Bion gives a list of towns but no distances. The sixty days’
                    journey or sail by water, however, is too indefinite a datum to be of any use,
                    although it agrees tolerably well with the account given by Herodotus. But the
                    625,000 paces of Eratosthenes are about the length of the direct caravan route;
                    and the 600,000 paces of Artemidorus, agree still more closely with the
                    ascertained length of that route, across tlιe Great Desert by Korosko and
                    Abu-Hammed, which is <pb break="no" facs="nls:194207557?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-7557-0595"/> 560 miles. According to Pliny, the dispute
                    concerning the distance from Syene to Meroe was finally settled by the
                    prctorians and tribune sent by Nero to explore the country, and who calculated
                    it at 876,000 paces, and on the supsition that these men followed the
                    sinuosities of the river, in order to observe the towns, and report upon the
                    resources of the country, this is pretty near to the truth. Pliny computes the
                    distance from Napata to the island of Meroe at 360,000 paces, and further states
                    that, from the commencement of the island to the site of the town, it is 70,000
                    paces, the actual distance being about 60 miles. The difficulty here, however,
                    is to ascertain the position of the ancient Napata, which has been fixed by some
                    at Gibel-el-Birkel, and by others at Old Dongola, whilst Ptolemy places it much
                    farther to the north. In fact, Gibel-el-Birkel is nearer to Meroe than the
                    ancient Napata by about 100 miles, that is, reckoning from Pliny’s computation
                    of the distance of the latter as compared with that of the former place, which
                    has been ascertained by modern travellers; and hence the presumption is in
                    favour of the accuracy of Ptolemy, who, as we have just mentioned, places the
                    site of Napata farther to the north. That geographer, moreover, places the
                    capital of Ethiopia in latitude 16° <hi rend="italic">'26',</hi> which differs
                    only by 30' from the latitude as determined by the observations of Caillaud. All
                    that remains of ancient Meroe is its magnificent necropolis, as it has been
                    called, crowded with pyramids, of which a very full and interesting account is
                    given in Hoskins’s <hi rend="italic">Travels in Ethiopia.</hi> “The pyramids of
                    Djizeh are magnificent,” says this traveller, “wonderful from their stupendous
                    magnitude; but for picturesque effect and elegance of architectural design, I
                    infinitely prefer those of Mcroe. I expected to find few remains here, and
                    certainly nothing so imposing, so interesting as these sepulchres doubtless of
                    the kings and queens of Ethiopia. I stood for some time lost in admiration. From
                    every point of view, I saw magnificent groups, pyramid rising behind pyramid,
                    while the dilapidated state of many did not render them less interesting, though
                    less beautiful as works of art.” From motives of curiosity or perhaps avarice,
                    attempts have been made to open many of the pyramids, but without success. In
                    those which had been partially broken into Mr. Hoskins did not perceive the
                    slightest indication that any of them contained galleries; a circumstance which
                    does not appear to favour his opinion that they were places of sepulture. There
                    is no doubt, however, that these pyramids belong to a very remote age, and form
                    a subject of interesting investigation, with reference to the question whether
                    the Ethiopians derived their knowledge of the arts from the Egyptians, or the
                    Egyptians from the Ethiopians. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ethiopian
                    Nations.)</hi> The hieroglyphics are much defaced, and inferior in grouping or
                    arrangement to those in the Egyptian inscriptions, being, according to the view
                    which may be taken of the course of civilization, either a corruption of the
                    Egyptian style, or the source whence it was originally derived. As to the city
                    of Mcroe itself, with its temples and palaces, scarcely a trace or vestige
                    remains. A large space about 2000 feet in length, and at the same distance from
                    the river, being strewed with burned bricks, some fragments of walls and stones
                    similar to those used in the construction of the pyramids, is supposed to have
                    formed part of the site of the capital; and this idea is strengthened by the
                    remark of Strabo, that the walls of the habitations were built of bricks. As at
                    Memphis, however, scarcely a trace of a palace or temple is to be seen, the very
                    ruins of these edifices having perished. This once populous plain is now
                    occupied only by herds of timid gazelles, whilst hyenas and wolves abound in the
                    neighbouring hills. For an account of the history, arts, and commerce of Meroe,
