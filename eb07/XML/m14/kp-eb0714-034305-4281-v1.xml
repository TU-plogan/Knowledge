                <p><label type="entry">MEAD</label>, a liquor prepared with honey and water. One of
                    the best methods of preparing mead is as follows. Into twelve gallons of water
                    put the albumen of six eggs, mixing these well together, andto the mixture
                    adding twenty pounds of honey. Let the liquor boil an hour; and when boiled, add
                    cinnamon, ginger, cloves, mace, and rosemary. As soon as it is cold, put a
                    spoonful of yest to it, and tun it up, keeping the vessel filled as it works;
                    when it has done working, stop it up close; and, when fine, bottle it off for
                    use. Mead is a liquor of very ancient use in Britain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mead,</hi> Dr. <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard,</hi> a
                    celebrated English physician, was born at Stepney near London, where his father,
                    the Rev. Mr. Matthew Mead, had been one of the two ministers of that parish; but
                    in 1662 he was ejected for non-conformity, though he continued to preach at
                    Stepney till his death. As Mr. Mead had a handsome fortune, he bestowed a
                    liberal education upon thirteen children, of whom Richard was the eleventh; and
                    for that purpose kept a private tutor in his house, who taught him the Latin
                    tongue. At sixteen years of age Richard was sent to Utrecht, where he studied
                    three years under the celebrated Graevius; and then choosing the profession of
                    physic, he went to Leyden, where he attended the lectures of Pitcairn, on the
                    theory and practice of medicine, and Hermann’s botanical courses. Having also
                    spent three years in these studies, he went with his brother and two other
                    gentlemen to visit Italy, and at Padua took his degree of doctor of philosophy
                    and physic, in 1695. He afterwards spent some time at Rome and Naples; and then
                    returning home, settled at Stepney, where he married, and practised physic with
                    a success which laid the foundation of his future celebrity.</p>
                <p>In 1703, Dr. Mead having communicated to the RoyaI Society an analysis of Dr.
                    Bonomo’s discoveries relating to the cutaneous worms that generate the itch,
                    which they had inserted in the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical
                    Transactions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> this, with his account of poisons,
                    procured him a place in the Royal Society, of which Sir Isaac Newton was then
                    president. The same year he was elected physician of St. Thomas’s Hospital, and
                    was also employed by the surgeons toread anatomical lectures in their hall,
                    which obliged him to remove into the city. In 1707 his Paduan diploma for doctor
                    of physic was confirmed by the university of Oxford; and being patronized by Dr.
                    Radcliffe, on the death of that famous physician he succeeded him in his house
                    at Bloomsbury Square, and also in the greater part of his business. In 1727 he
                    was made physician to George II., whom he had served in that capacity whilst he
                    was Prince of Wales; and he had afterwards the pleasure of seeing his two
                    sons-in-law, Dr. Nichols and Dr. Wilmot, his coadjutors in the same eminent
                    station.</p>
                <p>Dr. Mead was not more admired for the qualities of the head than he was loved for
                    those of his heart. Though he was himself a hearty Whig, yet, uninfluenced by
                    party principles, he was a friend to all men of merit, by whatever denomination
                    they might happen to be distinguished. Thus he was intimate with Garth, with
                    Arbuthnot, and with Freind; and long kept up a constant correspondence with
                    Boerhaave, who had been his fellow student at Leyden. In the meantime, intent as
                    Dr. Mead was on the duties of his profession, he had an activity of mind that
                    extended itself <pb break="no" facs="nls:194204294?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0714-4294-0344"/> to all kinds of literature, which he spared
                    neither pains nor money to promote. He caused the beautiful and splendid edition
                    of Thuanus’s history to be published in 1713, in seven vols, folio; and by his
                    interposition and assiduity Mr. Sutton’s invention of drawing foul air from
                    ships and other close places was carried into execution, and all the ships in
                    his Majesty’s navy provided with this useful machine. Nothing pleased him more
                    than to call hidden talents into light; to give encouragement to the greatest
                    projects, and to see them executed under his own eye. During almost half a
                    century he was at the head of his business, which brought him one year about
                    seven thousand pounds, and for several years between five and six thousand; yet
                    clergymen, and in general all men of learning, were welcome to his advice. His
                    library consisted of 10,000 volumes, of which Latin, Greek, and Oriental
                    manuscripts formed no inconsiderable part. He had a gallery for his pictures and
                    antiquities, which cost him large sums. His reputation, not only as a physician,
                    but as a scholar, was so universally established, that he corresponded with all
                    the principal literati in Europe. Even the King of Naples sent to desire a
                    complete collection of his works; and in return made him a present of the two
                    first volumes of Signior Bajardi’s treatise, which may be considered as an
                    introduction to the collection of the antiquities of Herculanum. At the same
                    time that prince invited Dr. Mead to visit his palace, that he might have an
                    opportunity of shewing him those valuable monuments of antiquity; and nothing
                    but his great age prevented his undertaking a journey so suited to his taste. No
                    foreigner of learning ever came to London without being introduced to Dr. Mead;
                    and on these occasions his table was always open, and the magnificence of
                    princes was united with the pleasures of philosophers. It was principally to him
                    that the several counties of England and our colonies abroad applied for the
                    choice of their physicians, and he was likewise consulted by foreign physicians
                    from Russia, Prussia, Denmark, andother countries. Besides the above works, he
                    wrote, 1. A Treatise on the Scurvy; 2. De variolis et morbillis Dissertatio; 3.
                    Medica Sacra, sive de Morbis insignioribus, qui in Bibliis memorantur
                    Commentarius; 4. Monita et Praecepta Medica; 5. A Discourse concerning
                    Pestilential Contagion, and the methods to be used to prevent it. The works
                    which he wrote and published in Latin were translated into English, under his
                    own inspection, by Dr. Thomas Stack. This great physician, naturalist, and
                    antiquarian, died on the 16th of February 1754.</p>
