                    in this place by the Danes; and hither, in ancient times, barren women used to
                    come and worship at his shrine, in hopes of being cured of their sterility. It
                    was here that the French squadron, having the Chevalier de St. George on board,
                    anchored in the year 1708, when the vigilance of Sir George Byng obliged him to
                    relinquish his design, and bear away for Dunkirk. The shores all round the

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">May,</hi><hi rend="italic">Thomas,</hi> an eminent English
                    poet and historian of the seventeenth century, was descended of an ancient but
                    decayed family in Sussex, and received his education at Cambridge, whence he
                    afterwards removed to London. Whilsthe resided at court, he wrote the five plays
                    now extant under his name. In 1622, he published a translation of Virgil’s
                    Georgies, with annotations; and in 1635 a poem on Edward HL, and a translation
                    of Lucan’s Pharsalia, which he continued down to the death of Julius Caesar,
                    both in Latin and in English verse. Upon the breaking out of the civil wars he
                    adhered to the parliament, and in 1647, published the History of the Parliament
                    of England, which began November the third, 1640, with a short and accessory
                    view of some precedent years. In 1649, he published in three parts, <hi

                    rend="italic">Breviarium,</hi><hi rend="italic">which</hi> he afterwards
                    translated into English. He also wrote the history of Henry II. in English
                    verse. His death occurred in 1650. Having gone to rest after a cheerful bottle
                    as usual, he died in his sleep before morning. Soon after the Restoration, his
                    body, with those of several others, was dug up, and buried in a pit in St
                    Margaret’s churchyard; and his monument, which was erected by the appointment of
                    parliament, was taken down and thrown aside.</p>
