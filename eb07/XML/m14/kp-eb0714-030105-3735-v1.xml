                    particular part of the service, is supposed to allude to the particular

                <p>Nicod, after Baronius, observes that the word <hi rend="italic">missa</hi> comes

                    church when the deacons said <hi rend="italic">Ite, missa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >est,</hi> after sermon and reading of the epistle and gospel; they not being
                    allowed to assist at the consecration. Menage derives the word from <hi
                    rend="italic">missio,</hi> dismissing; and others from <hi rend="italic"
                    >missa,</hi> missing, sending, because in the mass the prayers of men on earth
                    are sent up to heaven.</p>
                <p>The general division of masses consists of high and low. The first is that which
                    is sung by the choristers, and celebrated with the assistance of a deacon and
                    sub-deacon; low masses are those in which the prayers are barely rehearsed
                    without singing.</p>
                <p>There are many different or occasional masses in the Latin church, some of which
                    have nothing peculiar but the name; such as the masses of the saints; that of St
                    Mary of the snow, celebrated on the fifth of August; that of St Margaret,
                    patroness of lying-in women; that of the feast of St John the Baptist, at which
                    are said three masses; that of the innocents, at which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gloria in</hi><hi rend="italic">excelsis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Alleluia</hi> are omitted, and, it being a day of mourning, the altar is of a
                    violet colour. As to ordinary masses, some are said for the dead. At these
                    masses the altar is put in mourning, and the only decorations are a cross in the
                    middle of six yellow wax-lights; the dress of the celebrant and the mass-book
                    are black; many parts of the office are omitted, and the people are dismissed
                    without the benediction. If the mass be said for a person distinguished by his
                    rank or virtues, it is followed with a funeral oration. They erect a <hi
                    rend="italic">chapelle ardente,</hi> that is, a representation of the deceased
                    with branches and tapers of yellow wax, either in the middle of the church or
                    near the tomb of the deceased, where the priest pronounces a solemn absolution
                    of the deceased. There are likewise private masses said for stolen or strayed
                    goods or cattle, for health, for travellers, &amp;c. which go under the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">votive masses.</hi> There is still a further distinction of
                    masses, which are denominated from the countries in which they were used. Thus
                    the Gothic mass, or <hi rend="italic">Missa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mosarabum,</hi> is that which was used amongst the Goths when they were masters
                    of Spain, and is still kept up at Toledo and Salamanca; the Ambrosian mass is
                    that composed by St Ambrose, and used only at Milan, of which city he was
                    bishop; the Gallic mass is that used by the ancient Gauls; and the Roman mass is
                    the one used by almost all the churches in the communion of the Roman Catholic
                    church.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Mass</hi><hi rend="italic">of the Presanctified</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(Missa</hi><hi rend="italic">Praesanctĳicatorum)</hi> is a mass
                    peculiar to the Greek church, in which there is no consecration of the elements;
                    but, after singing some hymns, they receive the bread and wine which was before
                    consecrated. This mass is performed during the whole of Lent, excepting on
                    Saturdays, Sundays, and the Annunciation. The priest counts upon his fingers the
                    days of the ensuing week on which it is to be celebrated; cuts off as many
                    pieces of bread at the altar as he is to say masses; and after having
                    consecrated them, steeps them in wine, and then puts them in a box, out of
                    which, upon every occasion, he takes a portion with a spoon, and putting it on a
                    dish, sets it upon the altar.</p>
