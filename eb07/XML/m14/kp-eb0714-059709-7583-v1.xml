                <p><label type="entry">MESSIER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label>, a
                    celebrated astronomer, born at Badonviller, in Lorraine, on the 26th of June
                    1730. He was the tenth of twelve children, and lost his father when he was
                    eleven years old. He came to Paris at twenty, and had then to seek his fortune,
                    having only learned to write a good hand, and to draw. Delisle employed him as a
                    copyist in the observatory. Libour, his secretary, taught him to make use of the
                    common instruments of astronomy, to observe eclipses, and to look out for
                    comets; and this was the principal business of his subsequent life, for he was
                    never much of a theoretical or philosophical astronomer. Delisle obtained for
                    him an appointment as clerk in the Hydrographical Department of the Navy, and
                    gave him his board and lodging in his own house; and he claimed in return the
                    singular gratification of keeping all Messier’s observations of comets secret
                    for his own private amusement, until their novelty was completely lost.</p>

                <p>Messier had already discovered twelve comets when he lost his wife; his
                    attendance on her sick-bed prevented his discovering a thirteenth; and it is
                    said that the circumstance added not a little to his grief for her loss. He
                    afterwards became Astronomer to the Navy, instead of being only a clerk in the
                    department. He obtained a seat in the Academy with some difficulty, and not till
                    1770, being considered as too mechanical an observer to have a very strong claim
                    to that distinction. He was fond of drawing charts of the paths of comets, and
                    of other astronomical phenomena. One of these procured him the honour of being
                    made an Academician of Berlin, and another, with Laharpe’s interest, obtained
                    him the same distinction from Petersburg. He was also made a Fellow of the Royal
                    Society of London, in 1764. The highest compliment that he ever received was
                    paid him, perhaps without sufficient reason, by Lalande, who inserted, in his
                    celestial globe of 1775, a constellation with the name of Messier, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Messium custos,</hi> The Harvest Man, in the neighbourhood of
                    Cepheus. When Herschel had discovered the Georgian planet, hc was very
                    diligently engaged in observing its motions; but, in the meantime, his studies
                    were interrupted by an unfortunate accident. He fell into an ice-house, in a
                    garden, which he mistook for a part of a grotto, and fractured an arm and a
                    thigh. He was long in recovering, and hc obtained a small pension on the
                    occasion, from the royal bounty, by the solicitations of Μ. Sage and some others
                    of his friends, who had interest; of this, however, he was soon after deprived
                    by the Revolution. Messier was in some measure compensated for his pecuniary
                    losses by being made a Member of the Institute, of the Bureau des Longitudes,
                    and of the Legion of Honour. He lived to be near eighty-seven, and died of a
                    dropsy, or probably rather of old age, on the 11th of April 1817∙ The following
                    is a list of his works :—</p>
                <p>1. A variety of his observations, especially of <hi rend="italic">Comets,</hi>
                    are published in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Savans</hi><hi rend="italic">etrangers,</hi> v. vi. 2. After his admission into
                    the Academy, he was a constant contributor to its <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi>
                    from 1771 to 1790. His papers consist almost entirely of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations of comets and eclipses,</hi> with some <hi rend="italic">Accounts
                    of Aurorae Boreales.</hi> There is also a <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of
                    Nebulae</hi> in 1771; <hi rend="italic">An Account of points of light seen on
                    Saturn's ring</hi> in 1774; and of <hi rend="italic">An apparent fall of
                    globules over the sun’s disc,</hi> 1777. 3. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cοn-ηaisance des Temps</hi> there is a collection of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Observations of the eclipses of Jupiter’s satellites.</hi> 4. He contributed
                    some articles to the <hi rend="italic">Astronomical Ephemerides,</hi> of
                    Professor Hell, published at Vienna. 5. The <hi rend="italic">Voyage de
                    Cour-tanvauz</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">la fregatte
                    l’</hi><hi rend="italic">Aurore,</hi> Paris, 1768, in 4to. was written by
                    Pingré; the observations are Messier’s. 6. His only separate publication, (the
                    genuineness of which, however, is doubted,) was entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Grande</hi><hi rend="italic">Comète qui a paru à la naissance de Napoléon le
                    Grand,</hi> Paris, 1808, in 4to. 7. Delambre was in possession of a number of
                    his <hi rend="italic">unpublished</hi> observations of the solar spots; but he
                    found their results when computed, somewhat unsatisfactory.</p>
