                <p><label type="entry">TITHES</label>, in ecclesiastical law, are defined to be the
                    tenth part of the increase yearly arising and renewing from the profits of
                    lands, the stock upon lands, and the personal industry of the inhabitants; the
                    first species being usually called <hi rend="italic">predial,</hi> as of corn,
                    grass, hops, and wood; the second <hi rend="italic">mixed,</hi> as of wool,
                    milk, pigs, &amp;c., consisting of natural products, but nurtured and preserved
                    in part by the care of man; and of these the tenth must be paid in gross; the
                    third <hi rend="italic">personal,</hi> as of manual occupations, trades,
                    fisheries, and the like; and of these only the tenth part of the clear gains and
                    profits is due. We cannot precisely ascertain the time when tithes were first
                    introduced into this country. Possibly they were contemporary with the planting
                    of Christianity among the Saxons by Augustin the monk, about the end of the
                    sixth century. But the first mention of them which we have met with in any
                    written English law, is in a constitutional decree, made in a synod held <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a.d</hi>. 786, by which the payment of tithes in general is
                    strongly enjoined. This canon or decree, which at first bound not the laity, was
                    effectually confirmed by two kingdoms of the heptarchy, in their convention of
                    estates, respectively consisting of the kings of Mercia and Northumberland, the
                    bishops, dukes, senators, and people. This was a few years later than the time
                    when Charlemagne established the payment of them in France, and made that famous
                    division of them into four parts; one to maintain the edifice of the church, the
                    second to support the poor, the third the bishop, and the fourth the parochial
                    clergy. The next authentic mention of them is in the <hi rend="italic">Foedus
                    Edwardi et Guthruni,</hi> or the laws agreed upon between King Guthrun the Dime,
                    and Alfred and his son Edward the Elder, successive kings of England, about the
                    year 900. This was a kind of treaty between those monarchs, which may be found
                    at large among the Anglo-Saxon laws. As Guthrun was a pagan, it was necessary to
                    provide for the subsistence of the Christian clergy under his dominion; and
                    accordingly we find the payment of tithes not only enjoined, but a penalty added
                    upon non-observance. This law was seconded by the laws of Athelstan, about the
                    year 930.</p>
