                <p><label type="entry">TRENT</label>, a city of the Austrian province of Tyrol. It
                    was formerly the capital of an independent ecclesiastical state. The extent was
                    small, but the bishop was a member of the German empire. In the year 1803 it was
                    secularized and united to the Austrian dominions, being incorporated with the
                    province of Tyrol. It afterwards shared the fate of the other Austrian
                    territories in that quarter, till the peace of 1814 placed it in the condition
                    in which it is now to be seen. The bishop is still called a prince, and has a
                    yearly income of about L.4000 sterling. The city lies in a deep valley
                    surrounded with lofty hills, whose sides are covered with vineyards, intermixed
                    with numerous and some elegant country seats and gardens. It stands on the banks
                    of the river Etsch or Adige, which is navigable to it, and over which is a fine
                    bridge 300 feet in length. The city is surrounded with walls, but is not deemed
                    capable of defence, from the heights that command the works. The streets are
                    narrow, gloomy, and not very clean. The palace of the bishop is an antique and
                    unsightly building, but adorned by fine gardens. The cathedral is highly
                    ornamented, and worth seeing; and in the church of Santa Maria is a remarkably
                    fine painting, in which are portraits of the most distinguished members of the
                    celebrated council held at this place. There is a collegiate establishment or
                    lyceum, in which are thirteen professors teaching philosophy and theology. Being
                    on the great road from Italy to Germany, it has much commerce, including some by
                    the river, and a few considerable silk manufactories. It contains 760 houses and
                    9850 inhabitants. From the great heat of summer, and the severe cold of winter,
                    it is not found to be a healthy place.</p>
