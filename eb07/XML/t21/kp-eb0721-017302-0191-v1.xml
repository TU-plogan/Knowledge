                <p><label type="entry">TEMPERAMENT</label>, among physicians, the same with
                    constitution, or a certain disposition of the solids and fluids of the human
                    body, by which it may be properly denominated strong, weak, lax, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In every person there are appearances of a temperament peculiar to himself,
                    though the ancients only took notice of four, and some have imagined these were
                    deduced from the theories of the four humours or four cardinal qualities; but it
                    is more probable that they were first founded on observation, and afterwards
                    adapted to those theories, since we find that they have a real existence, and
                    are capable of receiving an explanation. The two that are most distinctly marked
                    are the sanguineous and melancholic, viz. the temperaments of youth and age.</p>
                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Sanguineous.</hi> This is accompanied by laxity of solids,
                    discoverable by the softness of hair, and succulency; large system of arteries,
                    redundancy of fluids, florid complexion; sensibility of the nervous power,
                    especially to pleasing objects; irritability from the plethora; mobility and
                    levity from lax solids. These characters are distinctly marked, and are proved
                    by the diseases incident to this age, as haemorrhages, fevers, &amp;c.; but
                    these, as they proceed from a lax system, are more easily cured.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Melancholic Habit.</hi> Here greater rigidity of solids
                    occurs, discoverable by the hardness and crispature of the hair; small
                    proportion of the fluids, hence dryness and leanness; small arteries, hence pale
                    colour; venous plethora, hence turgescency of these, and lividity; sensibility',
                    frequently exquisite; moderate irritability, with remarkable tenacity of
                    impressions; steadiness in action and slowness of motion, with great strength;
                    for excess of this constitution in maniacs gives the most extraordinary instance
                    of human strength we know. This temperament is most distinctly marked in old age
                    and in males. The sanguineous temperament of youth prevents us from
                    distinguishing the melancholic till the decline of life, when it is very
                    evident, from diseases of the veins, haemorrhoids, apoplexy, cachexy,
                    obstructions of the viscera, particularly of the liver, dropsies, affections of
                    the alimentary canal, chiefly from weaker influence of the nervous power. So
                    much for the sanguineous and melancholic temperaments; the other two are not so
                    easily explained. The choleric temperament takes place between youth and
                    manhood. In the</p>
                <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Choleric,</hi> the distribution of the fluids is more
                    exactly balanced; there is less sensibility, and less obesity, with more
                    irritability, proceeding from greater tension, less mobility and levity, and
                    more steadiness in the strength of the nervous power.</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Phlegmatic.</hi> This temperament cannot be distinguished by
                    any characters of age or sex. It agrees with the sanguineous in laxity and
                    succulency. It differs from that temperament and the melancholic, by the more
                    exact distribution of the fluids. Again, it differs from the sanguineous, by
                    having less sensibility, irritability, mobility, and perhaps strength, though
                    sometimes indeed this last is found to be great.</p>
                <p>These are the ancient temperaments. The temperaments, indeed, are much more
                    various, and very far from being easily marked and reduced to their genera and
                    species, from the great variety which is observable in the constitutions of
                    different men.</p>
