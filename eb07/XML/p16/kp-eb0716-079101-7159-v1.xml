                <p><label type="entry">PANTHEON</label>, a beautiful edifice at Rome, anciently a
                    temple, dedicated to all the gods, but now converted into a church, and
                    dedicated to the Virgin and all the martyrs. (See <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rome.)</hi></p>
                <p>This edifice is generally thought to have been built by Agrippa, son-in-law to
                    Augustus, from an inscription on the frieze of the portico. Several antiquaries
                    and artists, however, have supposed that the Pantheon existed in the times of
                    the commonwealth, and that it was only embellished by Agrippa, who added the
                    portico. But be this as it may, the Pantheon, when perfected by Agrippa, was an
                    exceedingly magnificent building; the form of the body being round or
                    cylindrical, and its roof or dome spherical. Within, it is 144 feet in diameter;
                    and the height from the pavement to the grand aperture on the top, through which
                    it re ceives the light, is just as much. It is of the Corinthian order. The
                    inner circumference is divided into seven grand niches, wrought in the thickness
                    of the wall, six of which are flat at the top; but the seventh, opposite to the
                    entrance, is arched. Before each niche are two columns of antique yellow marble,
                    fluted, and of one entire block, making in all fourteen, the finest in Rome. The
                    whole wall <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the temple, as high as the grand cornice
                    inclusive, is cased with different sorts of precious marble in compartments; and
                    the frieze is entirely of porphyry. Above the grand cornice arises an attic, in
                    which were wrought, at equal distances, fourteen oblong square niches; between
                    each niche there were four marble pilasters, and between the pilasters marble
                    tables of various kinds. This attic had a complete entablature; but the cornice
                    projected less than that of the grand order below. Immediately from the cornice
                    springs the spherical roof, divided by bands which cross each other like the
                    meridians and parallels of an artificial terrestrial globe. The spaces between
                    the bands decrease in size as they approach the top of the roof; to which,
                    however, they do not reach, there being a considerable plain space between them
                    and the great opening. That so bold a roof might be as light as possible, the
                    architect formed the substance of the spaces between the bands of nothing but
                    lime and pumice-stones. The walls below were decorated with lead and brass, and
                    works of carved silver; and the roof was covered on the outside with plates of
                    gilded bronze. There was an ascent from the springing of the roof to the very
                    summit, by a flight of seven stairs; and, if certaina uthors may be credited,
                    these stairs were ornamented with pedestrian statues ranged as an amphitheatre.
                    This notion was founded on a passage of Pliny, who says that Diogenes the
                    sculptor decorated the Pantheon of Agrippa with elegant statues, yet that it was
                    difficult to judge of their merit, upon account of their elevated situation. The
                    portico is composed of sixteen columns of granite, four feet in diameter, eight
                    of which stand in front, with an equal intercolumniation all along, contrary to
                    the rule of Vitruvius, who is for having the space answering to the door of a
                    temple wider than the rest. On these columns there is a pediment, the tympanum
                    of which was ornamented with bas-reliefs in brass; and the cross beams which
                    formed the ceiling of the portico were covered with the same metal, as were also
                    the doors. The ascent up to the portico was by eight or nine steps.</p>
                <p>In the reign of Tiberius, the Pantheon was considerably damaged; but it was
                    repaired by Domitian, from which circumstance some writers consider him as the
                    founder of the building. The Emperor Hadrian also did something to the edifice.
                    But the Pantheon was more indebted to Septimius Severus, than to any one
                    besides. The most, perhaps, that any of his predecessors had done, was adding
                    some ornament to it; Septimius bestowed upon it essential reparations.</p>
                <p>This temple subsisted in all its grandeur till the incursion of Alaric in the
                    time of Honorius. Zozymus relates, that the Romans having engaged to furnish
                    this barbarian prince with three thousand pounds weight of gold and five
                    thousand pounds weight of silver, upon condition that he should depart from
                    their walls; and having found it impossible to raise those sums either out of
                    the public treasury or by private contribution, they were obliged to strip the
                    temples of their statues and ornaments of gold and silver. It is probable that
                    the Pantheon supplied a good part, as that of Jupiter Capitolinus was the only
                    one in Rome that could vie with it in riches. Alaric carried off nothing from
                    the Romans besides their precious metals. But, thirty-nine years thereafter,
                    Genseric king of the Vandals took away part of the marbles; and whether from
                    greed of plunder, or from a relish for the productions of art, he loaded <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:194567172?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7172-0792"/> one
                    of his ships with statues. It cannot be questioned that on this occasion the
                    Pantheon was stripped of more of its ornaments, and that the inestimable works
                    of Diogenes became the prey of this barbarian.</p>
                <p>Before these predatory visits of the Goths and Vandals, the Christian emperors
                    had issued edicts for demolishing the Pagan temples. But the Romans, whatever
                    were their motives, spared the Pantheon, which is known to have suffered no
                    damage from the zeal of the pontiffs, or the indignation of the saints, before
                    the first siege of Rome by Alarie. It continued so rich till about the year 655,
                    as to excite the avarice of Constantius II., who came from Constantinople to
                    pillage the Pantheon, and executed his purpose so far as to strip it both of its
                    interior and exterior coverings of bronze, which he transported to Syracuse,
                    where they soon afterwards fell into the hands of the Saracens.</p>
                <p>About fifty years before this, Boniface IV. had obtained the Pantheon of the
                    Emperor Phocas, in order to convert it[into a church. The artists of those days
                    were totally ignorant of the excellence of the Greek and Roman architecture, and
                    spoiled every thing they laid their hands upon. To this period are to be
                    referred certain alterations, of which we shall immediately have occasion to
                    speak.</p>
                <p>After the devastations of the barbarians, Rome was contracted within a narrow
                    compass. The seven hills were abandoned; and the Campus Martius, being an even
                    plain, and near the Tiber, became the ground-plat of the whole city. The
                    Pantheon happening to stand at the entrance of the Campus Martius, was presently
                    surrounded with houses, which spoiled the fine prospect; and it was still more
                    deplorably disgraced by some of them which stood close to its walls.</p>
                <p>From the time when Constantius carried off the brass plating of the exterior
                    roof, that part was exposed to the injuries of the weather, or at best was but
                    slightly tiled in, till Benedict II. covered it with lead, which Nicholas V.
                    renewed in a better style. It does not appear that from this time till that of
                    Urban VIII. any thing remarkable was done for the Pantheon.</p>
                <p>Raffaelle, who had no equal as a painter, and who was also an architect, left a
                    considerable sum by his will for the reparation of the Pantheon, where his tomb
                    is placed; and Perino de la Vagua, Jacomo Udino, Annibale Caracci, Flamingo
                    Vacca, and the celebrated Corelli, did the same. All the ornaments within which
                    have any claim to be called good, are of later times. The paintings merit
                    esteem; and the statues, although not masterpieces, do honour to sculpture,
                    which alone is a proof that they are posterior to the fifteenth century.</p>
                <p>But, with all the respect due to a pontiff who was otherwise a protector and
                    friend of the arts, it were much to be wished that Urban VIII. had never known
                    that the Pantheon existed. The inscriptions cut at the side of the door inform
                    us that he repaired it; yet, whilst he built up with one hand, he pulled down
                    with the other. He caused two belfries constructed in a wretched taste to be
                    erected on the ancient front-work, and he divested the portico of all the
                    remains of its ancient grandeur, namely, the brazen covering of the cross beams,
                    which amounted to such a prodigious quantity, that not only the vast canopy of
                    the confessional of St Peter’s was cast out of it, but likewise a great number
                    of cannon for the castle of St Angelo.</p>
                <p>Alexander VII. did what Urban VIII. had neglected to do. Whilst Bernini was
                    constructing the colonnade of St Peter, this pontiff ordered search to be made
                    for pillars to match those of the portico of the Pantheon; and some were found
                    not far from the French church of St Louis, which were of the very same model.
                    They were granite of the isle of Ilva or Elba, and those of the portico were
                    Egyptian granite; the colour, however, was the same, so that the effect was
                    equal. Nor did the pontiff’s zeal stop here. He caused all the old houses before
                    the portico to be pulled down, and the soil and rubbish which covered the steps,
                    and even the bases of some of the pillars, to be cleared away. He began covering
                    the roof with marble, and raised a lantern ;over the aperture, to keep out rain;
                    but death removed him before his project was completed. Clement IX. his
                    successor, enclosed the portico within iron rails. Several Jater popes have
                    added to its decorations, which were all in the taste of the times when they
                    were executed; and the body of the edifice and its architecture gained nothing
                    by them. The main object of the liberality of the pontiffs was the embellishment
                    of the grand altar. One sent purple curtains, another bestowed silver
                    tabernacles, and others gave vases and superb dresses, suited to the solemn
                    ceremonies of religion. All these might be called rich; but they had in no sense
                    a tendency to retrieve the ancient majesty or original splendour of the temple.
                    The true gusto of the ornaments was a little imitated at the revival of the
                    arts. Good statues replaced the skeletons and squat figures which had disgraced
                    the altars for the space of eight centuries. The paintings of Perugino and
                    others covered the dull mosaics with which the Greeks of Constantinople had
                    loaded the walls of most of the churches in Rome. The porphyry and the green and
                    yellow antique found amongst the old ruins were likewise employed to much
                    advantage.</p>
