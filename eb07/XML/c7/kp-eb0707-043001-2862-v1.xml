                <p><label type="entry">COUNSEL</label>, in a general sense, signifies advice or
                    instruction how to act in any difficult matter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Counsel,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Advocates,</hi> in
                    English courts of law, are of two kinds.or degrees, namely, barristers and
                    serjeants.</p>
                <p>From both some are usually selected to be his majesty’s counsel, learned in the
                    law; the two principal of whom are called his <hi rend="italic"
                    >attorney-general</hi> and <hi rend="italic">solicitor-general.</hi> The first
                    king’s counsel, under the degree of serjeant, was Sir Francis Bacon, who was
                    made so <hi rend="italic">honoris causa,</hi> without either patent or fee; and
                    the first of the modern order, who are now the sworn servants of the crown, with
                    a fixed salary, seems to have been Sir Francis North, afterwards lord keeper of
                    the great seal to Charles II. These king’s counsel answer in some measure to the
                    advocates of the revenue, <hi rend="italic">advocati fisci,</hi> among the
                    Romans; for they must not be employed in any case against the crown without
                    special license, in which restriction they agree with the advocates of the fisc.
                    But in the imperial law the prohibition was carried still farther; for,
                    excepting some peculiar causes, the fiscal advocates were not permitted to be at
                    all concerned in private suits between subject and subject. A custom has
                    latterly prevailed, of granting letters patent of precedence to such barristers
                    as the crown thinks proper to honour with this mark of distinction, by which
                    they are entitled to such rank and pre-audience as are assigned in their
                    respective patents, sometimes next after the king’s attorney-general, but
                    usually next after bis majesty’s counsel. These, as well as the queen’s attorney
                    and solicitor-general, rank promiscuously with the king’s counsel, and, together
                    with them, sit within the bars of their respective courts; but they receive no
                    salaries, and are not sworn, and therefore are at liberty to be retained in
                    causes against the crown. And all other serjeants and barristers
                    indiscriminately, except in the court of common pleas, where only scr-jeants are
                    admitted, may take upon them the protection and defence of any suitors, whether
                    plaintiffs or defendants, who are therefore called their <hi rend="italic"
                    >clients,</hi> like the de pendents of the ancient Roman pleaders. The latter
                    indeed practised gratis, for honour mcrcly, or at most for the sake of gaining
                    influence; and so likewise it is established with us, that a counsel can
                    maintain no action for his fees, which are given, not as <hi rend="italic"
                    >locatio conductio,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">quiddam</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >honorarium,</hi> not as a salary or hire, but as a mere gratuity, which a
                    counsellor cannot demand without doing wrong to his reputation. The same is also
                    laid down with regard to advocates in the civil law, whose <hi rend="italic"
                    >honorarium</hi> was directed by a decree of the senate not to exceed in any
                    case ten thousand sesterces, or about L.80 sterling money. And in order to
                    encourage due freedom of speech in the lawful defence of their clients, and at
                    the same time to check the unseemly licentiousness of prostituted and illiberal
                    men, a few of whom may sometimes insinuate themselves even into the most
                    honourable professions, it has been held that a counsel is not answerable for
                    any matter spoken by him, relative to the cause in hand, and suggested in the
                    client’s instructions, although it should reflect upon the reputation of
                    another, and even prove ab solutely groundless; but if he mention an untruth of
                    his own invention, or even upon instructions, if it be impertinent to the cause
                    in hand, he is then liable to an action at the suit.of the party injured.</p>
