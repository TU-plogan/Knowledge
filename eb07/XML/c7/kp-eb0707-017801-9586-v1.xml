                <p><label type="entry">COMMONALTY</label>, the lower of the two divisions of the
                    civil state. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Civil State.</hi></p>
                <p>The commonalty, like the nobility, are divided into several degrees; and as the
                    lords, though different in rank, are all of them peers in respect of their
                    nobility, so the commoners, though some are greatly superior to others, are all
                    in law commonalty, in respect of their want of nobility.</p>
                <p>1. The first name of dignity next beneath a peer was anciently that of <hi
                    rend="italic">vidâmes,</hi><hi rend="italic">vice-domini,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">valvasors,</hi> who are mentioned by our ancient lawyers as <hi
                    rend="italic">viri magnae dignitatis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Sir Edward
                    Coke speaks highly of them. Yet they are now quite obsolete; and our legal
                    antiquaries are not agreed upon even their original or ancient office.</p>
                <p>2. Now, therefore, the first personal dignity after that of nobility is a knight
                    of the order of St George, or of the Garter, first instituted by Edw. III. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 1344.</p>
                <p>3. Next, but after certain official dignities, as privycouncillors, the
                    chancellors of the exchequer and duchy of Lancaster, the chief justice of the
                    king’s bench, the master of the rolls, and the other English judges, follows a
                    <hi rend="italic">knight banneret,</hi> who, indeed, by statutes 5 Richard II.
                    stat. 2, c. 4, and 14 Richard II. c. 11, is ranked immediately after barons; and
                    his precedence before the younger sons of viscounts was confirmed to him by
                    order of King James I. in the tenth year of that king’s reign. But in order to
                    entitle him to this rank, he must have been created by the king in person, in
                    the field, under the royal banners, in time of open war; otherwise he ranks
                    after,</p>
                <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Baronets,</hi> who are next in order. This is a dignity of
                    inheritance, created by letters patent, and usually descendible to the
                    issue-male. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Baronet.</hi></p>
                <p>5. Next follow <hi rend="italic">knights of the Bath,</hi> which see.</p>
                <p>6. The last of these inferior nobility are <hi rend="italic">knights
                    bachelors,</hi> the most ancient, though the lowest, order of knighthood amongst
                    us. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Bachelor.</hi></p>
                <p>7. The above, with those enumerated under the article <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Nobility,</hi> Sir Edward Coke says, are all the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >dignity</hi> in this kingdom; <hi rend="italic">esquires</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">gentlemen</hi> being only names of <hi rend="italic">worship.</hi>
                    But before these last the heralds rank all colonels, sergeants at law, and
                    doctors in the three learned professions.</p>
                <p>8. <hi rend="italic">Esquires</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gentlemen</hi> arc
                    confounded together by Sir Edward Coke, who observes, that every esquire is a
                    gentleman, and a gentleman is defined to be one <hi rend="italic">qui
                    arma</hi><hi rend="italic">gerit,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> who bears
                    coat-armour,” the grant of which adds gentility to a man’s family; in like
                    manner as civil nobility among the Romans was founded in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Jus</hi><hi rend="italic">imaginum,</hi> or having the figure or statue of one
                    ancestor at least who had borne some curule office. It is indeed a matter some-
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:194749599?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0707-9599-0179"
                    /><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> what unsettled what constitutes the
                    distinction, or who is a real esquire; for it is not an estate, however large,
                    that confers this rank upon its owner. Cambden, who was-himself a herald,
                    reckons up four sorts of esquires: lsŕ, the eldest sons of knights, and their
                    eldest sons in perpetual succession; 2JZy, the eldest sons of younger sons of
                    peers, and their eldest sons, in like perpetual succession, both of which
                    species of esquires Sir Henry Spelman entitles <hi rend="italic"
                    >armigeri</hi><hi rend="italic">natalitii</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">⅛dly,</hi> esquires created by the king’s letters patent, or
                    rather investiture, and their eldest sons; <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi>
                    esquires by virtue of their office, as justices of the peace and others who bear
                    any office of trust under the crown. To these may be added the esquires of the
                    knights of the bath, each of whom constitutes three at his installation, and all
                    foreign, nay, Irish peers; for not only these, but the eldest sons of peers of
                    Great Britain, though frequently titular lords, are only esquires in the law,
                    and must be so named in all legal proceedings.</p>
                <p>9. As for <hi rend="italic">gentlemen,</hi> says Sir Thomas Smith, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ti</hi> they be made good cheap in this kingdom; for
                    whosoever studieth the laws of the realm, who studieth in the universities, who
                    professeth liberal sciences, and, to be short, who can live idly and without
                    manual labour, and will bear the part, charge, and countenance of a gentleman,
                    he shall be called master, and shall be taken for a gentleman.”</p>
                <p>10. A <hi rend="italic">yeoman</hi> is he who has free land of forty shillings in
                    the year, and who is thereby qualified to serve on juries, vote for knights of
                    the shire, and do any other act where the law requires one that is <hi
                    rend="italic">probus et legalis</hi><hi rend="italic">homo.</hi></p>
                <p>11. The rest of the commonalty are <hi rend="italic">tradesmen, artificers,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">labourers,</hi> who, as well as all others, must, in
                    pursuance of the statute 1 Henry V. c. 5, be styled by the name and addition of
                    their estate, degree, or mystery, in all actions and other legal
                    proceedings.</p>
