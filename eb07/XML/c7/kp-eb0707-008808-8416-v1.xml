                <p><label type="entry">COLMAN, <hi rend="smallcaps">George</hi></label>, a
                    miscellaneous and theatrical writer, was born at Florence about the year 1733.
                    He was the son of Mr Colman, at that time British resident at the court of the
                    Duke of Tuscany, and of a sister of the Countess of Bath. He received the early
                    part of his education at Westminster School, where Lloyd, Churchill, and some
                    others, who afterwards became distinguished literary characters, were among his
                    intimate companions. While at school he appeared in the character of a poet,
                    having addressed a copy of verses to his cousin Lord Pulteney, which were
                    afterwards published in the magazine of St James. He was next sent to Christ
                    Church College, Oxford, where he gave many proofs of his lively genius, uniting
                    with Thornton in producing a weekly periodical paper entitled the <hi
                    rend="italic">Connoisseur,</hi> which was continued from January 1754 to
                    September 1756, and after wards published in 4 vols. 12mo. Although this work
                    met not with an equal share of approbation with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >World,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Adventurer,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Hambier,</hi> whieh made their appearance much about the same time, yet it may
                    with justice be affirmed, that some papers of it are superior to any which these
                    performances contain, for a ludicrous delineation of the current manners, which
                    has always been considered as an essential department of every periodical work.
                    When Mr Colman took the degree of A. Μ. he left the college and resided in
                    London. He entered at .Lincoln's Inn, and in proper time was admitted to the
                    bar; but literary pursuits were much more consonant to the bent of his genius.
                    He published in 1760 a dramatic piece of great humour, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Polly Honeycomb,</hi> which was successfully acted in Drury Lane; and the
                    following year he gave the world his comedy of the <hi rend="italic">Jealous
                    Wife,</hi> deemed the best which had for many years appeared. By the demise of
                    Lord Bath he came into the possession of a handsome fortune, and it was further
                    augmented by the death of General Pulteney in 1767. He still continued to write
                    for the stage, and produced, along with Garrick, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Clandestine Marriage.</hi> He also translated the comedies of Terence into a
                    kind of blank verse, which gained him considerable applause.</p>
                <p>Soon after this he made a purchase of Haymarket theatre from Mr Samuel Foote,
                    which he supplied with pieces either original or translations, and selected the
                    ablest actors, particularly in comedy. To a translation he made of Horace’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Art of Poetry,</hi> he prefixed an ingenious account of the
                    intention of its author; and added importance to the whole work by many critical
                    notes. The <hi rend="italic">Genius,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gentlemen,</hi> were other two of his performances, as also a number of small
                    pieces of the humorous kind. His understanding was much impaired by a stroke of
                    the palsy, which seized him in the year 1789, in consequence of which melancholy
                    event his son was intrusted with the management of the theatre. He died in the
                    month of August 1794, in the 62d year of his age.</p>
