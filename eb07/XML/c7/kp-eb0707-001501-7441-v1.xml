                <p><label type="entry">COCKBURNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Mrs Catharine</hi></label>, a
                    most accomplished lady and celebrated writer, was the daughter of Captain David
                    Trotter, a native of Scotland, and a naval commander in the reign of King
                    Charles II. She was born in London on the 16th of August 1679, and baptized in
                    the Protestant church, according to which she was bred up. She gave early marks
                    of her genius; and learned to write, and also made herself mistress of the
                    French language, by her own application and diligence, without any instructor;
                    but she had some assistance in the study of the Latin grammar and logic, of
                    which latter she drew up an abstract for her own use. The most serious and
                    important subjects, and especially religion, soon engaged her attention. But
                    notwithstanding her education, her intimacy with several families of distinction
                    of the Roman Catholic persuasion exposed her, while very young, to impressions
                    in favour of that church, which, not being removed by her conferences with some
                    eminent and learned members of the church of England, she embraced the Roman
                    Catholic communion, in which she continued till the year 1707. In 1695 she
                    produced a tragedy called <hi rend="italic">Aynes de Castro,</hi> which was
                    acted at the theatre-royal when she was only in her seventeenth year. The
                    reputation of this performance, and the verses which she addressed to Mr
                    Congreve upon his Mourning Bride in 1697, were probably the foundation of her
                    acquaintance with that celebrated writer. Her second tragedy, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fatal Friendship,</hi> was acted in 1698, at the new theatre in Lincoln’s-Inn
                    Fields. This tragedy met with great applause, and is still thought the most
                    perfect of her dramatic performances. Her dramatic talents not being confined to
                    tragedy, she brought upon the stage, in 1707, a comedy called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Love at a Loss,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Most Votes carry it.</hi> In the same
                    year she gave the public her third tragedy, entitled the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unhappy Penitent,</hi> acted at the theatreroyal in Drury Lane. But poetry and
                    dramatic writing did not so far engross the thoughts of our author as to prevent
                    her from sometimes turning them to subjects of a very different nature, and she
                    distinguished herself in an extraordinary manner in defence of Mr Locke’s
                    writings, a female metaphysician being a remarkable phenomenon in the republic
                    of letters.</p>
                <p>She returned to the exercise of her dramatic genius in 1703, and fixed upon the
                    revolution of Sweden, under Gustavus Ericson, for the subject of a tragedy. This
                    tragedy was acted in 1706, at the queen’s theatre in the Haymarket. In 1707 her
                    doubts concerning the Roman Catholic religion, which she had so many years
                    professed, having led her to a thorough examination of the grounds of it, by
                    consulting the best books on both sides of the question, and-advising with men
                    of the best judgment, the result was a conviction of the falseness of the
                    pretensions of that church, and a return to that of England, to which she
                    adhered during the remainder of her life. In 1708 she was married to the
                    Reverend Mr Cockburne, then curate of St Dunstan’s, in Fleet Street, but who
                    afterwards obtained the living of Long Horsely, near Morpeth, in Northumberland.
                    He was a man of considerable abilities; and, among several things, wrote an
                    account of the Mosaic Deluge, which met with some approbation from the
                    learned.</p>

                <p>Mrs Cockburne’s remarks upon some writers in the controversy concerning the
                    foundation of moral duty and moral obligation were introduced to the world in
                    August 1712, in the Literary Journal, entitled <hi rend="italic">The. History of
                    the Works of the Learned.</hi> The strength, clearness, and vivacity shown in
                    her remarks upon the most abstract and perplexed questions immediately raised
                    the curiosity of all good judges about the concealed writer; and their
                    admiration was greatly increased when her sex and advanced age were known. Dr
                    Rutherford’s <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Nature and Obligations of
                    Virtue,</hi> published in May 1744, soon engaged her thoughts; and
                    notwithstanding the asthmatic disorder which had seized her many years before,
                    and now left her small intervals of ease, she applied herself to the confutation
                    of that elaborate discourse, and finished it with a spirit, elegance, and
                    perspicuity, equal, if not superior, to the best of her former writings.</p>
                <p>The loss of her husband in 1748, in the seventy-first year of his age, was a
                    severe shock to her; and she did not long survive him, having died on the 11th
                    of May 1749, in the seventy-first year of her age, after long supporting a
                    painful disorder with that resignation to the Divine will which had been the
                    governing principle of her life. Her works are collected into two large volumes
                    8vo, by Dr Birch, who has prefixed to them an account of her life and
                    writings.</p>
