                <p><label type="entry">COOCH BAHAR</label>, a district of Hindustan, in the province
                    of Bengal, situated between the twenty-sixth and twenty-seventh degrees of north
                    latitude. It comprehends an area of 1300 square miles, and is bounded on the
                    north by Bootan, on the south-west by Rungpoor, and on the east by Bootan and
                    Rangamatty. This country towards the south is in a highly improved state, and
                    very fertile. The betel nut, the semmel, and the banyan tree, thrive well, and
                    attain to great luxuriance. In approaching the north towards the Bootan
                    Mountains, the appearance of the country is most miserable; and the inhabitants
                    are as stunted as the vegetable productions, being in general a poor-looking,
                    puny race. They are thinly scattered over the country, which is not well
                    cultivated, and extremely unhealthy, the land being low and marshy, interspersed
                    with deep woods, and everywhere almost choked with a coarse vegetation of rank
                    grass, reeds, and fern. The inhabitants are in such a state of poverty that they
                    are in the practice of selling their children for slaves; and mothers are
                    frequently seen dressing up their children in order to enhance their priee.</p>
                <p>It was about the year 1018 that the sultan Mahmood penetrated into the country of
                    which Cooch Bahar formed a part. It was also frequently plundered by the Afghan
                    governors of Bengal, but it always recovered its independence. In the year 1578
                    a Mogul army overran the country, and laid the rajah under contributions. About
                    seventeen years afterwards, the prince voluntarily became a vassalof the Emperor
                    Acbar. The district was notwithstanding overrun by the Mogul troops in 1638.
                    During the reign of Aurungzebe, the rajah of Cooeh Bahar not only threw off his
                    allegiance, but actually wrested from the imperial yoke several districts. This
                    insult was speedily avenged by the emperor, who sent his lieutenant, Meer Jumla,
                    in 1661, into the country, who took the capital, and changed its name to
                    Alumgeernagur; and at the same time the bigotry of the Mussulmans was so intense
                    that they destroyed the Hindu temples, broke in pieces a celebrated image of
                    Vishnu, and converted the son of the rajah. Striet justice, however, was
                    administered under his government, and all plunderers and offenders were
                    severely punished. From Cooch Bahar he proceeded to Assam, the conquest of which
                    he attempted, but failed to accomplish it. In 1738 Cooch Bahar was invaded by
                    Sayid Ahmed, military governor of Rungpore, and plundered. The rajah was
                    compelled to take refuge in the mountains; and another portion of the country
                    was annexed to Bengal. In 1765 this district devolved to the East India Company;
                    and in 1772 it was invaded by the rajah of Bootan, who laid claim to it, and,
                    meeting-with little resistance from the natives, rapidly gained possession of
                    the country. Two battalions of native infantry were sent to the aid of the
                    inhabitants; and the invaders were not only driven back, but the rajah, alarmed
                    for his own safety by the advanee of the Company’s troops, was soon compelled to
                    sue for peace.</p>
