                <p><label type="entry">COURT</label>, an appendage to a house or habitation,
                    consisting of a piece of ground inclosed with walls, but open above.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Court</hi> is also used for the palace or place where a king
                    or sovereign prince resides.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Court,</hi> in a legal sense, is defined a place in which
                    justice is judicially administered. And as by our constitution the sole
                    executive powćr of the laws is vested in the person of the king, it follows that
                    all courts of justice, which are the medium by which he administers the laws,
                    are derived from the power of the crown. For whether created by act of
                    parliament or by letters patent, or subsisting by prescription (the only methods
                    by which any court of judicature can exist), the king’s consent in the two
                    former is expressly, and in the latter impliedly given. In all these courts the
                    king is supposed, in contemplation of law, to be always present; but as that is
                    in fact impossible, he is there represented by his judges, whose power is only
                    an emanation of the royal prerogative.</p>
                <p>For the more speedy, universal, and impartial administration of justice between
                    subject and subject, the law has appointed a variety of courts, some with a more
                    limited, others with a more extensive jurisdiction; some constituted to inquire
                    only, others to hear and determine; some to determine in the first instance,
                    others upon appeal and by way of review.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Court</hi><hi rend="italic">of Arches ( Curia de</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arcubus),</hi> the chief and most ancient consistory court
                    belonging to the archiépiscopal see of Canterbury, for the debating of spiritual
                    causes. It is so called from the church of St Mary le Bow <hi rend="italic"
                    >(de</hi><hi rend="italic">arcubus),</hi> where it was formerly held. The judge
                    of this court, styled the Dean of the Arches, or the Official of the Arches
                    Court, has jurisdiction in all ecclesiastical causes except such as belong to
                    the prerogative court; and all manner of appeals from bishops or their
                    chancellors or commissaries, deans and chapters, archdeacons, and others, are
                    directed thereto. The dean of the arches has also a peculiar jurisdiction over
                    thirteen parishes in London, called a deanery, which <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi> are exempt from the authority of the Bishop of London, * and of which the
                    parish of Bow (c∕e <hi rend="italic">arcubus)</hi> is the principal. The persons

                    he might exercise either in his own person or by his bailie. But this
                    jurisdiction was, by the heritable jurisdiction act, 20 Geo. II. c. 43, reduced
                    to the right of recovering from his vassals and tenants the feu-duties and rents
                    of the land, and compelling them to perform the services which they maybe bound
                    to render, and to the right of deciding in civil questions where the debt or
                    damage does not exceed forty shillings, beyond which his civil jurisdiction
                    cannot be prorogated. The criminal jurisdiction is, by the same statute, limited
                    to assaults, batteries, and smaller offences, which may be punished by a fine
                    not exceeding twenty shillings, recoverable by poinding, or, in default of
                    goods, commutable into one month’s imprisonment at the utmost. But this
                    jurisdiction has been subjected to so many regulations and restrictions, that it
                    is seldom or never exercised by the baron.</p>
