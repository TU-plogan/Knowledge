                <p><label type="entry">CYRENAICA</label>, an ancient kingdom of Africa,
                    corresponding to the present kingdom and desert of Barca and Tripoli. It was
                    originally inhabited by a number of barbarous nations, differing little from
                    great gangs of robbers. Afterwards some colonies from Greece settled there, and
                    Cyrenaica became so powerful a state that it waged war with Egypt and Carthage,
                    often with success. In the time of Darius Hystaspes, Arcesilaus, the reigning
                    prince in Cyrenaica, was driven from the throne, upon which his mother Pheretima
                    applied for assistance to the king of Cyprus. Her son afterwards returning to
                    Barca, the chief city of Cyrene, was there assassinated, together with his
                    father-in-law. Pheretima finding herself disappointed by the king of Cyprus,
                    applied to Darius Hystaspes, and by the assistance of the Persians reduced
                    Barca. Here she behaved with the utmost cruelty, causing all those who had been
                    concerned in her son’s death to be impaled, and the breasts of their wives to be
                    cut off and affixed near them. She is said to have been afterwards devoured by
                    worms, which was looked upon as a divine judgment for her excessive cruelty. The
                    prisoners in the mean time were sent to Darius, who settled them in a district
                    of Bactria, from them called <hi rend="italic">Barca.</hi> Cyrenaica, however,
                    seems to have remained free till the time of Alexander the Great, who conquered
                    it along with Egypt. Soon after his death the inhabitants recovered their
                    liberty, but were in a short time reduced by Ptolemy, king of Egypt. Under these
                    kings it remained till Ptolemy Physcon made it over to his bastard son Apian,
                    who in the 658th year of Rome left it by will to the Romans. The senate
