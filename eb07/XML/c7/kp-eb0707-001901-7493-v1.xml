                <p><label type="entry">COFFIN</label>, the chest in which dead bodies are
                    interred.</p>
                <p>The sepulchral honours paid to the manes of departed friends in ancient times
                    demand attention, and are extremely curious. Their being put into a coffin was
                    considered as a mark of the highest distinction. With us, however, the poorest
                    people are provided with coffins; for, if the relations cannot afford them, the
                    parish is at the expense. On the contrary, in the East, coffins are not made use
                    of; Turks and Christians, as Thevenot assures us, agreeing in this. The ancient
                    Jews seem to have buried their dead in the same manner; neither was the body of
                    our Lord, it should seem, put into a coffin; nor that of Elisha (2d Kings, xiii.
                    21), whose bones were touched by the corpse that was let down a little after
                    into his sepulchre. However, all agree that coffins were anciently made use of
                    in Egypt; and antique coffins of stone and sycamore wood are still to be seen in
                    that country, not to mention those said to have been made of a kind of
                    pasteboard, formed by folding or gluing together many folds of cloth curiously
                    plastered, and then painted with hieroglyphics. The sacred historian expressly
                    observes of Joseph, that he was not only embalmed, but put into a coffin too,
                    both of which were in use among the Egyptians.</p>
                <p>Bishop Patrick, in his commentary on the passage just referred to, takes notice
                    of these Egyptian coffins of sycamore wood and of pasteboard; but he does not
                    mention the contrary usage in the neighbouring countries, which was requisite in
                    order fully to illustrate the text; though even this, perhaps, would not have
                    conveyed the whole idea of the sacred author. Maillet apprehends that all were
                    not inclosed in coffins who were laid in the Egyptian repositories of the dead,
                    but that it was an honour appropriated to persons of consideration; for after
                    having given an account of several niches found in those chambers of death, he
                    adds, “But it must not be imagined that the bodies deposited in these gloomy
                    apartments were <hi rend="italic">all</hi> inclosed in <hi rend="italic"
                    >chests</hi> and placed in niches. The greatest part were simply embalmed and
                    swathed after that manner which every one hath some notion of; after which they
                    laid them one by the side of another without any ceremony. Some were even laid
                    in these tombs without any embalming at all, or such a slight one that there
                    remains nothing of them in the linen in which they were wrapped but the bones,
                    and these half rotten. It is probable that each considerable family had one of
                    these burial places to themselves; that the niches were designed for the bodies
                    of the heads of the families; and that those of their domestics or slaves had no
                    other care taken of them than the laying them on the ground, after having them
                    embalmed, or even without that, which undoubtedly was also all that was done
                    even to the heads of families of less distinction.” After this he gives an
                    account of a mode of burial practised anciently in that country, which consisted
                    in placing the bodies, after they had been swathed, upon a layer of charcoal,
                    and covering them with a mat, under a depth of sand of seven or eight feet.</p>
                <p>That <hi rend="italic">coffins</hi> then were not universally used in Egypt, is
                    evident from these accounts; and probably none but persons of distinction were
                    buried in them. It is also reasonable to believe, that in times so remote as
                    those of Joseph they might be much less common than afterwards; and
                    consequently, that Joseph’s being put in a coffin in Egypt might be mentioned
                    with a design to express the great honours which the Egyptians showed him at his
                    death, being interred after the most sumptuous manner in use among that people.
                    Agreeably to this, the Septuagint version, which was made for Egyptians, seems
                    to represent coffins as a mark of distinction.</p>
                <p>It is no objection to this account, that the widow of Nain’s son is represented
                    as carried forth to be buried in a ďogo¢, or bier; for the inhabitants of the
                    Levant, who are well known to lay their dead bodies in the earth uninclosed,
                    frequently carry them out to burial in a kind of coffin. Hence Dr Russell
                    describes the bier used for the Turks at Aleppo as a kind of coffin much in the
                    form of ours, only that the lid rises with a ledge in the middle. Christians,
                    indeed, as he tells us, are carried to the grave on an open bier; but as the
                    most common kind of bier resembles our coffins, that used by the people of Nain
                    might possibly be of the same kind; in which case the word <hi rend="italic"
                    >¢ogos</hi> was very proper.</p>
