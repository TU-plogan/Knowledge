                <p><label type="entry">SCIOPPIUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Gaspar</hi></label>, a
                    learned German writer of the seventeenth century, was born at Neumark, in the
                    Upper Palatinate, on the 27th of May 1576. He studied at the university with so
                    much success, that at the age of sixteen he became an author, and published
                    books, says Ferrari, which deserve to be admired by old men. But his
                    dispositions did not correspond with his genius. Naturally passionate and
                    malevolent, he assaulted without mercy the characters of eminent men. He abjured
                    the system of the Protestants, and became a Roman Catholic, about the year 1599;
                    but his character remained the same. He possessed all those qualities which
                    fitted him for making a distinguished figure in the literary world; imagination,
                    memory, profound learning, and invincible impudence. He was familiar with the
                    terms of reproach in most languages. He was entirely ignorant of the manners of
                    the world. He neither showed respect to his superiors, nor did he behave with
                    decency to his equals. He was possessed with a frenzy of an uncommon kind, being
                    a perfect firebrand, scattering around him, as if for his amusement, the most
                    atrocious calumnies. Joseph Scaliger, above all others, was the object of his
                    satire. That learned man having drawn up the history of his own family, and
                    deduced its genealogy from princes, was severely attacked by Scioppius, who
                    ridiculed his high pretensions. Scaliger in his turn wrote a book entitled the
                    Life and Parentage of Gaspar Scioppius, in which he informs us that the father
                    of Scioppius had been successively a grave-digger, a journeyman stationer, a
                    hawker, a soldier, a miller, and a brewer of beer. These statements inflamed
                    Scioppius with greater eagerness to attack his antagonist. He collected all the
                    calumnies that had been thrown out against Scaliger, and formed them into a huge
                    volume, as if he had intended to crush him at once. He treated with great
                    contempt the king of England, James I., in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiasticus,</hi> and in his <hi rend="italic">Collyrium Regium Britannia
                    Regi graviter ex oculis laboranti munere missum,</hi> that is, An Eye-salve for
                    his Britannic Majesty. In one of his works he had the audacity to abuse Henry
                    IV. of France in a most scurrilous manner, on which account his book was burned
                    at Paris. He was hung in effigy in a farce which was represented before the king
                    of England, but he gloried in his dishonour. Provoked with his insolence to
                    their sovereign, the servants of the English ambassador assaulted him at Madrid,
                    and corrected him severely; but he boasted of the wounds he had received. He
                    published more than thirty defamatory libels against the Jesuits; and, what is
                    very surprising, in the place where he declaims with most virulence against that
                    society, he subscribes his own name with expressions of devotion: “I Gaspar
                    Scioppius, already on the brink of the grave, and ready to appear before the
                    tribunal of Jesus Christ, to give an account of my works.” Towards the end of
                    his life he employed himself in studying the Apocalypse, and affirmed that he
                    had found the key to that mysterious book. He sent some of his expositions to
                    Cardinal Mazarin; but the cardinal did not find it convenient to read them.</p>
                <p>Ferrari tells us, that during the last fourteen years of his life he shut himself
                    up in a small apartment, where he devoted himself solely to study. The same
                    writer acquaints us, that he could repeat the Scriptures almost entirely by
                    heart; but his good qualities were eclipsed by his vices. For his love of
                    slander, and the furious assaults which he made upon the most eminent men, he
                    was called the Cerberus of literature. He accuses even Cicero of barbarisms and
                    improprieties. He died on the 19th of November 1649, at the age of seventy-four,
                    at Padua, the only retreat which remained to him from the multitude of enemies
                    whom he had created. Four hundred books are ascribed to him, which are said to
                    discover great genius and learning. The chief of these are, 1. Verisimilium
                    Libri iv. 1596, in 8vo; 2. Commentarius de Arte Critica, 1661, in 8vo; 3. De sua
