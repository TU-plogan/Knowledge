                <p><label type="entry">SANDWICH</label>, a town of the county of Kent, in the
                    hundred of Eastry, and lathe of St Augustine, sixty-eight miles from London. It
                    is situated on the river Stour, two miles from its entrance into the sea. It was
                    once accessible by ships, but the sand has nearly choked the passage, though
                    some plans are at present in contemplation to improve it. It is one of the
                    Cinque Ports, and as such, is governed by a corporation composed of a mayor,
                    four aldermen, and eleven councillors, who have jurisdiction over Deal,
                    Fordwich, Ramsgate, Reculver, Sarre, Stower, and Walmer. It was once fortified,
                    and a portion of its walls is still standing. Sandown Castle, a strong fortress
                    within the parish, commands the anchorage of the Downs. It is rather a decayed
                    town, but has a market on Wednesday and Saturday. There are three established
                    churches, and also places of worship for dissenters. It returns two members to
                    parliament, and confers on the family of Montague the title of earl. The
                    population amounted in 1821 to 2912, and in 1831 to 3136.</p>

                    the Pacific Ocean, are eleven in number. They were discovered by Captain Cook
                    and Captain King in the year 1778, and have been subsequently visited by
                    Vancouver, Meares, Turnbull, and various other navigators. These islands
                    received their name from the Earl of Sandwich, during whose administration they
                    were discovered. In their climate they resemble the West India islands, which
                    lie in the same latitude, although, on the whole, the temperature is more
                    moderate; nor are they subject to the dreadful hurricanes which desolate the
                    West India Islands. The thermometer during the day never rises higher than 88°,
                    but its mean height at noon is about 83°. There is a constant land and sea
                    breeze every night. The vegetable productions differ little from those in the
                    rest of the South Sea islands. The bread-fruit thrives, the sugar-canes are of
                    unusual size, and large vegetable roots are produced, shaped like a yam, and
                    from six to eight pounds in weight, which yield a juice that was found to be an
                    excellent substitute for sugar. These islands are evidently peopled by the same
                    race which is found in the islands of New Zealand, the Society and Friendly
                    Islands, and the Marquesas; a race that possesses, without any intermixture, all
                    the known lands between the latitudes of 47° south and 20° north, and between
                    the longitudes of 184° and 260° east. The natives are in general above the
                    middle size, graceful in all their movements, and capable of bearing great
                    fatigue. They are of a much darker complexion than the Otaheitans, and are
                    altogether an inferior people, though many have fine open countenances, and a
                    number of the women have a sweetness and sensibility which renders them very
                    engaging. They are distinguished from Europeans by one pecu-<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=694" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0694-0640"/>
                    liarity, namely, a fulness of the nostril, without any flatness or spreading of
                    the nose. They are praised by Captain King for their mild and affectionate
                    dispositions; yet it is difficult to reconcile such dispositions with the habits
                    of savage life, which are always ferocious and cruel. Humanity, mildness, and
                    all the gentler sympathies of the human heart, are fostered by civilization.
                    They are the result of cultivation, and not the spontaneous produce of the human
                    heart; and, accordingly, they come to no maturity in the adverse soil of
                    barbarism. Besides, they are inferior to the other islanders in that sure test
                    of humanity, namely, respect for women. It has even been suspected, though no
                    positive evidence of the fact has been found, that they are or have been in the
                    practice of eating the bodies of their enemies; and it is well known, that the
                    sacrificing of human victims was commonly practised among them, which is
                    certainly no index of any mildness in their manners; and the same ferocious
                    spirit is indicated by their wearing, as ornaments the most precious and
                    invaluable, which are handed down as a sort of heir-looms in families, the bones
                    of their enemies slain in battle, which are fashioned into various forms. Their
                    natural capacity when they were first visited by Europeans was found to be good;
                    they had made some improvements in agriculture and manufactures; and the eager
                    curiosity with which they attended the armourer’s forge, and the many expedients
                    they invented for working the iron procured from Europeans, afforded strong
                    proofs of their docility and their ingenuity. They had, however, all the
                    peculiar customs of the most savage nations, and are still in the practice,
                    along with all the other inhabitants of these islands, notwithstanding the
                    example and exhortations of the missionaries settled among them, of tatooing
                    their bodies, and also their face, which is peculiar to them and to the New
                    Zealanders. The common dress of all ranks of people consists only of a piece of
                    thick cloth ten or twelve inches broad, which they pass between the legs and tie
                    round the waist. They have another dress appropriated to ceremonial occasions,
                    which consists of a feathered cloak and helmet, and which is remarkable for its
                    beauty and magnificence, and is reserved chiefly for persons of high rank. The
                    common people chiefly subsist on fish and vegetables, such as yams, sweet
                    potatoes, ta-mow, plantains, sugar-canes, and bread. To these the people of a
                    higher rank add the flesh of hogs and dogs, dressed in the same manner as at the
                    Society Islands. They also eat fowls. For further particulars, and a more full
