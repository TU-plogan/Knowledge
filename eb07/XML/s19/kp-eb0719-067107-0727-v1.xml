                    Ripa, in the territories of Verona, in 1484; and is said to have been descended

                    is not mentioned in the letters of naturalization which he obtained in France in
                    1528. He learned the first rudiments of the Latin tongue in his own country; and
                    in his twelfth year was presented to the Emperor Maximilian, who made him one of
                    his pages. He served that emperor seventeen years, and gave signal proofs of his
                    valour and conduct in several expeditions. He was present at the battle of
                    Ravenna in April 1512, in which he had the misfortune to lose his father
                    Benedict Scaliger, and his brother Titus, on which his mother died with grief;
                    when, being reduced to necessitous circumstances, he entered into the order of
                    the Franciscans, and applied himself to study at Bologna. But soon afterwards,
                    changing his mind with respect to his becoming a monk, he took arms again, and
                    served in Piedmont; at which time a physician persuaded him to study physic,
                    which he did at his leisure hours, and also learned Greek; and at last the gout
                    determined him, at forty years of age, to abandon a military life. He soon
                    afterwards settled at Agen, where he married, and began to apply himself
                    seriously to his studies. He learned first the French tongue, which he spoke
                    perfectly in three months; and then made himself master of the Gascon, Italian,
                    Spanish, German, Hungarian, and Sclavonian; but the chief object of his studies
                    was polite literature. Meanwhile, he supported his family by the practice of
                    physic. He did not publish any of his works till he was forty-seven years of
                    age, when he soon gained a great name in the republic of letters. He had a
                    graceful person, and so strong a memory, even in his old age, that he dictated
                    to his son two hundred verses which he had composed the day before, and retained
                    without writing them down. He was so charitable, that his house was as it were
                    an hospital for the poor and sick; and he had such an aversion to lying, that he
                    would have no correspondence with those who were given to that vice; but, on the
                    other hand, he had much vanity, and possessed a satirical spirit, which created
                    him many enemies. He died of a retention of urine in 1558. He wrote in Latin, 1.
                    A treatise on the Art of Poetry, and, 2. Exercitatione against Cardan, which
                    works are much esteemed; 3. Commentaries on Aristotle’s History of Animals, and
                    on Theophrastus on Plants; 4. Some treatises on Physic; 5. Letters, Orations,
                    Poems, and other works, in Latin.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scaliger,</hi><hi rend="italic">Joseph Justus,</hi> one of
                    the most learned critics and writers of his time. He was the son of the former,
                    and was born at Agen, in France, in 1540. He studied in the college of Bordeaux;
                    after which his father took him under his own care, and employed him in
                    transcribing his poems. By this means he obtained such a taste for poetry, that
                    before he was seventeen years old he wrote a tragedy upon the subject of
                    OEdipus, in which he introduced all the poetical ornaments of style and
                    sentiment. His father having died in 1558, he went to Paris the year following,
                    with a desire to apply himself to the Greek tongue. For this purpose he for two
                    months attended the lectures of Tumebus; but finding that in the usual course he
                    should be a long time in gaining his point, he shut himself up in his closet,
                    and by constant application for two years gained a perfect knowledge of that
                    language. After this he applied to the Hebrew, which he learned by himself with
                    great facility. He made no less progress in the sciences; and his writings
                    procured him the reputation of one of the greatest men of that or of any other
                    age. He embraced the reformed religion at twenty-two years of age. In 1563, he
                    attached himself to Louis Casteignier de la Roche Pozay, whom he attended in
                    several journeys; and, in 1593, he was invited to accept of the place of
                    honorary professor of the university of Leyden, which he complied with. He died
                    of a dropsy in that city in 1609. He was a man of great temperance, was never
                    married, and was so close a student that he often spent whole days in his study
                    without eating; and though his circumstances were always very narrow, he
                    constantly refused the presents that were offered him. He published many works,
                    the principal of which are, 1. Notes on Seneca’s Tragedies, on Varro, Ausonius,
                    Pompeius Festus, &amp;c.; 2. His Latin Poems; 3. A treatise de Emendatione
                    Temporum; 4. Eusebius’s Chronicle, with Notes; 5. Canones Isagogici; and many
                    other works. The collections entitled <hi rend="italic">Scaligeriana</hi> were
                    collected from his conversations by one of his friends; and being ranged into
                    alphabetical order, were published by Isaac Vossius.</p>
