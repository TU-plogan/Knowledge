                <p><label type="entry">SCLAVONIA</label>, a province of the Austrian empire, still
                    occasionally dignified with the name of kingdom. It is bounded on the west by
                    Croatia, on the north and east by Hungary, from which it is separated by the
                    river Drave, and partly by the Danube, and on the south by Turkey, the river
                    Save separating it from the territories of the sultan. The shape of this
                    province is long and narrow, and it contains a superficies of about 5000 square
                    miles. A chain of lofty mountains, which rises in Croatia, intersects it in its
                    whole length from east to west. This elevated ridge is covered with forests,
                    containing the finest oak and other valuable trees; but a proper water
                    conveyance is wanting to render this natural product of the soil a valuable
                    article of export. The rest of the country consists of fine plains, with a
                    fertile soil, and a climate which, although mild, is cooler than might be
                    expected under the parallels of forty-five and forty-six. This is to be
                    attributed to the presence of the forest-covered mountain chain just mention ed.
                    During dry years the open parts of the mountainous tracts are barren; in
                    favourable years they produce excellent crops of wheat, barley, flax, hemp, and
                    madder. The climate of the plains is sufficiently genial for the cultivation of
                    maize, silk, and the fruits of the south of Europe. Limestone, sulphur, coal,
                    salt, and some ferruginous substances, are amongst the most abundant mineral
                    treasures of Sclavonia; but these have not yet been thoroughly investigated.
                    Much of the mountain chain yet remains unexplored. The manufactures are too
                    insignificant to require specific notice; those of glass and potash appear to be
                    the most important. The exports consist of corn, tobacco, nuts, plums, hides,
                    wax, honey, and madder; the imports are chiefly iron, salt, and oil. Domestic
                    weaving and knitting is universally practised, so that few of the finer fabrics
                    of Great Britain or France are required, especially amongst a people the bulk of
                    whom live in mud-huts. The transit trade is of more importance, in consequence
                    of the three great rivers, the Danube, the Drave, and the Save, which directly
                    or indirectly communicate with a large tract of country.</p>
                <p>Under the Romans, Sclavonia formed a part of Pannonia, and derived its present
                    name from a tribe of Sclavi or Slavi, who settled here in the sixth or seventh
                    century. Subsequently, the Venetians, having acquired an ascendency over
                    Dalmatia, extended their acquisitions to this country. In the tenth century it
                    came under the dominion of Hungary, to which it remained subject, until, in the
                    year 1526, it was overrun and subdued by the Turks. It was finally subjected to
                    the house of Austria by the peace of Carlowitz, which was ratified in 1699. The
                    country remained divided into military districts until 1745, but since that time
                    a beginning has been made towards giving some of them a civil constitution.
                    These form three counties. The military district, or generalate, consists of
                    Brod, Peterwardin, and Gradisca. It is under a military government, at the head
                    of which is the commanding general in Sclavonia, who resides at Peterwardin. The
                    counties are subject to the kingdom of Hungary, each having its governor and
                    vice-governor. Although Sclavonia has undergone a material improvement since its
                    annexation to Austria, yet the population is not characterized either by
                    industry, or by that degree of intelligence necessary to turn the natural
                    advantages of the country to good account. The Sclavonians proper, or
                    aborigines, do not now form the majority of the inhabitants; they are largely
                    intermixed with Magyars, Wallachians, Gypsies, Germans, Greeks, Jews, and
                    Armenians. There are but few Protestants in the country. The most numerous
                    religious denominations are the Roman Catholic, the Greek Catholic, and the
                    Greek non-united Church. The population in 1831 amounted to 370,000, which is
                    about eighty-five inhabitants to every square mile.</p>
