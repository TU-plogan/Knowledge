                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scotland</hi>, the northern division of Great Britain, is
                    situated between 54° 38' and 58° 41' north latitude, and between 1° 47' and 6°
                    7' west longitude from Greenwich; having the sea on all sides, except the south,
                    where it is separated from England partly by the Tweed and other streams, and
                    partly by a line supposed to be drawn along the high grounds in that quarter.
                    The longest line that can be drawn in about the same parallel of longitude is
                    from the Mull of Galloway in Wigtonshire to Cape Wrath in Sutherland, a distance
                    of about 274 miles, though Dunnet-head in Caithness-shire, is the most northerly
                    point; while its breadth is extremely various, ranging from 147 miles to about
                    30. The greatest breadth is between Buchanness on the coast of Aberdeenshire,
                    and the Rowanmoan Point on the west coast of Ross-shire. There are other points
                    where the width is not much less; while between Alloa on the</p>
                <p>Frith of Forth and Dunbarton on the Clyde, the distance is only 32 miles, and
                    between Lochbroom and the Frith of Dornoch, it is rather less than 30. The area

                    494 square miles of fresh water lakes. This is the extent of the mainland only,
                    exclusive of the islands on the west, known by the name of the Hebrides or
                    Western Isles; and those of Orkney and Zetland on the north, which altogether
                    are computed to extend over 4224 square miles, of which 144 consist of fresh
                    water lakes. Including these islands, the northern limit of Scotland stretches
                    beyond the 61st degree of latitude, and its longitude lies between the meridian
                    of London and 8°18' west; its area being computed to comprehend 30,238 square
                    miles, of which the fresh water lakes occupy 638 square miles, or about l-48th
                    part of the whole.</p>

                <p>From what has been already said respecting the extreme variation in the breadth
                    of Scotland at different places, the fact may be inferred, that the outline on
                    the sea-coast is exceedingly irregular, and of great extent, the sea penetrating
                    to a great depth, both on its eastern and western sides. Of these arms of the
                    sea, the most considerable are the Firths of Forth and Tay, and the Moray and
                    Dornoch Firths, on the east; and the Firth of Clyde and the Luce and Wigton
                    Bays, on the west and south-west; whilst there are a very great number of
                    smaller inlets, called lochs, such as Loch Fyne, Loch Long, Loch Etive, Loch
                    Lynnhe, Loch Broom, &amp;c., which indent the country in all directions, to an
                    extent varying from ten to seventy miles. With this irregularity of outline is
                    combined a surface generally rugged and mountainous. With the exception of
                    narrow tracts along its principal rivers, there is very little of the country
                    flat or level, or what would be regarded as productive land in more favoured
                    regions. “To such a degree,” says Mr. M'Cullocb, “is this the case, that,
                    estimating the whole extent of the country, exclusive of lakes, at 19,000,000
                    acres, it is doubtful whether so many as 6,000,000 be arable; whereas, taking
                    the extent of England and Wales at 37,000,000 acres, the arable land certainly
                    exceeds 29,000,000; so that, while in Scotland, the proportion of the cultivable
                    to the entire land is less than one-third, in England it exceeds three-fourths.
                    With the exception, indeed, of a few tracts of rich alluvial land, (carses),
                    Scotland has no very extensive vales; the surface of the rest of the country
                    being, even where most level, considerably varied with hill and dale.”<note

                    Britain, vol. i. p. 239.</p></note> In the south of Scotland, a tract of
                    mountainous country, known by various names, stretches in a south-west
                    direction, from the Cheviot hills in Roxburghshire, on the borders of England,
                    to the Irish channel, sending off branches on both sides, whilst detached hills
                    prevail over the whole of the contiguous districts. These high grounds, however,
                    are for the most part clothed in green, almost to their summits, and have little
                    of that wild, romantic, and desolate character, which distinguishes many of the
                    mountains of the Highlands. Northward from the isthmus formed by the Firths of
                    Forth and Clyde, the low grounds constitute but a small proportion of the whole.
                    Here, in latitude 57°, the Grampians extend from sea to sea, with a breadth of
                    from forty to sixty miles; and parallel to them, to the south, is another chain,
                    called the Siedlaw, Ochills, and Campsie hills. Between these two ranges lies
                    the fertile valley of Strathmore; whilst, farther north, cultivation is mostly
                    confined to the sea-coast, the banks of the larger rivers, and the narrow glens
                    between the mountains. On the north-west, beyond the line of the Caledonian
                    canal, the country is, with few exceptions, singularly rugged and sterile;
                    consisting of lofty mountains, cither covered with heath, or presenting a mass
                    of naked rocks, interrupted only by deep and dark ravines, lakes, and
                    precipitous streamlets. But the eastern coast of Ross-shire is comparatively
                    level and fertile; and Caithness, the north-eastern county of the mainland of
                    Scotland, is generally low, marshy, and unproductive.</p>
                <p>Scotland is divided into Highlands and Lowlands. “Those countries, whose
                    inhabitants speak a different language, and wear a different garb,” says Mr.
                    Home, in his <hi rend="italic">History of the Rebellion,</hi> 1745,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Home’s Works, vol. iii. 385,
                    386.</p></note> ^ “are not separated by firths or rivers, nor distinguished by
                    northern or southern latitude. The same shire, the same parish, at this day,
                    contains part of both; so that a Highlander and Lowlander (each of them standing
                    at the door of the cottage where he was born) hear their neighbours speak a
                    language which they do not understand.” The line which separates the Highlands
                    from the Lowlands is by no means well defined; but it may be described as
                    beginning at Dunbarton, on the Firth of Clyde, and proceeding northward by
                    Crieff, Dunkeld, and Blair gowrie, it runs through the forest of Morven, in the
                    heights of Aberdeen, to Carron, in Banffshire; from Carron it stretches due west
                    by Tarnoway, in Morayshire, to the town of Nairn; from Nairn the line is
                    continued to Inverness; and from this latter place, it proceeds in a tortuous
                    direction, to Dunistra, on the south side of the Firth of Dornoch, where the
                    line of separation may be said to terminate, the country to the north of this
                    firth being altogether Highland, except a narrow stripe of land along the shores
                    of the German Ocean, which washes the east coast of Sutherland and Caithness. To
                    the west of this line lie the Highlands, which, including the Hebrides,
                    constitute in superficial extent nearly one-half of Scotland, although the
                    inhabitants of this division do not form an eighth part of the population of
                    that kingdom. The face of the country is wild, rugged, desolate, and
                    mountainous. In almost every strath, valley, or glen, there glitters a stream or
                    lake; and numberless firths, or arms of the sea, penetrate the land. The <hi
                    rend="italic">passes</hi> into the Highlands lie in deep ravines or glens, so
                    narrow, and soover-hung by mountains, that they admit of being very easily
                    defended, and till recently, when roads have been made, they were impracticable
                    almost to every one except the natives. To this must principally be ascribed the
                    successful resistance opposed by the Highlanders to the attacks of the Romans
                    and the Saxons; and hence, also, these northern people still form a distinct
                    race, the lineal descendants of the ancient Celtic inhabitants of the country,
                    and differing essentially in language, dress, and manners, from the
                    Lowlanders..</p>
                <p>The climate of Scotland, as may be expected, from its insular situation and high
                    latitude, is cold, cloudy, and humid. This is its general character, as compared
                    with the greater part of England; yet, even in the south of England, frost is
                    sometimes more intense, and snow falls more copiously than in Scotland. Corn,
                    however, and most of the fruits and vegetables common to both divisions of Great
                    Britain, attain maturity about three weeks earlier in the south of England than
                    in Scotland; and some plants, such as hops and a few others, cannot be
                    profitably cultivated at all in the latter country. The mean annual temperature
                    of Scotland is very high for the latitude, being about 46 ½ ° in places near the
                    level of the sea. In the more southerly parts of the kingdom, the climate
                    differs but little from that of the northern parts of England. Sir David
                    Brewster states the mean annual temperature to be 48 36 at Leith. At Edinburgh,
                    which is elevated from 300 to 400 feet above the level of the sea, and situated
                    two miles from it, the annual temperature is 47∙8, and this may be taken as a
                    near approximation to the general average of Scotland; the mean temperature of
                    winter being 38∙6, of spring, 46∙4, of summer, 58∙2, of autumn, 48∙4, the
                    coldest month being 38∙3, and the warmest 59·4.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Ibid.</p></note> The observations published
                    in the <hi rend="italic">New Statistical Account of Scotland,</hi> and in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh,</hi> closely
                    approximate to the above estimate. In the parish of Inch, Wigtonshire, the mean
                    temperature for the year 1837 was 48∙41. At Applegarth Manse, in the interior of
                    Dumfriesshire, the average annual temperature for seven successive years, ending
                    in 1831 inclusive, was 47Ί2; that of the spring being 40∙31, of the summer,
                    56∙86, the autumn, 54∙18, and of winter, 39·92. At Wick in Caithness the mean
                    annual temperature is 46∙7, that of the winter being 40∙35, the spring, 44∙4l,
                    the summer, 5377, and the autumn, 48·82; whilst at Sumburgh-head, the most
                    southerly promontory of the Shetland Islands, in latitude 59° 52', the mean
                    annual temperature is 45 ∙5, that of the winter being 40, the spring, 43·29, the
                    summer, 50∙60, and the autumn, 47∙48. The range of the barometer is 2∙82 inches,
                    or from 30·92 to 28· 10 inches; and in the Orkney and Shetland Islands it is
                    somewhat more, or about three inches. The fall of rain is very diffcr-<pb

                    about 31 inches. The quantity which falls on the east coast of Scotland ranges
                    from 22 to 26 inches; whilst, on the west coast and in the Hebrides, it is
                    nearly double, varying, according to situation, from 35 to 46 inches. The number
                    of fair days throughout the year is, on the west coast, only 160; whilst on the
                    east it is 230. The mean annual fall of rain at Edinburgh for the years 1824 and
                    1825, was 23 ½ inches; at Glasgow, for an average of thirty years, it was 30
                    inches; whilst, still farther west, at Mount Stewart, in the Isle ofBute, it
                    was, on an average of seven years, 46∙6 inches, the mean average of the whole
                    country being, as just stated, 31 inches. The prevailing winds throughout
                    Scotland are from the westerly points; but on the east coast it blows from the
                    easterly points about a third of the year. Easterly winds generally prevail in
                    March and April., and often in May and part of June, and not only check
                    vegetation, but are attended with slightly unfavourable effects on the health of
                    the inhabitants, particularly such of them as are nervous, dyspeptic,
                    consumptive, or rheumatic. But the climate of Scotland is eminently salubrious.
                    There are, properly speaking, no fens or marshes. The low grounds are, in
                    general, highly cultivated. From whatever point the wind may blow, except the
                    east, a wide expanse of sea is passed ever; and the air, though moist, is
                    purified from injurious emanations, which are readily absorbed by the ocean.
                    Hence it has been affirmed, that the mean duration of life is greater in
                    Scotland than in almost any other country.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Malthus, i. cap. x.</p></note> “We are pretty confident,
                    from extensive observation in different countries, that the proportion of the
                    population that reaches seventy or eighty years of age, and the vigour then
                    remaining, are greater in Scotland than almost any where else.”</p>
                <p>The mountains of Scotland consist either of detached groups, more or less closely
                    wedged together, or of ridges or chains. These latter may be characterized as
                    running in a north-east and south-west direction. The most celebrated chain, the
                    Grampians, mentioned by Tacitus,<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Agricolae Vita, c. 29.</p></note> extend from the
                    south-eastern boundaries of Argyleshire, with a more or less defined line, to
                    the heart of Aberdeenshire. This chain may be regarded as a natural rampart,
                    forming the south-eastern boundary of the Highlands. With the exception of Ben
                    Nevis, the highest mountains in Scotland arc comprehended in the Grampian range.
                    Another chain, to the south of the Grampians, and nearly parallel to them,
                    stretches from Montrose to the Clyde, in Dunbartonshire; but being intersected
                    by the Tay and the Forth, it is divided into three distinct portions, which bear
                    different names. From Montrose to the Tay, this chain is called the Siedlaw
                    hills; from the Tay to the Forth, it is known by the name of the Ochills; and
                    the remainder passes under the names of the Dundaff, Fintry, and Campsie hills.
                    The low-country, or strath, which separates this range of hills from the
                    Grampians, is called Strathmore, or the great valley. There is also a chain of
                    mountains in the south of Scotland, stretching from the Cheviot hills, on the
                    borders of Northumberland, to Loch Ryan, in Wigtonshire. There are other smaller
                    ranges, such as the Monagh Lea mountains, which run parallel to and along the
                    western side of the Spey; the Lomond hills in Fifeshire; the Pentland hills in
                    Mid-Lothian, and others. The altitude and situation of the principal hills and
                    mountains in Scotland having already been given under the head of Physical
                    Geography, it is unnecessary to repeat the information here.</p>
                <p>In the neighbourhood of the village of Leadhills, in Lanarkshire, 1564 feet above
                    the level of the sea, is the highest cultivated land in Scotland. In
                    Aberdeenshire, the plough sometimes reaches the height of about 1300 feet; but,
                    with few exceptions, an elevation of 600 feet seems to be the limit of the
                    tillage lands of Scotland. None of the Scottish mountains ascends to the line of
                    perpetual congelation; yet snow may be found all the year round in some of the
                    dark recesses, on which the sun never shines.</p>
                <p>From the rugged and mountainous character of the surface of Scotland, the vales
                    or level tracts cannot be expected to be extensive or numerous. They are,
                    indeed, when compared with England, very much the reverse. Of these vales,
                    called sometimes <hi rend="italic">straths</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >carses,</hi> the following are the most important The vale or <hi rend="italic"
                    >carse</hi> of Stirling and Falkirk is a tract of low alluvial land, which
                    extends on both sides of the Forth, with little interruption, and to a greater
                    or less width, from Borrowstonness to about twenty miles north of Stirling,
                    including the vales of the Teith and the Allan, two tributaries of the Forth.
                    These lands are peculiarly fertile, and produce the richest crops of wheat and
                    other grain. The vale of the Earn, a tributary of the Tay, known by the name of
                    Strathearn, is of a similar character, but of comparatively limited extent. The
                    carse of Gowrie, which lies on the north of the Tay, from Dundee to Perth, is
                    incomparably the most fertile and productive district in Scotland, and is
                    thought not to be surpassed in these respects by any other district of equal
                    extent in the united kingdom. Strathmore stretches from Lawrencekirk in
                    Angusshire to the neighbourhood of Perth, lying between the bases of the Siedlaw
                    hills and the Grampians. This valley is not entirely flat, but is characterised
                    by occasional gentle eminences. The <hi rend="italic">Merse,</hi> or level lands
                    of Berwick shire, stretch from the confluence of the Leader and the Tweed to the
                    town of Berwick, occupying most of the low and generally level part of the
                    country, or nearly the half of its surface. The carse of Baldoon, lying south of
                    the river Bladenoch, and on the east shore of the bay of Wigton, is of limited
                    extent, but of nearly equal fertility to the carse of Gowrie. There are other
                    less important straths or carses, such as those along the Teviot in
                    Roxburghshire; Tynedale, or the vale of Tyne, in East Lothian; and the Howe, or
                    vale of Eden, in Fifeshire. These lands are either loamy or alluvial.</p>
                <p>By this term we mean tracts of land composed of morasses, intermixed with rocks,
                    lakes, and peat-moss. The moor of Rannoch, lying between Schehallion, Ben
                    Cruachan, and Ben Nevis, is one of the most lonely, wild, and dreary districts
                    in Scotland. It may be said to be entirely devoid of value, and would not of
                    itself bring any rent. It is not inhabited, and very seldom visited. There is a
                    tract about ten miles inland on the west coast of Sutherlandshire, not very
                    dissimilar, but, though more rugged, it is not quite so dreary as that of the
                    moor of Rannoch. The <hi rend="italic">flow</hi> of Glenluce lies between
                    Newtonstewart and Luce Bay, stretching along the public road for about ten
                    miles, composed chiefly of peat and morasses, and forming one of the bleakest
                    and most dreary rides in Scotland.</p>
                <p>From the rugged and mountainous nature of the country, the rivers of Scotland are
                    characterised by a more rapid course, are more diversified by rocks and
                    cataracts, and are more limpid than those of England. Their course is also
                    necessarily shorter, and few of them are navigable, at least to any great
                    extent. Being generally mountain streams, they are peculiarly liable to sudden
                    overflowings, their rise and fall being equally sudden. From a very tedious and
                    elaborate set of experiments, it is computed that they carry out to the sea, on
                    an average, about <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    2000</hi> the weight of their waters in mud; that is, a film of about <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 50</hi> of an inch annually,
                    or one inch in fifty years over the whole surface from which they draw their
                    waters.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers of Scotland, with the single exception of the Clyde, are
                    exclusively confined to the east. Three inconsiderable rivers flow in a
                    south-easterly direction, the<pb break="no"

                    Dee, which falls into the Solway Firth about six miles south of Kirkcudbright,
                    and is navigable for small vessels two miles above that town; the Nith, which
                    rises in the north of Dumfries-shire, and falls into the Solway Firth more than
                    seven miles below Dumfries, being navigable to within two miles of that place;
                    and the Annan, which rises on the south side of Hartfell, near Moffat, and falls
                    into the same estuary at the town of Annan. The last is not navigable beyond
                    this burgh. The rivers which flow in a northerly or north-easterly direction are
                    the Ness, which flows from Loch Ness, and, after a short course, falls into the
                    Moray Firth near Inverness; the Findhorn, which, rising in the Monagh Lea
                    mountains, falls into the same estuary at Findhorn, after a winding course of
                    upwards of 50 miles; and the Spey, the most rapid of the Scottish rivers, which
                    flows from Loch Spey towards the west of Inverness-shire, and, after receiving
                    innumerable tributaries, and traversing the best wooded portion of the
                    Highlands, falls into the Moray Firth. The course of the Spey is nearly 100
                    miles; it drains above 1300 square miles of country, but is not navigable. With
                    the exception of the Ayr, which is likewise not navigable, and falls into the
                    sea at the town of the same name, the only river on the west coast worth
                    mentioning, is the Clyde, (the <hi rend="italic">Glotta</hi> of Tacitus), which,
                    in a manufacturing and commercial point of view, is the most important stream in
                    Scotland. It rises on the west of the Moffat mountains, and, after a circuitous
                    course of nearly eighty miles, falls into the Firth of Clyde below Dunbarton. It
                    receives various tributaries, and is navigable to Glasgow, passing in its course
                    the principal manufacturing and commercial towns in Scotland; Glasgow, Hamilton,
                    Lanark, Paisley, Port-Glasgow, and Greenock. The navigation of the Clyde was
                    formerly much obstructed; but under the management of a Parliamentary board,
                    called the River Trust, these obstructions have been nearly removed, and the
                    channel rendered so deep and straight that vessels of 400 tons can now resort to
                    the Broomielaw at Glasgow. The falls of Clyde, which are about 30 miles
                    south-east of Glasgow, are very striking and celebrated. The first considerable
                    fall is that of Bonnington, its height, including that of a little one
                    immediately above it, being about thirty feet. The second is Corra Linn, where
                    the water dashes from one shelving rock to another, its perpendicular height
                    being about seventy feet. Dundaff fall is only ten feet in height; whilst that
                    of Stonebyres, which includes three distinct falls, is not less than seventy-six
                    feet.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Naiamith’s Survey
                    of Clydesdale, p. 19, &amp;c.</p></note> All the other rivers are on the east
                    coast, namely, the Tweed, the Forth, the Tay, the North and South Esk, the Dee,
                    and the Don. The Tweed rises near the sources of the Annan and Clyde, and
                    running past Peebles through a beautiful pastoral country, falls into the German
                    ocean at Berwick-upon-Tweed, after a winding course of about a hundred miles.
                    The descent from its source to its embouchure is about 1500 feet; and it is
                    navigable only to Berwick. The Forth, (the <hi rend="italic">Bodotria</hi> of
                    Tacitus), rises on the east of Ben Lomond, and receiving the waters of the Teith
                    and the Allan, it becomes a considerable stream at Stirling, to which the tide
                    flows, and to which it is navigable for vessels of about seventy tons. From
                    Stirling to Alloa is only six miles by land, but the stream of the Forth is so
                    tortuous that it is no less than sixteen by water. The river may here be said to
                    terminate in the Firth, which extends to the German ocean, a distance of forty
                    miles. Its width is various. At Queensferry, eight miles west of Edinburgh, it
                    is two miles; at Leith it is six; and thence it gradually expands till it is
                    lost in the open sea. It is navigable for vessels of 300 tons as far as Alloa.
                    The only low water pier of which it can boast is that of Granton, about a mile
                    and a half west of Leith. The Tay rises to the north of Loch Lomond, and
                    expanding into the romantic sheet of water called Loch Tay, it flows in a
                    circuitous route past Dunkeld and Perth, and falls into the Firth of Tay at the
                    confluence of its waters with the Earn, about twenty miles from the mouth of the
                    estuary. It is navigable to Dundee for vessels of 500 tons burthen, and to Perth
                    for those of 100 tons. It receives many tributaries, of which the Earn, just
                    mentioned, is the most important. The Tay is the largest of the Scottish, and,
                    in respect to the volume of water it conveys to the sea, even of the British
                    rivers. The North and South Esk have their source in the Grampians, and fall
                    into the sea at Montrose, within three miles of each other. The South Esk is
                    navigable to Montrose, about a mile and a half from its mouth. The North Esk is
                    not navigable. The basin of Montrose, through which the South Esk flows, and
                    which bounds the town on the west, comprehends about 2000 acres of land; it is
                    covered by water at full sea, and exhibits nothing but bare sand at ebb tide.
                    This expanse, it has been calculated, might be reclaimed at a gross cost of
                    L.11,938.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quarterly
                    Journal of Agriculture, March 1838.</p></note> The Dee and the Don have also
                    their rise in the Grampians, and fall into the sea, the former at New Aberdeen,
                    and the latter at Old Aberdeen. The Dee is navigable for about a mile from its
                    mouth; the Don is not navigable.</p>
                <p>The Scottish rivers, as stated at the beginning of this head, are of such a
                    character, that there is no room for reclaiming waste land from their channels.
                    This is prevented by the rapidity of their streams and by their rugged course.
                    But several attempts have been made to reclaim lands from innundation on the
                    shores of the Firths of Forth and Tay. Without entering into particulars the

                <p>In addition to this, it has been stated that the extent of land now in process of
                    being reclaimed, on different estates on the shores of the Tay, may be computed
                    at 1140 acres, at a gross cost of L.50 per acre. The following extract, on the
                    subject of embankments, from a work just published,<note anchored="true"

                    Scots acres of land have been here, (the parish of St. Madoes,) at different
                    times reclaimed from the Tay by embankments. In 1826, in consequence of an
                    arrangement between Sir John Richardson, the proprietor, and Mr. R.W. Rannie,
                    tenant, Pitfour Mains, by which the latter agreed to raise an embankment at his
                    own expense, and after being allowed to take the first crop free, to pay L.4,
                    10s. annually, per Scots acre, for the reclaimed land, during a lease of
                    nineteen years; operations were commenced, which resulted in the complete
                    reclamation of 50 acres during the autumn of that year. The whole expense of
                    embankments, sluices, levelling, water cuts, and trenching amounted to L.1530.
                    So productive, however, did the new soil turn out, that Mr. Rannie has been
                    amply rewarded for his enterprise. According to his own account, he has had,
                    before liming and manuring, on some parts of a field, about 60 bolls of potatoes
                    per acre, the average produce being from 40 to 50 bolls. After liming and
                    manuring, he has had, on some parts of a field, 70 bolls per acre, the average
                    being from 50 to 60 bolls, of 32 stones Dutch to<pb break="no"

                    the boll. He has had of oats, before liming and manuring, from 10 to 11, after
                    liming and manuring, from 12 to 13 quarters per acre; and of wheat from 6 to 7
                    quarters per acre. He commenced liming in 1829 and manuring in 1835, the
                    rotation, up to that period, being potatoes, and wheat, or oats, alternately. In
                    1833, Sir John Richardson reclaimed 18 acres more at an expense of L.1200; and,
                    by means of head-dikes, break-waters, and other contrivances, which he is from
                    time to time throwing out into the river, for the purpose of accommodating silt,
                    upwards of 150 acres more may ultimately be added to the parish; of these, from
                    15 to 20 may be banked off in the course of two years.”</p>
                <p>From a table already given, under the head of Superficial Extent, we have already
                    found that the fresh water lakes in Scotland occupy an area of 638 square miles,
                    or cover an aggregate extent of 408,320 English statute acres. The only counties
                    that are devoid of lakes are those of Berwick, Clackmannan, the Lothians, and
                    Peebles; whilst those of Roxburgh amount to only 320 English acres. The greatest
                    extent of lakes are in Inverness-shire, (84,480 English acres,) Argyleshire,
                    exclusive of islands, (38,400,) Ross-shire, (38,400,) Perthshire, (32,000,) and
                    Sutherlandshire, (30,080.) The lakes, generally speaking, occupy the valleys or
                    ravines amongst the mountains, and are thus distinguished for their length,
                    their breadth being comparatively trifling. The only Lowland lakes worth
                    specifying are Loch Leven, St. Mary’s Loch, and Loch Ken. The first, situated in
                    Kinross-shire, is four miles in length by two in breadth, having the Lomond
                    hills on its east, and Benarty hill on its south; whilst the towns of Kinross
                    and Milnathort lie on its western margin. This lake is remarkable for a peculiar
                    species of red trout, which is highly valued;<note anchored="true"

                    and it also produces char, perch, pike, and other species of fish. The fishery
                    is let for a considerable sum; and it is a remarkable fact that Loch Leven is
                    the only Scottish lake that yields any revenue to its proprietors. There is not
                    even an attempt made to derive any profits from any other lake; nay, they are
                    not fished for the domestic consumption even of the neighbouring inhabitants.
                    But Loch Leven is principally celebrated for an island in the lake in which are
                    the picturesque ruins of a castle, where Queen Mary was confined by her
                    subjects, and from which she effected her escape (1568) a few days previous to
                    the fatal battle of Langside. There are other small islands in the lake, the
                    principal of which is St. Serf’s, where was once a famous monastery, of which
                    Andrew Winton, author of the <hi rend="italic">Chronykil of Scotland,</hi> was
                    prior. St. Mary’s Loch, a most beautiful and picturesque sheet of water, three
                    miles in length by from half a mile to a mile in breadth, is in Selkirkshire.
                    Loch Ken is formed by the expansion of the river Ken in Kirkcudbrightshire, and
                    forms part of the river. It is ten miles in length by rather less than a mile in
                    breadth. The other lakes are all north of the Firths of Clyde and Forth. Loch
                    Lomond is the most celebrated as well as the largest lake in Scotland; indeed,
                    it is the largest in the British dominions. This noble sheet of water is above
                    twenty-four miles in length, its greatest breadth is ten miles, but, towards its
                    upper part, it is not more than half a mile. Its depth varies from twenty to a
                    hundred and twenty fathoms, and its greatest depth is towards the north. It is
                    studded with numerous and richly wooded islands, some of them being very small,
                    but the largest, Inchmurrin, is two miles in length and one in breadth. Some of
                    them, particularly Inchmurrin, are stocked with deer. Both sides of the lake are
                    flanked by high and rugged mountains, among which “the lofty Ben Lomond” stands
                    conspicuous, its height being 3195 feet above the margin of the water. The
                    surface water of Loch Lomond is from three to five feet higher in winter than in
                    summer; but its mean height is about twenty-two feet above the level of the sea
                    at Dunbarton. Its surplus water is convey ed to the Clyde, a distance of six
                    miles, by the river Leven. Loch Katterin, so celebrated in Sir Walter Scott’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Lady of the Lake,</hi> lies in the district of Menteith,
                    Perthshire, and is one of the most romantic in Scotland. Its length is eight
                    miles, and its greatest breadth less than one. It does not seem necessary to
                    give a minute description of the other lakes; but the following table, taken
                    from the <hi rend="italic">General Report of Scotland,</hi> will shew their
                    number, dimensions, and situation.</p>

                <p>In a general point of view, Scotland may be separated, geologically as well as
                    geographically, into three portions. By passing a line on the map nearly
                    straight from Stonehaven, through Dunkeld, to the middle of the Isle of Bute,
                    and thence with a slight curve to the Mull of Cantyre, we shall have traced the
                    southern boundary of the primary nonfossiliferous system of rocks. Another line,
                    but much more irregular than the former, drawn from St. Abb’s Head in
                    Berwickshire, passing near Peebles, Sanquhar, and New Cumnock, to the south of
                    Girvan on the western coast, will form a general parallelism with the former
                    line, and will contain the old greywacke, now named the Cumbrian system, lying
                    to the south, and extending to the boundary between England and Scotland, whilst
                    the land included between the two lines comprehends the old red sandstone, and
                    great central basin of Scotland.</p>
                <p>That extensive tract of Scotland which constitutes the northern division, is
                    composed chiefly of gneiss, mica slate, chlorite slate, and clay slate, with
                    subordinate masses of hornblende slate, talc slate, and primitive limestone.
                    These, with granitic centres, often rise into magnificent mountains, of which
                    the Grampians form a part. In many of these deposits, particularly in the mica
                    slate, garnets of a brown colour are very abundant. In the primary deposits no
                    organic remains have ever been discovered.</p>
                <p>These, however, are not the only stratified formations which constitute this
                    extensive district. The old red sandstone fringes the extremities of the land,
                    commencing near the<pb break="no"

                    Moray Firth, extending on both sides of Loch Ness till within a short distance
                    of Fort Augustus, and then proceeding northward, expanding the whole breadth of
                    Caithness, and constituting the principal formation of the Orkney Isles. On the
                    western site of the mainland, the old red sandstone is deposited in numerous
                    patches on the gneiss formation, as at Loch Broom, Gairloch, and Applecross.</p>
                <p>The new secondary rocks have been but sparingly observed in Scotland; yet it is a
                    curious fact that the few patches that have been discovered are superimposed on
                    the old red sandstone, and have not been reposing in uninterrupted order in the
                    secondary series. Thus the lias shales, highly micaceous, and some of the upper
                    beds of the oolitic system, occur at the mouth of the Cromarty Firth, from
                    Dunrobin Castle to the ord of Caithness, Applecross, and other points on the
                    mainland, and in the Western Islands, on the borders of Mull, the south and east
                    of Skye, and near to the rocks of Arran. The equivalent of the fresh water
                    deposits of the wealds of Sussex, geologically situated above the oolitic group
                    and below the chalk, is seen in Moray and Skye. In the central and southern
                    divisions of Scotland, these newer groups of rocks have not been detected. In
                    this division of Scotland very few metallic ores have been found. Lead mines
                    were formerly wrought at Tyn-drum, to the west of Loch Tay. Lead mines are at
                    present wrought at Stronbean in Argyleshire, at which place the carbonate of
                    strontian was first discovered. At Glen Strath-fairer, in Inverness-shire, there
                    have been detected veins of plumbago running between the laminae of the mica
                    slate.</p>
                <p>We may here briefly refer to the geological character of the Western Isles. Dr.
                    M'Culloch<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Western
                    Islands of Scotland, VoL II.</p></note> calls the Long Island, consisting of a
                    series of islands lying in a south-west and north-east direction, the gneiss
                    island, from the predominance of that species of rock. Another group, embracing
                    Skye, Rum, Canna, Mack, Egg, and Mull, he denominates the trap islands. There
                    are five basaltic islands off the north-west side of Mull, of which the smallest
                    but the most celebrated is Staffa, which is well known for its basaltic columns
                    and cavern, called Fingal’s cave. This cave, one of the most remarkable natural
                    excavations in the world, is formed of the columnar bed of basalt, where it
                    declines to the level of the sea, which washes the feet of the columns, that are
                    like the pillars of an immense cathedral, placed close to each other, the sea
                    forming the floor. The top of the arch, at the entrance, is 66 feet; but it
                    gradually declines to 40 at the extremity, at the distance of 227 feet. The
                    breadth of the cave is about forty feet. There are other similar caverns of less
                    note on the island. The basalt of which the columns in Staffa are composed, is
                    similar to that of the Giant’s Causeway in Ireland; and it is probable that they
                    are both of submarine origin, having been raised by the sea. St. Kilda,the most
                    western of the Hebrides, is composed of several varieties of the trap rock.
                    Arran, in the Firth of Clyde, even to the top of the highest mountains, is
                    principally granitic.</p>
                <p>In tracing the geological features of the country in the ascending order of the
                    groups, we come next to the transition or greywacke system, now divided into two
                    principal sections, the lower or Cumbrian, and the upper or Silurian. As far as
                    has hitherto been ascertained, the Silurian division is unknown in Scotland; and
                    the Cumbrian rocks, destitute of organic remains, cover the greater part of the
                    area of the south of Scotland. These greywacke strata stand at high angles of
                    from sixty to ninety degrees, and consist chiefly of coarse slatystrata, seldom
                    divisible into thin roofing slates, and often alternating with arenaceous and
                    coarse conglomerates. Amongst them, limestone is seldom found, and, when it is,
                    the quality of it is inferior. In the division of which we now treat, coal and
                    its accompaniments are known in few places; it is, however, wrought at Canonby,
                    near Langholm, and at the Carter Fell. The only other rock formation, found in
                    connexion with the old transition group here, with the exception of igneous
                    rocks, is a red sandstone, ascertained, in some situations, to be the old red,
                    but in others, considered as the new red sandstone, particularly in
                    Dumfries-shire.</p>
                <p>In the third geological division of Scotland, namely, the centre of the kingdom,
                    is placed the great coal basin; but, adhering to our rule of marking the
                    successive formations in the ascending order, we shall first treat of the old
                    red sandstone, the most ancient rock in this subdivision of the country. This
                    rock abuts against the line of the primary rocks, and stretches across the whole
                    country from the German Ocean to the Atlantic, pursuing, like the mountain
                    ranges, a south-westerly, or north-easterly direction. Its line forms a long,
                    uninterrupted, extensive, and fertile valley. In the north-western part, it
                    rises into hills, on the sides of one of which, east of Menteith, are deep and
                    hideous fissures, the effect of some convulsion of the earth.</p>
                <p>The formation appears to be of vast thickness, especially towards the north, and
                    may, it is supposed, be divided into three portions; the lower, the middle, and
                    the upper beds. In what are considered as the lower strata, the remains of
                    fishes have been found in a high state of preservation. The well known Arbroath
                    pavement belongs to the old red sandstone series.</p>
                <p>But the most important group in this central district is the coal formation,
                    consisting of limestone, ironstone, freestone, coal, and clays. The extent from
                    east to west is bounded only by the extremities of the land. To the north, it is
                    cut off from the old red sandstone by a range of trap hills, crossing the
                    country from east to west. On the south, it is bounded by the greywacke and the
                    old red sandstone. Its breadth, extending on both sides of the Forth and Clyde,
                    averages forty miles, and its length about seventy miles.</p>
                <p>The mountain limestone forms generally the basis of the group, although it is
                    frequently found interstratified with other members of the series, and abounds
                    with great numbers of organic remains. Below the mountain limestone, however,
                    but belonging to the same group, a bed of limestone is worked at Burdie-house,
                    near Edinburgh, in which the organic remains differ essentially from those which
                    have been just named. These remains consist of many of the plants which
                    distinguish the coal formation; but that alluded to includes also the teeth,
                    scales, and other bones of fishes which partake of the reptile character, some
                    of which must have been of gigantic dimensions. Small fishes are also found in a
                    fine state of preservation. The same limestone has been found in other parts of
                    the country, and is of superior quality to the common limestone, for mortar,
                    plaster, and the smelting of iron.</p>
                <p>The clay limestone is found in beds and nodules, the workable kind containing
                    from twenty-seven to forty-five per cent. of iron. The kind termed black band is
                    in high request. From this ore is smelted vast quantities of pig iron. The iron
                    works in Scotland have been increasing beyond all example; at Carron,
                    Gartsherrie, Shotts, Cleland, Airdrie, Clyde, and other places. The quantity of
                    iron produced in Scotland in 1830 amounted to 37,500 tons. But tour years
                    afterwards, in 1834, the latest date of which we have any correct accounst, the
                    quantity had nearly doubled, being about 72,000 tons. These works are generally
                    within ten or a dozen miles of Glasgow.</p>
                <p>The coal is found in beds varying from a few inches to forty feet in thickness,
                    is extracted in great quantity, and is used as fuel, both for domestic and
                    manufacturing purposes. One variety, cannel coal, is of superior quality for<pb

                    manufactured fire brick and gas retorts; and the sandstone furnishes an
                    inexhaustible store of substantial and beautiful material for building.</p>
                <p>These several deposits contain in abundance the impressions of the vegetables
                    which distinguish the carboniferous period; and, what is remarkable, the remains
                    of animals, the same as occur in the Burdie-house limestone, are found in the
                    shales, and even in the coal itself. In the island, no strata newer than the
                    carboniferous system is known to exist. All is covered over with accumulations
                    of clay, gravel, sand, and soil.</p>
                <p>Until after the middle of last century’ there was scarcely a good road in
                    Scotland. Soon after the rebellion of 1715, Government began to open up the
                    country by roads made by the military, hence called military roads, which
                    extended in all about eight hundred miles; but these being confined for the most
                    part to the Highlands, intended for military purposes, and formed with little or
                    no regard to such ascents and descents as do not impede the passage of an army,
                    were of little advantage in an economical point of view. It is in the
                    recollection of persons still living, when corn, coals, and other heavy
                    articles, were usually carried upon the backs of horses, even in the southern
                    counties of Scotland; the roads, or rather the tracks, being for the greater
                    part of the year unfit for wheel-carriages. But so great a change has been made
                    in this respect, particularly within the last forty years, that mail-coaches,
                    and other carriages, now run day and night at the rate of from eight to ten
                    miles an hour through every part of the country, from the borders of England to
                    the northern extremity of Great Britain.</p>
                <p>The only funds formerly applicable to the making and the repairing of the roads
                    in Scotland were what is called the Statute Labour, or the labour of the
                    occupiers of the land, for six days annually, upon the roads passing through
                    their respective parishes, and a small assessment imposed upon the proprietors.
                    This labbur, which has been converted into payment in money, and also the sums
                    raised by assessment on the proprietors, under the name of road and bridge
                    money, are now applied to bye-roads, or such as communicate with the great
                    turnpikes. Almost every county has procured an act of Parliament which fixes the
                    rate of these assessments; but this varies in different counties according to
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The turnpike roads and bridges in the Lowlands have, for nearly a century, been
                    made, and are kept in repair by means of tolls exacted from those who use them,
                    under the authority of private acts of Parliament. The first of these acts was
                    obtained in 1750, at which time the roads were so bad that the journey from
                    Edinburgh to Glasgow, a distance of forty-two miles, occupied 1 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> days, whereas it is
                    now effected in from 4 ½ to 5 hours. The trustees named in these acts are
                    commonly empowered, whether wisely or not, to borrow money upon the security of
                    the funds to be received; by which means the work is more speedily executed. The
                    board of trustees consists of the sheriff-depute, his substitute, and the
                    justices of the peace in the county, together with all individuals, and their
                    eldest sons, who are owners of estates worth L.100 Scotch a-year, and upwards,
                    of valued rent. The result of this is, that “in consequence of the excellent
                    materials which abound in all parts of Scotland, and of the greater skill and
                    science of Scotch trustees and surveyors, the turnpike roads in Scotland are
                    superior to those in England.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>In the Highlands, the nature of the country, and the state of the population, did
                    not admit of the same system as in the Lowlands. The military roads had not only
                    been made, but were kept in repair at the public expense, for which L.5000
                    a-year was usually granted by Parliament; but a great many new roads and bridges
                    were required; and, in 1803, an act was passed, proceeding upon “a survey and
                    report of the coasts and central Highlands of Scotland,” by which Parliament
                    agreed to provide half the estimated expense of the necessary roads and bridges,
                    the other half to be defrayed by the landed proprietors; and Commissioners were
                    named to carry into effect the beneficent intentions of the Legislature. It
                    appears from the report just referred to, that, under this act, the
                    Commissioners had, in 1821, expended, on 875 miles of road, and several large
                    bridges, upwards of L.450,000, of which L.240,000 was granted by Parliament, and
                    the rest defrayed by the counties through which the roads passed; and that
                    L.100,000 more had been laid out by them upon harbours, of which L.50,000 was
                    paid out of the funds arising from the forfeited estates in Scotland, and the
                    remainder raised by the burghs, and by the contributions of individuals. If, to
                    these sums, we add the amount of the losses sustained by the contractors, as
                    stated in the Report, and the expense of the new roads made at the sole cost of
                    the proprietors, to communicate with the Parliamentary roads, together with the
                    charges of repairs, the whole amount expended within these twenty years upon the
                    roads, bridges, and harbours of the Highlands of Scotland, may not be too highly
                    stated at a million sterling. The Commissioners have under their charge both the
                    maintaining of their own roads, and part of the military roads, the extent of
                    the whole in 1821 being 1183 miles; and about L.10,000 a-year, of which L.5000
                    is granted by Parliament, was considered to be necessary for this purpose,
                    including all charges of management.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>The Caledonian Canal, the greatest work of the kind ever attempted in Great
                    Britain, stretches south-west and northeast across the island, from a point near
                    Inverness to Fort-William, a distance of 60 ½ miles, including Lochs Ness, Oich,
                    and Lochy, by which nearly two-thirds of it are formed. The excavated or
                    artificial part is tw enty-three miles; and there are in all twenty locks. The
                    depth in some places is only seventeen feet, but it was originally meant to be
                    twenty. As it is, however, frigates of 32 guns, and merchant ships of 1000 tons
                    can pass through it. It is 50 feet wide at the bottom, and 122 at top. But with
                    all its magnificence, it has been found to be an improvident speculation. The
                    total cost of the canal, up to 1822, when it was opened, was L.905,258; and the
                    aggregate outlay to the first of May 1839, was no less than L.1,023,628.
                    Besides, the Commissioners have incurred a debt, including cash advanced by the
                    bank, and outstanding claims, of L.39,146. Nor has the income ever met the
                    expenditure. In the year ending on the first of May 1839, for example, the
                    expenditure was L.4170, whereas the income, though above the average, was only
                    L.2532. It has, therefore, become a question with government whether the
                    undertaking should be maintained or abandoned. The Lords of the Treasury,

                    minute investigation of the entire works, and to report. The report was
                    presented to the House of Commons in 1838; and a select Committee was appointed
                    to take the whole subject into consideration. The result of their investigations
                    was, a recommendation that steam tugs should be employed in the locks, so as to
                    ensure a speedy navigation, and that a sum not exceeding L.200,000 be placed at
                    the disposal of the government, to be expended in the repair and improvement of
                    the canal, under the authority of an act of Parliament, which should be procured
                    for the purpose.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See

                    situated in Argyleshire, and is intended to afford a communication between Loch
                    Gi!p and the Western Ocean, so as to avoid the difficult and circuitous passage
                    round the Mull of Cantyre. It was originally undertaken in 1793 by subscription
                    of share-holders; but the sum subscribed(L.108,000) being quite insufficient for
                    the completion of the work, the government advanced the money, and the canal was
                    transferred on mortgage to the Barons of Exchequer in Scotland. The management
                    has since 1817 been lodged in the hands of the Commissioners of the Caledonian
                    Canal. It is nine miles long, and twelve feet deep, admitting vessels of 200
                    tons burden. The income scarcely covers the expenditure.<note anchored="true"

                    sometimes called the Great Canal, though begun in 1768, was not finally
                    completed till 1790. The length from Grangemouth on the Forth to Bowling Bay on
                    the Clyde, is 35 miles, and, including the lateral branch to Port-Dundas,
                    Glasgow, 38 ½. Its depth is ten feet; and it has in all thirty-nine locks.
                    Though iron swift boats and other lighters ply upon it, its staple trade
                    consists in the transit of sailing vessels of 120 tons and under. The Edinburgh
                    and Glasgow Union Canal, which was finished in 1822, stretches from
                    Port-Hopetoun, Edinburgh, until it joins the Forth and Clyde Canal at
                    Port-Downie, near Falkirk, a distance of 31 ½ miles. Its depth is only five
                    feet, so that its traffic is quite limited. The Monkland Canal stretches from
                    Glasgow to Woodhall, about two miles south-east of Airdrie, a distance of twelve
                    miles, and communicates by a lateral branch with the Forth and Clyde Canal at
                    Port-Dundas. The Glasgow, Paisley, and Ardrossan Canal has not been completed;
                    indeed it is not now intended to complete it. The progress of railways seems
                    partially to supersede the use of canal communication. The canal in question has
                    been constructed from Port-Eglinton, near Glasgow, to the village of Johnstone,
                    a distance of eleven miles, and was opened in 1811. It was on this canal that
                    the experiment was made in rapid travelling by canals, demonstrating that it was
                    practicable for a properly constructed boat, carrying passengers and goods along
                    a canal, to go at a rate of nine or ten miles an hour, without injury to the
                    banks. These light boats are now common on canals suited for such travelling.
                    The Aberdeenshire Canal, completed in 1807, stretches from the harbour of
                    Aberdeen to Inventury. The length is 18 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 4</hi> miles, and the number of locks is seventeen.</p>
                <p>The first act obtained, in 1808, for a railway in Scotland, was for that between
                    Kilmarnock and Troon, a distance of 9 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles. The Monkland and Kirkintilloch railway connects
                    the rich coal and ironstone district of New and Old Monkland, and, within
                    fourteen miles of the city of Glasgow, with the Forth and Clyde Canal, near
                    Kirkintilloch. The Ballochney railway, which has been in operation for about ten
                    years, is merely an elongation of the last mentioned line, four miles eastward
                    into the interior. The Glasgow and Garnkirk railway stretches eight miles west
                    from Glasgow, till it communicates with the Monkland and Kirkintilloch line,
                    forming a direct communication with Glasgow, and avoiding the circuitous route
                    of that line. The Wishaw and Coltness railway, which is meant to connect the
                    Monkland and Kirkintilloch branch with the rich coal and ironstone beds of
                    Wishaw, Coltness, and Allanton, has not yet been completed, though the act was
                    passed in 1829. The Slamannan railway, which is in progress of construction, is
                    to extend from the eastern termination of the Ballochney line to the Union
                    Canal, within a mile of Linlithgow, a distance of 12 <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles. An act has been passed (1837) for
                    forming a branch to the town of Bathgate. The Pollock and Govan railway, which
                    was meant to connect these two places, which lye on the south of Glasgow, with
                    that city, an interval of three miles, is in the same unfinished state. The
                    Paisley and Renfrew railway, which extends from Paisley to the river Clyde at
                    Renfrew ferry, a distance of 3 ½ miles, was opened in 1837. The Glasgow,
                    Paisley, and Greenock railway is meant to connect Glasgow and Greenock by way of
                    Paisley. It runs nearly parallel with the Clyde, and is meant to be completed in
                    1840. The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock, and Ayr railway is intended to connect
                    these towns and the adjacent districts. The line from Glasgow to Paisley is
                    declared to be common to the latter line, and that of the Glasgow, Paisley, and
                    Greenock railway, and to be executed at the joint expense of both companies. The
                    Glasgow and Paisley railway is to send branches out to the different towns in
                    the district through which it passes. An act was obtained in 1838 for
                    constructing a railway between Edinburgh and Glasgow. The line is to run nearly
                    on a parallel with the Union Canal, past Ratho, Winchburgh, Linlithgow, and
                    Falkirk, to pass that canal near Port-Downie, and to proceed onward to Glasgow
                    by a line nearly parallel to the Great Canal. The distance will be forty-six
                    miles. The capital of the company is L.900,000. Twenty-nine miles of the line
                    have already been contracted for, and the work will be completed at farthest in
                    1842. The Edinburgh and Dalkeith railway was opened in 1832. It extends to
                    Dalhousie Mains on the South Esk, but a private branch has been carried over
                    that river by a viaduct, and extends southwards for upwards of a mile. The
                    Dalkeith line is about to be carried over the North Esk, in order to connect
                    extensive coal fields in that quarter with the city of Edinburgh. There are also
                    branches to Leith and Fisherrow. On this railway upwards of 100,000 tons of
                    goods, and 300,000 passengers are annually conveyed. The Edinburgh, Leith, and
                    Newhaven railway is only meant to extend 2 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi
                    rend="subscript"> 2</hi> miles. It is to commence at Canal Street, at the cast
                    end of Princes Street gardens, and proceed by a tunnel of 2800 feet, or rather
                    more than a fifth of the whole line, under St. Andrews Street, St. Andrews
                    Square, Duke Street, Drummond Place, &amp;c. to the foot of Scotland Street, and
                    thence to Newhaven in nearly a straight line, with a branch along the north side
                    of the Water of Leith, to the wet docks at Leith. The work has been begun, but
                    when it will be completed is uncertain. If the terminus of the line were to be
                    united with that of the Edinburgh and Glasgow railway, much advantage would
                    accrue to both speculations. But, according to act of Parliament, a mile
                    intervenes at present between the dépôts of the two. The Dundee and Newtyle
                    railway is eleven miles in length, but branches are in progress to Cupar-Angus
                    and to Glammis. There are on the line three inclined planes, and a tunnel of 340
                    yards. The Dundee and Forfar railway was opened in</p>

                <p>About the middle of the seventeenth century, the lands of Scotland were valued,
                    with a view to ascertain what proportion of the land-tax and others should be

                    2,489,725 acres of pasture, will be L.4,979,450. But there still remains
                    14,000,000 acres of mountain pasture, waste land, and plantations,<note

                    than 950,000 acres.</p></note> which, at an average rent of 3s. per acre, will
                    be L.2,100,000. Hence the total annual value of the land produce in Scotland
                    will be,</p>

                <p>Total,.... L.20,435,325</p>
                <p>This is the value of the gross produce of the soil. Most of the land is rented by
                    tenants, only about a tenth part being supposed to be farmed by the landowners.
                    The exact amount of the rental of Scotland cannot be known. The rental for 1810,
                    including mines, fisheries, quarries, and the like,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>’ General Report, i. p. 123.</p></note> was
                    ascertained to be L.4,851,404; and it is supposed that, though considerable
                    variations have taken place in different districts, the rental of Scotland
                    continues at nearly the same amount; for although many of the rents contracted
                    for, during the last years of the late war, have been greatly reduced, yet
                    others, from the falling in of the older leases, have been proportionally
                    advanced. As the common duration of the lease in Scotland is 19 years, the
                    average term of the current leases must be between 9 and 10 years; so that half
                    the leases current in the beginning of 1810 must have been entered into in the
                    first year of the century, at a period previous to any great enhancement of land
                    having taken place. Hence it is that we regard the rental of 1810 and of the
                    present time as nearly equal to each other. It is conjectured by an eminent
                    authority, that the rental of the 14,000,000 acres of mountain pasture,
                    including wood and waste lands, does not exceed L.850,000, or, in other words,
                    that it averages 1 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 7</hi>
                    s. per acre, whilst he estimates the rental of the arable portion at an average
                    of 16s. an acre.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Statistical Account of the British Empire, p. 539.</p></note> Rent, we may
                    here remark, has advanced more in Scotland during the last seventy years, than
                    perhaps in any old settled country during a similar period. The entire rental of
                    Scotland is not supposed to have exceeded L.l,000,000, or L.1,200,000, in 1770.
                    In 1795, it is believed to have been at least L.2,000,000; and since that time
                    it has a good deal more than doubled.</p>
                <p>It is here worthy of remark, that both the law and the practice of Scotland are
                    favourable to agricultural enterprise. What in England are termed “tenants at
                    will,” or tenants without a lease, are unknown in this portion of the empire.
                    Leases in Scotland may be said to be universal, extending to 15, 19, or 21
                    years. It was not uncommon, indeed, about fifty years ago, and before that time,
                    to give liferents, or leases for twice nineteen years, or even longer, a
                    circumstance highly favourable to enterprise on the part of the tenant. With the
                    exception of some districts in the Highlands and Islands, the system of small
                    farms has been abandoned, and has given way to farms of great extent, rented by
                    persons of intelligence and capital. There are no tithes. Poor-rates are
                    entirely unknown in about three-fourths of the parishes of Scotland; and where
                    this assessment does exist, it is of comparatively trifling amount. Besides, so
                    large are the farms, that, exclusive of owners who cultivate their own property
                    or portions of it, there are supposed to be only about 40,000 tenants in
                    Scotland. And as farms are large, so they cannot be divided or sublet without
                    the consent of the landlord. This consent is seldom or never granted; so that in
                    point of fact no such subdivision ever takes place. A lease, moreover, is
                    heritable; and on the death of a tenant, it is not parcelled out amongst his
                    children, but descends entire to his oldest son, or heir at law. All these
                    circumstances combined afford great encouragement to agricultural improvement
                    and enterprise.<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=817"

                <p>In a remote, and what may be termed the aboriginal period of our judicial annals,
                    the king was chief justice of the kingdom; and, with his council., made progress
                    through the realm for the administration of public justice. At that time,
                    indeed, the king executed in person the principal duties of government; and it
                    was not till comparatively recent times that the different departments of the
                    state began to be exclusively assigned to distinct and responsible officers.</p>
                <p>As late as the middle of the fifteenth century, an act was passed, in which “the
                    three estates concluded, that our sovereign lord ride through the realm
                    incontinent, after there be word sent to his council., where any rebellion,
                    slaughter, huming, reif, or thieft happens; and there to call the sheriff of the
                    shire, and ere the king depart out of that shire, to set remeid of the harm, or
                    gif ony sik sall happen to be done, whether the default be in the officers or in
                    the doers, to be punished by the king; the quhilk conclusion and ordinance, all
                    the barons of common assent and consent are obliged to assist baith with their
                    power in bodies and gudes.” This act was passed in the third parliament of king
                    James the Second; and in the fifth parliament of his successor, when the courts
                    of justice were regulated by statute, there was a special proviso to the effect
                    that, “nevertheless, it sall be lawful to the kingis highness to take decision
                    of ony matter that comes before him, at his compleasance, like as it was wont to
                    be of before,” 1469, c. 26. Two centuries afterwards, Charles the Second claimed
                    a like power and prerogative; and “in a dutiful and humble recognisance
                    thereof,” the estates of parliament declared, that notwithstanding of any
                    jurisdictions or offices whatsoever, “his sacred majesty may, by himself or any
                    commissionated by him, take cognisance and decision of any cases or causes he
                    pleases,” all government and jurisdiction within the kingdom originally residing
                    in him, 1681, c. 18. Such a right, however, formed one of the grievances
                    complained of at the Revolution; and since that event it has been deemed a
                    settled part of the constitutional law of the land, that the king has committed
                    all judicial power to the judges, and cannot himself administer justice in the
                    courts.</p>
                <p>The justiciar <hi rend="italic">(justiciarius)</hi> was anciently the king’s
                    more,<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=818"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0818-0754"/> immediate and principal officer. He seems to have
                    been 'derived from Normandy; and agreeably to the mixed constitution of that
                    country, he was here, as in England, <hi rend="italic">caput legis et
                    militioe,</hi> at the head both of the law and of the military force of the
                    kingdom. He accompanied the king in his progresses through the realm, or
                    represented him in his absence; and he had thus powers and jurisdiction as
                    universal in their nature as they were unlimited in extent. We find,
                    accordingly, repeated instances of the military prowess as well as judicial
                    firmness of our early justiciars; and, not to mention other instances, in the
                    middle of the thirteenth century, Durward, when thwarted in the project he had
                    conceived of securing the throne to his descendants, joined Henry the Third in
                    France, and served in his army, till, by the influence of the English monarch,
                    he was re-instated in his high office of lord justiciar.</p>
                <p>It does not appear, however, that the justiciar ever became here the formidable
                    officer which he proved to be in England, where he was at one time a terror both
                    to the king and to his subjects. Various circumstances concurred to limit his
                    power. The chief of these, no doubt, was the influence of his adversary, the
                    Lord Chancellor, as the head and organ of the ecclesiastics; but much also was
                    owing to the early partition of the office into a justiciary of ancient
                    Scotland, or the territory north of the Forth, and of Lothian, or the territory
                    south of the Forth. This partition of the office, indeed, is observed in the
                    very earliest notice of our justiciars. The series begins in the reign of
                    Malcolm the Fourth, and from that time we have distinct and separate justiciars
                    for Scotland and for Lothian. In neither of these was Galloway comprehended,
                    that district enjoying its own peculiar laws and customs;<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stat. Alex. II. c. § 1. fin.</p></note> but
                    in 1258 it also got a separate justiciar. This state of matters continued till
                    the invasion of Scotland by Edward the First.</p>
                <p>In 1296, Sir William de Ormesby, a justice of the common pleas, and justice in
                    ayre in England, was constituted lord justiciar of Scotland by Edward, who also
                    associated with him William de Mortimer, an English justice of assize; and the
                    next year the same king made Roger de Skotre, an English lawyer, justiciar of
                    Galloway. But ip 1299, John earl of Buchan was <hi rend="italic">justiciarius
                    Scotioe;</hi> he was son of the last regular justiciar of Scotland, Alexander
                    earl of Buchan, who was upwards of thirty years in office previous to his death
                    in the year 1289. In 1305, however, Edward again put down the Scotch; and
                    thereupon distributed the kingdom into four districts, appointing for each
                    district two justices, an Englishman and a Scotchman. These officers were of the
                    nature of the English justices of assize; and when we take into consideration
                    the nature of the appointments which were at the same time made in the counties,
                    the object in view cannot be mistaken. Edward evidently contemplated putting the
                    whole island under one judicial system, which had shortly before been introduced
                    into England, namely, that of having annual or temporary sheriffs with a limited
                    jurisdiction, and confining the law business of the country to a few courts and
                    judges; a system very different from that which previously existed both in
                    England and Scotland, where the great object was to bring justice home to every
                    man’s door in permanent local courts. The project, however, was stopped by
                    Edward’s death; the justiciars of Scotland and Lothian were then displaced, and
                    permanent sheriffs restored. Robert the Second also restored to the people of
                    Galloway their ancient laws.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Rob. I. c. 35.</p></note> Matters appear to have generally
                    continued in this state till the disastrous battle of Flodden. On that event,
                    which united all classes of the community, the office of lord justiciar, or, as
                    he was now styled, lord justice general, (in contradistinction to the special
                    justiciars now frequently appointed, as well for particular trials as for
                    particular places and districts,) came into the hands of a single individual,
                    and comprehended the whole kingdom. The High Court of Justiciary also began to
                    be settled at Edinburgh, and from that time commence the regular series of its
                    books of adjournal.</p>
                <p>The Justiciar or Justice-General might now have become formidable; but
                    circumstances again concurred to reduce his power. The office fell into the
                    noble family of Argyll, where it continued hereditary for a century; the Court
                    of Session was established with a universal civil jurisdiction; and as that
                    court was co-ordinate with it on the land, the admiral of Scotland came to be
                    co-ordinate with it on the seas. By statute 1587, c.82, eight senators or
                    advocates of the College of Justice, were appointed as justiciar-deputes for the
                    different quarters into which the realm was then divided; and by 1672, c. 16,
                    instead of the justice-deputes, five lords of session were constituted
                    commissioners of justiciary, along withthelord justice-general,and the
                    justice-clerk, which latter was now made vice-president of the court. By statute
                    1681, c. 16, too, the high admiral was declared the king’s lieutenant and
                    justice-general on the seas. By a recent act, however, the Court of Justiciary
                    re-acquired a jurisdiction in crimes at sea; and by Will. IV. c. 69, which
                    entirely abolished the court of admiralty, the office of lord justice-general
                    was made to devolve on, and remain with that of lord-president of the Court of
                    Session. The effect of this seems to have been to place the justice-general at
                    the head of the administration of the law; and thus, by a singular revolution,
                    to restore him, after the lapse of three hundred years, to his former situation
                    as lord chief-justice of Scotland.</p>
                <p>It may, in conclusion, be remarked here, that in the Court of Justiciary, which,
                    being a superior or at least co-ordinate tribunal, was but indirectly affected
                    by the changes in the law introduced by the Court of Session, several usages of
                    our most ancient common law have been preserved to this day. The court meets
                    about eleven o’clock, which was <hi rend="italic">the hour of cause</hi> of old,
                    (1587, c. 87) whereas the Court of Session, in direct contrast, rose at that
                    time, meeting, agreeably to the early hours of the ecclesiastics, at eight in
                    the morning, (1537, c. 49). So also, jury trial, when laid aside by the other
                    courts, continued here; the verdict is still by a majority; and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">assizes oath,</hi> we may trace at once the original character of
                    a jury as an inquest of the vicinage, and also the rhythmical measures of our
                    old legal formulae. The circuits of the Court of Justiciary were arranged in
                    their present form by the act 1587, c. 82. Previous to that time the justiciar
                    made a progress through the realm, from shire to shire, successively; but, by
                    the above act, the realm was divided into four districts, or quarters. The
                    present circuits are, besides the Lothians or home circuit, the southern,
                    western, and northern circuits. The assize towns of the south, are Jedburgh,
                    Dumfries, and Ayr; those of the west, Glasgow, Inverary, and Stirling; those of
                    the north, Perth, Aberdeen, and Inverness.</p>
                <p>The Court of Session, that is to say, the first court so called, was erected in
                    1425, the year following King James the First’s return from his long captivity
                    in England. It was composed of the “chancellor, and with him certain discreet
                    persons of the three estates, chosen and depute by the king and was to have a
                    like jurisdiction as that exercised by the king and his council. It was,
                    however, but of short duration; for, on the king’s death, or rather on that of
                    Bishop Wardlaw of St. Andrews, by whose influence it was in all likelihood
                    erected, Bishop Cameron, the chancellor, was removed from office, and the court
                    of the session expired. Attempts were afterwards made to revive it by Bishop
                    Horse-wood, secretary to king James II.; and, thirty years afterwards, by Bishop
                    Elphinstone, whose zeal for the establishment of<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=819" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0819-0755"/>
                    the Roman law is well known. Accordingly in 1503, the court of daily council.,
                    which was essentially a revival of the former court of the session, was
                    established by means of Bishop Elphinstone. And at length, whilst the kingdom
                    was yet in a state of distraction from the fatal losses at Flodden, the present
                    Court of Session or College of Justice was instituted; and of the numerous
                    attempts of the clergy to establish the Roman law as the common law of the land,
                    this was the last and most successful.</p>
                <p>According to the simple principles of our old law, all suits originated by
                    plaint, claim, or summary application to the judge, setting forth the cause of
                    action; and the judge was bound of common right to administer justice therein.
                    But afterwards, a maxim was introduced that the judges were substitutes of the
                    crown, and consequently should take cognisance only of what was specially
                    referred to them. Brieves or mandatory letters from the king to the judges were
                    then invented; and the chancel of the royal chapel became the great <hi
                    rend="italic">officina justitiae,</hi> the shop or mint where the king’s writs
                    were framed, and sold out to parties injured, according to the exigency of the
                    case. These writs issued out from the chancel or chancery until the institution
                    of the College of Justice, when the chancellor and clergy, who were the
                    principal judges there, began a mint or shop of their own in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Bill chamber</hi> of the court, so called because the brieves, or,
                    as they are here termed <hi rend="italic">letters,</hi> issue out, not on the
                    oral application of the party, but on his “bill” or written supplication. This
                    course of proceeding was adopted from the court of Rome; and it is observable,
                    that in both cases the language employed is sometimes identical. Thus, when the
                    request or prayer of the bill is granted, the judgment is, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Fiat ut petitur,</hi> which are the very words used by the Pope in the like
                    case; and tire odd phrase, “Finds the letters orderly proceeded,” is but a
                    verbal translation of the <hi rend="italic">Male appellatum et bene
                    processum</hi> of the papal court. The names of the letters are also the same,
                    letters of advocation ion, suspension, and reduction, being equally well known
                    in both places; and letters of horning, caption, and relaxation, have their
                    papal origin impressed upon them. The comparison might be carried through our
                    whole process to its minutest technicality, and also to the style and habit of
                    the judges. After the manner of the ecclesiastical tribunals, too, the judges
                    deliberated in secret conclave with shut doors, parties and their counsel, and
                    all others being removed (1537, c. 66); and there was no report of the judges’
                    opinions, or of the reasons of the judgment, but only of the vote or sentence.
                    At the Revolution, however, the court was thrown open; but so powerful is custom
                    over all men, that to this day the great body of the practitioners continue to
                    walk the Outer House.</p>
                <p>In modem times the court has been altered in almost every particular; its
                    constitution and jurisdiction, the number of the judges, the distribution of the
                    business, and the forms of proceeding. The machinery was indeed bad, but the
                    spirit which pervaded it was worse; and the best antidote to this would perhaps
                    be the full force of public opinion, that is, perfect publicity, not merely of
                    hearing and judgment, but of every step in the administration of justice.</p>
                <p>According to its first institution, the court consisted of a president and
                    fourteen ordinary lords, half of the temporal estate and half spiritual, of
                    which the president likewise was one. The Lord Chancellor, who was also an
                    ecclesiastic, was made principal of the college, as it was termed, and as such
                    had a vote with the judges; and there was a reserved power to the king to
                    appoint, at his pleasure, three or four extraordinary lords, a power which the
                    crown always exercised, and also sometimes greatly abused. It was the
                    Reformation which gave the first blow to the court. From that event it began to
                    lose its ecclesiastical, which had been its earliest and most distinguishing
                    feature. The Revolution followed, and opened up to the public eye the heretofore
                    secret tribunal. And at the union with England it ceased to be supreme, though
                    this last peculiarity, and that by which <hi rend="italic">the Lords</hi> became
                    so formidable in the country, was long struggled for, and is yet perhaps but
                    imperfectly given up by the court. These important changes, however, affected
                    the spirit and character of the court, rather than its external form, which
                    remained much as it was before. But they prepared the way for alterations there
                    too; and during the last thirty years, a great number of public statutes have
                    been passed, altering the details of the court, and otherwise regulating the
                    administration of justice throughout the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In 1808, the commencement of the period just referred to, the court was formed
                    into two divisions; or, in effect, two communicating but equal and independent
                    courts. The reason assigned for this change, was the greatly increased number of
                    lawsuits from the great extension of agriculture, commerce, manufactures, and
                    population, and the consequent multiplication of transactions in Scotland. There
                    is every ground to believe, however, that much of the supposed business was
                    caused by the tedious methods of proof and written pleadings adopted by the
                    court, and its endless judgments and rehearings; for in the degree in which
                    these have been abolished, the court has been able to absorb and dispatch the
                    business of the other superior courts, and still to allow a decrease in the
                    number of its judges. These are now only thirteen in all. Each division is
                    composed of four judges; the Lord President, who is properly head of the whole
                    court, presiding in the First Division, and the Lord Justice-Clerk presiding in
                    the Second. The remaining judges sit separately in the Outer House, as Lords
                    Ordinary. This term was originally given to all the judges under the president,
                    and they served in the Outer House by rotation; but amongst other recent
                    changes, the five junior judges were at first made permanent Lords Ordinary, as
                    attached to a particular division of the Inner House, but now without any such
                    relation. The junior or youngest Lord Ordinary of all is Ordinary on the Bills,
                    and has a peculiar class of cases assigned to him. But it is to be observed,
                    that from him, and from the other Ordinaries, an appeal lies, or a proceeding in
                    the nature of an appeal, to the Inner House; which, besides this appellate, has
                    also some original jurisdiction. It is not necessary to add, that there is much
                    imperfection in this whole system of judicature. There appears to have been
                    little unity of design in its formation; there is considerable complexity in its
                    actual working, and there is no great satisfaction in its results.<note

                <p>Let us now turn our attention to the local courts throughout the kingdom.</p>
                <p>In early times the realm was divided into provinces, clanships, or counties, in
                    each of which was a maormor, maor, mayor or mair, as the king’s executive and
                    ministerial officer; and in every county or province there were divers judges,
                    each exercising judicial functions. The provinces and judicial districts of
                    those times, however, are now but imperfectly known; and, as might be expected,
                    the series of mayors and judges cannot by any means be made out. With re-<pb
                    break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=820"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0820-0756"/> spect to the latter, viz., the Celtic judge, we
                    have not traced him to a later period than the beginning of the fourteenth
                    century. He was in all probability extinguished during king Edward’s invasion of
                    Scotland in the unhappy times which followed on the death of king Alexander the
                    Third. The sheriff was then universally established; and as that officer
                    engrossed to himself the functions both of the judge and mair, the former
                    disappeared entirely from our annals, whilst the latter gradually degenerated
                    into the sheriff's officer, with whom, accordingly, he is, to the present day,
                    found mixed up in some of the northern counties.</p>
                <p>The most ancient sheriff was certainly the <hi rend="italic">comes</hi> or earl.
                    There is no direct evidence to that effect, however; and from a remote time, the
                    officer so called was the <hi rend="italic">vice-cornes.</hi> The office was not
                    a century in existence amongst us, when, falling into the hands of the great
                    local proprietors, it began to descend to heirs with the paternal estate. The
                    sheriffship of Ayr, which was erected in the year 1221, out of the bailiaries of
                    Kyle, Carrick, and Cuningham, was from the first hereditary. It is not
                    surprising that the hereditary <hi rend="italic">vice-cornes</hi> should soon
                    cense to perform in person the duties of his office; these were accordingly
                    devolved on a deputy or <hi rend="italic">sub-vice-comes.</hi> The earliest
                    officer of this sort we have met with, is <hi rend="italic">Alan de Pilch,</hi>
                    or Alan of the hairy garment, sub-vice-comes de Inverness, temp. Robert I.;<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Robertson’s Index, p.
                    29.</p></note> but sheriff-deputes are mentioned much earlier,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stat. Will. c. 14. Stat.
                    Alex. II. c. 14.</p></note> and to such an extent was the abuse of deputation
                    carried, that in some counties, that of Cromarty for instance, the district was
                    partitioned into various deputy-sheriffships, and individuals appointed, such as
                    officers of the army, medical men, and others, in situations of life perfectly
                    incompatible with the due discharge of the office. The office also in many
                    instances became hereditary; and another was required to execute the active
                    duties of the place, or <hi rend="italic">pro-sub-vice-cornes.</hi> Thus, at the
                    time of the jurisdiction act in 1747, there were in most or all of the counties,
                    omitting the <hi rend="italic">comes,</hi> count or earl, a sheriff-principal or
                    high sheriff, and sheriff-depute, and a sheriff-substitute. All these were
                    continued by the above act; but the judicial powers were confined to the two
                    last, whose duties and qualifications have also been repeatedly regulated. It
                    would undoubtedly have been more agreeable to principle, however, to have
                    abolished offices which grew out of the abuses of the times, and assigned to
                    every sheriff a reasonable district in respect of extent and population, with
                    constant residence therein, and the exercise of judicial functions only. In
                    determining the number, character, and situation of courts in a country, the
                    great problem evidently is, so to distribute them as to secure two things,
                    namely, to bring justice home to every man’s door, and to mature a sound and
                    fixed system of jurisprudence. In England, the latter object appears to have
                    been principally regarded since the days of Edward the First, before whose time
                    England and Scotland were equally distinguished for their local courts. But
                    what, we may ask, avails the best system of law, if it be remote or difficult of
                    access? The end is in such case sacrificed to the means; and a multitude of
                    petty courts, with a few practitioners in each, would prove the ruin not only of
                    the legal profession, but of the law itself.</p>
                <p>The sheriff-principal, or high sheriff, is lord lieutenant of his county, and
                    appointed at pleasure by the crown. The sheriff-depute, so called, is also
                    appointed by the crown; but he is quite independent of the high sheriff. He must
                    be an advocate of at least three years’ standing; he holds his office during
                    life, or good behaviour; and he receives a salary, varying, according to the
                    shire, from L.350 to L.1200 a-year. The sheriff-substitute must be of the
                    profession of the law, though not necessarily a member of the bar. He is named
                    by the sheriff-depute of the shire, but paid by the crown, and is otherwise an
                    independent officer. In every county there is a high sheriff or lord lieutenant.
                    The same may be said of the sheriff-depute, except as to the united shires of
                    Clackmannan and Kinross, Elgin and Nairn, Ross and Cromarty. Ross, Sutherland,
                    and Caithness, were originally parts of the great shire of Inverness; but in the
                    seventeenth century they became disjoined, and were erected into separate
                    shires. By the jurisdiction act, however, Ross was put under the same sheriff
                    with the ancient shire of Cromarty, and has continued so ever since. Sutherland
                    and Caithness were then also re-united; but in 1806 these were again separated.
                    Kinross was originally part of Fife; but it was afterwards separated, then
                    re-united, and in 1807 disjoined again, and united to Clackmannan. With respect
                    to the sheriff-substitute, in every shire there is at least one; but Edinburgh,
                    Fife, Forfar, Perth, Renfrew, and Sutherland, have each two, Kirkcudbright and
                    Argyle have each three, Lanark and Inverness have each four, and in one of the
                    districts of Ross there is a sort of assistant substitute.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of the county courts was originally most extensive; and as to
                    civil suits in particular, there seems to have been scarcely any limitation. It
                    was the policy of the Court of Session, however, to make itself the great law
                    court of the kingdom; and as it gradually absorbed the civil jurisdiction of the
                    justiciary, so, by a bold stratagem, it stripped the sheriff of all power to
                    decide upon questions of real property. Such questions were formerly tried under
                    the brieve of right, a judicial writ so named, because issued to try what was
                    esteemed the highest right, that of property in land; and it is clear that this
                    brieve was <hi rend="italic">in viridi observantia,</hi> and competent to
                    sheriffs, till within a very few years of the institution of the Court of
                    Session. This is clear from the act 1503, c. 95, which was passed to regulate
                    it; and it is familiarly referred to by the poet Dunbar, in his Dance of the
                    Seven Deadly Sins, where, speaking of the occupations of the damned, he
                    says,</p>
                <p>Yet the Court of Session was scarcely established, when it boldly adjudged this
                    brieve “nocht to have bene, nor yet to be thir mony yeires in use ;”<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Skene <hi rend="italic"
                    >voce</hi> Breve de recto.</p></note> and having thus, by repressing the writ,
                    ousted the sheriff of his real jurisdiction, Boon took it to itself
                    exclusively,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Bishop of
                    Aberdeen <hi rend="italic">v</hi>. Ogilvy, 3d July 1563.</p></note> by letters
                    prepared for the court in its own Bill-chamber. The sheriff, however, still
                    continued competent to possessory actions; and by a recent statute, his
                    jurisdiction has even extended to all actions and proceedings relative to
                    nuisance or damages, arising from an undue exercise of the right of property,
                    and also to questions touching the constitution or exercise of real or judicial
                    servitudes, which is so far a restoration of his ancient powers. Besides the
                    ordinary jurisdiction, civil and criminal, of the county court, the sheriff is
                    empowered to decide summarily in questions of debt, when the sum in dispute does
                    not exceed eight pounds. These small debt courts were instituted in 1825, with a
                    view to extend and improve the like jurisdiction, which had been conferred upon
                    justices of the peace about thirty years before. The summary redress which such
                    courts afford is of the greatest benefit to trade and to good neighbourhood, in
                    consequence of the little sacrifice of time, money, and feeling they require;
                    and they are accordingly now extensively established, not only in this<pb

                <p>The courts we have now adverted to comprehend the public and general courts of
                    the kingdom, which have a public and general jurisdiction; but besides these,
                    there are, or rather were, some whose jurisdiction was limited to particular
                    sorts of causes only. We allude to the Court of Exchequer, and the
                    ecclesiastical and maritime courts.</p>
                <p>With respect to the first of these, the old Scotch court, composed of the
                    treasurer and lords auditors of exchequer, was superseded at the union by a
                    Court of Exchequer, composed of a lord chief-baron and four puisne barons; and
                    in addition to certain ministerial powers continued from the old court, it had
                    the like authority, jurisdiction, and course of procedure as the Court of
                    Exchequer in England, after which generally it was modelled. It was an absurdly
                    large and expensive establishment. It had comparatively nothing to do; and as
                    the judges might be, and some of them commonly were, English barristers, it
                    never could be opened up, like the exchequer of England, to the ordinary law
                    business of the country. Accordingly the barons were gradually reduced, and the
                    business is now transacted by a lord of session sitting as a judge in
                    exchequer.</p>
                <p>The Commission of Teinds, which was first erected at the Reformation, was in like
                    manner remodelled at the Union. It was formerly vested with powers for the
                    planting of churches, assigning and modifying stipends, and the valuation and
                    sale of teinds. But by a recent statute, all actions for the valuation or sale
                    of teinds, all actions of suspension or reduction of localities, and all actions
                    of declarator or reduction connected with teinds, must be brought and decided in
                    the Court of Session.</p>
                <p>In times of popery, causes ecclesiastical were tried by the archdeacon’s
                    official, the bishop’s commissary, and the auditor or official principal of the
                    province; from which last an appeal lay to the pope, who generally determined
                    the matter by commission. But at the Reformation, commissaries named by tne
                    crown were appointed in every commissariat; and a Commissary Court, with
                    original and appellate jurisdiction, was also established at Edinburgh, of which
                    Sir James Balfour, the former official of St. Andrews, within the archdeaconry
                    of Lothian, was the first chief-judge. The commissary courts continued till
                    recent times, when the office of the local commissaries was abolished, and soon
                    afterwards the Commissary Court of Edinburgh, their powers and jurisdiction
                    being transferred to the Court of</p>
                <p>Session, and, in as far as regards confirmation pf testaments, to the sheriff or
                    county courts.</p>
                <p>The jurisdiction of the Admiralty cannot perhaps be traced to an earlier period
                    than the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the office of lord justiciar,
                    who was of old the supreme judge in all manner of causes, became hereditary in
                    the noble family of Argyll, and the authority of the Admiralty was also long
                    very limited. It was confined to seafaring causes, and in these it had no
                    exclusive jurisdiction.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    and part ii. p. 83; and A. S., 16th January 1554.</p></note> The earliest
                    collection of maritime laws in Scotland, is that contained in Balfour’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Practicks,</hi> and entitled “The Sea Laws, collectit furth of the
                    Actis of Parliament, the prac-tiques and lawis of Oberon, and the lawis of
                    Wisbeig, and the constitutions of Francois, king of France, 1543, 1557.” This we
                    conceive was the <hi rend="italic">Lib. Kintor.</hi> referred to by Balfour, and
                    the work of David Kintore, then judge of the Admiralty. Towards the end of the
                    same century, Alexander King, advocate, filled the same office; and from the
                    date of his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Maritime Law,</hi> apparently the
                    first regular treatise on that branch of jurisprudence in Great Britain, the
                    court of Admiralty rose into importance. By the act 1609, c. 15, it was declared
                    a sovereign judicatory, and letters of homing were allowed on its decrees; and
                    the reputation of the court being afterwards sustained by a succession of
                    eminent judges, such as Acheson of Glencairney, Roberton of Beidlay, and Lyon of
                    Carse, all of whom became lords of Session, it began to extend its jurisdiction
                    generally to mercantile, and not, as before, to mere seafaring causes. The above
                    act was then ratified by that of 1681, c. 16, by which the ground of the court
                    was farther cleared and enlarged; the admiral being now also styled the high
                    admiral, and declared the king’s lieutenant and justice-general on the high
                    seas. By a later statute, provision was made for a stated salary of L.100 to the
                    judge of the Admiralty. This was renewed by the act 1704, c. 8; and by 26 Geo.
                    III. c. 47, the salary was made L.400, which was afterwards raised to L.800
                    a-year. The court, however, did not long enjoy this flow of prosperity By the 6
                    Geo. IV. c. 120, jurisdiction in prize and capture was withdrawn, and vested in
                    the Admiralty of England; and by a later statute the court was altogether
                    abolished, and its remaining jurisdiction transferred to the Court of Session,
                    and Sheriff courts; the High Court of Justiciary having also previously
                    re-acquired, as of old, a co-ordinate jurisdiction in crimes at sea.</p>
                <p>An ancient species of exempt territory was that of <hi rend="italic"
                    >sanctuary.</hi> The first of the sort were probably churches; and<pb break="no"

                    in regard to them we find a rescript of Pope Innocent III. to the king of
                    Scots,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Decret. Greg. 46
                    3. Tit. 49. c. 6.</p></note> and thereupon the statute Alex. II. c. 6, which is
                    among the earliest regulations on the subject in the Scotch law. There were of
                    old divers sanctuaries, or, as they were termed, <hi rend="italic">girths,</hi>
                    (1469, c. 35; 1535, c. 23; 1555, c. 31), and mostly ecclesiastical; there being
                    a constant rivalry at all times between the sovereign power and the
                    ecclesiastical. But the only one now in use, is the sanctuary of Holyrood,
                    which, besides usage, has two main foundations, namely, a religious house, and a
                    royal palace, especially the former, the precincts being usually called the
                    sanctuary of Holyroodhouse, and the court there the Abbey court. The
                    jurisdiction of the place is administered by a bailie, who holds a court for
                    debt, and other civil obligations, where the debtor dwells within the
                    precincts.</p>
                <p>Regalities were another species of exempt territory. They were rights of
                    exclusive power and jurisdiction, civil and criminal, real and personal, granted
                    by the crown to the higher nobility;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">* Regales,</hi> Cod. Theod. vii. 1,
                    9.</p></note> and though the impolicy of such grants had long been perceived,
                    yet they were not altogether abolished till the passing of the jurisdiction act,
                    in the middle of last century. By 1455, c. 43, it was enacted that all
                    regalities in the king’s hands should be annexed to the royalty and made subject
                    to the king’s courts and officers. It was about the date of that act that the
                    great district of Kirkcudbright fell to the crown by the forfeiture of its lord;
                    and a <hi rend="italic">senes-challis</hi> being thereupon appointed, it has
                    ever since remained the stewartry of Kirkcudbright. But neither this nor the
                    islands of Orkney and Zetland, which were also erected into a stewartry,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>• See 1669, c. 13.</p></note>
                    differs materially from a shire; each having a court perfectly of the nature of
                    a sheriff or county court. Besides these, there were other stewartries, such as
                    Strath-em and Menteith in Perthshire, and Annandale in Dumfries; but by the
                    jurisdiction act, they merged into their respective shires.</p>
                <p>Burghs form yet another species of exempt territory; the principal character of a
                    burgh being its separate jurisdiction and independent government, but upon
                    reasons altogether different from either sanctuaries or regalities. They arise
                    neither from superstition nor princes’ favours. They have their origin in the
                    wants and social tendencies of our nature; they are the chosen seats of
                    civilization and the arts of life; and the distinction between them and shires
                    pervades the entire political constitution of the country. There are three sorts
                    of burghs, namely, burghs of barony, burghs of regality, and burghs of royalty
                    or royal burghs; and in establishing these last, it would seem to have been the
                    general policy of government to divide the realm into districts, in each of
                    which a royal burgh was placed. Several of the burghs are counties of
                    themselves, or counties corporate, such as Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, Aberdeen,
                    and Inverness; and these obviously contain within themselves all the elements of
                    government and judicature. But it has unfortunately happened, that none of the
                    burgh courts has kept pace with the advance of intelligence, the progress of
                    trade, or the increase of commercial transactions. Justice continues to be
                    administered there just as it was centuries ago. The consequence is, that the
                    peculiar feature of the burghs as independent jurisdictions has in many cases
                    given way; the burgh courts have been forsaken for the sheriff and justice of
                    peace courts; and it seems to have become a public question of policy, whether
                    they should not be altogether abolished. The same causes, however, which gave
                    origin to burghs, remain; and therefore it would seem to be the wiser policy to
                    improve the burgh courts, rather than to abolish them; to improve them, by
                    relieving the magistrates of all, or at least the more important judicial
                    duties, and to devolve these upon fixed and qualified judges.</p>
                <p>The superintendence of the royal burghs was in the king’s chamberlain, who held
                    <hi rend="italic">ogres,</hi> or itinerant courts, at which the magistrates and
                    burgesses of burghs were bound to give attendance, and where he heard and
                    determined all charges made against them. He was also in use from the earliest
                    times, to hold, in the southern part of the kingdom, courts of four boroughs;
                    which were so called because composed of delegates from the four burghs,
                    originally of Edinburgh, Stirling, Berwick, and Roxburgh, but afterwards of
                    Edinburgh, Stirling, Lanark, and Linlithgow. These delegates assembled before
                    the chamberlain, and formed for appeals from the chamberlain ayres, and the
                    different burgh courts, a tribunal which was to burgesses what the high court of
                    parliament was to the other inhabitants of the kingdom, the last and highest
                    court of appeal. The northern burghs had been long under a peculiar government
                    of their own. They formed a sort of Hanseatic league; for as early as the reign
                    of William the Lyon, a royal charter was granted to the king’s burghers <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> Aberdeen and of Moray, and all beyond the Grampians, to
                    hold their free “ansum” or hanse, as freely, quietly, fully, and honourably, as
                    their predecessors had done in the time of the granter’s royal grandfather.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Kennedy's Annals of Aberdeen,
                    vol. i. p. 8.</p></note> In the beginning of the fifteenth century, a court of
                    four boroughs was holden at Stirling, where it was resolved that deputies from
                    each of the royal burghs south of the Spey should convene yearly to consider and
                    conclude on all matters affecting the commonweal of the royal burghs, their
                    liberty and court. This convention was in all likelihood formed in imitation of
                    the northern Hanse. The inconvenience of having two separate yet similar
                    assemblies in the kingdom, however, must have been quickly felt; and, at the
                    same time, the ease and propriety of uniting them, and thus assimilating the
                    regimen of all the burghs, obvious. Accordingly, in the end of the same century,
                    an act of parliament was passed, (1487, c. 3.) appointing deputies from all the
                    royal burghs, “<hi rend="italic">baith north and south"</hi> to meet in
                    convention yearly, thus forming the convention of royal burghs which has been
                    ever since continued. The place of meeting was fixed at Inverkeithing, on the
                    north of the Forth, probably from its central situation; but the convention soon
                    removed to Edinburgh, which had long been the seat of the court of four
                    boroughs, and was now become the metropolis of the kingdom. On the institution
                    of the Court of Session, the court of four boroughs and the chamberlain ayres
                    quickly fell into disuse, their judicial, and many of their ministerial
                    functions having been engrossed by that court; and from the time of Malcolm lord
                    Fleming, who fell at Pinkey in 1547, the office of chamberlain, or, as he was
                    now styled, lord great chamberlain, ceased to be exercised. The convention,
                    however, continued its yearly meetings; indeed, its records begin only at this
                    time, when the Lord Provost of Edinburgh became by devolution its standing
                    preses, and the Town-Clerk of Edinburgh its standing clerk.</p>
                <p>Let us now return to the general and ordinary courts of the kingdom; the Court of
                    Justiciary and Court of Session, the Sheriff Court, and the Bailie Courts of
                    burghs.</p>
                <p>The Court of Justiciary was originally the great pattern followed in the
                    administration of justice throughout the kingdom; but soon after the institution
                    of the Court of Session, an act passed (1540, c. 72.) requiring all sheriffs and
                    other temporal judges to copy the proceedings, not of the justices, as
                    before<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stat. Rob. III.
                    c. 33.</p></note> but of the Lords of Session; and the principle of this
                    enactment was adopted in the recent judicature act regulating the forms of
                    process in civil matters. The course of proceeding in ordinary actions is now
                    generally as follows. The defendant, or, as he is called, the defender, is first
                    summoned on the original writ to compear in court peremptorily<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=823" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0823-0759"/>
                    on a day named, the intervening days being held as <hi rend="italic">inducite
                    legales.</hi> If, when the cause is called, the defender do not appear, decree
                    in absence may pass against him. If he appear, he is allowed certain days,
                    termed <hi rend="italic">inducite deliberatoriae,</hi> to see the original writ
                    and productions, and determine whether and how he shall proceed. He then puts in
                    his defence and plea, admitting or denying the facts alleged, stating any other
                    facts which he offers to prove, and subjoining a summary of the pleas in law on
                    which he means to found. The defences and all subsequent steps of procedure must
                    be drawn by counsel; and after the defences are given in, every order in the
                    cause must be moved for in court and determined by the judges. If the parties
                    choose they may go to judgment on the summons and defences; but commonly more
                    specific pleadings are ordered, such as a condescendence and answers, or mutual
                    condescendences, which are similar to the <hi rend="italic">responsive
                    allegations</hi> of the ecclesiastical courts, and both are borrowed from the
                    <hi rend="italic">articuli et responsiones</hi> of the papal process. These
                    papers being revised by the parties, the record, ready to be closed, is
                    transmitted to the judge for private consideration; after which, it is put out
                    by him for debate. Parties are then heard in court by their counsel, and the
                    judge may thereupon either give judgment at once, or, as is commonly the case,
                    take the proceedings to chambers again for consideration, and there write out
                    his decision; or, if any difficulty occur in the determination of the case, he
                    may report the point to the Inner House for their direction or decision; or
                    again, if the cause involves details or difficulties, he may order cases, that
                    is to say, full argumentative pleadings, and then either decide the cause or
                    report it to the Inner House. When the Lord Ordinary gives an interlocutor or
                    judgment, it may be carried to the Inner House by reclaiming note, upon which
                    counsel are heard, and the decision of the Lord Ordinary either altered or
                    adhered to, and with or without cost, as the court may determine.</p>
                <p>In jury causes, that is to say, causes appropriated for trial by jury, or in
                    which jury trial is to take place, the course of proceeding now pointed out is
                    but partially followed. In such causes a record is made up in the manner
                    described; but as the system of pleading adopted in the Scotch courts does not,
                    as in the common law courts of England, bring out the issue whether of fact or
                    law, issues must be prepared. This is done by an officer of court, and in
                    settling issues there is frequently considerable difficulty. In the proceedings
                    of sheriff and bailie courts, however, there is something like an approach to
                    the English system, an answer or reply to the defence being allowed. But here
                    the analogy ends. There is no rejoinder unless ordered; and from the multitude
                    of pleas pleadable in each paper, a single issue, or indeed any issue, in the
                    technical sense of the term, is never produced. It is also to be observed, that
                    jury trials in civil causes gradually fell into disuse in the local courts after
                    the institution of the Court of Session, where such mode of trial was unknown
                    till recently introduced by statute; and it has not been re-established except
                    in the Court of Session. The details of a jury trial, when it does take place,
                    need not be specified here, though they differ in some few particulars from the
                    like proceeding in England.</p>
                <p>Of the several methods of defence and proof in criminal cases, the earliest, and
                    at the same time the rudest, was battle, in which the parties litigant put the
                    truth of their averment on the issue of a judicial combat.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quon. Att. c. 61, Leg. Burg. c.
                    24.</p></note> This method of trial, so truly barbarous, was termed the judgment
                    of God, though that appellation came more peculiarly to designate another method
                    of a different origin, but no less uncertain as a criterion of truth. This was
                    ordeal, which, if not introduced, was at least continued and countenanced by the
                    ecclesiastics. It was of various kinds, but those known in Scotland were water,
                    fire, and iron;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Stat.
                    Will. c. 7, 15; Stat. Alex. II. c. 7∙</p></note> and accordingly, as the accused
                    was able to bear applications of these, so accordingly was he judged guilty or
                    innocent. Another method of trial used also instead of battle, was that by
                    compurgators, where the defendant exculpated or purged himself of the guilt
                    imputed to him, by declaring his innocence on oath, and also producing a number
                    of persons to swear that they believed he swore truly, which they did in general
                    on their knowledge of his character.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>’ Quon. Att. c, 5, §. 7; Leg. Burg, c. 24,</p></note> But
                    all these methods of trial have been abolished, or have gradually become
                    obsolete, which leads us to notice the course of proceeding now in use in
                    ordinary cases.</p>
                <p>The first step is to commit the accused for examination, when, if no case is made
                    out, he is dismissed, otherwise he is committed for trial. From that moment he
                    may sue out and “run his letters,” a proceeding analogous to the <hi
                    rend="italic">habeas corpus.</hi> Trial being determined on, the accused is
                    summoned to the day fixed, being at the same time served with a duplicate of the
                    indictment or criminal letters, and lists of the assize (jurors) and witnesses
                    on his own behalf. On the day of compearance, he must appear personally,
                    (otherwise he is outlawed,) and stand at the bar or pannel whence he is termed
                    the <hi rend="italic">pantiel;</hi> but in all cases he is allowed counsel and
                    agent. If, on arraignment, he has no special matter to plead, the libel is read
                    to him, and his confession, if made, is recorded. If any special plea on the
                    relevancy is offered, it is determined by the judges on oral or written
                    argument. Issue being joined, the evidence on both sides is laid before the
                    court and jury, which are now impannelled for that purpose. The jury are then
                    addressed by the pannel or his counsel, and the evidence is afterwards summed up
                    by the presiding judge, with adirection in law to the jury; when the jury, after
                    deliberation, return, unanimously, or by a majority, a verdict of guilty, not
                    proven, or not guilty, as the case may be. A verdict of not guilty declares the
                    prisoner’s innocence; a verdict of not proven indicates suspicion, but
                    insufficient proof of guilt; and in the case of a verdict of guilty, but in that
                    only, sentence is pronounced. The nature of the sentence depends not only on the
                    crime, but also on the public prosecutor; for of a long time past that officer
                    has been in use to exercise a power to restrict the pains of law. This important
                    power is commonly exercised with great discretion; yet undoubtedly it is a
                    dangerous one to hold, and to it more, perhaps, than to any other cause
                    whatever, is to be ascribed the singularly lax state of the criminal law of
                    Scotland in reference to the punishment for crime.</p>
                <p>There seems little doubt but that in early times the king was public prosecutor,
                    as he was also generalissimo and chief justice of the kingdom. His great
                    officer, the justiciar, who followed him, as we have seen, in the two latter
                    capacities, followed him likewise in the capacity of public prosecutor; and what
                    the justiciar did throughout the realm generally, the same did the sheriff in
                    his particular county. Accordingly, we find it enacted in our early law that if
                    any stranger remained in a town longer than a night without finding a pledge or
                    surety for his good behaviour, “the justiciar or the sheriff shall accuse
                    him;"<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Quon. Ate. c.
                    63.</p></note> and so late as the middle of the fifteenth century it was enacted
                    “that all mairs and serjeants arrest at the sheriff’s bidding, albeit na party
                    follower be, all trespassers, and that the sheriff follow said trespassers in
                    the king’s name, gif na party follower appears,” (1436, c. 140.) In process of
                    time however, as the principles of civil liberty and the elements of our
                    constitution came to be better understood, distinct officers were appointed to
                    the different departments of the State; and this office of public prosecutor
                    naturally devolved upon the crown counsel. The principal of these is the lord
                    advocate, and next to<pb break="no"

                    him is the solicitor-general, an officer derived from the English courts, and
                    probably not known in Scotland earlier than the union of the crowns in the
                    beginning of the seventeenth century. There are also four standing deputies to
                    the lord advocate, or “advocate deputes,” as they are termed, who had their
                    origin by the act 1587, c. 82, which divided the realm into circuits for the
                    administration of criminal justice. The procurators fiscal of the county and
                    burgh courts, who arc the public prosecutors in their respective districts, may
                    also be regarded as deputies of the lord advocate. It is true they do not derive
                    their authority from him; but they communicate with him in the prosecution of
                    criminals, and in that department have generally the same powers and duties. The

                <p>Of both which there were at the instance of the</p>
                <p>Lord Advocate.</p>
                <p>The following statement will also give some idea of the working of the criminal
                    jurisdictions of Scotland. It relates to the year 1836. In that year there were
                    2922 persons charged with crime in the several counties and burghs of Scotland.
                    Of these 289 were discharged without trial, and 219 from other causes; and of
                    the remaining 2414, there were tried by the Justiciary, 574, (viz. 173 in the
                    high court, and 404 on circuit); by sheriffs, 1325,(viz.547with jury, and 778
                    without jury); and5l5 by burgh magistrates, justices of the peace, and others.
                    Of the above 2414 also, 2152 were convicted; in 194 cases the charges were found
                    not proven; 30 were declared not guilty; 36 were outlawed, and two were found
                    insane on arraignment. And finally, of the 2152 convicted, 1647 were sentenced
                    to imprisonment of different periods, 305 were condemned to transportation for
                    different periods, 187 were punished by fine, 6 were discharged on sureties, 2
                    had sentence of death, 1 was executed, and 5 received no sentence.</p>
                <p>Next in dignity to the crown counsel is the dean of faculty, <hi rend="italic"
                    >facultatis juridicoe decanus;</hi> or rather we should say that between these
                    learned personages there has been a contest waged, the latter claiming
                    precedence of the former. This claim, however, seems to be just a <hi
                    rend="italic">residuum</hi> of the once greater claims of the whole college of
                    justice, and the dispute but a continuation of the conflict formerly maintained
                    by the court against all power except its own. The place of dean of faculty has
                    been held by some of the first men of the kingdom; and in the course of the last
                    two hundred years there have been no less than three instances of elevation from
                    it at once to the presidentcy of the Court of Session, Sir George Lockhart, Sir
                    Hugh Dalrymple, and Mr. Blair. But in all the common elements of rank there
                    cannot be a doubt of its inferiority to that of crown counsel.</p>
                <p>According to the original constitution of the Court of Session, the members were
                    associated into a college, with a view to a collegiate or common life; the
                    judges or lords of Session being “senators” of the college, and the advocates
                    the <hi rend="italic">facultas juridica,</hi> or faculty of law, subordinate to
                    whom were the students of law, or “servitors,” as they were termed, who were
                    attached to particular advocates as their pupils in the study of the law. The
                    celebrated Sir Thomas Hope was in early life a “servitor” to Sir Thomas
                    Nicolson. The term “servitor” was a college term, well known in the University
                    of Oxford; but it has gone out of use with us, those formerly so designed being
                    now termed “advocates’ first clerks.” But to what extent such intention was ever
                    carried out, or whether any thing existed here in the nature of the English laws
                    of court or Doctors Commons, does not appear. At present there is nothing of the
                    sort. The original entry money to the Faculty was L.40 Scotch, and so it
                    continued till 1672, the year in which the statute for the regulation of the
                    judicatories passed, when the sum was raised to 200 merks. In the beginning of
                    last century it had advanced to L.40 sterling, and now, after repeated advances,
                    the fees of entry are upwards of 250 guineas besides extras. The number of the
                    Faculty which, forty years ago, was about 260, is at present about 470,
                    averaging of late about twelve in the year; but a fourth part only are in
                    attendance on the courts.</p>
                <p>The distinction of counsel and agents in Scotch practice is of modern origin. The
                    earliest agents properly so called, or practitioners below the bar, were the
                    “servitors” above mentioned, or advocates’ first clerks in the Court of Session;
                    and all others were forbidden to act as agents.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See AS. 13th July 1596, Stat. 1672, c. 16,
                    and AS. '26th February 1678.</p></note> By the injunctions of their chief
                    officer, the Secretary of State, in 1594, Writers to the Signet were also
                    prohibited from acting as agents; and by a bye law of the body itself in 1676,
                    every member who should take it upon him to act as an agent, was made liable to
                    be prosecuted. They came at length, however, to act likewise as agents, and are
                    now a large and influential body. Sixty years ago they were not more than 100;
                    but about forty years ago they were 280. At present they are upwards of 700 in
                    number, and almost all of them resident in Edinburgh; and the average entries
                    yearly are the same in proportion as into the Faculty. There is another class of
                    agents, the Solicitors before the supreme courts, enrolled under AS. 9 July
                    1754, and AS. 1772. They are upwards of a hundred in number, which is somewhat
                    more than the enrolled number of advocates’ first clerks, a body which lias
                    remained much about the same for the last forty years.</p>
                <p>With respect to the procurators of the inferior courts, they appear to have
                    generally continued, till recent times, on the same close footing on which the
                    practitioners of all the courts stood previous to the institution of the Court
                    of Session; nor are they to this day admitted by the supreme court, or
                    marshalled, like the bar, into one body, but are severally admitted, on varying
                    qualifications, by the respective courts throughout the kingdom. They are of
                    course restricted to the particular court so admitting them; whereas the
                    advocates of the College of Justice form the proper bar of Scotland, and being
                    admitted by the supreme court, may practise in any court of the kingdom. The
                    same principle might be extended with evident advantage; and the local courts
                    opened up to the talent and practical skill of the agents of the Court of
                    Session. The present arrangements are very plainly imperfect, and incapable of
                    maturing a uniform and settled system of jurisprudence in the country. There is
                    not a tenth part of the law business of the country conducted by the counsel and
                    agents of the supreme court. Unless a different provision is made, both the law
                    and the legal profession of Scotland will inevitably suffer.</p>
                <p>In the style of the procurators of Aberdeen, there is a peculiarity which may
                    here be taken notice of and explained. They are styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >advocates,</hi> which name is otherwise appropriated to the advocates of the
                    College of Justice. The truth is that the appellation of advocate is amongst the
                    earliest which we find in our records applied to practitioners<pb break="no"

                <p>of the law, (1424, c. 45); and it appears that persons so designated were
                    formerly’ in every court of the kingdom, (1424, c. 45, 1429, c. 11G—125.) The
                    term was used synonymously with procurators; and at the institution of the Court
                    of Session both terms were applied together, (1537, c. 64.) The sheriff court of
                    Aberdeen was the earliest county court regulated subsequent to the erection of
                    the Court of Session; and in the act of court then passed, the two names were
                    used promiscuously. Hence has arisen the common use of the style of advocate;
                    but the advocates of Aberdeen form no part of the proper bar of Scotland, any
                    more than the practitioners of any of the local courts whatsoever. The entry of
                    procurators of Edinburgh was not regulated by the sheriff till 1765, and for
                    fifteen years more they remained unincorporated. It was still later before the
                    procurators of Glasgow were erected into a corporation; and it was not till
                    above thirty-five years ago that the procurators of Paisley were
                    incorporated.</p>
                <p>We have now a word or two to say with respect to the garb of the profession. The
                    proper habit of the bar is the long robe which now characterises the profession,
                    and which seems to have been adopted by the advocates of the College of Justice
                    as the ecclesiastical array. Anciently, however, a sort of cloak or tabard of
                    green was worn, (1455, c. 45.) which colour it will be recollected, was
                    symbolical of learning amongst the ancient Britons; and accordingly that class
                    of their priesthood called <hi rend="italic">Ovats,</hi> and who professed the
                    liberal arts, wore habits of green. In the burgh court of Edinburgh the cloak
                    was worn till the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the procurators
                    were required to wear gowns instead.</p>
                <p>It remains to advert shortly to the executive officers of the law. These are,
                    properly speaking, the sheriffs in their respective counties, and the
                    magistrates in the burghs; and in the criminal warrants of the superior courts
                    this is clear. But the ordinary civil process of the Court of Session is exe
                    cuted by the messengers and other officers at-arms; and the like process of the
                    sheriff and bailie courts is executed by the sheriff and burgh officers
                    respectively. The messengers-at-arms amount to upwards of two hundred in number,
                    and are distributed throughout the different shires and districts of the
                    kingdom. They are all associated, however, under the Lyon herald, king of arms,
                    who, as head of the office or college of arms, has authority and jurisdiction
                    over all the members and officers of the establishment. In this respect the Lord
                    Lyon may be regarded as essentially at the head of the civil branch of the
                    executive department of the law; and accordingly it might deserve consideration
                    whether it would not be expedient, with a view at once to give unity of
                    management to the entire department, and also to relieve the sheriff of all but
                    judicial duties, to devolve upon the Lord Lyon and his officers the execution of
                    process of every kind, and the whole ministerial powers of the sheriff, in as
                    far as these are executive, or auxiliary to the courts of law.</p>
                <p>In order to give a clear and concise view of the manner in which justice is
                    distributed throughout Scotland by means of the circuit courts of justiciary,
                    and the courts of the sheriffs-depute and sheriffs-substitute, not including the
                    burgh and justice of peace courts, the following Tables are subjoined.</p>
                <p>The great divisions of the realm in early times were Lothian, Galloway, and
                    Scotland. In the first of these, justice-ayres were holden at Edinburgh,
                    Peebles, and soon afterwards Glasgow; and if we credit the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Reg. Mag.</hi> lib. ii, c. 20, the <hi rend="italic">loca capitalia
                    Scotioe</hi> were, Scone for Gowry, Cluny for Stormonth, Rait for Athole,
                    Dalguish for Fife, Perth for Strathearn, Forfar for Angus, Aberdeen for Mar and
                    Buchan, and Inverness for Ross and Moray. The judicial districts assigned by
                    king Edward I., in 1305, were Lothian, Galloway, beyond the Forth to the
                    Grampians, and beyond the Grampians. At the institution of the Court of Session
                    in 1532, the realm was divided, for the purposes of civil judicature, into four
                    quarters, as follows :—</p>
                <p>Forfar, Kincardine, Aberdeen, Banff, Elgin, Forres, Naim, Inverness,
                    Cromarty.</p>
                <p>Edinburgh, Haddington, Linlithgow, Berwick, Roxburgh, Peebles, Selkirk,</p>
                <p>Dumfries, Annandale, Kirkcudbright, Ayr, Wigton, Lanark, Renfrew, Stirling,</p>
                <p>Dunbarton, Argyle, Bute, Clackmannan, Kinross, Fife,</p>
                <p>Perth.</p>
                <p>By 1587, c. 82, the realm was divided, for the purposes of criminal judicature,
                    into four quarters, of seven shires each, but these are not stated.</p>

                <p>The divisions which are recognized under this head are counties or shires, and
                    parishes. Of the <hi rend="italic">counties,</hi> the origin of which is very
                    ancient, and has not been ascertained, a list, and other particulars respecting
                    them, have already been given. They are thirty-three in number, but most of them
                    are subdivided by local acts of parliament into two or more districts, for the
                    purpose of police and internal economy; and several of them comprehend a variety
                    of territorial divisions, founded on the natural circumstances of the country.
                    Thus the county of Berwick is popularly divided into the three districts of the
                    Merse, Lauderdale, and Lammermuir; Lanarkshire into the upper, middle, and lower
                    wards; Ayrshire into Kyle, Cunningham, and Carrick; and in the extensive
                    Highland counties, the subdivisions are still more numerous. There is no trace
                    in Scotland of the minor divisions of the English counties, called hundreds,
                    wapentakes, and the like. Of the judicial divisions of Scotland an account will
                    be found in this article under the head of Judicial Establishments. Respecting
                    the date of the erection of <hi rend="italic">parishes,</hi> there have been
                    various conjectures. They were purely an ecclesiastical regulation, and could
                    not have been formed till the Christian system had been generally received, and
                    its preachers become numerous; and as this division, and the necessary previous
                    ecclesiastical establishment, infer no inconsiderable degree of civilization, it
                    is highly probable that it did not take place before the ninth or the tenth
                    century.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Murray's
                    Literary History of Galloway, 2d edit. 1832, p. 7.</p></note> Mr. Chalmers
                    supposes that parishes were gradually formed after the year 843; but that they
                    existed in the time of Malcolm III., who died in 1093, is ascertained by
                    authentic records.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Caledonia, vol. i. p. 23.</p></note> The number of parishes has not been
                    uniform. Previously to the Reformation the bishops possessed the power of
                    uniting or disjoining parishes. Between this period and the Union, in 1707, the
                    authority was transferred from the bishops and vested in several successive
                    commissions of the Scottish parliament. In 1707, parliament vested this power in
                    the Court of Session, but confined the power of the court to cases where consent
                    had previously been given by persons possessing three-fourths of the valued
                    rental of the parish; and this is the existing law. The disjoining or union of
                    parishes is, therefore, attended with considerable difficulty, and very rarely
                    takes place, except in cities where the consent of the municipal authorities, if
                    patrons of the parish, and of the presbytery of the bounds, is sufficient for
                    the purpose. Hence in Edinburgh five new parishes have been erected out of the
                    parish of St. Cuthbert’s, within the last forty years. The number of parishes is
                    at present 916, exclusive of what arc commonly called <hi rend="italic">quoad
                    sacra</hi> parishes. These latter parishes have been formed in either of the two
                    following ways. First, owing to the inconvenient extent of parishes in the
                    Highlands, and the consequent distance of many of the people from the parish
                    church, missionaries<pb break="no"
                    facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=827" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0827-0763"/>
                    supported by a royal grant, were appointed to certain localities with the
                    privileges <hi rend="italic">quoad spiritualia</hi> of parochial clergymen,
                    except that they could not be constituent members of any of the church courts,
                    and could not even have sessions of their own. But in the year 1833, these
                    localities were, by an act of the General Assembly, converted into parishes <hi
                    rend="italic">quoad sacra,</hi> and their ministers declared to be constituent
                    members of the ecclesiastical courts. The number of these new parishes is
                    forty-one. Secondly, from the many difficulties attending the erection of new
                    parishes, means have been introduced, in addition to the establishment of the
                    new <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra</hi> parishes referred to, to supersede the
                    necessity of such a step; and this object was accomplished by the institution of
                    “chapels of ease,” or subsidiary places of worship, without any assigned
                    locality. These parishes, the first of which was erected in 1798, amounted in
                    1834 to sixty-six, when the General Assembly conferred on them the same rights
                    and privileges which belong to parish ministers, and appointed them a certain
                    defined locality <hi rend="italic">quoad sacra.</hi> Since that period they have
                    greatly increased in number, and are yearly increasing, so that it would be both
                    difficult and unnecessary to ascertain the exact amount. But they do not affect
                    the original parishes in any way, except in regard to the spiritualities.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Church of Scotland.</hi> The reformation from popery began at
                    an early period in Scotland, but was not triumphant until the year 1560, when
                    popery was abolished, and the protestant religion established by act of
                    parliament in its stead. But whilst popery was abolished, the protestants could
                    not agree amongst themselves as to the system of ecclesiastical polity which
                    should be established in its place. Episcopacy, or the government of the church
                    by bishops, received the support of the king and of many of the most powerful
                    families; whilst presbytery, or the polity introduced by Knox from Geneva, where
                    he had studied under Calvin, was embraced by the great body of the people. But
                    amidst the struggle for pre-eminence, the presbyterians, who constituted
                    five-sixths of the protestant population, took matters into their own hand, and
                    embodied their ecclesiastical system in a work entitled <hi rend="italic">The
                    Second Book of Discipline,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>The <hi rend="italic">First Book of Discipline</hi> was
                    presented by the reformers to the parliament of 1560, which abolished popery;
                    but it was not ratified by the legislature, though it was subscribed by a great
                    many of its members as private individuals. But the parliament, though it did
                    not give the sanction of its authority to <hi rend="italic">The First Book of
                    Discipline,</hi> accepted and confirmed the <hi rend="italic">Confession of

                    establish any particular set of doctrines as to abjure popery; and hence it is
                    called the <hi rend="italic">Negative Confession.</hi> Another <hi rend="italic"

                <p>But whilst presbytery was thus the religion of the people, it did not receive the
                    sanction either of the Privy Council or Parliament. On the contrary, in 1584,
                    episcopacy was established as the national church; presbytery was declared
                    illegal; and the presbyterian clergy were exposed to much obloquy and
                    persecution. But the public voice again got the ascendancy; and presbytery was
                    for the first time ratified by act of parliament, in 1592, as the national
                    church. But not being acceptable to the king and the court, this polity was
                    superseded by episcopacy in 1606; nor did it again obtain the supremacy till the
                    famous General Assembly, held at Glasgow in 1638, which abolished prelacy, and
                    restored the presbyterian form of worship. The proceedings and acts of this
                    Assembly were afterwards confirmed by the king and the parliament. But in 1660,
                    on the restoration of</p>
                <p>Charles II., presbytery was compelled again to give way to episcopacy, which
                    maintained the predominance till the Revolution. The act of William and Mary,
                    re-establishing presbytery, was passed in 1690.<note anchored="true"

                    these 27 are collegiate, that is, have each the services of two clergymen, who
                    preach alternately in the same place of worship. The whole number of parishes,

                    It is composed of the minister of the parish and the lay elders. The minister is
                    officially moderator or president of the session. This court takes cognizance of
                    cases of scandal, of the poor’s fund, and of parochial ecclesiastical
                    discipline. There is a power of appeal from the session to the presbytery, which
                    is the next court in dignity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Presbytery</hi> is composed of a number of contiguous
                    parishes. A presbytery consists of the ministers of all the parishes within its

                    bounds, and of a lay-elder from each parish. The presbytery takes young men on
                    trial as students of divinity, and candidates for licence; ordains presentees to
                    vacant livings; and has the superintendence of religion and education within its
                    precincts. Its decision is not final, if an appeal be lodged to the synod. A
                    presbytery generally meets monthly; and it must necessarily meet at least twice
                    a-year. The number of presbyteries is eighty.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Synod</hi> is composed of two or more presbyteries. It
                    consists of every parish minister within its limits, and of the elders who last

                    from the synod to the General Assembly. The number of synods is sixteen.</p>

                    this high functionary has no voice in the deliberations of the court; and even
                    his presence is not absolutely necessary. The Assembly, unlike the inferior

                    Scottish clergy, which is generally derived from teinds or tithes,<note

                    rend="italic">teinds</hi> in Scotland, since the Reformation, is involved and
                    intricate. We need not enter on the consideration of the subject here, but
                    merely state that, at the approach of the Reformation, most of the teinds, and
                    much of the property of the church were alienated, and bestowed on laymen, or
                    devolved on the crown. But to overlook the intermediate steps, the greatest
                    change which took place in the matter was in the reign of Charles the First, who
                    revoked all the ecclesiastical grants (except the church lands) which had been
                    made during the two preceding reigns. This revocation having taken place, though
                    with difficulty, it was provided that the lands, except such as had been already
                    appropriated to the payment of stipend, should be valued and sold. The
                    landholders were entitled to sue for a valuation or <hi rend="italic"
                    >modus,</hi> and to purchase the teinds of their own estates. To facilitate the
                    inquiry into the value of teinds, commissioners and sub-commissioners were
                    appointed, the latter of whom were enjoined to visit their several parishes, and
                    to report to the commissioners. Some of their reports, when made, were
                    sanctioned; others have been brought forward for approval at later periods. The
                    result was, that by far the greater part of the teinds have been bought up by
                    the proprietors of the respective lands, after stipends, commuted into a money
                    payment, had been modified to the clergymen, the teinds being held by these
                    proprietors under the condition of augmenting, if necessary, such stipends to
                    the extent of their value; in other words, there are in these cases no tithes or
                    teinds, but part of the rent of the proprietors constitutes ministers’ stipend,
                    and a certain additional portion, in cases where the valuation is not exhausted,
                    is still liable to augmentation of stipend. In cases where no valuation has
                    taken place, the value of the teinds is calculated at one-fifth of the existing
                    rent, and is also paid in money. The body of commissioners just spoken of,
                    continued to act from the date of their appointment, to the Union in 1707, at
                    which period the Court of Session was authorised to supply their place, and to
                    determine in all cases of valuation and sale of teinds. As the commissioners had
                    been empowered to modify the stipends of the ministers, the same power was
                    transferred to the Court of Session. A clergyman is entitled, when the teinds of
                    the parish are not exhausted, to apply to the Court for an augmentation of his
                    stipend, which it is competent for that Court either to grant or refuse. But,
                    whether granted or not, twenty years must elapse before such applications can be
                    renewed. The stipend generally consists of so many chalders of grain. The value
                    of the grain is determined by the <hi rend="italic">fiar</hi> prices, which are
                    struck in each county in Scotland in the month of February or March annually;
                    and this value, which necessarily varies yearly, is then payable in money. The
                    teinds are also appropriated to the building of parish churches and manses, and
                    the keeping of them in repair. The ministers of Edinburgh and Montrose are paid
                    not by teinds, but by a local tax, levied on the occupiers of houses; a
                    circumstance that has been the source, particularly in Edinburgh, of much
                    irritation and discontent. (Sir J. Connel on Teinds, <hi rend="italic"

                    to the clergyman an income of L.150, the government has provided a fund, so as
                    to raise such income to this minimum amount. The parishes thus assisted are
                    called bounty livings, and amount to 208.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    dissenters are presbyterians, entertaining Calvinistic opinions, and recognising
                    the same confession of faith and the same standards as the members of the
                    established church; they abandoned that church in consequence of certain alleged
                    errors in discipline, and particularly the undue exercise of patronage, for
                    lay-patronage has always obtained, with more or less vigour in the Scottish
                    establishment, except for more than twenty years prior to 1712. (See <hi

                <p>The dissenting body next in importance to the United Associate Synod, is the
                    Relief, which was founded in 1755. The founders of this sect professed to differ
                    from the Established Church on no other point than the right of patrons to
                    appoint ministers against the inclinations of the people.<note anchored="true"

                    p∙ 361-8.</p></note> But the breach between this body of dissenters and the
                    Establishment has now become wader; while the different sections of dissenters
                    seem more disposed to union among themselves. The two numerous bodies of the
                    Secession and the Relief, are at present (1839) engaged in making advances
                    towards a union of these denominations. The Original Burgher Associate Synod
                    declined to join the coalition formed between the Burghers and Antiburghers in
                    1820. The different congregations belonging to this sect are, with few
                    exceptions, disposed to join the Established Church; indeed, some of them have
                    already done so. There is another class of presbyterian dissenters, generally
                    called Cameronians, but who assume the title of the Reformed Presbyterian Synod,
                    who are the successors and representatives of the Covenanters in the time of
                    Charles the First and his son. This small but interesting body refused to accept
                    the settlement of Presbytery, as cstabli3hcd by law in 1690, unless the king
                    should consent to subscribe the Solemn League and Covenant, and the standards of
                    the Church. The Cameronians are, perhaps to this day, the most rigid
                    presbyterians in Scotland. But without descending into particulars, the
                    following table will afford a pretty correct view of the extent and importance
                    of the different religious bodies in Scotland.<note anchored="true"

                    dissenters amount to much more than the fourth part of the whole population of

                <p>The subject of education engaged the attention of the Scottish Parliament even in
                    comparatively rude times, viz. as early as the year 1494. The protestant church
                    zealously took up the subject, and many acts of the General Assembly were passed
                    in support of it. But it was not till 1616 that the Privy Council interposed and
                    passed an act in favour of parish schools; nor was it till seventeen years
                    afterwards, that this act of Council was ratified by Parliament. The disturbed
                    state of the times prevented the act from becoming operative; and it was not, in
                    truth, till some time after the Revolution, namely, in 1696, that the celebrated
                    statute of William and Mary was passed, which forms the foundation of the
                    present parochial system. The provisions of this act were immediately carried
                    into effect in most parishes; and now the system is in universal operation
                    throughout Scotland. The landowners and clergymen have it in their power,
                    according to law, to establish more than one school in a parish, if
                    circumstances seem to demand it; in which case the salary assigned to each of
                    the teachers is less than the maximum sum (L.34, 4s. 4 ½ d.) given when there is
                    only one schoolmaster in a parish. From a Parliamentary paper,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Educational Inquiry,
                    Scotland, Session 1837, vol. xlvii.</p></note> we learn, that the number of
                    parochial schools in Scotland is 1047; that the number of teachers is 1170; that
                    the aggregate amount of the salaries paid to them is L.29,642, 18s. 11 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>.; and that their total
                    income, including salaries, fees, and all other emoluments, but exclusive of
                    their dwelling-house and garden, is L.55,339, 17s. 1 ½ d., being an average of
                    only L.47, 5s. 11 ¾. to each teacher. But ill-paid though the teachers be, they
                    are, generally speaking, a well educated and meritorious class of men; and the
                    parochial system has given such a stimulus to education, that the endowed
                    schools have been found, in the progress of society, to be too few to answer the
                    demand for instruction on the part of the people. Hence it appears from the same
                    official document, that the number of schools not parochial, is not less than
                    3995, and the number of teachers 4469, being nearly four times the amount of the
                    parochial schools and teachers.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Under the head of schools non-parochial, are included those

                    namely, 89; and those instituted by the different dissenting
                    congregations.</p></note> The greatest number of pupils attending the parochial
                    schools between Ladyday and Michaelmas 1833, was 71,426; and the lowest number
                    was 50,029∙ The greatest number attending the schools not parochial, between the
                    same dates, was 189,427; and the lowest number was 139,237. What the incomes of
                    the non-parochial teachers may be, we have no data to judge. They are pretty
                    high in our large towns, but miserably low, perhaps not above ten shillings
                    a-week, in rural districts. Taking the average of the preceding number of
                    pupils, attending both the parochial and non-parochial schools, namely, 225,061,
                    the inference is, that 10 ½ out of 100 of the population are at school; but when
                    we take into account the number of female seminaries, of private boarding
                    schools for boys, and children taught in private families by governesses and
                    tutors, not to mention Sabbath evening schools and classes for religious
                    instruction, we may with propriety conclude, that at least 9 <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> out of every 100 of
                    the population are at the same time under tuition; a larger proportion than is
                    known to be similarly situated, excepting in particular districts, in any other
                    country of Europe.</p>
                <p>The origin of the Scottish universities is not of any remote date. But as early
                    as the year 1282, Dervorgille, wife of John Balliol, founded and endowed a
                    college at Oxford for the reception of Scottish students; and, in 1,326, a
                    college, known by the name of the Scotch college, was founded and endowed at
                    Paris by David Murray, bishop of Moray, for a similar purpose.<note

                    advantages of universities within the limits of her own territory. That of St.
                    Andrews, the oldest in the kingdom, was founded by papal authority in 1413; that
                    of Glasgow, by the same authority, in 1450; that of Aberdeen, also under the
                    sanction of the pope, in 1494, though education did not commence there till
                    1500; and that of Edinburgh, founded by the presbyterians, in 1582. The
                    university of St. Andrews consisted at one time of three colleges, instituted at
                    different periods, viz. St. Salvador’s, St. Leonard’s, and St. Mary’s; hut in
                    1748, the two first were united, and the buildings of St. Leonard’s were
                    alienated and converted into dwelling-houses. The university of Aberdeen
                    consists of two colleges; King’s, founded, as just stated, in 1494; and
                    Marischal college, instituted and endowed by George Keith, Earl Marischal, in
                    1593. The universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh contain one college each; but
                    embrace all the faculties in their course of instruction. The following table
                    shews the number of professors in the different universities, with the date of

                <p>When founded.</p>
                <p>Each of these universities enjoys the privilege of conferring literary honours in
                    all the faculties. The aggregate number of students attending all these
                    seminaries is about 2900, of whom about 1300 belong to the university of
                    Edinburgh; 1100 to that of Glasgow; and the remainder to Aberdeen and St.
                    Andrews, the attendance on the latter not exceeding 130. There are no religious
                    tests to exclude students from any of our Scottish colleges. Jews, Catholics,
                    Protestants, enjoy the same privileges. But the professors should, according to
                    law, belong to the Established Church, and are liable to be called upon to sign
                    her standards. This condition, however, is not always exacted. The session
                    extends from the beginning of November till the end of April. There are a few
                    summer classes in the universities of Edinburgh and Glasgow, but these extend
                    only to three months preceding the first of August. A Royal Commission was
                    appointed in 1826 for visiting the universities and colleges of Scotland, and in
                    1830 gave in a voluminous report. Another Commission was nominated in 1836, for
                    visiting the university of Aberdeen. Their report has just been presented. But
                    though a bill was brought into Parliament in 1836, founded on the former report,
                    providing for a general board of visitors appointed by the crown over all the
                    universities, that bill was withdrawn; and no measure on the subject has since
                    been brought forward.</p>
                <p>Though poor-rates are not generally imposed in Scotland, yet a law involving a
                    compulsory assessment for the support of the impotent poor, was passed as early
                    as the year 1576. But the very existence of such a statute seemed nearly unknown
                    till about the middle of last century. “As long as there was no secession of
                    presbyterians from the Established Church, the weekly collections, under the<pb

                    found sufficient for the management of the poor. In some years of peculiar
                    hardship or scarcity, such as the four last years of the seventeenth century, or
                    the year 1740, voluntary assistance was no doubt given; and in some instances
                    temporary assessments were resorted to, to enable the kirk-sessions to meet the
                    usual emergencies. But on all ordinary occasions the resources of the
                    kirk-sessions were considered as sufficient, and continued to be so at least as
                    late as 1755.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Sir Henry
                    Monereiff's Life of Dr. Erskine, p. 468.</p></note> And as legal assessments
                    were reluctantly introduced, notwithstanding the existence of a law in their
                    favour, so they have spread tardily. At this moment they embrace only 236
                    parishes, being little more than a fourth of the total parishes of Scotland.
                    These assessments have not only been introduced, but are the heaviest, in the
                    parishes bordering on England; and with the exception of our larger towns, they
                    decrease or disappear as we recede from the infectious example of the sister
                    kingdom. Thus every parish in the synod of Merse and Teviotdale is burdened with
                    assessment. In the midland synods, less than the half of the parishes are
                    assessed; whilst in the northern synods, embracing 157 parishes, only three are
                    exposed to that burden.</p>

                <p>Both these institutions have long existed in Scotland, but were based till
                    recently on an insecure foundation. With the view of putting them on a sound
                    footing, the act of 10 Geo. IV., c. 56, and of 4 and 5 Will. IV., c. 40, were
                    passed. All friendly societies, claiming the benefits of these acts, are obliged
                    to submit a statement of their rules and regulations for the approval of the
                    officer appointed by government for the purpose; and these must receive his
                    sanction ere the parties become entitled to the privileges conferred by the act
                    in question, namely, the being allowed to invest the funds of the society in
                    government securities at a minimum rate of interest (2 ½ d. per cent. per day),
                    and in the funds of savings banks. Upwards of five hundred friendly societies
                    have been instituted on the principle of these acts. The act as to savings
                    banks, which has been in operation in all other parts of the empire since 1819,
                    was extended to Scotland in 1835. According to the provisions of this act, the
                    money of savings banks can be invested in government securities at the rate of
                    L.3, 16s. 0 ½ d. per cent.; but the interest paid to depositors is not to exceed
                    2 ½ d. per cent. per day, or L.3, 8s. 5 ¼ d. per cent. per annum. No individual
                    can deposit more than L.30 in any one year, exclusive of interest, nor more than
                    L.200 in all. Savings banks have been established under the law in Edinburgh,
                    Glasgow, Cupar, Kirkaldy, Dunfermline, Dalkeith, and other towns. The deposits
                    in the Edinburgh institution amount to about L.170,000, in rather less than 3
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi> years; and the
                    other savings banks in Scotland have been equally successful.</p>
                <p>The peers of Scotland, by the treaty of union, elect sixteen of their number to
                    be their representatives in the House of Lords. This election takes place in the
                    palace of Holyrood on the dissolution of parliament. These sixteen peers, who
                    are not elected for life, as is the case with the Irish representative peers,
                    but for the continuance of the parliament for which they are chosen, enjoy all
                    the privileges of the peers of</p>
                <p>England. The other peers of Scotland have all the privileges of the House of
                    Lords, except the legislative and judicial powers, and the privileges thence
                    arising. The number of Scottish peers at the union was one hundred and
                    fifty-four; and there has been since restored five, making one hundred and
                    fifty-nine; but the present number is eighty-three, namely, seven dukes, four
                    marquises, thirty-nine earls, three countesses, six viscounts, twenty-three
                    barons, and one baroness. Thirty-six of these are also British peers; and two
                    are likewise peers of Ireland.</p>
                <p>Scotland, before the passing of the reform bill in the year 1832, was represented
                    in the House of Commons by forty-five members, thirty being returned by the
                    counties, and fifteen by the royal burghs, sixty-six in number. The number of
                    the Scottish representatives since the passing of the reform bill, is
                    fifty-three, thirty being, as before, chosen by the counties, whilst the burghs
                    and towns, seventy-six in number, of which ten are not royal burghs, send
                    twentythree. The counties, thirty-three in number, return only thirty members,
                    because, for parliamentary objects, Kinross and Clackmannan, Elgin and Nairn,
                    and Ross and Cromarty, are respectively united. The aggregate number of the
                    county freeholders or voters, at the passing of the reform act, was 3211. The
                    burgh constituencies were still more limited. With the exception of Edinburgh,
                    which sent a member of itself, the other burghs were parcelled out in groups,
                    and each burgh in the group voted by a delegate chosen by the magistrates and
                    towncouncil., amounting, upon an average, to twenty in each, or 1320 in all. The
                    aggregate number of the county constituencies, in 1838-39, was 46,480, or nearly
                    fifteen limes the former amount; and of the burgh constituencies, 36,373, or
                    fully twenty-seven times its former extent. The total constituency of Scotland
                    is 82,853.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Burton's

                <p>The amount of square miles, as stated under a previous head, being 29,600, the
                    average population is within a fraction of eighty to the square mile. Great as
                    has been the advance of population since the beginning of the last century, and
                    particularly since 1801, it has been considerably less than its progress during
                    the same period in England or Ireland. This desirable result seems to have been
                    owing principally to the consolidation of farms in the low country; the
                    extinction of the cottier system in the Highlands, and the substitution in its
                    stead of large sheep farms; the comparative want of poor-laws; and the obstacles
                    interposed by the law of Scotland to the sub-letting of farms, and to the
                    subdivision of land. But however it may be accounted for, the fact is certain
                    that, as compared with the increase of wealth, the population of Scotland has
                    increased less rapidly than that of either of the two sister kingdoms. The
                    Scotch have therefore advanced much more rapidly than the English or Irish in
                    wealth, and in the command of the necessaries and conveniences of life. Their
                    progress in this respect has, indeed, been quite astonishing. The habits, diet,
                    dress, and other accommodations of the people, have been signally improved. It
                    is not too much to affirm, that the peasantry of the present day are better
                    lodged, better clothed, and better fed, than the middle class of landowners were
                    a century ago.</p>

                    two years afterwards. In 1819, they had increased to 11; in 1830, to 61; and in

                <p>On the subject of the Scottish manufactures our notices, derived from official or
                    other documents, shall be brief, particularly as under the articles <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Dundee, Glasgow,</hi> &amp;c., we have already given pretty
                    ample information on the different manufactures for which the country is
                    distinguished. The linen manufacture was the earliest, and long regarded as the
                    staple, branch of industry carried on in Scotland. But such were the narrow
                    limits within which it was confined, that, at the Union, in 1707, it was not
                    supposed to exceed 1,500,000 yards a-year. In 1727, aboard of trustees was
                    established for the superintendence and encouragement of the linen manufacture;
                    and bounties and premiums were given on its production and exportation.</p>
                <p>The regulations as to the inspection and stamping of the linen intended for
                    exportation, by which the trade was much annoyed, were abolished in 1822; and
                    the bounties ceased in the year 1830. The quantity produced for sale in 1728 was
                    2,000,000 yards; in 1775, 12,000,000 yards; in 1822, 36,000,000 yards; and the
                    exports alone, in 1835, exclusive of home consumption, was between 60,000,000
                    and 70,000,000 yards, worth about L.l,600,000. Dundee and the east of Scotland,
                    including Fifeshire, are the great seats of the manufacture, particularly in
                    Osnaburghs, sail-cloth, and the coarser fabrics; and Dunfermline and the
                    neighbouring towns and villages, the principal seat of damask, diaper, and the
                    finer fabrics. Previously to 1791, all the yarn used in the manufacture was spun
                    upon the common hand-wheel; but the spinning by machinery began at that time to
                    be introduced; and such has been the facility of production consequent on the
                    erection of flax-mills, that the cost of the yarn, including the raw material,
                    is now less than the spinning amounted to thirty years ago. The number of flax,
                    hemp, and tow factories was, in 1837, 175, employing no fewer than 15,462
                    workers, of whom 4231 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 163
                    between nine and thirteen.</p>
                <p>Lanarkshire, which includes the city of Glasgow, and also the contiguous county
                    of Renfrew, has always been the principal seat of the cotton manufacture. Some
                    of the fabrics made at Glasgow and Paisley are of almost unrivalled beauty and
                    fineness. The first steam-engine for the spinning of cotton erected in Scotland,
                    was constructed so late as 1792. The number of cotton factories in 1837 was 177,
                    all those of considerable size being situated at Glasgow, and in the
                    neighbouring districts, comprehending twenty or thirty miles around Glasgow,
                    excepting five in Aberdeenshire, two in Perthshire, one in Dumfries-shire, and
                    one at Gatehouse, in Kirkcudbrightshire. But, with no exception, all these
                    country mills are connected with Glasgow houses, or the Glasgow trade, at least
                    so far as the raw material is concerned. The number of hands from eight years of
                    age upwards employed in the Scottish cotton manufacture, is 34,418, of whom
                    13,567 are between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 1096 between nine and
                    thirteen.</p>
                <p>The woollen manufacture of Scotland has never been considerable. It was formerly
                    the custom for the occupiers of land in this country to spin the whole of their
                    wool with the hand in their own houses, and to send the yarn to the village
                    weaver to be woven into a species of coarse cloth called <hi rend="italic"
                    >plaiding;</hi> but this mode, which is indicative of a rude and backward state
                    of society, is now entirely abandoned, having been superseded by machinery.
                    Factories for the making of fine cloth have been established in Aberdeenshire,
                    and in some other counties; but comparatively coarse fabrics still continue to
                    be the staple article of Scotch manufacture. The number of woollen or worsted
                    factories in 1837 was 104, situated chiefly at Aberdeen, in Clackmannanshire, at
                    Hawick, Galashiels, and Jedburgh, Roxburghshire, and in the counties of
                    Stirling, Argyle, and Inverness. Hawick has almost entirely withdrawn from this
                    species of manufacture, and devotes its energies principally to the production
                    of woollen hose, of which it annually produces about 500,000 pairs, with
                    blankets, and flannels. The towns of Stirling and Bannockburn are almost the
                    exclusive seat of tartans. Kilmarnock is chiefly celebrated for its manufacture
                    of carpets and shawls, besides large numbers of night-caps, bonnets, and
                    foraging caps for the army. Bonnets in Scotland, however, have been pretty
                    generally superseded by hats. The woollen factories, in 1837, contained 4339
                    workers, of whom 1856 were between thirteen and eighteen years of age, and 156
                    between nine and thirteen.<pb break="no"

                    The silk manufacture in Scotland is still less considerable than that of
                    woollen. The principal seats of it are at Paisley, Glasgow, and Edinburgh. Broad
                    silks, or manufactured goods of entire silk, sold by the yard, viz. gauzes,
                    Persians, satins, and, in general, all broad silks, plain or figured, are made
                    at these places, particularly the two first. Silk mills were established in
                    Edinburgh so late as the year 1838. Handkerchiefs, such as Bandanas and
                    Barcelonas, are made at Paisley and Glasgow, and a few adjacent places in
                    connexion with these towns. Paisley is celebrated for “mixed goods,” that is,
                    all varieties of manufacture in which silk forms a component part. Edinburgh is
                    eminent chiefly for its shawls of the finest fabrics, but perhaps is surpassed
                    even in this its staple silk production by Paisley. The silk factories contain
                    about 1000 workers. The whole of the factories, of all kinds, in Scotland,
                    namely, those of linen, cotton, woollen, and silk, amounted, in 1837, to 462,
                    (of which 102 are situated in Lanarkshire, 94 in Forfarshire, including Dundee,
                    Arbroath, and other manufacturing towns, and 62 in Renfrewshire,) employing
                    55,159 persons; but the number of both has increased considerably since that
                    time.</p>
                <p>Soap has long been manufactured to a very great extent in Scotland; and the
                    principal seats of the manufacture are Glasgow, Leith, Paisley, Aberdeen,
                    Prestonpans, and Montrose. The quantity made, in 1837, was 12,958,856 lbs., viz.
                    of hard soap, 9,553,855, and of soft, 3,4050,01. The quantity exported was
                    450,956 lbs., the rest being retained or home consumption. The number of
                    licences issued to soapmakers was twenty-one.</p>
                <p>The quantity of whisky produced in Scotland cannot be ascertained before the year
                    1823, because, previously to that time, owing to the high rate of duty, (5s. 6d.
                    per English wine gallon,) smuggling prevailed to a great extent in almost every
                    district of the country, particularly in the Highlands. But in 1823 the duty was
                    reduced to 2s., though subsequently, namely, in 1826 and 1830, it has been
                    successively raised to 2s. 10d. and 3s. 4d. The following table will shew the
                    quantity that paid duty for home consumption since that time:</p>

                    was 119,551 barrels annually, (the duty being 9s. 10d. per barrel,) and of table

                <p>The manufacture of kelp, which was formed by the incineration of the common
                    sea-wrack, has altogether ceased; but during the late war it was prosecuted to
                    such an extent, particularly on the shores of the Highlands and Islands, that
                    the total amount produced in Scotland was about 20,000 tons, which usually
                    brought about L.10 per ton, or L.200,000 yearly. At some periods it brought
                    L.20, at others it was as low as L.4 per ton. But since the reduction of the
                    duty on barilla and salt, the manufacture has altogether ceased.</p>
                <p>Scotland has long been famous for its fisheries, which were fora time the subject
                    of bounties and premiums on the part of government; but it is questionable
                    whether such factitious encouragement was productive of any real or permanent
                    good. Boards for protecting, extending, and encouraging the fisheries were
                    instituted in 1749, 1786, and 1808. But all bounties and premiums have now
                    ceased; and the branch of industry in question is now thriving at least as well
                    as when encumbered with factitious aid. The salmon fishery of Scotland has long
                    been very considerable. The fishery in the Tweed is the most important, not only
                    in Scotland, but in the empire, though there has of late years been a great
                    decline in the quantity caught. About the end of the late war, the Tweed fishery
                    yielded a rental of from L.15,000 to L.18,000 a-year; but owing to the falling
                    off in the quantity caught, it does not now yield above L.4000 a-year. In
                    addition to the Tweed, the other most valuable salmon fisheries are in the
                    Forth, Tay, Dee, Don, Findhorn, Spey, Ness, Conon, and other rivers throughout
                    Scotland. The London market is supplied with salmon chiefly by Scotland. The
                    total value of the salmon caught in Scotland has been estimated at L.150,000
                    a-year.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Loudon’s

                    Salmon fisheries north of the Tweed and Solway, but not these rivers themselves,
                    are to be shut from the 14th of September to the 1st of February. In the Tweed
                    and its tributary streams, the taking of salmon with the net is prohibited
                    between the 15th of October and 15th February, or with the rod between 7th of
                    November and 15th February. The Solway fisheries, according to the act of
                    Parliament, include all streams that fall into the Solway Firth, embracing the
                    Piltanton, the Luce, and the Bladenoch in Wigtonshire; the Cree, Fleet, Dee, and
                    Urr in the Stewartry of Kirkcudbright; as well as the Nith and other rivers in
                    Dumfries-shire. The close season with all of these rivers begins on the 25th of
                    September, and terminates with Piltanton, Luce, Bladenoch, and Cree, as early as
                    the 3lst of December; with the Fleet<pb break="no"

                    and the Dee on the 1st of February; and on the Solway Firth itself, properly so
                    called, including the Urr and the other streams that enter it, it extends to the
                    10th of March. The penalties for transgressing any of these regulations are
                    heavy.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Burton’s Manual

                    herring fishery has long been extensively cultivated, and much capital has been
                    invested in it. The chief seat is the east of Scotland, of which Wick, and its
                    suburb, Pultneytown, in Caithness, are important stations. Pultneytown, indeed,
                    has, owing to this circumstance, grown up with something like the rapidity of a
                    manufacturing village. During the fishing season, from 1500 to 2000 boats, each
                    averaging a crew of five men, rendezvous here. Of these about 500 belong to the
                    town; the rest resort thither from all quarters of the kingdom. Of 436,098
                    barrels of herring cured in the year ending the 5th of April 1834, no fewer than
                    134,738, or between a third and a fourth of the whole, were cured at Wick. The
                    following table contains an account of the total number of barrels of herring
                    which were cured in Scotland in the year just referred to, distinguishing the
                    stations where landed or cured:</p>

                <p>About an eighth part of the whole was cured at sea, and the remainder on shore.
                    About the same proportion was cured ungutted; the rest were gutted, and
                    generally within twenty-four hours after the fish were caught. In addition to
                    the herring, the Scottish coast abounds with various kinds of white fish, such
                    as haddock, cod, ling, and the like, as also oysters, flounders, and other flat
                    fish. the persons who carry on the white fishing reside in the sea-ports, or the
                    numerous villages on the coast. They use lines and nets, but principally the
                    former; and their business can be carried on throughout the year. Steam
                    navigation gives them a readier and a wider command of a market than they
                    formerly enjoyed. In 1834 the herring, cod, and ling fisheries employed 9,263
                    boats, decked and undecked, 48,700 fishermen and boys by whom the boats were
                    manned, 1893 coopers, and 28,645 in gutting, packing, &amp;c; the total number
                    of persons employed in these fisheries being 79,238.</p>
                <p>This article would not be complete if it did not refer, however briefly, to the
                    system of banking for which Scotland has become so celebrated. The Scottish
                    banks are joint-stock establishments with large constituencies, the National
                    bank having no fewer than 1238 partners, and the North of Scotland bank 1418;
                    and, except in the case of chartered banks, each partner is responsible to the
                    extent of his private fortune. With the chartered banks the responsibility is
                    limited; but then the charter guarantees a certain amount of capital. For
                    example, the capital of the bank of Scotland is L.1,500,000, for which sum the
                    shareholders are responsible; and of it two-thirds, or L. 1,000,000, has been
                    actually paid up. These establishments, consisting of extensive constituencies,
                    whose responsibility is unlimited, or, if chartered, possessing large capitals
                    paid up or guaranteed, enjoy the perfect confidence of the public. Besides, they
                    are severally under the management of a body of Directors chosen by the partners
                    out of their own body, and directly and periodically responsible to their
                    constituents; and under their superintendence the banking business is carried on
                    in these establishments on the most judicious and approved principles. Nor is
                    this all. The different banks periodically exchange notes with each other; in
                    Edinburgh, twice weekly, and in the country generally once a-week. Over-issuing
                    is thus completely checked, for if any one bank has, after an exchange is made,
                    an overplus of the notes of any other, this latter must redeem those notes
                    either by a payment in specie, or in Exchequer bills, or an order on the bank of
                    England. For any of these institutions to become insolvent or bankrupt seems
                    next to be impossible. Indeed, no joint-stock bank, of any importance, ever did
                    become insolvent; but in cases when, in provincial towns, such banks have
                    suspended payment, (which has happened only in a very few instances, and these
                    originating in ignorance or fraud,) the public, or the holders of their notes,
                    have suffered no loss, each partner being responsible to the amount of his
                    private fortune. The Scotch banks receive sums as low as L.10, or sometimes
                    lower, as deposits, and allow interest on them at about one, or one and a half
                    per cent. below the market rate. The system of “cash accounts” is peculiar to
                    the Scottish mode of banking. A cash account is a credit given by a bank to an
                    individual with two or more collateral securities, for a certain sum, which he
                    may draw out wholly or partially as he pleases, replacing it in the same way,
                    being charged interest only on the portion he withdraws. The act prohibiting the
                    circulation of small notes in England did not extend to Scotland; so that the
                    currency consists almost exclusively of papcr, namely, notes of the value of L.1
                    and upwards, Indeed, there is very little gold in circulation. The Scotch banks
                    draw on London at twenty days date. The Bank of Scotland, the oldest banking
                    establishment in Scotland, was established in 1695, and issued notes for L.1 as
                    early as 1704. The Royal Bank of Scotland was founded in 1727 and the British
                    Linen Company in 1746. The total number of joint-stock banks at present in
                    Scotland is 25, having altogether 306 branches. There are also seven private
                    banking establishments. The aggregate amount of the sums deposited in the
                    different Scottish banks was calculated to be in 1826 about L.20,000,000 or
                    L.21,000,000; and it must have since increased considerably. The circulatior is
                    supposed to be between L.3,000,000 and L.4,000,000 seldom exceeding the latter
                    sum.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>House of Commons’
