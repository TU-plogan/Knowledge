                    >Joinus,</hi> a sect or rather race of Hindus, found in considerable numbers in
                    different parts of India, particularly in the southern peninsula. They form a
                    class of dissenters from the established faith of Brahminism, so generally
                    considered throughout India as alone founded on an orthodox basis. They deny
                    altogether the authority of the Vedas, regarded by the genuine Hindu as file
                    holiest of books. They either disown, or sink into a subordinate station, all
                    the grand objects of Hindu veneration. In their hypothesis concerning the origin
                    of the world, they have adopted opinions which seem to partake of the character
                    of atheism. They do not, like the followers of the Vedas, acknowledge any
                    spiritual and eternal Being, from whom the universe derived its origin. The
                    material world, as well as the minds of all men and animals, are held by them to
                    be eternal. They refuse to acknowledge anything which is not, or has not been,
                    the object of the senses. Upon this principle they deny the existence of any
                    beings superior to man, and admit no objects of worship except men who have
                    raised themselves by their merits to the rank of divinities. As, however, they
                    set no bounds to the perfection which the human soul may arrive at, their most
                    eminent saints and pontiffs (amongst whom they particularly celebrate Gomat
                    Iswara Swami) partake almost of the attributes of supreme divinity. To this
                    station, however, they are exalted, not in consequence of a virtuous life, or of
                    benefits rendered to mankind, but of those excesses of absurd and extravagant
                    penance to which, throughout all India, such sovereign merit is attached. They
                    have three ranks of ascetics, whom they call <hi rend="italic">Yatis.</hi> 1 he
                    first, called <hi rend="italic">Anuvrata,</hi> can be attained only by him who
                    forsakes his family, entirely cuts off his hair, holds always in his hand a
                    bundle of peacock’s feathers and an carthen pot, and wears only clothes of a
                    tawny colour. The second rank, <hi rend="italic">Mahανratα</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> i</hi> requires that all dress should be abandoned except a mere rag
                    to cover nakedness, and that the hair instead of being shaven off, should bc
                    pulled out by the roots. He who aspires still higher, and seeks to attain the
                    third degree, or <hi rend="italic">Nirvana,</hi> throws aside even rags, and
                    remains entirely naked; he eats nothing but rice, and that only once in two
                    days. The name is nearly synonymous with that oí Deity, and he is held in nearly
                    equal veneration with the priests and rajahs, whose images are worshipped in the
                    temples. At Billicnll, or Belligola, the residence of their high priest, they
                    have a gigantic image of Gomat Iswara Swami, the foot of which is nine fcet in
                    length, so that the height of the entire statue cannot be less than fifty-four
                    fcet; and there is a similar one at Kurcul, near Mangalore. This worship of
                    gigantic images is common to them with the followers of Buddha, whom they also
                    closely resemble in their theological tenets; nay, Samana and Gaudma, the main
                    objects of Buddh veneration, are enumerated by the Jains amongst the earliest
                    and most venerated of their priests. On the other hand, they differ from them
                    entirely in being divided into four castes, distinguished from each other by the
                    same privileges and manners as amongst other Hindus. The Jains observe also
                    similar penances, carrying them only to a greater extreme. They are also
                    scrupulous to a still greater degree as to causing the death of any living
                    thing, even the minutest insect. The strictest Jains, to guard against this
                    danger, do not eat after sunset; they have always a small broom to sweep the
                    ground before them, and never drink water unless strained through a cloth. The
                    orthodox Hindus have ceremonies by which any involuntary offence of this kind
                    may be expiated; but the Jains, not allowing the efficacy of these, have no
                    means of relieving their soul from the burden of such a trespass. Like the other
                    Hindus, they consider it as unlawful for the widow to marry again, but
                    discourage the barbarous practice of sacrificing herself on the body of the
                    husband. On the whole, it w ould appear, that whilst their doctrines and belief
                    closely coincide with those of the Buddhists, their civil and social life is
                    discriminated only by minute shades from that of the Hindus. They have a system
                    of their own with regard to history, chronology, and physics, of which we need
                    only observe, that its tenets are still more extravagant and absurd than those
                    contained in the orthodox pages of the Vedas and Puranas∙ (See <hi rend="italic"
