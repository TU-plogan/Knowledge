                    of physic, professor of botany in the Royal Garden at Paris, and a member of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Academie</hi><hi rend="italic">des Sciences,</hi> was born at
                    Lyons in the year 1686, and educated at Montpellier, where he took his degree of
                    doctor of physic, after which he became associated with the faculty of Paris.
                    Although much occupied in the practice of medicine in the capital, he was
                    ardently devoted to the study of botany, having, in the earlier part of his
                    life, visited Spain and the southern provinces of France in search of plants.
                    When stationary at Paris, he communicated various essays to the academy, which
                    arc printed in its <hi rend="italic">Mémoires.</hi> These are chiefly botanical,
                    illustrating the characters or the qualities of various exotics, at that period
                    not well known; but he has given several papers also, on extraneous fossils, and
                    a few other subjects of natural history. He furnished the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >Appendices</hi> to Tourneforťs <hi rend="italic">Institutiones Rei</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Herbaria,</hi> and edited the <hi rend="italic">Icοηes</hi> of
                    Barrelier. He also published an historical account of the magnificent collection
                    of drawings of plants and animals, originally begun under the auspices of Gaston
                    duke of Orleans, and continued down to the present times. When Linnaeus visited
                    Paris in 1738, he, in a letter to Haller, mentioned the elder Jussieu, as “much
                    engaged in medical practice, well versed in the knowledge of the species of
                    plants, though too prone to multiply them, and strictly confined to the ideas
                    and principles of Tournefort.” In one important point, however, which could
                    hardly escape Linnaeus, and ought not to be forgotten, he emancipated himsclf
                    from the errors of his master, for he perfectly understood, and fully admitted,
                    the doctrine of the sexes of plants. A letter of his, completely explaining this
                    phenomenon on the most correct principles, is given by Bradley, in his <hi
                    rend="italic">Philosophical Account of the Works of Nature</hi> (p. 25-32). He
                    died of an apoplectic fit, at Paris, on the 22d of April 1758, aged
                    seventy-two.</p>

                    brother of the preceding» and, like him, a physician, and a member of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Academic des Sciences,</hi> was still more devoted to the
                    philosophical as well as practical study of botany, and ranks amongst the
                    greatest names in that science, as having first attempted to form a system
                    according to the <hi rend="italic">natural affinities of plants.</hi> He was
                    born at Lyons in 1699, and appears to have accompanied or followed his brother
                    to Paris, where hc occupied, under him, the place of botanical demonstrator in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Jardin</hi><hi rend="italic">du Roi,</hi> and at length
                    succeeded him as professor of botany. If his communications to the academy were
                    less numerous than those of his brother, they were of a rather superior
                    character. In one of them, published in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires</hi> of
                    that body for 1742, he enters on the subject, then scarcely touched by any
                    person, of the animal nature of certain marine productions, previously taken for
                    plants; and we perceive, in his inquiries, dawnings of that meridian light which
                    our countryman Ellis afterwards threw on these curious tribes. On other
                    occasions he explained the flowers of the <hi rend="italic">Litto-</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">rella,</hi> and, with much acuteness, the more obscure
                    fructification of the <hi rend="italic">Pilularia.</hi> He wrote, in conjunction
                    with the learned Comte de Caylus, on the <hi rend="italic">Papyrus;</hi> and he
                    gave an improved edition of Tourneforťs <hi rend="italic">History of the Plants
                    about Paris,</hi> in 1725.</p>
                <p>Linnaeus became personally acquainted with this ingenious man at Paris in 1738,
                    and maintained, for some years, an intimate correspondence with him. They could
                    not be long in each other’s company without discussing the natural affinities of
                    plants; a study which seems to have been much advanced, if not first excited, in
                    the mind of Linnaeus, by his correspondence with Haller. Bernard de Jussieu had
                    probably about the same time been led to consider it by his own contemplations;
                    for the system of Tournefort, in which he was educated, is too artificial in
                    principle to have given him any such ideas. In its execution, indeed, that great
                    author is led, by his own good sense, into some natural and philosophical views,
                    even in spite of his system; and these may possibly have caught the attention of
                    Jussieu. However this may be, mutual satisfaction and instruction could not but
                    flow from the intercourse of Bernard de Jussieu and Linnaeus. They traced out
                    together the characters and the limits of various natural assemblages or orders.
                    Every day produced, and every letter communicated, some new discovery. But as
                    the multifarious hordes of the north appear originally to have used one common
                    tongue, which, after they were dispersed, divided, and cultivated, when it came
                    to be written, assumed the form of various distinct languages; so these two
                    botanical philosophers, when their more intimate intercourse had ceased, pursued
                    different paths, and went far towards different conclusions. Linnaeus, after
                    throwing the whole vegetable creation, more or less completely, into natural
                    groups, became more and more persuaded that it was not only impracticable to
                    connect them by one synoptic clue or system, but that not one of his assemblages
                    or orders was capable of precise and unexceptionable definition. On the other
                    hand, Bernard de Jussieu, to the last, aimed at a general scheme of
                    classification, though he accomplished little more than throwing his several
                    orders into larger assemblages, and disposing the whole, as indeed Linnaeus
                    himself has done, in one series, according to their relationship to each other.
                    The French botanist is recorded to have spoken with great diffidence of his own
                    performance, and he has written nothing of a general classification. But be
                    often gave hints, in lectures or conversation, by which others perhaps profited.
                    This appears from the preface to the <hi rend="italic">Genera Plantarum of</hi>
                    his distinguished nephew, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu, botanical professor at
                    Paris, who, following up the ideas of his uncle, and sacrificing something to
                    technical convenience, at the expense <hi rend="italic">of</hi> nature,
                    contrived to exhibit a tolerably natural system, founded on methodical
                    principles.</p>
                <p>It would be to little purpose to discuss, at the present day, the claims of
                    Linnaeus or of Bernard de Jussieu to originality in the study of natural orders.
                    Professor de Candolle has justly asserted, that they had the sámc object in
                    view, and adopted, in the main, the same principles. Bernard de Jussieu having,
                    in a letter dated the 15th of February 1742, congratulated Linnaeus on his
                    appointment to the botanical chair at Upsal, says, “<hi rend="italic"
                    >Eloroe</hi><hi rend="italic">devotus omnino poteris viam quam monstrasti
                    facilem amplius aperire, naturalem que methodum tandem perficere, quam
                    desiderant et</hi><hi rend="italic">expectant</hi><hi rend="italic">boternophyli
                    omnes.”</hi> In a subsequent letter of the 7th May, 1746, he also tells his
                    Swedish friend, “<hi rend="italic">Scio quantum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >emolumentum receperint qui</hi><hi rend="italic">secundum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tua principia</hi><hi rend="italic">student; mcmet</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >experientia</hi><hi rend="italic">doeuit J</hi> This is enough to settle the
                    question, though great allowance is perhaps due to the modesty of Jussieu, who
                    was less disposed to honour himself than his friend.</p>

                <p>His biographer, the celebrated Marquis de Condorcet, records his singularly
                    amiable and unaffected manners. These, during his occupation of arranging,
                    according to natural classes, the garden of Trianon, attracted the notice and
                    esteem of his sovereign, Louis XV. to whom any unsophisticated character or
                    object could not but form an agreeable relaxation from the routine of a court.
                    Jussieu obtained plants and seeds to be sent to his friend in the king’s name.
                    He pursued his innocent and useful studies till his death, which happened in
                    1777, in his seventyninth year.</p>
