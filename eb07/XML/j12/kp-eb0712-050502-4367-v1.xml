                    James first preached the gospel to the dispersed Jews; and afterwards returned
                    to Judaea, where he preached at Jerusalem, when the Jews raised up against him
                    Herod Agrippa, who put him to a cruel death, about the year 4İ4. Thus St James
                    was the first of the apostles who suffered martyrdom. St Clement of Alexandria
                    relates, that his accuser was so struck with his constancy, that he became
                    converted, and suffered with him.</p>

                    in particular after his resurrection. He was the first bishop of Jerusalem, when
                    Annanias II. high priest of the Jews, caused him to be condemned and delivered
                    into the hands of the people and the Pharisees, who threw him down from the
                    steps of the temple, when a fuller dashed out his brains with a club, about the
                    year 62. His life was so holy, that Josephus considers the ruin of Jerusalem as
                    a punishment inflicted on that city for his death. He was the author of the
                    epistle which bears his name.</p>

                    instituted in 1170, under the reign of Ferdinand II. king of Leon and Gallicia.
                    Its object was to put a stop to the incursions of the Moors, these knights
                    obliging themselves by a vow to secure the roads. An union was proposed and
                    agreed to in 1170, between these and the canons of St Eloy; and the order was
                    confirmed by the pope in 1175. The highest dignity in that order is that of
                    grand-master, which has been united to the crown of Spain. The knights were
                    obliged to give proof of their descent from families that had been noble for
                    four generations on both sides; they also were required to make it appear that
                    their ancestors were neither Jews, Saracens, nor heretics, nor had ever been
                    called in question by the inquisition.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">James,</hi> the name of several kings of Scotland and of
                    Great Britain.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi> I. king of Scotland in 1423, the first of the
                    house of Stuart, was not only the most learned king, but one of the most learned
                    men, of the age in which he flourished. This ingenious and amiable prince fell
                    into the hands of the enemies of his country in his tender youth, when he was
                    flying from the snares of his unnatural and ambitious uncle, who governed his
                    dominions, and was suspected of designs against his life. Having secretly
                    embarked for France, the ship was taken by an English privateer off Flamborough
                    Head; and the prince and his attendants were confined in a neighbouring castle
                    until they were sent to London. The prince was conducted to the Tower
                    immediately after he was seized, on the 14th of April 1405 (in the thirteenth
                    year of his age), and there kept a close prisoner till the 10th of June 1407,
                    when he was removed to the castle of Nottingham, from which he was brought back
                    to the Tower on the 1st of March 1414, and there confined till the 3d of August
                    in the same year, when he was conveyed to the castle of Windsor, where he was
                    detained till the summer of 1417, when Henry V., for political reasons, carried
                    him with him into France in his second expedition. In this melancholy situation,
                    so unsuitable to his age and rank, books were his chief companions, and study
                    his greatest pleasure. That he wrote as well as read much we have his own
                    testimony, and that of all our historians who lived near his time. Bowmaker, the
                    continuator of Fordun, who was his contemporary, and personally acquainted w ith
                    him, spends ten chapters in his praise, and in lamentations for his death; and,
                    amongst other things, states that his knowfledge of the Scriptures, of law, and
                    philosophy, was incredible. Hector Boyce tells us that Henry IV. and Henry V.
                    furnished their royal prisoner with the best teachers in all the arts and
                    sciences; that by their assistance, he made great proficiency in every part of
                    learning and the fine arts; and that he became <hi rend="italic">a</hi> perfect
                    master in grammar, rhetoric, poetry, music, and all the secrets of natural
                    philosophy, and was inferior to none in divinity and law. This prince’s skill in
                    music was remarkable. Walter Bower, abbot of Inchcolm, who was intimately
                    acquainted with him, assures us that he played on eight different instruments,
                    which he names, and especially on the harp, with such exquisite skill, that he
                    seemed to be inspired.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    century after his death he was celebrated in Italy as the inventor of a new and
                    pleasing kind of melody, which had been admired and imitated in that country.
                    This appears from the following testimony of Tassoni, a writer who was well
                    informed, and of undoubted credit. “W <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> e may
                    reckon amongst us moderns, James king of Scotland, who not only composed many
                    sacred pieces of vocal music, but also of himself invented a new kind of music,
                    plaintive and melancholy, different from all other; in which he had been
                    imitated by Carlo Gesualdo, prince of Venosa, who, in our age, has improved
                    music with new and admirable inventions.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    in captivity, and encountering many difficulties on his return into his native
                    kingdom, he was murdered by barbarous assassins in the prime of life. Many of
                    the productions of his pen have perished, for only three poems that have been
                    ascribed to him are now extant, viz. Christ’s Kirk on the Green; Peebles at the
                    Play; and the King’s Quair. But slender as these remains are, they afford
                    sufficient evidence that the genius of this royal poet was not inferior to that
                    of any of his contemporaries, and that it was equally fitted for the gayest or
                    the gravest strains. (See <hi rend="italic">Poetical Remains of James I.</hi>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi> V. king of Scotland, was but eighteen months old
                    when his father fell in the battle of Flodden Field in 1513. When of age he
                    assisted Francis I. king of France against the Emperor Charles V.; a service for
                    which, in 1535, Francis gave him his eldest daughter in marriage. This princess
                    died in two years; and James married Mary of Lorraine, daughter of Claude duke
                    of Guise, and widow of Louis d'Orleans, by whom he had only one child, Mary
                    queen of Scots, born only eight days before his death, which happened on the
                    13th of December 1542, in the thirty-fifth year of his age. This was the first
                    prince of his family who died a natural death since its elevation to the throne.
                    He is said to have been the author of a humorous composition called the <hi

                    he succeeded in Scotland, as he did Elizabeth in England. He valued himself much
                    upon his polemical writings, and was so fond of theological disputations, that,
                    to keep them alive, he founded Chelsea College for the express purpose of
                    attaining this object; but it was converted to a much better use by Charles II.

                    speeches was published in one folio volume. He died in 1625, in the fifty-ninth
                    year of .his age and twenty-third of his reign.</p>

                    entered New College, Oxford, of which he became a fellow in 1593; took his
                    degree as master of arts in 1599; and having collated several manuscripts of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Philobiblion</hi> of Richard of Durham, which he published in
                    4to, dedicated to Sir Thomas Bodley, he recommended himself to the favour of
                    that munificent patron of learning, and through his influence was in 1602
                    appointed keeper of the public library, an office which he held during eighteen
                    years. In 1614 he was created doctor in divinity, promoted to the archdeaconry
                    of Wells, and about the same time presented to the rectory of Mongeham in Kent,
                    not to mention other spiritual preferments. In 1620 he resigned his situation as
                    librarian, and applied himself chiefly to the readings of old manuscripts, in
                    which he assures Archbishop Usher that he had restored three hundred citations,
                    or rescued them from corruptions. Having been chosen a member of the convocation
                    held with the parliament at Oxford in 1625, he there moved to have commissioners
                    appointed to collate the manuscripts of the fathers in all the libraries of
                    England, with the Roman Catholic editions; but as this project did not meet with
                    the desired encouragement, he himself undertook the arduous task, and continued
                    to prosecute it until his death, which took place in August 1629. He left behind
                    him a great number of learned works, the principal of which are, 1. Philobiblion
                    Ricardi Dunelmensis, 1599; 2. Cyprianus Redivivus, London, 1600; 3. Catalogus

                    in 1703; his father was a major in the army, his mother a sister of Sir Robert
                    Clarke. He was of St John’s College in Oxford, where he took the degree of
                    bachelor of arts; and afterwards practised physic at Sheffield, Lichfield, and
                    Birmingham successively. He then removed to London, and became a licentiate in
                    the college of physicians; but in what year is not know n. At London he applied
                    himself to writing, as well as practising physic; and in 1743 published a
                    Medical Dictionary, in three vols, folio. Soon afterwards he published an
                    English translation, with a supplement by himself, of <hi rend="italic">Ramaz

                    8vo. He also published, in 17⅛6, The Practice of Physic, 2 vols. 8vo; in 1760,
                    On Canine Madness, 8vo; in 1764, A Dispensatory, 8vo. In June 1755, when the
                    king was at Cambridge, James was admitted by mandamus to the doctorship of
                    physic. In 1788 were published, A Dissertation upon Fevers, and A Vindication of
                    the Fever Powder, 8vo; with A Short Treatise on the Disorders of Children. This
                    was the eighth edition of the Dissertation, the first of which had been printed
                    in 1751; and the purpose of it was to set forth the success of this powder, as
                    well as to describe more particularly the manner of administering it. The
                    Vindication was posthumous and unfinished; for he died in March 1776, whilst he
                    was employed upon it.</p>
