                <p><label type="entry">JERSEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">New</hi></label>, one of the
                    thirteen original states of the American union, is bounded on the north and
                    northeast by New York, on the east and south-east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the
                    south-west by Delaware Bay, and on the west by Pennsylvania. The extreme length
                    directly' from north to south is onc hundred and seventy miles, the mean breadth
                    is about forty-six miles, and the whole state contains an area of 7820 square
                    miles.</p>
                <p>The surface of the country presents every variety, but three marked divisions
                    maybe particularised; first, a sandy or marine section; secondly, a hilly or
                    middle section; and, thirdly, a mountainous section. The first occupies . nearly
                    one half of the area of the state. A line from the mouth of Shrewsbury River to
                    Bordentown will very nearly separate the alluvial from the hilly region. Between
                    this limit and the continuation of the blue ridge, the state is beautifully
                    variegated by rich and bold scenery. From the north to the south a succession of
                    mountains, and lesser hills and heights, interspersed with plains, stretch out,
                    each occupying a distinct and well-defined region. The mountainous portion of
                    New Jersey is the extreme northern part of the state, composed of the counties
                    of Warren and <pb break="no" facs="nls:192944861?mode=fullsize"

                    has not been very accurately determined, but the higher valleys of the latter
                    county must be from 800 to 1000 feet above the level of the sea. The descent
                    from the mountain to the hilly region is abrupt, as by the steps of a stair. A
                    remarkable difference <hi rend="italic">of</hi> temperature is experienced in
                    the space <hi rend="italic">of</hi> less than two and a half degrees of
                    latitude. The alluvial plains of the southern section have a mild or rather
                    tropical climate, resembling the eastern part of Virginia, and admit of the
                    cultivation of cotton; whilst in the counties of Sussex and Warren it is more
                    various, and, though salubrious enough, is in general less mild.</p>
                <p>The principal internal waters are Second River, Hackinsack, Passaic, Raritan,
                    Musconetcong, Rancocus, Salem, Shrewsbury, Tom’s River, Great Eggharbor,
                    Cohanzey, and Maurice River. None of these rivers are of any great length,
                    though every part of the state abounds in rapid millstreams. A connexion, by
                    means of a canal, between the Hudson and Delaware basins was completed in 1831,
                    at an expense of about 2,000,000 of dollars. The line leaves the Delaware at
                    Phillipsburgh, opposite Easton in Pennsylvania, and is carried over Warren
                    county, New Jersey, ’ to its extreme north-cast angle, about thirty miles;
                    thence eastward through Morris and Essex counties, to the Passaic River, and
                    along the valley of the latter to Newark. From that city it proceeds across
                    Passaic and Hackinsack, and winds through the Bergen Marshes to Jersey city,
                    opposite New York. Inclined planes arc used on this canal instead of locks.
                    During the year 1834 the Delaware and Raritan Rivers were connected by means of
                    a canal from Brunswick to Bordentown, a distance of above thirty miles. This
                    canal is calculated for sloop navigation; and has been constructed at an
                    expense, with its feeder, of 2,500,000 dollars. The principal railroad is the
                    Camden and Amboy, which unites the cities of New York and Philadelphia, crossing
                    the state of New Jersey. It is sixty-one miles in length, and is connected with
                    the Raritan and Delaware Canal. There is likewise a road from the manufacturing
                    village of Patterson to New York, a distance of about sixteen miles; and another
                    in progress (1835) from Jersey city, through Newark and Elizabethtown, to
                    Brunswick.</p>
                <p>New Jersey abounds in staples, composed of every product of its fields, woods,
                    mines, fisheries, and manufactories. Some parts of the state are not well
                    adapted to cultivation, being either sandy and barren, or rocky and mountainous;
                    but large portions have a soil of great fertility, well suited to the
                    cultivation of grain, and fitted for grazing; and accordingly vast numbers of
                    cattle are raised for the markets of New York and Philadelphia. Large quantities
                    of butter and cheese, of superior quality, are made; and apples, peaches, and
                    fruits of all kinds, are raised in abundance. The manufactories of Ncw Jersey
                    are extensive and thriving. Iron is probably the most important. Bog ore is
                    found in Burlington and Monmouth, and the mines of the northern counties are
                    exceedingly rich. There are a number of forges and furnaces in active operation
                    in several of the counties, and chain-cables are made at the town of Dover. The
                    towns most engaged in manufactures are Newark and Patterson. The former is noted
                    for the manufacture of leather, and the exercise of various occupations in which
                    it is employed; also for the making <hi rend="italic">of</hi> carriages, cabinet
                    ware, and fancy chairs. Patterson is chiefly noted for its manufactures· of
                    cotton, hemp, and machinery. Glass of various kinds, and in large quantities, is
                    made in different counties; and paper and gunpowder are manufactured to some
                    extent. This state is rich in mineral productions. Besides the iron already
                    mentioned, which is abundant, limestone prevails extensively. Marble and zinc
                    are found, and orcs <hi rend="italic">of</hi> gold and silver have been
                    discovered. Copper mines in Somerset and Bergen counties were wrought previously
                    to the revolution, and extensive veins arc believed to cross the state in a
                    south-westerly direction, from Schuyler mine, near Belleville, to the river
                    Delaware. Marl, well adapted for manuring the arenaceous districts, is found in
                    their vicinage. Clay <hi rend="italic">of</hi> superior quality for the arts is
                    obtained in great abundance near South Amboy; and sand, adapted for the
                    manufacture of the finest glass, is found in the county of Cumberland, from
                    which it is conveyed to the principal manufactories of the union.</p>
                <p>New Jersey is divided into fourteen counties, Bergen, Morris, Sussex, W^arren,
                    Essex, Somerset, Henderson, Middlesex, Burlington, Mónmouth, Gloucester, Salem,
                    Cumberland, and Cape May; and these are subdivided into townships. Trenton, the
                    seat of government, is on the Delaware River, at the falls, on the great route
                    between New York and Philadelphia, sixty miles south-west of the former, and
                    thirty north-east of the latter. At the foot of the falls there is an elegant
                    bridge over the Delaware, and that river is navigable for sloops and steam-boats
                    to this place. The latter ply regularly between Trenton and Philadelphia. It is
                    a handsome town, and contains a number of public buildings, amongst which the
                    most conspicuous is the state-house. Trenton contains several respectable
                    manufactories; and, in 1830, the population amounted to 3925. Newark is
                    pleasantly situated on the western bank of the Passaic River, a fcw miles from
                    its mouth. This is the handsomest town in the state, and contains several public
                    buildings and religious edifices, together with extensive manufactories of
                    different kinds. In this and the adjoining town of Orange there are valuable
                    quarries of stone for building, and numerous tanneries. The population in 1830
                    amounted to 10,953. New Brunswick is situated on the western bank of the
                    Raritan, thirty-three miles south-west of New York; and steam-boats regularly
                    ply between the two cities. The buildings of New Brunswick, which has a city
                    incorporation, arc thinly distributed over a considerable extent of ground.
                    Besides several public buildings and churches, there is a college and
                    theological seminary. The former was established by the ministers of the Dutch
                    reformed church, for the education of their clergy, and incorporated in 1770.
                    The exercises, which were suspended for several years, were revived ' in 1825,
                    under very favourable auspices. The theological seminary was established in the
                    city in 1810, by the general synod of the Dutch reformed churches, and is to a
                    certain extent connected with the college. In 1830, the population of New
                    Brunswick amounted to 7831, half of whom are of Dutch extraction. Princeton is a
                    pleasant village, eleven miles north-east of Trenton, and sixteen south-west of
                    Brunswick. Here is the college of New Jersey, founded in 1738, and which has
                    always been one of the most respectable and flourishing literary institutions in
                    the country. The college edifice is designated Nassau Hall, and it contains a
                    chapel, with sixty rooms for students. There are also buildings for the library,
                    philosophical apparatus, museum, and other purposes. There are ten instructors,
                    and above one hundred students. There is also a theological seminary at
                    Princeton, connected with which are two professors, one of didactic and polemic
                    theology, and another of ecclesiastical history. The edifice for the
                    accommodation of the institution is an elegant stone building, containing rooms
                    for one hundred students. Elizabethtown is pleasantly situated on Elizabethtown
                    Creek, which empties itself into Staten Island Sound. Vessels of twenty or
                    thirty tons come up to the town, and those of two or three hundred tons to
                    within two miles of the town. A steam-boat plies between the city of New York
                    and Elizabethtown Point. Patterson is situated on the Passaic, near the great
                    falls, in a position much admired for the romantic scenery which surrounds it.
                    It is the chief manufacturing town in the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:192944874?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-4874-0544"/> state, and in
                    1830 contained a population of 7731. The other towns are not of sufficient
                    importance to demand individual description. They have all, according to their
                    size, the usual number of public edifices and of religious houses.</p>
                <p>Great attention to the cause of public education has recently been evinced
                    throughout this state, and measures adopted which promise important results to
                    the cause of universal enlightenment. Previously to the inquiry which was
                    instituted in 1828, the system of instruction was very defective; but efforts
                    have since been made to change this state of things. A school fund, exceeding
                    250,000 dollars, is managed by trustees under the authority of the legislature,
                    and is steadily increasing; whilst a large portion of its annual income is
                    distributed amongst the several townships, and is applied, augmented by moneys
                    voluntarily raised by the townships, to the support of common schools, and
                    otherwise to extend the means of education over the whole community. With regard
                    to religion, almost every Christian denomination is represented in this state.
                    The Presbyterians have eighty-fivc churches, eighty-eight ministers, twenty
                    licentiates, and 12,519 communicants; the methodists 10,730 members; the Dutch
                    reformed churches are twenty-eight in number, with as many ministers; the
                    Baptists have thirty-four churches, twenty-one ministers, and 2324 communicants;
                    the Episcopalians twenty ministers; the Friends are numerous; and there are some
                    Congregationalists.</p>
                <p>The legislature is composed of two bodies; the legislative council and the
                    general assembly. The former is composed of fourteen members, one being returned
                    from each county; and the latter of fifty members, the counties being
                    represented by different numbers, from one to five. The governor is annually
                    appointed, and, like most of the executive, judicial, and military officers, by
                    the two houses in joint meeting. The judicial powers are, a court of chancery,
                    modelled after that in England, the governor being chancellor; a supreme court
                    of common law jurisdiction over the whole state, with a circuit court for the
                    trial of issues of fact in civil cases in each county; courts of common pleas in
                    the several counties, for the trial of civil causes; orphans’ courts, for
                    matters of testament, administration, and guardianship; and courts with
                    presiding justices of peace, for the trial of small causes. The courts of
                    criminal jurisdiction are, courts of general sessions of the peace, of oyer and
                    terminer and general jail delivery, the supreme court, and the governor and
                    council for the trial of impeachments exhibited by the house of assembly.
                    According to the official documents of 1830, the military force of the state
                    consists of 30,456 infantry, 1810 cavalry, 1886 artillery, 1115 riflemen, and 93
                    general, brigade, and staff officers, forming in all a body of 35,360 mcn.</p>
                <p>The counties of Salem and Bergen in this state were respectively very early
                    settled by the Swedes and Dutch, the latter people having emigrated from the
                    neighbouring settlement of New York. By a charter dated in 1664, Charles II.
                    granted this province to his brother James duke of York, who, having shortly
                    afterwards granted it to subordinate agents, the English were not tardy in
                    extending the settlement. In 1676, it was separated into two great divisions,
                    East Jersey and West Jersey. Each owned a separate proprietor, w ho held both
                    the rights of the soil and the powers of government; governors being appointed
                    by them for the exercise <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the latter, whilst the people
                    were allowed to elect their own representatives. In 1702, the powers of
                    government passed from the hands of the proprietors into those of Qucen Anne,
                    and the colony remained attached to the British crown until the declaration of
                    American independence. During this period the governors were nominated by the
                    crown, and the legislature, as before, chosen by the people, but afterwards
                    representing the whole community, and sitting alternately at Burlington and
                    Perth Amboy, then the principal towns <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the respective
                    divisions. From the earliest period of its history, New Jersey displayed much
                    zcal and firmness in the cause of civil and religious liberty, and was amongst
                    the earliest to resolve on independence. During the revolutionary conflict, it
                    suffered much from having been the arena where the belligerent hosts frequently
                    contended; and some of the most interesting scenes and the most arduous
                    conflicts took place within its limits. This state has the two large and
                    increasing cities of New York and Philadelphia on its borders; and, viewed in
                    every light, although much smaller than many others in the union, it may be
                    doubted whether it is not the most advantageously situated of any political
                    subdivision in the republic. The population in 1820 was 277,575, and in 1830,
                    320,779; of these, 2446 were slaves. (it. R. R.)</p>
