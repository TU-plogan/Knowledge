                <p><label type="entry">JUGURTHA</label>, king of Numidia, was son of Mastanabal and
                    a concubine; he was also grandson of Masinissa. The principal events of his life
                    are included between 134 and 106 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> He was
                    educated, along with his cousins Adherbal and Hiempsal, the sons of his uncle
                    Micipsa, and began at an early period to exhibit such strong symptoms of
                    ambition, that Micipsa felt much uneasiness respecting the succession of his
                    sons to the throne. With a view, therefore, of getting rid of Jugurtha, when the
                    Romans sent for auxiliaries in their war against Numantia, B. c. 134, Jugurtha
                    was despatched at the head of a body of troops, and it was hoped that he might
                    fall in some engagement with the enemy. The event did not correspond with his
                    expectation; for he returned to Micipsa with letters from Scipio, who commanded
                    the Roman troops, full of the most flattering expressions. When Micipsa found
                    his end approaching, he saw it necessary to change his policy in respect to
                    Jugurtha; and, hoping that gratitude might prevent him from gratifying his
                    ambitious views, he named him joint heir with his two sons Adherbal and
                    Hiempsal. But the third part of the kingdom did not satisfy Jugurtha, who began
                    immediately to take measures for getting rid of his cousins. Hiempsal was
                    murdered, and Adherbal only saved his life by a timely flight, B. c. 112. The
                    fugitive prince had recourse to Rome, where the venality of the nobility had
                    become proverbial, and made application to the senate. The bribes of Jugurtha
                    prevented an adverse decision, and commissioners were appointed to divide the
                    kingdom equally between the two princes. The most fertile and populous part of
                    Numidia was given to Jugurtha, who, finding all his schemes succeed, began
                    without delay to make war on his cousin. Having shut him up in the town of
                    Cirta, Jugurtha induced him to surrender upon promise of his life, but, in
                    contempt of all the laws of honour, put him to death. This atrocious proceeding
                    roused the indignation of the people of Rome, and the senate could no longer
                    withstand the popular feeling. War was declared, and carried on with vigour <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 111), till the Numidian prince succeeded in bribing
                    the generals sent against him. Peace was at last granted to him upon very
                    advantageous conditions, and he had even the boldness to come to Rome, where he
                    caused Massiva to be murdered, whose claims to his kingdom began to give him
                    uneasiness. Nothing could now save him from the indignation of Rome, and he was
                    ordered immediately to quit Italy. It was on leaving Rome that he is said to
                    have frequently looked back on it, and to have exclaimed, “Urbs venalis et
                    mature peritura si emptorem inveniet.” The war began <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >b.</hi> c. 110, but with little success to the Romans. Jugurtha defeated Aulus,
                    who had been sent against him, and made his troops pass under the yoke. Metellus
                    was next despatched to Africa, who, not allowing himself to be gained either by
                    the promises or bribes of Jugurtha, soon reduced him to great difficulties. He
                    took many of his chief cities, <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 109, and
                    compelled Jugurtha to apply for assistance to the Gaetulians and Moors. Marius
                    followed up the war with still greater vigour, till Jugurtha was obliged at last
                    to fly to Bocchus, who delivered him up to Sylla, then quaestor of Marius, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">b.</hi> c. 106. He was carried to Rome, where he was led in
                    triumph <pb break="no" facs="nls:192945966?mode=fullsize"

                    life has been written by Sallust, and some facts may be found in Plutarch’s <hi
