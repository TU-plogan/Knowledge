                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Berenice,</hi> grand-daughter of the preceding, and daughter
                    of Agrippa I. king of Judaea, acquired an unchaste celebrity on account of her
                    amours. She was betrothed to one Marcus, but he died before the marriage was
                    consummated. Soon after she married his uncle Herod, who, at the desire of
                    Agrippa, his brother and father-in-law, was created king of Chalcis by the
                    emperor Claudius. She lost her husband in the eighth year of the emperor
                    Claudius; and in her widowhood it was rumoured that she committed incest with
                    her brother Agrippa. To put a stop to this report, she offered herself in
                    marriage to Polemon, king of Cilicia, provided he would change his religion. He
                    accepted her offer, was circumcised, and married her. But Berenice soon left him
                    to follow her own ways; and he abandoned Judaism to return to his former
                    religion. She stood always well with her brother Agrippa, and seconded him in
                    his design of preventing the desolation of Judaea. This artful intriguante got
                    Titus into her snares; but the murmurs of the Roman people opposing an obstacle
                    to the marriage she had contemplated, there remained nothing for her but the
                    title of mistress or concubine of the emperor. During the seventeenth century
                    the French stage resounded with the amours of Titus and Berenice.</p>
