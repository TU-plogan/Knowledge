                <p><label type="entry">BONA</label>, a considerable sea-port of the territory of
                    Algiers, in the province of Constantina, called by the Arabs Bleid-el-Anet. It
                    appears to be about a mile distant from the ancient Hippo, the ruins of which,
                    consisting of broken walls and cisterns, cover a considerable extent of ground.
                    It has two good harbours, though from neglect they are becoming less commodious.
                    The French African Company once carried on a considerable trade here, exporting
                    in one year wool, wax, hides, and grain, to the value of L.28,500. Britain,
                    during the last war, by her naval superiority, compelled that company to give up
                    their settlement, and obtained to herself the cession of Bona, with some other
                    towns; but she never formed any establishment here, and the claim seems now to
                    have become obsolete. In the vicinity of Bona are extensive coral banks, the
                    seat of an important fishery, chiefly carried on by vessels from Naples, Genoa,
                    and other parts of Italy, who have generally been allowed to prosecute it
                    without molestation. In 1816, however, the Algerines, irritated by the
                    interposition of the English against the capture of slaves, suddenly attacked a
                    number of crews employed in this fishery, and committed a most barbarous
                    massacre of them. This outrage, however, immediately called forth the expedition
                    under Lord Exmouth, the triumphant issue of which prevented for a time the
                    repetition of any similar violence. Bona is sixty-six miles north-north-east of
                    Constantina, in long. 7. 45. E. lat. 36. 52. N.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Bona</hi><hi rend="italic">Dea,</hi> in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pagan Mythology,</hi> one of the names of Cybele. According to
                    some, she was a Roman lady, the wife of one Faunus, and so famous for her
                    chastity that after her death she was deified. Her sacrifices were performed
                    only by matrons, and in so secret a manner that it was death for any man to
                    intrude himself into the assembly. Cicero reproaches Clodius with having entered
                    this temple disguised as a singing woman, and by his presence polluted the
                    mysteries of the Bona Dea. What kind of mysteries these were, we learn
                    incidentally from Juvenal, sat. vi. 313, where the horrid abominations practised
                    in them are very significantly pointed at.</p>
