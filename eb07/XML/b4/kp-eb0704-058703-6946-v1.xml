                <p><label type="entry">BERMUDAS</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Somers’s
                    Islands,</hi> a cluster of small islands in the Atlantic Ocean, about four
                    hundred innumber, but for the greater part so small and barren that they possess
                    neither inhabitants nor name. The discovery of these islands, like that of many
                    others of greater note, resulted from shipwreck. Juan Bermudas, a Spaniard,
                    whose name they now bear, when on a voyage from Old Spain to Cuba with a cargo
                    of hogs, was here wrecked about the year 1522. Henry May, an Englishman,
                    suffered the same fate in 1593; and lastly, Sir George Somers shared the destiny
                    of the two preceding navigators in 1609. Sir George was the first who
                    established a settlement upon them, and, from his indefatigable labours in
                    furtherance of this object, it is due to his memory that his name should be for
                    ever identified with them. Sir George, however, died before he had fully
                    accomplished his design of colonization; but a company of one hundred and twenty
                    persons was formed in Virginia, sixty of whom, under the command of Mr Henry
                    More, proceeded to the island. England also, during his government, sent out
                    supplies both of provisions and men; and the work of cultivation was prosecuted
                    with vigour and success.</p>
                <p>An accession of inhabitants was gained during the civil wars, many having sought
                    a refuge from the tyranny of the ruling party in this distant sanctuary; and at
                    this time also the population was at the highest. The archives of the colony
                    present nothing worthy of notice after the period here referred to; tradition
                    only handing down a succession of quarrels between the governors and the
                    people.</p>
                <p>Of the vast number of islands composing this archipelago, not above twelve are
                    inhabited. The names of the principal of these are St George, Hamilton, St
                    David, Cooper, Ireland, Somerset, Nonsuch, and Long and Bird Islands. These are
                    closely connected, and in their characteristic features so similar, that they
                    may be considered and described as one island. The coast is of the most
                    dangerous description, being thickly studded with rocks, which appear and
                    disappear with the ebb and flow of the tide; and a landing is never attempted
                    without a pilot. The extreme length of the colony, from St Catherine’s Point on
                    St George’s, to the western extremity of Bermudas, is not more than twenty
                    miles; but the road continues <pb break="no" facs="nls:193196959?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-6959-0588"/> round the Great Sound to the north-east point of
                    Somerset, making the distance twenty-four miles. The greatest breadth from north
                    to south by land is about one mile and a half, and the whole contains a
                    superficies of 12,161 acres, of which not so much as one tenth is ever disturbed
                    by spade or plough. The appearance of Bermudas at first sight is highly
                    romantic, and apparently a fitting place for the scene of such a drama as the
                    1empest. But a closer inspection does not justify the first impression, and the
                    prospect becomes very monotonous. Broad fields of barren rock, and tracts of
                    evergreen cedar, are scattered over the whole island, which is also traversed by
                    numerous sheets of salt water. There are a great number of caves, some of which
                    pierce far into the land, and beautiful varieties of stalactites and stalagmites
                    fret these subterranean halls. Bermudas is miserably behind in agriculture,
                    although capable of producing all varieties of vegetables. In 1827 there was
                    only one plough in the whole colony, the spade being in more general request.
                    This neglect of internal resources may be ascribed to the facility with which
                    supplies are received from America, and also to the great varieties of excellent
                    fish with which the shores abound, withdrawing the attention of numbers of the
                    lower orders from the cultivation of the soil. The whale is an annual visitor of
                    the coast; the fishing of which being a lucrative employment, is another
                    inducement to neglect the spade. The soil is very fertile in the growth of
                    esculent plants and roots, such as potatoes, onions, cabbages, carrots, turnips,
                    peas, French beans, &amp;c. Pumpkins and melons also grow luxuriantly, but they
                    are easily destroyed by the blighting winds of the climate. The citron, sour
                    orange, lemon, and lime, grow spontaneously in great luxuriance; but the apple
                    and the peach arrive at no perfection. The climate is well adapted for the
                    grape, but the inhabitants appear to be bad horticulturists, and pay no
                    attention to the cultivation of this fruit. Medicinal plants, such as castor,
                    aloe, and jalap, grow to great perfection without culture; and coffee, indigo,
                    cotton, and tobacco, are also spontaneous products. A great quantity of
                    arrow-root is raised, which is considered of first-rate quality. Almost all the
                    occupiers of land sow a small quantity of barley; but the novel manner of
                    reaping gives it rather an unfavourable idea of the state of agriculture in that
                    quarter. An old woman furnished with a basket and a pair of scissors cuts off
                    the heads of the grain, leaving the stalk erect, which is afterwards converted
                    into bonnets. Few oxen or sheep are reared in the colony, these being supplied
                    from our North American dominions. Every species of domestic poultry excepting
                    geese is extensively propagated. Bermudas possesses no fresh-water streams, and
                    only a few wells, the water of which is brackish; but there are a great many
                    tanks, which fill during the rainy season, and afford the principal supply of
                    water. Vegetation is very rapid on these islands, there being but little variety
                    of temperature in the different seasons. Spring may be said never to forsake
                    them, and accordingly the fields and forests are clad with a mantle of perpetual
                    green. The climate, however, is by no means healthy, and only a short residence
                    is necessary to cause the germs of constitutional disease to appear. The yellow
                    fever also visits them, and typhus has lately made its appearance. Storms of
                    thunder and lightning are not unfrequent, and hurricanes more or (ess violent
                    generally pay an autumnal visit. The inhabitants foretell the approach of these
                    by the appearance of a halo round the moon which precedes them.</p>
                <p>There are only two small towns in Bermudas, St George’s and Hamilton, each of
                    which has a mayor and other civic officers. The former was the capital until Sir
                    James Cockburn removed the senate and courts of justice to Hamilton, which being
                    centrally situated, is much more convenient. There is little display of
                    architectural taste in these places, the buildings being both disproportioned
                    and irregularly huddled together. They are built of sandstone, veins of which
                    are everywhere found. Limestone is also abundant. There are three signal
                    stations, one at St George’s, another at Mount Langton, and a third at Gibb’s
                    Hill, at each of which a small party of soldiers is stationed. A detachment of
                    engineers and two companies of the line are stationed on Ireland Island. A
                    dock-yard and several other public works have been lately built, for the
                    erection of which 700 convicts were sent out. A superb mansion for the naval
                    commissioner has also lately been erected. The church establishment at Bermudas
                    is composed of onc archdeacon, four rectors, and a curate, exclusive of the
                    chaplain of the dock-yard. Schoolmasters from England are in general request,
                    and handsome emoluments are held out to them. The laws of Bermudas are enacted
                    by the governor and council, and the house of assembly, subject to the approval
                    and confirmation of the government at home; the constitution in this, as in
                    other respects, being similar to that of our other colonies in the western
                    hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The population of Bermudas amounts to about 10,000, of which nearly the one half
                    are slaves. The imports amount to about L.l 1,000, and the exports to L.35,000
                    annually. It is 1200 leagues distant from the Madeiras, 400 from Hispaniola, and
                    200 from Cape Hatteras in Carolina, which is the nearest land. The north point
                    of these islands is situated in long. 63. 28. W. lat. 32. 34. N.</p>
