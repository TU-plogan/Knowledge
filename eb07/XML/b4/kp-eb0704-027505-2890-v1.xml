                <p><label type="entry">BACON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Roger</hi></label>, a Franciscan
                    friar of great genius and learning, was born near Ilchester in Somersetshire in
                    the year 1214. He began his studies at Oxford, but in what school or college is
                    uncertain. Thence he removed to the university of Paris, which in those times
                    was esteemed the centre of literature. Here, we are told, he made such rapid
                    progress in the sciences, that he was esteemed the glory of that university, and
                    was much caressed by several of his countrymen, particularly by Robert
                    Greathead, afterwards bishop of Lincoln, his friend and patron. About the year
                    1240 he returned to Oxford, and, assuming the Franciscan order, prosecuted his
                    favourite study of experimental philosophy with unremitting ardour and
                    assiduity. In this pursuit, in experiments, instruments, and scarce books, he
                    tells us he spent, in the space of twenty years, no less than L.2000, which, it
                    seems, was given him by some of· the heads of the university to enable him to
                    continue his interesting inquiries. But such extraordinary talents, and
                    astonishing progress in sciences which, in that ignorant age, were totally
                    unknown to the rest of mankind, whilst they raised the admiration of the more
                    intelligent few, failed not to excite the envy and malice of his illiterate
                    fraternity, who found no difficulty in possessing the vulgar with the notion
                    that Bacon dealt with the devil. Under this pretence he was restrained from
                    reading his lectures; his writings were confined to his convent; and, finally,
                    in 1278, he was himself imprisoned in his cell. At this time he was sixty-four
                    years of age. Nevertheless, being permitted the use of his books, he persevered
                    in the rational pursuit of knowledge, corrected his former labours, and wrote
                    several curious pieces. When he had been ten years in confinement, Jerome de
                    Ascoli being elected pope, Bacon solicited his holiness for release, but did not
                    immediately succeed in his object. However, towards the latter end of that
                    pope’s reign he obtained his liberty, and spent the remainder of his life in the
                    college of his order, where he died in 1294, in the eightieth year of his age,
                    and was buried in the Franciscan church. Bale and others have enumerated a
                    multitude of pieces as written by Bacon, and existing in manuscript in various
                    collections. Several of his tracts were published in the work entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">Epistolae Fratris Rogeri Baconis de Secretis Operibus Artis et
                    Naturoe, et de Nullitate Magiae.</hi> Paris, 1542, 4to; Basil, 1593, 8vo. His
                    <hi rend="italic">Opus Majus,</hi> which forms a sort of digest of his preceding
                    writings, remained unpublished till 1733, when it was given to the world in a
                    handsome folio volume by Dr Jebb. Some of his chemical tracts maybe found in the
                    <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus Chemicus,</hi> published in an octavo volume at
                    Frankfort in 1603 and 1620. By an attentive perusal of his works, the reader
                    will find that Roger Bacon was a great linguist and a skilful grammarian; that
                    he was well versed in the theory and practice of perspective; that he understood
                    the use of convex and concave glasses, the <hi rend="italic">camera
                    obscura,</hi> burning-glasses, &amp;c.; that he was conversant in geography and
                    astronomy; that he knew the great error in the calendar, assigned the cause, and
                    proposed the remedy; that he understood chronology well; that he was in all
                    probability the inventor of gun-powder; that he possessed considerable knowledge
                    in the medical art; and that he was an able mathematician, logician, and
                    theologist.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bacon,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir Nicholas,</hi> lord keeper
                    of the great seal in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, was born at Chislehurst in
                    Kent in 1510, and educated at the university of Cambridge, after which he
                    travelled in France, and made some stay at Paris. On his return he settled in
                    Gray’s Inn, and applied himself with such assiduity to the study of the law,
                    that he quickly distinguished himself; and, on the dissolution of the monastery
                    of St Edmund’s Bury in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192903?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2903-0276"/> Suffolk, he had a grant from King Henry VIΠ., in
                    the thirty-sixth year of his reign, of several manors. In the thirty-eighth of
                    the same king he was promoted to the office of attorney in the court of wards,
                    which was a place both of honour and profit. In this office he was continued by
                    King Edward VI.; and in 1552 he was elected treasurer of Gray’s Inn. His great
                    moderation and consummate prudence preserved him through the dangerous reign of
                    Queen Mary. In the very dawn of that of Elizabeth he was knighted; and on the
                    22d of December 1558, the great seal of England having been taken from Nicholas
                    Heath, archbishop of York, was delivered to him, with the title of Lord Keeper;
                    and he was also made one of the queen’s privy council. He had a considerable
                    share in the settling of religion; and, as a statesman, he was remarkable for a
                    clear head and wise counsels. But his great parts and high preferment were far
                    from raising him in his own estimation, as appears from the modest answer he
                    gave Queen Elizabeth when she told him his house at Redgrave was too little for
                    him: “Not so, madam,” returned he; “but your majesty has made me too great for
                    my house.” After having held the great seal more than twenty years, this able
                    statesman and faithful counsellor was suddenly removed from the scene of his
                    labours. He had been under the hands of his barber, and, thinking the weather
                    warm, had ordered á window before him to be thrown open; but he fell asleep as
                    the current of fresh air was blowing in upon him, and awakened some time after
                    distempered all over. Hc was immediately removed into his bed-chamber, where he
                    died a few days after, on the 26th of February 1578-9, equally lamented by the
                    queen and her subjects. He was buried in St Paul’s, where a monument was erected
                    to him, which was destroyed by the great fire of London in 1666. Mr Granger
                    observes that he was the first lord keeper who ranked as lord chancellor; and
                    that he had much of that penetrating genius, solidity, judgment, persuasive
                    eloquence, and comprehensive knowledge of law and equity, which afterwards shone
                    forth with so great splendour in his illustrious son.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bacon,</hi><hi rend="italic">John,</hi> academician, born
                    24th November 1740, who may be considered as the founder of the British school
                    of sculpture, and whose works are still its greatest boast, was the son of
                    Thomas Bacon, cloth-worker in Southwark, whose forefathers possessed a
                    considerable estate in Somersetshire.</p>
                <p>At the age of fourteen he was bound apprentice in Mr Crispe’s manufactory of
                    porcelain at Lambeth, where he was at first employed in painting the small
                    ornamental pieces of china, but soon attained the distinction of being modeller
                    to the work. The produce of his labour was devoted by him, from his earliest
                    years, towards the support of his parents. While thus engaged, he had an
                    opportunity of seeing the models executed by different sculptors oí eminence,
                    which were sent to be burned at an adjoining pottery. An observation of these
                    productions appears to have immediately determined the direction of his genius;
                    and his progress in the imitation of them was no less rapid than his propensity
                    to the pursuit was strong. His ardour and unremitting diligence are best proved
                    by the fact, that the highest premiums given by the Society for the
                    Encouragement of Arts in those particular classes in which he was a competitor,
                    were adjudged to him nine times between the years 1763 and 1776. During his
                    apprenticeship he likewise formed the design of working statues in artificial
                    stone, which he afterwards carried to perfection.</p>
                <p>Mr Bacon first attempted working in marble about the year 1763, and, during the
                    course of his early efforts in this art, was led, by the resources of his
                    genius, to improve the method of transferring the form of the model to the
                    marble (technically called <hi rend="italic">getting out the points),</hi> by
                    the invention of a more perfect instrument for this purpose, and which has since
                    been adopted by many sculptors both in this and other countries.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The invention has sometimes
                    been erroneously ascribed to Monsieur Hudon, a French sculptor.</p></note> The
                    advantages which this instrument possesses above those formerly employed are,
                    its greater certainty and exactness, that it takes a correct measurement in
                    every direction, is contained in so small a compass as not to encumber the
                    workman, and is transferable either to the model or the marble, as may be
                    required, without the necessity of a separate instrument for each.</p>
                <p>In the year 1769 the first gold medal given by the Royal Academy was adjudged to
                    Bacon, and in 1770 he was associated by that body. His first work in sculpture
                    was a bust of his majesty George HL, intended for Christ Church College. It is
                    said, that of sixteen different competitions in which he engaged with other
                    artists, he was unsuccessful in one case only. His knowledge of the antique
                    style was for a time called in question; and on occasion of the doubts which
                    were raised on this point, he is reported to have modelled his head of Jupiter
                    Tonans, as the most satisfactory method of repelling the charge. The objection
                    probably originated from the circumstance, that in some of his principal works
                    the figures were represented in the costume of modern times, of which his statue
                    of Justice Blackstone at All Souls College, Oxford, and that of Howard in St
                    Paul’s Cathedral, are remarkable examples. But his genius was not subjected to
                    the trammels of this or of any one style exclusively. Many of his emblematical
                    figures are designed after the purest models, and in a taste altogether
                    classical. Among several of this character, the monument to Mrs Draper, in the
                    cathedral of Bristol, is exquisitely simple. In his later productions, likewise,
                    particularly those of a monumental kind, he introduced frequent examples of the
                    ancient style; as in the well-known monument to the earl of Chatham in
                    Westminster Abbey, that to Lord Robert Manners, and others which might be
                    mentioned. “Another marble, scarcely finished at the time of his death,” says
                    Dallaway, in his <hi rend="italic">Anecdotes of the Arts in England,</hi> “will
                    secure him a lasting fame for originality and classical taste. It is the
                    cenotaph lately erected in Westminster Abbey tθ the poet Mason. A muse, holding
                    his profile on a medallion, reclines on an antique altar, on which are
                    sculptured, in relief, a lyre, the tragic masque and laurel wreath; all of the
                    most correct form, as seen on ancient sarcophagi oi the pure ages.”</p>
                <p>On the 4th of August 1799 Mr Bacon was suddenly attacked with an inflammation of
                    the bowels, which occasioned his death in little more than two days. He died in
                    his 59th year, leaving a widow, his second wife, and a family of six sons and
                    three daughters.</p>
                <p>Of his merit as a statuary, the universal and established reputation of his works
                    has afforded the decisive proof “The works of Bacon, Bankes, Nollekins, λVilton,
                    and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192916?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2916-0277"/> Flaxman,” says Dallaway, and to these might now
                    perhaps be added other names of nearly equal promise, “will rescue the present
                    age from being totally indebted to foreigners for perfection in statuary.” The
                    various productions of this artist which adorn St Paul’s Cathedral, Christ
                    Church and Pembroke Colleges, Oxford, the Abbey Church at Bath, and Bristol
                    Cathedral, give ample testimony to his oowers; above all, those great and
                    prominent works among the monuments in Westminster Abbey.</p>
                <p>But it was not as an artist only that Mr Bacon was esteemed; -he was no less
                    distinguished by the firmness of his mind, and the uprightness of his private
                    character. His principles were deeply founded, and the virtues which he strove
                    to attain were measured by a standard more unbending than the mere dictates of
                    feeling or of a cultivated taste. He was an avowed believer in the truths of the
                    Christian religion; and in him this belief exhibited its corresponding effects,
                    by producing a consistent influence upon his whole character and conduct. In
                    this manner, the strength of his principles, and the reality of his conviction,
                    were daily manifested throughout his life, than which, no test of sincerity is
                    more unequivocal, no instruction more useful, and no recommendation more
                    persuasive.</p>
                <p>Mr Bacon was remarkable for the simplicity of his manners, and was in all things
                    devoid of ostentation. Of the general powers of his mind, and particularly of
                    his acute and just perception in matters of taste connected with his art, a very
                    favourable opinion will be formed by those who peruse the article <hi
