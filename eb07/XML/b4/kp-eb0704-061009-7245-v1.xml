                    province of Agra, and formerly the capital of an independent state. The rajah,
                    who was one of the principal chieftains of the tribe of Jauts, possessed a
                    considerable territory and several forts on the south-western bank of the Jumna.
                    In 1818 the total area of this state was rather less than 5000 square miles.
                    Bhurtpore is a place of great extent, the circumference of the town and fort is
                    above eιg∏ <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> miles, and it is everywhere strongly
                    fortified, being suι-rounded by a mud wall of great height and thickness, wit
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193197258?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-7258-0611"/>
                    . <hi rend="subscript"> a</hi> very wide and deep ditch. The fort stands at the
                    eastern extremity of the town; its situation is more elevated, its walls are
                    higher, and its ditch is of greater width and depth. It is of a square figure;
                    one side overlooking the country, while the other three are within the town. The
                    ditch, from the nature of the ground, may be easily filled with water, and then
                    it presents a formidable obstacle to a besieging army. It was in 1700 that the
                    tribe of Jauts first attracted notice in Hindostan. They migrated from the Indus
                    into the province of Mooltan, and were allowed to settle in several parts of the
                    country between the Ganges and the Jumna. They are, according to Bishop Heber,
                    the finest people in point of bodily advantages and martial spirit that he had
                    seen in India; and their country is one of the most fertile and best cultivated.
                    The fortress of Bhurtpore was erected by one of their chiefs out of the plunder
                    which he had carried off from Aurungzebe’s army during its last march towards
                    the Deccan. He transmitted this stronghold to his successors, and it was held by
                    Runjeet Sing at the time the British advanced into central India. In 1803 a
                    treaty of perpetual friendship was concluded between him and General Lake; but,
                    notwithstanding this, he espoused the declining cause of Holkar in 1805, and
                    admitted his routed army into the fortress of Bhurtpore. Lord Lake arrived
                    before the place on the 3d of January 1805, and commenced a series of operations
                    against it, more sanguinary than any that had ever occurred in the annals of
                    Indian warfare. The British army, from its limited numbers compared with the
                    extent of the place, acted under every disadvantage. Their operations were
                    confined to one point, and the besieged consequently could easily procure
                    supplies to any amount from the surrounding country. Undismayed by these
                    obstacles, Lord Lake made four successive attempts to storm the fortress, in all
                    of which he was repulsed with great slaughter; his loss amounting, in killed and
                    wounded, to about 3000. The rajah, notwithstanding his success, fearing that
                    British courage and skill would ultimately prevail, sent his son to Lord Lake’s
                    camp with the keys of the fortress, and agreed to compel Holkar to quit
                    Bhurtpore. A second treaty was then concluded with the rajah, and several
                    additional precautions adopted to secure his fidelity. This signal overthrow of
                    the British by the Jauts, the defenders of Bhurtpore, was celebrated all over
                    India, and was by many regarded as the forerunner of their expulsion from
                    Hindostan. But in the lapse of twenty years an opportunity occurred for a new
                    trial of strength, which terminated in the complete triumph of the British arms.
                    A dispute occurred in the family of the rajah respecting the succession; the
                    cousin having usurped the inheritance of the son, Bulwunt Sing, the rightful
                    heir. Sir David Ochterlony prepared to expel the usurper, but was restrained by
                    orders from the governor-general. Afterwards, however, it was determined to
                    attack this great stronghold; and on the 10th December 1825 Lord Combermere
                    assumed the command of the British army before Bhurtpore. As it was vain to
                    batter in breach, on account of the extraordinary thickness of the wall, the
                    besiegers proceeded by mining; and by the 17th of January a practicable breach
                    was made. On the 18th, at eight o’clock in the morning, the signal was given for
                    the assault; and in the course of two hours every gateway and bastion, and the
                    whole rampart surrounding the town, with the gates of the citadel, were in
                    possession of the besiegers, and thus forever effaced the transient stain which
                    the former failure <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> 1t Bhurtpore had cast on the
