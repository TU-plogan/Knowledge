                    learned Italian, was born at Florence on the 25th <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    September 1726. Having been left an orphan in his infaney, he was supported by
                    his uncle, Joseph Bandini, a lawyer of some note. He received his education
                    among the Jesuits, and discovered an early passion for the study of antiquities.
                    A desire which he also manifested to distinguish himself as a poet was
                    fortunately checked by the ill suecess of his first attempt; and, from that
                    period, he devoted himself principally to literary history and archaeological
                    seience. The celebrated Dr Lami, with whom he had the good fortune to contract a
                    friendship, assisted him with his counsels, and encouraged him to persevere in
                    that path to whieh his genius seems to have directed him.</p>
                <p>In the year 1747 Bandini undertook a journey to Vienna, in company with the
                    bishop of Volterra, to whom he acted in the capacity of secretary. He was
                    introduced to the emperor, and took the opportunity of dedieating to that
                    monareh his <hi rend="italic">Specimen Litteraturce Florentinae,</hi> which was
                    then printing at Florence. In the following year he , returned by the way of
                    Veniee, Padua, Ferrara, and Bologna, and united himself in friendship with the
                    learned men in all these cities. Having resided some time at Florence, he
                    repaired to Rome, and entered into orders, passing the whole of his time in the
                    library of the Vatican, and in those of the Cardinals Passionei and Corsini. At
                    that time the famous obelisk of Augustus was disinterred from the ruins of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Campus Martius.</hi> Bandini, by the order of Benedict XIV.,
                    undertook to describe and explain this eurious monument; but finding that the
                    air of Rome was injurious to his health, he returned to Florence. In 1750 lie
                    was selected by Alexander Marueelli to take charge of the valuable library whieh
                    his unele. the Abbé Franeis Marueelli had left, and whieh, according to the will
                    of the founder, was to be open to the public. But he had scarcely entered upon
                    the duties of this eharge when the proprietor died, after bequeathing all his
                    effects to the library, and appointing the Abbé Bandini perpetual librarian and
                    his testamentary exeeutor. It required two years to liquidate the succession and
                    to form the complete catalogue of this vast library, whieh was at length opened
                    to the publie in the year 1752. In 1756 he was preferred by the emperor to a
                    prebend at Florence, and appointed principal'librarian to the Laurentian
                    library. During forty-four years he continued to discharge the duties of this
                    situation, and died in 1800, generally esteemed and regretted. On his death-bed
                    he founded a public sehool, and bequeathed the remainder of his fortune to other
                    eharitable purposes.</p>
                <p>The first work by whieh Bandini beeame known as a man of letters was his <hi
                    rend="italic">Dissertatio de Veterum Saltationibus,</hi> which he wrote at the
                    age of twenty-two, and which was inserted by his learned friend Lami in the
                    fifth volume of the works of Meursius, published in 1745. The most remarkable of
                    his other works are, 1. Specimen Lit-teraturae Florentinae Seeuli XV. &amp;e. 2

                    some of the minor Greek poets, whieh he enriehed with notes and various
                    readings. These were Callimachus; the two poems of Nieander on Poisons and
                    Antidotes; the Phenomena of Aratus; the Poems of Musaeus; those of Coluthus on

                    and the golden verses of Pythagoras. The Greek text of these poems was earefully
