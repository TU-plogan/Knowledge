                <p><label type="entry">BARONET</label>, a dignity or degree of honour next below
                    that of baròn, and above that of knight, with precedency of all knights
                    excepting those of the Garter, and the only knighthood that is hereditary.</p>
                <p>The dignity of baronet is generally conferred by patent, and forms the lowest
                    degree of honour that is hereditary. The order was instituted by King James I.
                    at the suggestion of Sir Robert Cotton in 1611, when two hundred baronets were
                    created at once, being the number to which it was intended they should always be
                    restricted; but it is now enlarged at the king’s pleasure, without limitation.
                    Originally, the creation of this order seems to have been merely an expedient to
                    raise money in the name of fees, which, in each case, amounted to about L.1200
                    sterling.</p>
                <p>Baronets take precedence according to the dates of their patents, conformably to
                    the terms of which, no intermediate honour between barons and baronets can be
                    established. The title or prefix of <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> is granted them
                    by a peculiar clause in their patents, thoug!ι they be not dubbed knights.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Baronets</hi><hi rend="italic">of Scotland,</hi>
                    called also <hi rend="italic">Baronets of Nova Scotia.</hi> This order of
                    knights baronets was instituted by Charles I. in the year 1625, when the first
                    person dignified with the title was Sir Robert Gordon of Gordonstone, a younger
                    son of the earl of Sutherland. The object of the institution was to encourage
                    the plantation and settlement of Nova Scotia in North America: hence the king
                    granted to each of them a certain portion of land in this province, which they
                    were to hold of Sir William Alexander, afterwards earl of Stirling, with
                    precedency to <pb break="no" facs="nls:193194567?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-4567-0404"/> them and thcir heirs-male for ever, before all
                    knights called <hi rend="italic">equites aurati,</hi> all lesser barons called
                    <hi rend="italic">lairds,</hi> and all other gentlemen, except Sir William
                    Alexander, his majesty’s lieutenant in Nova Scotia, his heirs, their wives and
                    children. It was further provided that the title of <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi>
                    should be prefixed to their Christian name, and Baronet added to thcir surname;
                    and that their own and their eldest sons’ wives should enjoy the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Lady, Madam,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Dame.</hi></p>
                <p>Mr Malone has given the following curious note upon this subject, in his very
                    learned <hi rend="italic">Life of Dryden,</hi> prefixed to his edition of the
                    prose works of that writer :—“When the order of baronets was first established
                    in 1611, King James engaged that they should not exceed two hundred. However,
                    toλvards the close of his reign, that number being completed, and the creation
                    of baronets being found a useful engine of government (the courtier by whose
                    influence the title was obtained receiving usually L.1000 for the grant), it was
                    not lightly to be parted with. A scheme, therefore, of creating <hi
                    rend="italic">Baronets of Scotland</hi> was devised, which, it was conceived,
                    would be no infraction of the original compact, to confine the grants to a
                    limited number; and as the English baronets were created under the great seal of
                    England, for the reduction of Ulster in Ireland, so the Scottish baronets were
                    created under the great seal of Scotland, for the reduction of Acadia, or <hi
                    rend="italic">Nova Scotia.</hi> The scheme, however, was not carried into
                    execution by King James; but early in the rcign of his successor several
                    Scottish baronets were made. From this statement it appears, that there is no
                    more necessity for calling a baronet created under the great seal of Scotland
                    (whether he be an Englishman or Scotchman), <hi rend="italic">ο,Baronct of Nova
                    Scotia,</hi> than there is to denominate one created under the great seal of
                    England a <hi rend="italic">Baronet of Ulster.”</hi> (Malone’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Dryden,</hi> vol. i. p. 28-9.)</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Baronets</hi><hi rend="italic">of Ireland.</hi> This
                    order was likewise instituted by King James I. in the 18th year of his reign,
                    for the same purpose and with the same privileges within the kingdom of Ireland
                    as had been conferred on the analogous order in England; for which also the
                    Irish baronets paid the same fees into the treasury of Ireland.</p>
