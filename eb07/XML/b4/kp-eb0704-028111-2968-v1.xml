                <p><label type="entry">BAGPIPE</label>, a musical instrument, of the wind kind,
                    chiefly used in Scotland and Ireland, but not uncommon in some of the
                    mountainous districts of Italy, particularly in Calabria. The peculiarity of the
                    bagpipe, from which indeed it takes its name, is, that the air which blows it is
                    collected in a leathern bag, whence it is propelled by the arm into the pipes.
                    These pipes consist of a bass and tenor or rather treble, and they are different
                    according to the species of the pipe. The bass part is called the <hi
                    rend="italic">drone,,</hi> and the tenor or treble part the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chanter.</hi> In all the species the bass never varies from its uniform note,
                    and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193192981?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-2981-0282"/> therefore very deservedly gets the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">drone;</hi> the compass of the chanter is likewise very limited.
                    There is a considerable difference between the Highland and Lowland bagpipe of
                    Scotland; the former being blown with the mouth, and the latter with a small
                    bellows; though this difference is not essential, every species of bagpipe being
                    capable, by a proper construction of the reeds, of producing music either with
                    the mouth or bellows. The following are the species of bagpipe most commonly
                    known in this country.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Irish Pipe</hi> is the softest, and in some respects the
                    most melodious of any. The chanter, like that of all the rest, has eight holes
                    or ventiges, like the English flute, and is played on by opening and shutting
                    these as occasion requires; the bass consists of two short drones and a long
                    one. The lowest note of the chanter is D on the German flute, being the open
                    note on the counter-string of a violin; the small drone, one of them being
                    commonly stopped up, is tuned in unison with the note above this, and the large
                    one to an octave below; so that a great length is required in order to produce
                    such a low note, on which account the drone has sometimes two or three turns.
                    The instrument is tuned by lengthening or shortening the drone till it sounds
                    the note desired.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Highland Bagpipe</hi> consists of a chanter and two short
                    drones, which sound in unison the lowest note of the chanter except one. This is
                    exceedingly loud, and almost deafening if played in a room; and is therefore
                    mostly used in the field for marches, and at a distance. It requires a
                    prodigious blast to sound it, so that those unaccustomed to it cannot imagine
                    how Highland pipers can continue to play for hours together, as they are
                    frequently known to do. For the same reason, those who use the instrument are
                    obliged either to stand on their feet or walk when they play. This instrument
                    has but nine notes; its scale, however, has not yet been reduced to a very
                    regular standard in comparison with that of other instruments, so that little
                    can be said as to its compass. Those who are acquainted with it, however, affirm
                    that it plays only the natural notes, without being capable of variation by
                    flats or sharps. Pipe-music is now written out according to a peculiar
                    notation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Scottish Lowland Pipe</hi> is likewise a very loud
                    instrument, though less so than the former. It is blown with bellows, and has a
                    bass like the Irish pipe. This species is different from all the rest, as it
                    cannot play the natural notes, but has F and C sharp. The lowest note of a good
                    bagpipe of this kind is unison with C sharp on the tenor of a violin tuned to
                    concert pitch; and, as it has but nine notes, the highest is D in alt. From this
                    peculiar construction, the Highland and Lowland bagpipes play two species of
                    music essentially different, as each of them also is from every other species of
                    music in the world. Hence these two species of bagpipes deserve notice as
                    curiosities; for the music which they play is accompanied with such peculiar
                    ornaments, or what are intended as such, that neither violin, nor even organ,
                    can imitate it, except in a very imperfect manner. This kind of bagpipe was
                    formerly very much used in Scotland at weddings and other festivals; being
                    indeed extremely well calculated for playing that peculiar species of Scottish
                    music called reels. It ĥas often been matter of surprise how this was possible,
                    as the instrument has only a compass of nine or ten notes at the utmost, and
                    which cannot be varied, as in other instruments; but within this range it will
                    play an inconceivable variety of tunes. As its notes are naturally high, there
                    is scarce any one tune that is not transposed by it, so that w hat would be a
                    flat note on the key proper for the violin may be a sharp one on the bagpipe;
                    and although the latter cannot play any flat note, it may never theless in this
                    manner play tunes which on other instruments would be flat, to as great
                    perfection as these instruments themselves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">Small Pipe</hi> is remarkable for its diminutive size, the
                    chanter not exceeding eight inches in length; for whieh reason the ventiges are
                    so near each other, that it is with difficulty they can be closed. This pipe has
                    only eight notes, the lower end of the chanter being commonly stopped to prevent
                    the slurring of all the notes, which is unavoidable in the other species; so
                    that in the hands of bad players they become the most shocking and
                    unintelligible instruments imaginable. But, by having the lower ventige closed,
                    and also by the peculiar way in which the notes are expressed, this pipe plays
                    all its tunes in the manner called by the Italians <hi rend="italic"
                    >staccato,</hi> and cannot slur at all. It has no species of music peculiar to
                    itself, and can play nothing which cannot be much better executed upon other
                    instruments; although it is surprising what volubility skilful performers on
                    this instrument display, and how far they are able to overcome its natural
                    disadvantages. Some of this species, instead of having drones like the others,
                    have their bass parts consisting of a winding cavity in a kind of short case,
                    and are tuned by opening these to a certain degree by means of sliding covers,
                    from which contrivance they are called <hi rend="italic">shuttle-pipes.</hi>
                    Besides these there are a variety of others called <hi rend="italic">Italian,
                    German, Organ,</hi> &amp;c. bagpipes, which have nothing different in their
                    construction from those above described, nor any good quality to recommend
                    them.</p>
