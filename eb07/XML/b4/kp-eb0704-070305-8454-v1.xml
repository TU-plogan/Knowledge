                    ichthyologist and helminthologist, born at Anspach about the year 1730. He was
                    of the Jewish nation, and his parents being indigent, his early education was
                    much neglected; but having entered into the employment of a surgeon at Hamburg,
                    he supplied the deficiency by his own exertions, and made great progress in the
                    study of anatomy, as well as in the other departments of the medical sciences.
                    He established himself as a physician at Berlin, and found means to collect
                    there a valuable museum of the subjects of all the three kingdoms of nature, as
                    well as an extensive library; and these objects often attracted to his house an
                    assemblage of the most accomplished naturalists of his age and country.</p>
                <p>He applied himself, however, more particularly to those parts of natural history
                    which are the most connected with the practice of physic; and, on occasion of a
                    prize question of the academy of Copenhagen, he entered into a very elaborate
                    examination of the different species of worms which are found in the bodies of
                    other animals. In his essay on this subject, to which the prize was adjudged, he
                    maintains that the parasitical species are only found within the animal body;
                    and since they often occur in the foetus, and in cavities which are completely
                    inclosed, he infers that they must be generated in some unknown way, and not
                    taken in with the food in the form of eggs. For the general remedy in cases of
                    worms in the intestinal canal, he recommends large draughts of cold water,
                    followed by cathartics. He has added to his Essay a complete classification and
                    description of all the species of intestinal worms, accompanied by figures.</p>
                <p>Μ. Bloch also published a variety of papers on different subjects of natural
                    history, and of comparative anatomy and physiology, in the collections of the
                    various academies of Germany, Holland, and Russia, particularly in that of the
                    Friendly Society of Naturalists at Berlin. But his great work was his <hi
                    rend="italic">Ichthyology,</hi> which occupied the labour of a considerable
                    portion of his life. His attention was first directed to the subject by
                    receiving a present of a species of salmon, which he could not find described in
                    the Linnaean <hi rend="italic">System of Nature;</hi> and he discovered a number
                    of similar omissions in Artedi, and in all former ichthyologists. He accordingly
                    undertook to collect into one work everything that was known respecting the
                    natural history of fishes, and to give figures of all the species; and he passed
                    several summers by the sea side, and among fishermen and their nets, comparing
                    the descriptions of authors with nature, and taking bold sketches of the most
                    interesting subjects, not uncommonly on board of the very boats which furnished
                    them. His publication was encouraged by a large subscription, and it passed
                    rapidly through five editions in German and in French. He made little or no
                    alteration in the systematical arrangement of Artedi and Linné, although he was
                    disposed to introduce some modifications into the classification, depending on
                    the structure of the gills, especially on the presence or absence of a fifth
                    gill, without a bony arch; a character which affords some useful subdivisions of
                    several genera. To the number of genera before established, he found it
                    necessary to add nineteen ncw ones; and he described 176 new species, many of
                    them inhabitànts of the remotest parts of the ocean; and by the brilliancy of
                    their colours, or the singularity of their forms, as much objects of popular
                    admiration as of scientific curiosity.</p>
                <p>In 1797 he paid a visit to Paris, where he was secure of finding a variety of
                    collections of such subjects of natural history as had been inaccessible to him
                    on the shores of the Baltic; and he returned to Berlin by way of Holland. FIis
                    health, w,hich had hitherto been unimpaired, began now to decline. He went to
                    Carlsbad for its recovery, but his constitution was exhausted, and he died there
                    on the 6th of August 1799. (Coquebert in <hi rend="italic">Rapport de la Société
