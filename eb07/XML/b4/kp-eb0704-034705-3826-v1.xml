                <p><label type="entry">BANKRUPT</label>, a person publicly declared to be in debt
                    beyond his power of payment. Bankruptcy is distinguishable from insolvency. An
                    insolvent is one who owes more than he can pay; he becomes a bankrupt when that
                    inability is proclaimed by some public or judicial proceeding.</p>
                <p>In England one is made bankrupt only by the issuing of a commission under the
                    great seal, which deprives him of all his funds, and vests them in certain
                    commissioners, to be assigned, managed, sold, and divided among his
                    creditors.</p>
                <p>In Scotland a person may be made bankrupt either, 1⅛ by a judicial process called
                    sequestration, analogous to the English commission, by which his estate and
                    effects are taken from him and vested in a trustee, to be managed and divided
                    among his creditors; or, <hi rend="italic">⅝Jhj,</hi> by imprisonment for debt,
                    or by absconding, taking sanctuary, or defending himself against the officers
                    sent to arrest him.</p>
                <p>The law for regulating bankruptcy has had in view chiefly, persons engaged in
                    trade: and the object in both countries has been to preserve the funds of a
                    debtor on the eve of failure from being secreted, or placed in the hands of
                    confidants, or given to favourite relations; to prevent the bankrupt from
                    dealing unequally with his creditors on the eve of his failure; to place his
                    estates and funds under economical management, in order that they may be
                    realised, and the price divided among his credi- <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi>
                    θ ascertain the true amount of his debts; to have <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi>
                    fair distribution made at certain terms; and to provide or the safety of the
                    debtor’s person, where he has dealt justly with his creditors, and given up
                    every thing fairly or their payment. There is also ingrafted upon this
                    proceeding, in either country, a mode of stopping short, after due inquiry into
                    the amount of the debts and value of the funds, and enabling a certain large
                    majority of the creditors to make an agreement, which shall bind the whole,
                    whereby the proceedings are superseded, immediate payment of part of the debts
                    accepted as a composition for the whole, and the rest of the debt discharged.

                <p>Provisions have also been made in both countries for regulating the interests of
                    creditors, and the evil of imprisonment for debt, where the insolvent debtor is
                    not engaged in trade. A short account of the laws established in both countries
                    for regulating both those states of insolvency may be useful.</p>

                    rend="italic">Commission of bankruptcy against persons engaged in trade.—</hi>
                    The law relating to the bankruptcy of persons engaged in trade is consolidated
                    in one statute, 6 Geo. IV. c. 16. Where a trader or manufacturer either commits
                    certain acts with the intent of defeating or delaying his creditors; or, having
                    been arrested, lies for twenty days in prison; or declares himself insolvent,
                    and gives notice thereof in the Gazette; a commission may, on the petition of a
                    creditor making oath of debt to the amount at least of L.I00, be issued by the
                    Lord Chancellor under the great seal, appointing certain persons called
                    commissioners of bankrupts to take order and direction with the body of the
                    bankrupt, and his lands, estates, and funds of all kinds, and to make sale
                    thereof for payment and satisfaction to the creditors. Notice is immediately
                    published in the Gazette, and certain days are named, on whieh the bankrupt is
                    to appear before the commissioners, and be examined in presence of his
                    creditors; and the creditors are to appear and prove their debts, the
                    commissioners having large inquisitorial powers for discovery of the bankrupt’s
                    funds. After the creditors have proved their debts, they are empowered to choose
                    trustees, to whom the estate shall be assigned by the commissioners, in order to
                    be sold and converted into money for division; and among the estates and funds
                    so to be assigned are comprehended, lsŕ, all goods and chattels in the
                    possession, order, disposition, and reputed ownership, of the bankrupt; 2√, all
                    lands, debts, goods, &amp;c. which, after insolvency, and without adequate
                    consideration, the bankrupt shall have conveyed or transferred to his children
                    or others; <hi rend="smallcaps">3íZ,</hi> all property and effects transferred
                    or affected by contracts or other dealings, or by executions or attachments
                    subsequent to an act of bankruptcy, provided the party concerned have had notice
                    of such act of bankruptcy, or that it shall have taken place within two calendar
                    months of the commission. The assignees are ordered to make dividends among the
                    creditors at certain periods, as the funds shall be realized, notice being given
                    in the Gazette; and the bankrupt may be discharged from all his debts on
                    procuring a certificate signed by a certain proportion of his creditors in
                    number and value, and having it sanctioned by the Lord Chancellor, on hearing
                    any objections which may be stated against the discharge. But no bankrupt can
                    thus be discharged who has lost money at play, or by stockjobbing, to a certain
                    amount; or who has destroyed his books, or made false entries, or concealed his
                    property, or been privy to the proving of fictitious debts on his estate.
                    Finally, the whole proceeding under the commission may be superseded by the Lord
                    Chancellor, if, after the bankrupt shall have passed his last examination, proof
                    shall be given to him of an offer of composition made by the bankrupt or his
                    friends, and acceded to by nine tenths of the creditors in number and value.</p>

                    made in England, by occasional or temporary acts, for relieving insolvent
                    persons not within the bankrupt laws, imprisoned for debt. But in 1820 a new
                    court was established for the purpose of affording permanently the means of such
                    relief, 1 Geo. IV. c. 119, and 5 Geo. IV. c. 61. The court consists of a chief
                    and three commissioners, to sit in London, called <hi rend="italic">the Court
                    for relief of Insolvent Debtors.</hi> Any person in custody for debt within the
                    walls of a prison in England is entitled to apply to this court, by summary
                    petition, for his discharge from prison, and to have future liberty of his
                    person from all debts due by him at the date of the petition, upon delivering a
                    correct schedule of all his debts, and of all property and assets of every kind,
                    and assigning every thing (except wearing apparel, bedding, &amp;c. to the value
                    oí L∙20), to the officer of the court, for the satisfaction of his creditors; to
                    be by him made over to assignees appointed by the court, to sell and distribute
                    the proceeds. Provision is made for due notice to the creditors, for the
                    investigation of debts claimed, for the proper disposal of all the property, for
                    the duly accounting of the assignees; and all conveyances and preferences given
                    to creditors within three months are declared void. The prisoner’s right to a
                    discharge from prison is to be judged of by the court, on hearing the creditors
                    and examining the prisoner; and the court is empowered to discharge him from
                    prison if satisfied with his conduct, or to prolong his imprisonment in their
                    discretion (not, however, exceeding three years), where he has concealed funds,
                    destroyed books, &amp;c. The court has power, where the debtor is not to be
                    discharged, to order the creditor or creditors at whose suit he is detained, to
                    pay to the prisoner a sum not exceeding four shillings by the week, on failure
                    of which the prisoner is to be discharged. To avoid the expense of proceedings
                    in London, the court may order the investigations to proceed in the court-house
                    of the assize-town of the county; one of the commissioners of the court there
                    attending, with all the powers of the court. And the court may appoint examiners
                    to assist in the necessary investigations in counties. A prisoner found entitled
                    to the benefit of the act is not liable to imprisonment for debts due previous
                    to these proceedings, unless he shall succeed to or acquire property, and refuse
                    to assign it to the assignees, for the benefit of his creditors; in which case
                    the assignees may· <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> Pply 1° have him remanded to

                <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Bankruptcy of persons engaged in trade.—</hi> By 54 Geo.
                    III. c. 137, a judicial proceeding, called sequestration, is authorized to be
                    issued by the Court of Session, on the petition of an insolvent trader or
                    manufacturer in Scotland, with concurrence of a creditor swearing to a debt of
                    L.100, or of a creditor to that amount without the concurrence of the debtor,
                    provided the insolvency have been followed by imprisonment, absconding, or
                    taking sanetuary, or by the execution of certain judicial warrants, if he be
                    privileged from arrest. By this process the whole estates and effects of the
                    debtor, real and personal, are placed under sequestration, to the effect of
                    being made over to a trustee, as soon as the creditors can meet and choose a fit
                    person; for which purpose a day is appointed, and notice given in the Gazette.
                    The property is in the meanwhile managed by a factor, appointed by the
                    creditors; and the trustee, when chosen, has the whole property assigned to him,
                    and is entitled to recover, for the benefit of the creditors, all property and
                    effects made over to confidential persons after insolvency, or conveyed to
                    creditors in satisfaction or security of previous debts, within two months
                    before sequestration or imprisonment. The trustee’s duty is to bring the whole
                    estate to sale, with certain precautions; to receive and investigate the claims
                    <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of the creditors, and to reject or admit them,
                    subject to review of the Court of Session by summary petition. At certain
                    appointed times he is required to make successive dividends, till the whole
                    funds shall be exhausted. The debtor and his family must submit to public
                    examinations on oath before the sheriff of the county in which his trade was
                    carried on; and he may receive a judicial protection from arrest, if four fifths
                    of his creditors in number and value shall think him entitled to it, and the
                    trustee shall certify his conduct to be unexceptionable. And on the same
                    conditions he may, after a certain time, be discharged of all his debts by the
                    court, after hearing any creditor in opposition. The whole may also be
                    superseded by composition, if (after the examinations as to the funds, and the
                    lapse of sufficient time for the creditors to appear) a proposal of composition
                    shall be made by the bankrupt, and assented to by nine tenths of the creditors
                    in number and value: the court may judicially sanction it by discharging the
                    bankrupt of all his debts on payment of the composition.</p>
                <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Bankruptcy of persons not engaged in trade.—</hi> By a
                    statute in the end of the seventeenth century (1696, c. 5) the Scottish
                    parliament provided, that any person insolvent and imprisoned upon caption, or
                    taking sanctuary, or absconding, or defending himself by force against arrest,
                    shall be deemed a bankrupt; and the effect of this is, lsí, that no preference
                    given to one creditor over others within two months previous to the bankruptcy
                    shall be effectual; 2&lt;7, that all attachments of goods, debts, &amp;c. within
                    the same term shall be unavailing to give preference to the creditor using them;
                    3ď, that the debtor may apply to the Court of Session to be discharged from
                    prison, after a month’s imprisonment, on making a complete <hi rend="italic"

                    effects; the court having power to judge of his right to such discharge, and to
                    prolong his imprisonment (or rather to refuse his discharge), according to his
                    conduct. His future acquisitions are liable to be attached by his creditors.</p>
