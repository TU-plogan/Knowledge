                <p><label type="entry">BOCHART, <hi rend="smallcaps">Samuel</hi></label>, one of the
                    most learned men of the seventeenth century, was born atRoucn in Normandy in the
                    year 1599. He early made great progress in learning, and became a proficient in
                    the oriental languages. He was many years pastor of a Protestant church at Caen,
                    and became tutor to Wentworth Dillon, earl of Roscommon, and author of the Essay
                    on Translated Verse. While at Caen, he particularly distinguished himself by his
                    public disputations with Father Veron, a Jesuit, and celebrated as a polemic.
                    The dispute was held in the castle of Caen, in the presence of a great number of
                    Catholics and Protestants, including among the former the duke of Longueville.
                    Bochart came off with great honour; and his reputation was not a little
                    increased, in the year 1646, by the publication of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Phαleg</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chanaan,</hi> which are the titles of the two
                    parts of his <hi rend="italic">Geographia Sacra.</hi> He also acquired great
                    fame by bis <hi rend="italic">Hierozoicoη,</hi> printed in London in 1675, which
                    treats of the sacred animals of Scripture. The great learning he displayed in
                    his works rendered him esteemed not only among those of his own <pb break="no"

                    but amongst all lovers of knowledge, of whatsoever denomination. In 1652,
                    Christina, queen of Sweden, invited him to Stockholm: he repaired thither
                    accompanied by Huet, and was very well received. On his return to Cacn he
                    resumed the functions of the ministry, married, and was received into the
                    academy of that city. Bochart was a man of profound erudition; he possessed a
                    thorough knowledge of the principal oriental languages, including the Hebrew,
                    Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic; and such was his zeal for extending his
                    acquirements, that at an advanced age he wished to learn Ethiopie. He was also
                    remarkable for modesty and candour; but, like all scholars who have become
                    deeply imbued with the language which has formed the favourite object of their
                    studies, he saw Phoenician, and nothing but Phoenician, in every thing, even in
                    the words of the Celtic; and hence the prodigious number of chimerical
                    etymologies which swarm in his works. He died on the 16th of May 1667, in the
                    sixty-eighth year of his age. A complete edition of his works was published at
                    Leyden, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Sam. Bochart Opera O&gt;nnia: hoc
