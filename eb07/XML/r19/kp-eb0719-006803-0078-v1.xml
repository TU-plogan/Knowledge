                <p><label type="entry">RAMUS</label> Peter, was one of the most celebrated
                    professors of the sixteenth century. Hewas born in Picardy in 1515. A thirst for
                    learning prompted him, when very young, to repair to Paris, and he was admitted
                    as a servant in the college of Navarre. Spending the day in waiting on his
                    masters, and the greater part of the night in study, he made such surprising
                    progress, that, when he took his degree as master of arts, he offered to
                    maintain a doctrine quite opposite to that of Aristotle. This raised him many
                    enemies; and the first two books he published, <hi rend="italic">Institutiones
                    Dialecticoe</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aristotelicoe Animadversiones,</hi>
                    occasioned great disturbances in the university of Paris. The opposition against
                    him was not a little heightened by his deserting the Catholic religion, and
                    professing that of the Reformed. Being thereby forced to retire from Paris, he
                    visited the universities of Germany, and received great honours wherever he
                    went. He returned to France in 1571, and lost his life miserably during the
                    massacre of St Bartholomew’s day. He was a great orator, a man of general
                    learning, and endowed with fine moral qualities. He published many books, which
                    Teissier enumerates. Ramus’s merit in his opposition to Aristotle, and his
                    firmness in undermining his authority, is unquestionably very great. But it has
                    been doubted, and with much reason, whether he was equally successful in his
                    attempts to form a new logical institute. The following general outline of his
                    plan is given in Dr Enfield’s History of Philosophy. “Considering dialectics as
                    the art of deducing conclusions from premises, he endeavours to improve this
                    art, by uniting it with that of rhetoric. Of the several branches of rhetoric,
                    he considers invention and disposition as belonging equally to logic. Making
                    Cicero his chief guide, he divides his treatise on dialectics into two parts,
                    the first of which treats of the invention of arguments, the second of
                    judgments. Arguments he derives not only from what the Aristotelians call middle
                    terms, but from any kind of proposition, which, connected with another, may
                    serve to prove any assertion. Of these he enumerates various kinds. Judgments he
                    divides into axioms, or self-evident propositions, <hi rend="italic"
                    >dianoea,</hi> or deductions by means of a series of arguments. Both these he
                    divides into various classes; and illustrates the whole by examples from the
                    ancient orators and poets.</p>
                <p>“In the logic of Ramus, many things are borrowed from Aristotle, and only appear
                    under new names; and many others are derived from other Grecian sources,
                    particularly from the dialogues of Plato, and the logic of the Stoics. The
                    author has the merit of turning the art of reasoning from the futile
                    speculations of the schools to forensic and common use; but his plan is
                    defective in confining the whole dialectic art to the single object of
                    disputation, and in omitting many things, which respect the general culture of
                    the understanding and the investigation of truth. Notwithstanding the defects of
                    his system, we cannot, however, subscribe to the severe censure which has been
                    passed upon Ramus by Lord Bacon and others; for much is, we think, due to him
                    for having with so much firmness and perseverance asserted the natural freedom
                    of the human understanding. The logic of Ramus obtained great authority in the
                    schools of Germany, Great Britain, Holland, and France; and long and violent
                    contests arose between his followers and those of the Stagyrite, till his fame
                    vanished before that of Descartes.”</p>
