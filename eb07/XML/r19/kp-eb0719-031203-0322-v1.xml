                <p><label type="entry">ROHAN</label> Henry Duke of, peer of France, and prince of
                    Leon, was born at the Chateau de Blein, in Brittany, in 1579. Henry IV. under
                    whose eye he gave distinguished proofs of his bravery at the siege of Amiens,
                    when only sixteen years of age, loved him with as much affection as if he had
                    been his own son. After the death of Henry, he became chief of the Calvinists in
                    France; and was equally formidable for his genius as his sword. In defence of
                    the civil and religious rights of his party, he maintained three wars against
                    Louis XIII. The first, which terminated to the advantage of the Protestants,
                    broke out when that prince wished to establish the Romish religion in Bearn; the
                    second, because of the siege which Cardinal de Richelieu ordered to be laid to
                    Rochelle; and the third, when that place w <hi rend="superscript">τ</hi> as
                    besieged a second time. The consequences of this war are sufficiently known:
                    Rochelle surrendered, and the duke de Rohan, perceiving, that after the taking
                    of this place, the majority of his party were endeavouring to make up matters
                    with the court, succeeded in procuring for them a general peace in 1629, upon
                    very honourable and advantageous terms. There is a very particular anecdote of
                    him, extracted from the Memoirs of the Duchess of Rohan, Margaret of Bethune,
                    daughter of the famous Sully. While the duke de Rohan was at Venice, a proposal
                    was made to him from the Porte, that for 200,000 crowns, and an annual tribute
                    of 20,000, the grand signior would give him the island of Cyprus, and fully
                    invest him with the dignity and prerogatives of king. The duke was warmly
                    inclined to comply with this proposal, and to settle in the island the
                    Protestant families of France and Germany. He negoci-ated this business at the
                    Porte by means of the intervention of the patriarch Cyril, with whom he had much
                    correspondence; but different circumstances, and in particular the death of the
                    patriarch, contributed to break off the treaty. The republic of Venice chose
                    Rohan for their commander in chief against the Imperialists; but Louis XIII.
                    took him from the Venetians, and sent him ambassador into Switzerland, and into
                    the Grisons. He wished to assist these people in bringing back La Valteline
                    under their obedience, the revolt of which the Spaniards and Imperialists
                    encouraged. Rohan, being declared general of the Grisons, after many victories
                    drove the German and Spanish troops entirely from La Valteline in 1633. He again
                    defeated the Spaniards in 1636, at the banks of the lake of Come. France, not
                    thinking it proper to withdraw her troops, the Grisons rose up in arms, and the
                    duke de Rohan, not satisfied with the conduct of the court, entered into a
                    special treaty with them on the 28th of March 1637. This hero, fearing the
                    resentment of Cardinal de Richelieu, retired to Geneva, with a view to join his
                    friend the duke of Saxe-Weimar, who wished him to undertake the command of his
                    army, then ready to engage the Imperialists near Rhinfeldt. Although he declined
                    this honour, yet he took the command of the regiment of Nassau, with which he
                    threw the enemy into confusion; but was himself wounded, 28th February 1638, and
                    died of his wounds the 13th of April following, at the age of fifty-nine. He
                    wrote several interesting performances: 1. The Interests of Princes, printed at
                    Cologne in 1666, in 12mo; in which work he fully examines the public interests
                    of all the princes of Europe. 2, The Perfect General, or an</p>
                <p>Abridgement of the Wars from Casar's Commentaries, in 12mo. Here he makes it
                    appear, that a knowledge of the tactics of the ancients might be of much use to
                    the modems.</p>
                <p>3. A Treatise on the Corruption of the Ancient Militia.</p>
                <p>4. A Treatise on the Government of the thirteen Provinces. 5. Memoirs; the best
                    edition of which is in two vols. 12mo. They contain the history of France from
                    1610 to 1629. 6. A Collection of some Political Discourses on State Affairs,
                    from 1612 to 1629, 8vo, Paris, 1644, 1693, 1755; with the Memoirs and Letters of
                    Henry Duke de Rohan relative to the War of La Valteline, three vols. 12mo,
                    Geneva, 1757. This was the first edition which appeared of these curious
                    memoirs: we owe it to the great attention and diligence of Baron de Zurlauben,
                    who published them from different authentic manuscripts. He likewise ornamented
                    this edition with geographical, historical, and genealogical notes, and a
                    preface, which contains an abridged but highly interesting life of the duke de
                    Rohan, author of the memoirs.</p>
