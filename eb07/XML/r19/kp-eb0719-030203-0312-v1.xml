                <p><label type="entry">ROBINS</label> Benjamin, an ingenious mathematician, was born
                    at Bath in 1707. His parents were Quakers of low condition, and consequently
                    were unable to have him much instructed in human learning; but his own
                    propensity to science having procured him a recommendation to Dr Pemberton at
                    London, by his assistance, while he attained the sublimer parts of mathematical
                    knowledge, he commenced teacher of the mathematics. But the business of
                    teaching, which required confinement, not suiting his active disposition, he
                    gradually declined it, and engaged in business that required more exercise.
                    Hence he tried many laborious experiments in gunnery, from the persuasion that
                    the resistance of the air has a much greater influence on swift projectiles than
                    is generally imagined. Hence also he was led to consider the mechanic arts that
                    depend on mathematical principles; as the construction of mills, the building of
                    bridges, the draining of fens, the rendering of rivers navigable, and the making
                    of harbours. Among other arts, fortification much engaged his attention; and lie
                    met with opportunities of perfecting himself by viewing the principal strong
                    places of Flanders, in some tours which he made with persons of distinction.</p>
                <p>Upon his return from one of these excursions, he found the learned amused with Dr
                    Berkeley’s work entitled “The Analyst,” in which an attempt was made to explode
                    the method of fluxions. Mr Robins was therefore advised to clear up this subject
                    by giving a distinct account of Sir Isaac Newton’s doctrines, in such a manner
                    as to obviate all the objections that had been made, w ithout naming them.
                    Accordingly he published, in 1735, “A Discourse concerning the Nature and
                    Certainty of Sir Isaac Newton’s Method of Fluxions ;” and, some exceptions being
                    made to his manner of defending Newton, he afterwards wrote two or three
                    additional discourses. In 1738, he defended the same great philosopher against
                    an objection contained in a note at the end of Baxter’s <hi rend="italic">Matho,
                    sive Cοsmotheoria puerilis;</hi> and the following year printed Remarks on
                    Euler’s Treatise of Motion, on Dr Smith’s System of Optics, and on Dr Jurin’s
                    Discourse of distinctand indistinct Vision, annexed to Smith’s work. In the mean
                    while, Mr Robins did not solely confine himself to mathematical subjects; for in
                    1739 he published, without his name, three pamphlets on political affairs. Two
                    of them, relating to the convention and négociation with Spain, were so highly
                    esteemed as to occasion his being employed in a very honourable post: on a
                    committee being appointed to examine into the past conduct of Sir Robert
                    Walpole, he was chosen their secretary.</p>
                <p>In 1742, Mr Robins published a small treatise entitled</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="ht:wu.89119129625&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=313"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0719-0313-0303"/>
                <p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> New</hi> Principles of Gunnery,”
                    containing the result of many experiments; and a discourse being published in
                    the Philosophical Transactions, in order to invalidate some of his opinions, he
                    thought proper, in an account which he gave of his book in the same
                    Transactions, to take notice of those experiments. In consequence of this
                    discussion, several of bis Dissertations on the Resistance of Air were read, and
                    the experiments exhibited before the Royal Society, for which he was presented
                    by that honourable body with a gold medal.</p>
                <p>In 1748 appeared Lord Anson’s Voyage round the World, which, though Mr Walter’s
                    name is in the title, has been generally thought to be the work of Robins.
                    Walter, chaplain on board the Centurion, had brought it down to his departure
                    from Macao for England, when he proposed to print the work by subscription. It
                    was however, it is said, thought proper that an able judge should review and
                    correct it, and Robins was appointed; when, upon examination, it was resolved
                    that the whole should be written by Robins, and that Walter’s papers should only
                    serve as materials. Hence the introduction entire, and many dissertations in the
                    body of the work, it is said, were composed by him, without receiving the least
                    assistance from Walter’s manuscript, which chiefly related to the wind and the
                    weather, the currents, courses, bearings, distances, the qualities of the ground
                    on which they anchored, and such particulars as generally fill up a sailor’s
                    account. No production of this kind ever met with a more favourable reception:
                    four large impressions were sold within a twelvemonth; and it has been
                    translated into most of the languages of Europe. The fifth edition, prilled at
                    London in 1749, was revised and corrected by Robins himself. In the corrigenda
                    and addenda to the first volume of the Biographia Britannica, printed in the
                    beginning of the fourth volume of that work, it is however stated that Robins
                    was only consulted with respect to the disposition of the drawings, and that he
                    had left England before the book was printed. Whether this be the fact, as it is
                    asserted to be by the widow of Mr Walter, it is not for us to determine.</p>
                <p>Robins was soon afterwards desired to compose an apology for the unfortunate
                    affair at Prestonpans. It was prefixed as a preface to “The Report of the
                    Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on their Examination into the
                    conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope ;” and this preface was esteemed a
                    masterpiece in its kind. He afterwards, through the interest of Lord Anson,
                    contributed to the improvements made in the Royal Observatory at Greenwich.
                    Having thus established his reputation, he was offered the choice of two
                    considerable employments; either to go to Paris as one of the commissaries for
                    adjusting the limits of Acadia, or to be engineer-general to the East India
                    Company. He chose the latter, and arrived in the East Indies in 1750; but the
                    climate not agreeing with his constitution, he died there the year
                    following.</p>
