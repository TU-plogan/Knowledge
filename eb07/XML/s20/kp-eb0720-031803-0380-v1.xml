                <p><label type="entry">SHORT, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, an eminent
                    optician, was born in Edinburgh, on the 22d of June in the year 1710. At ten
                    years of age, having lost his father and mother, and being left in a state of
                    indigence, he was received into Heriot’s Hospital, where he soon displayed his
                    mechanical genius, in constructing for himself little chests, book-cases, and
                    other conveniences, with such tools as fell in his way. At the age of twelve he
                    was removed from the Hospital to the High School, where he shewed a considerable
                    taste for classical literature, and generally kept at the head of his forms. In
                    the year 1726 he entered the university, where he passed through the usual
                    course of education, and took his master’s degree with great applause.</p>
                <p>By his friends he was intended for the church; but after attending a course of
                    theological lectures, his mind revolted from a profession which be thought
                    little suited to his talents, and he devoted his whole time to mathematical and
                    mechanical pursuits. He had been fortunate enough to have the celebrated
                    Maclaurin for his preceptor, who having soon discovered the bent of his genius,
                    and made a proper estimate of the extent of his capacity, encouraged him to
                    prosecute those studies in which nature had qualified him to make the greatest
                    figure. Under the eye of that eminent master, he began in 1732 to construct
                    Gregorian telescopes; and, as the professor observed in a letter to Dr. Jurin,
                    “by taking care of the figure of his specula, he was enabled to give them larger
                    apertures, and to carry them to greater perfection than had ever been done
                    before him.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1736 Mr. Short was called to London, at the desire of Queen Caroline,
                    to give instructions in mathematics to the Duke of Cumberland; and immediately
                    on his appointment to that honourable office, he was elected a fellow of the
                    Royal Society, and patronized by the Earls of Morton and Macclesfield. In the
                    year 1739 he accompanied the former of these noblemen to the Orkney Isles, where
                    he was employed in adjusting the geography of that part of Scotland; and happy
                    it was for him that he was so employed, as he might otherwise have been involved
                    in a scuffle which took place between the retainers of Sir James Stewart of
                    Barra and the attendants of the earl, in which some of the latter were
                    dangerously wounded.</p>
                <p>Mr. Short having returned to London, and finally established himself there in the
                    line of his profession, was, in 1742, employed by Lord Thomas Spencer to make
                    for him a reflector of twelve feet focus, for which he received six hundred
                    guineas. He made several other telescopes of the same focal distance with
                    greater improvements and higher magnifiers; and in 1752 finished one for the
                    king of Spain, for which, with its whole apparatus, he received twelve hundred
                    pounds. This was the noblest instrument of the kind that had then been
                    constructed, and perhaps it has never yet been surpassed, except by the
                    astonishing reflectors of Herschel.</p>
                <p>Mr. Short used to visit the place of his nativity once every two or three years
                    during his residence in London, and in 1766 he visited it for the last time. On
                    the 15th of June 1768 he died, after a very short illness, at Newington Butts,
                    near London, of a mortification in his bowels, and was buried on the 22d of the
                    same month, having completed his fifty-eighth year.</p>
