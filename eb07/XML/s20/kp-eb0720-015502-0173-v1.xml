                <p><label subtype="homonym" type="entry"><hi rend="smallcaps">Serpent</hi></label>,
                    in <hi rend="italic">Mythology,</hi> was a common symbol of the sun, and he is
                    represented biting his tail, and with his body formed into a circle, in order to
                    indicate the ordinary course of this luminary. The serpent was also the symbol
                    of Medicine, and of the gods which presided over it, as of Apollo and
                    AEsculapius; and this animal was the object of very ancient and general worship,
                    under various appellations and characters. In most of the ancient rites we find
                    some allusion to the serpent, under the several titles of Ob, Ops, Python, and
                    the like. This idolatry is alluded to by Moses. The woman at Endor who had a
                    familiar spirit is called Oub, or Ob, which is interpreted Pythonissa. The place
                    where she resided, says Bryant, seems to have been named from the worship there
                    instituted; for Endor is compounded of <hi rend="italic">En-adοr,</hi> and
                    signifies <hi rend="italic">fons Pythonis,</hi> “the fountain of light,” the
                    oracle of the god Ador, which oracle was probably founded by the Canaanites, and
                    had never been totally suppressed. His pillar was also called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Abbadir</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Abadir,</hi> compounded of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ab</hi> and <hi rend="italic">adir,</hi> and meaning the serpent deity Addir,
                    the same as Adorns.</p>
                <p>In the orgies of Bacchus, the persons who partook of the ceremony used to carry
                    serpents in their hands, and with horrid screams call upon Eva, being, according
                    to the writer just mentioned, the same as epha or opha, which the Greeks
                    rendered <hi rend="italic">ophis,</hi> and by it denoted a serpent. These
                    ceremonies and this symbolical worship began among the Magi, who were the sons
                    of Chus; and by them they were propagated in various parts. Wherever the
                    Ammonians founded any places of worship, and introduced their rites, there was
                    generally some story of a serpent. There was a legend about a serpent at
                    Colchis, at Thebes, at Delphi, and at other places. The Greeks called Apollo
                    himself Python, which is the same as Opis, Oupis, and Oub.</p>
                <p>In Egypt there was a serpent named Thermuthis, which was looked upon as sacred;
                    and the natives arc said to have made use of it as a royal tiara, with which
                    they ornamented the statues of Isis. The kings of Egypt wore high bonnets,
                    terminating in a round ball, and surrounded with figures of asps; and the
                    priests had likewise the representation of serpents upon their bonnets.</p>
                <p>Abadon, or Abaddon, mentioned in the Revelations (xx. 2), is supposed by Bryant
                    to have been the name of the Ophite god, with whose worship the world had been
                    so long infected. This worship began among the people of Chaldaea, who built the
                    city of Ophis upon the Tigris, and were greatly addicted to divination and to
                    the worship of the serpent. From Chaldaea the worship passed into Egypt, where
                    the serpent deity was called Canoph, Can-eph, and C-neph. It had also the name
                    of Ob or Oub, and was the same as the Basiliscus or royal serpent, the same as
                    the Thermuthis, and made use of by way of ornament to the statues: of<pb

                    xml:id="kp-eb0720-0174-0156"/> their gods. The chief deity of Egypt is said to
                    have been Vulcan, who was styled Opas. He was the same as Osiris, the Sun; and
                    there were pillars sacred to him, with curious hieroglyphical inscriptions
                    bearing the same name, whence, among the Greeks, who copied from the Egyptians,
                    every thing gradually tapering to a point was styled obelos, or obeliscus.</p>
                <p>As the worship of the serpent began among the sons of Chus, Bryant conjectures,
                    that from thence they were denominated AEthiopians and Aithiopians, from Ath-ope
                    or Ath-opes, the god whom they worshipped, and not from their complexion. The
                    AEthiopes brought these rites into Greece, and called the island where they
                    first established them, <hi rend="italic">Ellopia, Solis Serpentis insula,</hi>
                    the same with <hi rend="italic">Euboea,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Oubaia,</hi>
                    “the serpent island.” The same learned writer discovers traces of the
                    serpent-worship among the Hyperboreans, at Rhodes, in Phrygia, and upon the
                    Hellespont; in the island Cyprus, in Crete, among the Athenians; in the name of
                    Cecrops, among the natives of Thebes in Boeotia, among the Lacedaemonians, in
                    Italy, in Syria; and in the names of many places, as well as of the people,
                    where the Ophites settled. One of the most early heresies introduced into the
                    Christian church was that of the Ophitae. (Bryant’s Analysis of Ancient
                    Mythology, vol. i. p. 43 and 473.)</p>
