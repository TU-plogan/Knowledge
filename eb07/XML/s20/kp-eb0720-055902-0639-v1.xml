                <p><label type="entry">STAHL, <hi rend="smallcaps">George Ernest</hi></label>, an
                    eminent German chemist, was born at Anspach, on the 21st of October 1660, and
                    chosen professor of medicine at Halle, when a university was found ed in that
                    city in 1694. The excellency of his lectures while he filled that chair, the
                    importance of his various publications, and his extensive practice, soon raised
                    his reputation to a very great height. He received an invitation to Berlin in
                    1716, which having accepted, he was made counsellor of state and physician to
                    the king. He died in 1734, in the seventy-fifth year of his age. Stahl is
                    without doubt one of the greatest men of which the annals of medicine can boast:
                    his name marks the commencement of a new and more illustrious era in chemistry.
                    He was the author of the doctrine of phlogiston, which, though now completely
                    overturned by the discoveries of Lavoisier and others, was not without its use,
                    as it served to combine the scatter ed fragments of former chemists into a
                    system, and as it gave rise to more accurate experiments and a more scientific
                    view of the subject, to which many of the subsequent discoveries were owing.
                    This theory maintained its ground for more than half a century, and was received
                    and support ed by some of the most eminent men which Europe has produced; a
                    sufficient proof of the ingenuity and the abilities of its author. He was the
                    author also of a theory of medi cine, founded upon the notions which he
                    entertained of the absolute dominion of mind over body; in consequence of which
                    he affirmed, that every muscular action is a voluntary act of the mind, whether
                    attended with consciousness or not. This theory he and his followers carried a
                    great deal too far; but the advices at least which he gives to attend to the
                    state of the mind of the patient, are worthy of the attention of physicians.</p>
                <p>“Stahl,” says Dr. Cullen, “has explicitly founded his system on the supposition,
                    that the power of nature, so much talked of, is entirely in the rational soul.
                    He supposes that, upon many occasions, the soul acts independently of the state
                    of the body; and that, without any physical necessity arising from that state,
                    the soul, purely in consequence of its intelligence, perceiving the tendency of
                    noxious powers threatening, or of disorders anyways arising in the system,
                    immediately excites such motions in the body as are suited to obviate the
                    hurtful or pernicious consequences which might otherwise take place. Many of my
                    readers may think it was hardly necessary for me to take notice of a syssem
                    founded upon so fanciful a hypothesis; but there is often so much seeming
                    appearance of intelligence and design in the operations of the animal economy,
                    that many eminent persons, as Perrault in France, Nichols and Mead in Eng land,
                    Porterfield and Simson in Scotland, and Gaubius in Holland, have very much
                    countenanced the same opinion, and it is therefore certainly entitled to some
                    regard.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Cullen’s First
