                    the northeastern coast, and capital of a government of the same name,
                    subordinate to that of Java. It is situated at the mouth of a river, navigable
                    for vessels of 100 tons one mile and a half from the seashore. The harbour is
                    one of the most convenient in the island; it is broad and spacious, secure
                    against the violence of the sea and wind; and it is mentioned by Sir Stamford
                    Raffles, that it may be rendered impregnable to any hostile attack.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Raffles’s History of Java,
                    vol. i. p. 12.</p></note> It is form ed by the approaching extremities of the
                    islands of Java and Madura, which in some places are not above eighty three
                    fathoms distance for about ten or fifteen miles. This strait is not of easy
                    navigation, but it is marked all along by buoys; and is, besides, defended by
                    strong batteries. One of these, a circular battery, has a commanding sweep
                    across the Strait of Madura, which is narrowest there, being opposite to the
                    southwest end of the island of that name. The eastern entrance being impassable
                    for large ships, the batteries are still incomplete on that side; but the north
                    western entrance is defended by Fort Ludowyk, distant from Gressie about six,
                    and from Point Panka about five miles. It presents, low on the water, a hundred
                    pieces of the finest ordnance, mounted on traversing carriages, be sides some
                    heavy mortars. The European part of the town is separated from the Chinese part,
                    and from the native quarter, by the river; but is connected with it by a fine
                    drawbridge. The houses are very good, some of them elegant, particularly the
                    newly erected country-seats of private individuals. The house of the British
                    resident at Sim pang is a fine large building, close to the river; and near it
                    the general hospital is unequalled in elegance and commodiousness. Sourabaya has
                    been greatly improved within these few years, in proportion as the neighbouring
                    town of Grossie has fallen into decay. A fine arsenal, and other extensive
                    works, calculated for equipments on a very large scale, were formed by General
                    Daendels at this place. Vessels are built and equipped at Sourabaya. Abundance
                    of timber is procured from the adjoining forests, which is floated down the
                    river that takes its rise from a large inland lake encircled with high
                    mountains. Here is also a mint, from which silver and copper coins are issued. A
                    new governmenthouse was begun at Sourabaya, and was designed to be a splendid
                    edifice; but the foundation of the front range having sunk, and endangered the
                    building, the plan was abandoned, and that part which conti nued firm was
                    converted into storerooms. Ships from Batavia bound to China or the Philippines
                    generally touch for refreshments at this place, especially during the northwest
                    monsoon. The surrounding country is fertile, and shaded by thickets of bamboos,
                    bananas, and other shrubs. The adjacent country is remarkably populous; and the
                    villages of the Javanese, Malays, and Chinese are so populous that they appear
                    to be a continuation of the town. Long. 112. 55. E. Lat. 7. 14½. S.</p>
