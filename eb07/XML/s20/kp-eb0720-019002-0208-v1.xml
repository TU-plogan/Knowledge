                    rend="italic">Abraham</hi></label>, an eminent English mathematician and
                    astronomer, was born at Little Horton, near Bradford, in the year 1651. He was
                    put as apprentice to a merchant at Manchester; but so strongly was he inclined
                    to the study of mathematics, that he soon found his situation both irksome and
                    disagreeable. By the mutual consent, therefore, of his master and himself, he
                    quitted the business of a merchant. He then removed to Liverpool, where he
                    devoted himself wholly to mathematical studies, and where, for a subsistence, he
                    taught writing and accounts.</p>
                <p>Soon after this, a merchant from London, in whose house the celebrated Flamsteed
                    then lodged, engaged Sharp to be his book-keeper. With this eminent astronomer
                    he soon contracted an intimate friendship, and by his recommendation he obtained
                    a more profitable employment in the dock-yard of Chatham, where he continued
                    till his friend and patron called him to his assistance. Mr Sharp was chiefly
                    employed in the construction of the mural arch, which he finished in the course
                    of fourteen months, so entirely to the satisfaction of Flamsteed, that he spoke
                    of him in terms of the highest praise. In the opinion of Smeaton, this was the
                    first good instrument of the kind, and Sharp the first artist who cut delicate
                    divisions on astronomical instruments. When this instrument was constructed,
                    Sharp was but twenty-five and Flamsteed thirty years of age. Mr Sharp assisted
                    his friend in making a catalogue of nearly three thousand fixed stars, with
                    their longitudes and magnitudes, their right ascensions and polar distances,
                    with the variations of the same while they change their longitude by one
                    degree.</p>
                <p>But, from the fatigue of constantly observing the stars by night in a cold thin
                    air, added to a weakly constitution, his health was much impaired. For the
                    recovery of it he requested leave to retire to his house at Horton, where, as
                    soon as he felt himself recovering, he began to fit up an observatory of his
                    own; and the telescopes he made use of were all of his own construction, and the
                    lenses ground and adjusted with his own hands.</p>
                <p>It was about this time that he assisted Flamsteed in calculating most of the
                    tables in the second volume of his <hi rend="italic">Historia Caeglestis,</hi>
                    as appears by their letters, to be seen in the hands of Sharp’s friends at
                    Horton. The mathematician, says Dr Hutton, meets with something extraordinary in
                    Sharp’s elaborate treatise of Geometry Improved; by a large and accurate table
                    of segments of circles, its construction and various uses in the solution of
                    several difficult problems, with compendious tables for finding a true
                    proportional part; and their use in these or any other tables exemplified in
                    making logarithms, or their natural numbers, to sixty places of figures, there
                    being a table of them for all primes to 1100, true to sixty-one figures. His
                    concise treatise of Polyedra, or solid bodies of many bases, both of the regular
                    ones and others, to which arc added twelve new ones, with various methods of
                    forming them, and their exact dimensions in surds and in numbers; illustrated
                    with a variety of copperplates, neatly engraved by his own hands. Indeed few of
                    the mathematical instrument makers could exceed him in exactly graduating or
                    neatly engraving mathematical or astronomical instruments. He possessed a
                    remarkably clear head for contriving, and an extraordinary hand for executing,
                    any thing, not only in mechanics, but likewise in drawing, writing, and making
                    the most beautiful figures, in all his calculations and constructions.</p>
                <p>The quadrature of the circle was undertaken by him for his own amusement, in the
                    year 1699, deduced from two different series, by which the truth of it was
                    proved to seventy-two places of figures, as may be seen in Sherwin <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> s Tables of Logarithms. In the same book may likewise
                    be seen his ingenious improvements on the making of logarithms, and the
                    constructing of the natural sines, tangents, and secants.</p>
                <p>Mr Sharp kept up a correspondence with most of the eminent mathematicians and
                    astronomers of his time, as Flamsteed, Newton, Halley, Wallis, Hodgson, the
                    answers to whose letters are all written on the backs or empty spaces of the
                    letters he received, in a short hand of his own invention. Being one of the most
                    accurate and indefatigable computers who ever existed, he was many years the
                    common resource for Flamsteed, Sir Jonas Moor, Halley, and others, in all sorts
                    of troublesome and delicate calculations.</p>
                <p>Sharp was never married, and spent his time as a hermit. He was of a middle
                    stature, very thin, of a weakly constitution, and remarkably feeble during the
                    last three or four years before his death, which happened on the l8th of July
                    1742, in the ninety-first year of his age.</p>
                <p>He was very irregular as to his meals, and uncommonly sparing in his diet. A
                    little square hole, resembling a window, formed a communication between the room
                    where he usually studied, and another where a servant could enter; and before
                    this hole he had contrived a sliding board. It often happened, that the
                    breakfast, dinner, and supper, have remained untouched, when the servant had
                    gone to remove what was left, so deeply was he engaged in calculations.</p>
