                <p><label type="entry">STANLEY, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi></label>, a very
                    learned writer, was the son of Sir Thomas Stanley of Laytonstone in Essex, and
                    Cumberlow in Hertfordshire, by his second wife Mary, the daughter of Sir William
                    Hammond of St. Alban’s-court. He was descended from a natural son of Edward earl
                    of Derby. He was born in the year 1625, and received a domestic education under
                    the tuition of William the son of Edward Fairfax, the well-known translator of
                    Tasso. In 1639, he became a fellow-commoner of Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, where
                    he distinguished himself by his progress in classical learning. After having
                    travelled on the conti nent, he resided for some time in the Middle Temple. Here
                    he lived on terms of particular intimacy with his cou sin Edward, afterwards Sir
                    Edward Sherburne, who cultivated similar studies, and who dedicated a volume of
                    Poems to this learned kinsman. Stanley published Poems and Translations in 1649,
                    8vo. They were reprinted, with additions, in 1651. But his principal work was
                    his “History of Philosophy, containing the Lives, Opinions, Actions, and
                    Discourses of the Philosophers of every Sect.” Of the original edition, printed
                    in folio, the first part appeared in 1655, and the third in 1660. The work is
                    dedicated to his uncle-in-law, Sir John Marsham, author of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Canon Chronicus,</hi> who first suggested the undertaking. There are four
                    editions of the History, the last and best being that of 1743, 4to. The author
                    has displayed solid as well as extensive erudition, but his valuable materials
                    are not disposed to the best advantage. The reputation of his work extended to
                    the continent; and a Latin translation of it by Olearius was published at
                    Leipzig, in quarto, in the year 1711. The part relating to the history of
                    oriental philosophy had been translated into the same language by Le Clerc, and
                    published at Amsterdam in 1690, with a dedication to Bishop Bumet. This version
                    he afterwards inserted in the second volume of his “Opera Philosophica.” Stanley
                    next prepared his elaborate and valuable edition of AEschylus. Lond. 1663, fol.
                    Some copies of the same impression bear the date of 1664. This edition, which
                    includes the fragments and the Greek scholia, and is accompanied with a
                    commentary and a Latin version, was of great importance when it first appeared;
                    but since the death of the learned editor, so much has been effected by Schiitz,
                    Wellauer, and other scholars, that it has lost a great portion of its original
                    value. The best of all possible editions of AEschylus has for many years been
                    expected from Hermann; but those who have sufficient means of ascertaining his
                    present views and occupations, have at length begun to despair of its ever
                    making its appearance. It was thought expedient to reprint Stanley’s edition,
                    with the commentary, corrected and enlarged from his papers preserved in the
                    university library at Cam bridge. The charge of this edition was committed to a
                    very competent scholar, Samuel Butler, afterwards promoted to the bishopric of
                    Lichfield; who, with the addition of his own annotations, published it at
                    Cambridge in the year1809, in 4 vols. 4to., and in 8 vols. 8vo. Some notes on
                    Demosthenes, ascribed to Stanley, have recently been published in the ninth
                    volume of Dobson’s <hi rend="italic">Oratores Attici.</hi> He died at his
                    lodgings in Suflblkstreet,in the parish of St. Martin’s-in-the Fields, on the
                    12th of April 1678. He had married Dorothy, the daughter and coheiress of Sir
                    James Enyon of Flower in Northamptonshire, Bart. He had a son, who bore his own
                    name, and, like himself, was educated at Pern<pb break="no"

                    broke Hall. At a very early age, he published “AElian’s Various Histories,
                    translated into English.” Lond. 1665, 8vo.</p>
