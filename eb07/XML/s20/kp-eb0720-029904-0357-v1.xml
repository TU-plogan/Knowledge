                    coast of Waygoo. Long. 130. 53. E. Lat. 0. 1. S.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Shoe,</hi> a covering for the foot, usually of leather.
                    Shoes among the Jews were made of leather, linen, rush, or wood; those of
                    soldiers were sometimes of brass or iron. They were tied with thongs, which
                    passed under the soles of the feet. To put off their shoes was an act of
                    veneration; it was also a sign of mourning and humiliation. To bear one’s shoes,
                    or to untie the latchets of them, was considered as the meanest kind of
                    service.</p>
                <p>Among the Greeks, shoes of various kinds were used. Sandals were worn by women of
                    distinction. The Lacedaemonians wore red shoes. The Grecian shoes generally
                    reached to the middle of the leg. The Romans used two kinds of shoes; the <hi
                    rend="italic">calceus,</hi> which covered the whole foot, somewhat like our
                    shoes, and was tied above with latchets or strings; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >solea</hi> or slipper, which covered only the sole of the foot, and was
                    fastened with leathern thongs. The calceus was always worn along with the toga
                    when a person went abroad; slippers were put on during a journey and at feasts,
                    but it was reckoned effeminate to appear in public with them. Black shoes were
                    worn by the citizens of ordinary rank, and white ones by the women. Red shoes
                    were sometimes worn by the ladies, and purple ones by the coxcombs of the other
                    sex. Red shoes were put on by the chief magistrates of Rome on days of ceremony
                    and triumphs. The shoes of senators, patricians, and their children, had a
                    crescent upon them, which served for a buckle; and these were called <hi
                    rend="italic">caleei lunati.</hi> Slaves wore no shoes; and hence they were
                    called <hi rend="italic">cretati,</hi> from their dusty feet. Phocion also and
                    Cato of Utica went without shoes. The toes of the Roman shoes were turned up in

                <p>In the ninth and tenth centuries the greatest princes of Europe wore wooden
                    shoes, or the upper part of leather and the sole of wood. In the reign of
                    William Rufus, a great beau, Robert, surnamed the horned, used shoes with long
                    sharp points, stuffed with tow, and twisted like a rain’s horn. It is said that
                    the clergy, being highly offended, declaimed with great vehemence against the
                    long-pointed shoes. The points, however, continued to increase till, in the
                    reign of Richard IL, they were of so enormous a length that they were tied to
                    the knees with chains, sometimes of gold, sometimes of silver. The upper parts
                    of these shoes were in Chaucer’s time cut in imitation of a church window. The
                    long-pointed shoes were called crackowes, and continued in fashion for three
                    centuries, in spite of the bulls of popes, the decrees of councils, and the
                    declamations of the clergy. At length the parliament of England interposed by an
                    act passed in the year 1463, prohibited the use of shoes or boots with pikes
                    exceeding two inches in length, and forbade all shoemakers from making shoes or
                    boots with longer pikes, under severe penalties. But even this was not
                    sufficient. It was necessary to denounce the dreadful sentence of
                    excommunication against all who wore shoes or boots with points longer than two
                    inches. The present fashion of shoes was introduced in 1633, but the buckle was
                    not used till 1670.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Shoe</hi><hi rend="italic">of an Anchor,</hi> a
                    small block of wood, convex on the back, and having a small hole, sufficient to
                    contain the point of the anchor-fluke, on the fore-side. It is used to prevent
                    the anchor from tearing or wounding the planks on the ship’s bow, when ascending
                    or descending; and for this purpose the shoe slides up and down along the bow,
                    between the fluke of the anchor and the planks, as being pressed close to the
                    latter by the weight of the former.</p>
