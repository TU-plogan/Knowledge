                <p><label type="entry">SIRENS</label>, in fabulous history, certain celebrated
                    song-stresses who were ranked amongst the demigods of antiquity. Hyginus places
                    their birth amongst the consequences of the rape of Prosperine. Others make them
                    daughters of the river Acheleüs and one of the muses. The number of the Sirens
                    was three, and their names were Parthenope, Lygea, and Leucosia. Some make them
                    half women and half fish; others half women and half birds; there are antique
                    representations of them still subsisting under both these forms. Pausanias tells
                    us, that the Sirens, by the persuasion of Juno, challenged the Muses to a trial
                    of skill in singing; and these having vanquished them, plucked the golden
                    feathers from the wings of the Sirens, and formed them into crowns, with which
                    they adorned their own heads. The Argonauts are said to have been diverted from
                    the enchantment of their songs by the superior strains of Orpheus, Ulysses,
                    however, had great difficulty in securing himself from seduction.</p>
                <p>Pope, in his notes to the twelfth book of the Odyssey, observes, that the critics
                    have greatly laboured to explain what was the foundation of this fiction of the
                    Sirens. We are told by some, that the Sirens were queens of certain small
                    islands named <hi rend="italic">Sirenusae,</hi> that lie near Capraea in Italy,
                    and chiefly inhabited the promontory of Minerva, upon the top of which that
                    goddess had a temple built by Ulysses.</p>
                <p>Mr. Bryant says, however, that the Sirens were Cuthite and Canaanitish priests,
                    who had founded temples in Sicily, which were rendered infamous on account of
                    the women who officiated. They were much addicted to cruel rites, so that the
                    shores upon which they resided are described as covered with the bones of men
                    destroyed by their artifice.</p>
                <p>All ancient authors agree in telling us, that Sirens inhabited the coast of
                    Sicily. The name, according to Bochart, who derives it from the Phoenician
                    language, implies a songstress. Hence it is probable, says Dr. Burney, that in
                    ancient times there may have been excellent singers, but of corrupt morals, on
                    the coast of Sicily, who, by seducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable. And if
                    this conjecture be well founded, he observes, the Muses are not the only pagan
                    divinities who preserved their influence over mankind in modern times; for every
                    age has its Sirens, and every Siren her votaries. When beauty and talents, both
                    powerful in themselves, are united, they become still more attractive.</p>
