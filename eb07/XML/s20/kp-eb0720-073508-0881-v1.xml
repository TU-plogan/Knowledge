                    the river Trent, is neat and well built; and by means of a canal has an easy
                    communication with most parts of the kingdom. The church is a fine structure,
                    with a square tower and a good set of bells. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to
                    2305, in 1811 to 2314, in 1821 to 2855, and 1831 to 3460.<pb break="no"

                    self-taught mathematician, was bom in Scotland, but neither the place nor the
                    time of his birth is well known; nor have we any memoirs of his early life,
                    except in a letter from the Chevalier Ramsay to Father Castel, a Jesuit of
                    Paris, and published in the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de Trevoux.</hi> Born the
                    son of a gardener of the Duke of Argyle, he arrived at eight years of age before
                    he learned to read. By chance a servant having taught him the letters of the
                    alphabet, there needed nothing more to discover and expand his genius. He
                    applied himself to study, and arrived at the knowledge of the most sublime
                    geometry and analysis, without a master, without a conductor, without any other
                    guide but pure genius. He was author and translator of several useful works,
                    viz. 1. A New Mathematical Dictionary, in 8vo, first printed in 1726. 2.
                    Fluxions, in 8vo, 1730. The Direct Method is a translation from the French of De
                    l'Hospital's “Analyse des infiniment Petits ;” and the Inverse Method was
                    supplied by Stone himself. 3. The Elements of Euclid, in 2 vols. 8vo, 1731.
                    Stone was a fellow of the Royal Society, and had inserted in the Philosophical
                    Transactions (vol. xli. p. 218) an “Account of two species of lines of the 3d
                    order, not mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton or Mr Stirling.” In 1758 he published
                    “The Construction and principal Uses of Mathematical Instruments; translated
                    from the French of Μ. Bion. In 1742 or 1743 his name was withdrawn from the list
                    of the Royal Society; and in his old age he appears to have been left to poverty
                    and neglect. He survived till March or April 1768.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stone,</hi><hi rend="italic">Jerome,</hi> the son of a
                    seaman, was born in the parish of Sc∞nie, Fifeshire. His father died abroad when
                    he was but three years of age, and his mother, with her young family, was left
                    in very narrow circumstances. Jerome having obtained the ordinary school
                    education, reading English, writing, and arithmetic, betook himself to the
                    business of a pedlar. He began his philological pursuits with the study of the
                    Hebrew and Greek tongues, and made himself so far master of these, without any
                    assistance, as to be able to interpret the Hebrew Bible and Greek Testament into
                    English <hi rend="italic">ad aperturam libri.</hi> At this time he did not know
                    one word of Latin. Some time afterwards, he was encouraged to prosecute his
                    studies at the university of St Andrews; and an unexampled proficiency in every
                    branch of literature recommended him to the esteem of the professors. Having
                    finished his studies, he settled as schoolmaster at Dunkeld, where he died in
                    1757, in the 30th year of his age.</p>
