                <p><label type="entry">STERNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Laurence</hi></label>, an
                    eccentric writer of fiction, has left behind him a sketch of the principal
                    events of his life, and some particulars of his family history. From that
                    outline it appears that he was born at Clonmell, in the south of Ireland, on the
                    24th November 1713. His father was a lieutenant in the army, and grandson of Dr
                    Richard Sterne, archbishop of York. When his son was about eight years of age,
                    Lieutenant Sterne placed him at a school in Halifax, to which town he had been
                    conducted by his professional duties. That officer died in 1731, and in the
                    following year, young Sterne, by the bounty of a relation and namesake of his
                    own, was transferred from the school of Halifax to Jesus College, Cambridge.</p>
                <p>Having completed his studies at the university, he proceeded to York; and his
                    uncle, Dr Jacques Sterne, prebendary of Durham, and canon residentiary and
                    precentor of York, procured him the living of Sutton, and afterwards a prebend
                    at York. At York he formed an acquaintance with the lady who afterwards became
                    his wife, under circumstances sufficiently romantic. From a friend of hers he
                    obtained the living of Stillington, but continued for twenty years to reside at
                    Sutton, relieving the burden of his double charge, as he informs us, “by books,
                    painting, fiddling, and shooting.” In the library of Shelton Castle, the
                    residence of his friend and relation, John Hall Stevenson, author of a
                    licentious production, entitled Crazy Tales, Sterne found among the dross of
                    antiquity many a brilliant gem, which he transferred without scruple to his own
                    pages. In this stolen garb he cut a most imposing figure, until Dr Ferriar of
                    Manchester, twenty years after the death of the celebrated plagiary, restored
                    the pilfered trappings to the rightful owners.<note anchored="true"

                    train Shandy, which procured him both money and reputation. In these volumes
                    there was abundance of matter which every one could relish; and what was
                    unintelligible was thought profound. Much ingenious speculation was squandered
                    upon the black leaves and marbled pages, which were long contemplated with
                    wonder, before they were discovered to mean nothing. “The republic of dark
                    authors,” says Swift, “have been peculiarly happy in the variety, as well as
                    extent, of their reputation.”</p>
                <p>Before this period, Sterne had only printed two sermons. The two volumes of
                    Tristram Shandy were succeeded by two volumes of Sermons. In 1761 appeared the
                    third and fourth volumes of the novel, and the fifth and sixth in the year
                    following. The seventh and eighth volumes were published in 1765; but these
                    monstrous births had by that time ceased to please. Four volumes of Sermons were
                    produced in 1766; and in 1767, these were followed by the ninth and last volume
                    of Tristram Shandy. In 1768 Sterne returned from Italy, whither he had repaired
                    in the hopes of finding relief for a consumptive complaint with which he had
                    long been afflicted. He only survived to prepare for the press the first part of
                    his Sentimental Journey, which was published in 1768. In the month of March of
                    that year he expired at his lodgings in Bond Street, surrounded by strangers; a
                    mode of death which he considered as most desirable.</p>
                <p>The English writer to whom the author of Tristram Shandy is most indebted for his
                    matter is Burton; and his manner bears some resemblance to the capricious,
                    whimsical, and digressive Tale of a Tub. He even mimics Swift in sneering at
                    “the great Dryden ;” but in the writings of his prototype he might have found
                    many tilings infinitely more worthy of imitation. In order to make room for his
                    pathos, however, he eschewed the misanthropy of the dean of St Patrick’s, and
                    set up for a lover of his species, to which character his claims were less than
                    equivocal, for his philanthropy did not extend so far as to his own mother. That
                    sensibility is worthy only of ridicule that bestows a tear with greater
                    promptitude than a shilling. For the irony of Swift, Sterne substituted
                    buffoonery, which, in conformity with the opinion of Aristotle, the dean
                    regarded as the less liberal species of pleasantry But the strongest objection
                    to much of the satire in Tristram Shandy is, that the author threw away his
                    ridicule upon pedantry that had become altogether obsolete.</p>
                <p>It would be harsh justice to conclude, that the beauties of Sterne’s writings are
                    drawn from some yet undiscovered source, because he is known to have had
                    confused notions on the subject of literary honesty, and to tear the laurel from
                    his brows, because some of its leaves are purloined from the tombs of the dead.
                    “Every man’s wit,” he says, “must come from every man’s own soul, and no other
                    body's.” That he had much wit of his own, there is reason as well as charity in
                    supposing, although his propensity to make free with the wit of others may
                    justify some suspicion on the subject, upon the principle that a rich man, who
                    retains the use of his reason, is seldom guilty of theft. And it cannot be
                    denied, that the world would be indebted to the writer who could produce such
                    another tissue of reproductions, if such it is, as “The Life and Opinions of
                    Tristram Shandy, Gent.”</p>
