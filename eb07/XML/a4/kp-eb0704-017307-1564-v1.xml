                <p><label type="entry">ATTRACTION</label>.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> word Attraction is used to denote what we observe
                    when one body approaches another, or tends to approach it, without any apparent
                    impulse or other cause to which the motion can be ascribed.</p>
                <p>We have instances of attraction when iron approaches the magnet, when certain
                    bodies are placed near an excited electric, and when a stone falls to the earth.
                    We say likewise that the earth attracts the moon; by this mode of expression
                    meaning no more than that the moon is continually deflected towards the earth,
                    from the rectilineal course which it would otherwise pursue. It is likewise in
                    this sense that we must be understood when we say that the sun attracts all the
                    planets.</p>
                <p>In the instances already mentioned, attraction extends to a distance. In other
                    cases it is confined within limits so extremely narrow as to become
                    imperceptible at an interval which cannot be appreciated by the senses. Of this
                    kind is the attraction which takes place between the particles of the same
                    fluid, as is apparent from the round figure of small drops. To this class
                    likewise belongs the attraction between fluid and solid bodies; whence originate
                    the very interesting appearances observed in capillary tubes, and other kindred
                    phenomena. An attraction between the small elementary particles of all solid
                    bodies is manifest from the force with which they cohere or resist an endeavour
                    to separate them. In many cases the intensity of this force is prodigiously
                    great in contact or at the nearest distances; while it ceases to act upon making
                    the smallest separation between the parts. Lastly, chemistry developes
                    innumerable instances of attraction between the molecules of the bodies about
                    which it is conversant; insomuch that it is to this principle, under the name of
                    affinity, that we must ultimately ascribe the various decompositions and new
                    combinations which occur m that science.</p>
                <p>All these phenomena, although very different from one another in other respects,
                    have yet this in common, that we observe in certain bodiea a tendency to
                    approach one another, and to resist a separation, with some degree of force. The
                    facts are certain, and are attended with no ambiguity; and it is to express
                    these facts that the term <hi rend="italic">attraction</hi> is used in
                    physics.</p>
                <p>We likewise observe, in some bodies, a tendency to fly off from one another when
                    they are brought near. This is called <hi rend="italic">repulsion.</hi></p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">force</hi> has, in general, some degree of obscurity.
                    It is used to denote the cause of motion; but we have no direct knowledge of it,
                    and we judge of its intensity by the effect which we suppose it to produce. In
                    all our reasoning concerning forces, it is the changes of motion which we
                    measure and compare together, and which are really the subjects of our thoughts.
                    Attraction and repulsion are forces or principles of motion, known to us only by
                    the phenomena we observe; but the circumstance of their implying action at a
                    distance is an additional source of obscurity in which other kinds of force do
                    not participate.</p>
                <p>It certainly is inconceivable that motion should be produced at a distance, when
                    no connection can be traced between the body moved and that which is supposed to
                    produce the motion. We are strongly impressed with the prejudice, that a body
                    cannot act but where it is; and we find difficulty in admitting that the mere
                    presence of two bodies, without the intervention of any mechanical means, can be
                    a satisfactory cause of motion. On this account attraction has been classed by
                    some with the occult qualities of the schools; and the favourers of this
                    doctrine have been reproached with reviving exploded notions in philosophy.
                    Impulse is a principle of motion more familiar to us, and to which we are not
                    disposed to make equal objection. W’henever the communication of motion can be
                    traced to this source, we are satisfied that the effect is justly explained.
                    Hence many philosophers have been of opinion, that impulse is the only cause of
                    motion that can <pb break="no" facs="nls:193191577?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0704-1577-0174"/> be admitted in physical science; and many
                    attempts have accordingly been made to reduce to this principle all cases in
                    which distant bodies act on one another. With regard to these attempts, it will
                    be sufficient to remark here, that they are all built upon hypothesis. No
                    evidence is adduced to prove that such things exist as the elastic ether or
                    gravific matter which they set out with supposing. And, as far as such systems
                    have no other object than to obviate the difficulty of action at a distance,
                    this argument alone is sufficient to confute them, without adverting to the
                    difficulties that attend each of them separately, their inconsistency with the
                    received laws of motion, and the innumerable contradictions and improbabilities
                    to which they are liable on every side.</p>
                <p>A little reflection is sufficient to show that, in reality, we have no clearer
                    notion of impulse as the cause of motion than we have of attraction. We can as
                    little give a satisfactory reason why motion should pass out of one body into
                    another on their contact, as we can, why one body should begin to move, or have
                    its motion increased, when it is placed near another body. It is equally
                    impossible in both cases to prove that there is a necessary connection between
                    the related facts; and in this respect both the phenomena are alike
                    inexplicable.</p>
                <p>When motion is produced by impulse, it is probably the circumstance of contact
                    apparently taking place which leads us to think that the effect is so clearly
                    explained. It is in this manner only, or by actual contact, that we ourselves
                    can move external objects. We have no power of producing motion in distant
                    bodies, except by the intervention of other bodies on which we act immediately.
                    Impulse is, therefore, a cause of motion familiar to us, and strikes us as the
                    plainest and most satisfactory ultimate principle at which we can arrive. On the
                    other hand, when one body attracts another at a distance, there is nothing
                    familiar to us with which we can compare it; our curiosity is excited, and we
                    are led to seek out some hidden connection between them.</p>
                <p>But it may be doubted whether there is actual contact in any case of the
                    communication of motion. When a body is impelled by the air, it will hardly be
                    affirmed that the particles of that elastic fluid are in contact with one
                    another, since there is no space, however small, within which a given bulk of it
                    may not be compressed, by applying an external force sufficiently great. The
                    particles of air, therefore, act on one another at a distance; and the same
                    thing must be true of all other elastic fluids. And, by the way, what is here
                    said is sufficient to prove, that no scheme, founded on the hypothesis of an
                    elastic ether, will enable us to account for attraction; because such a
                    contrivance can do nothing more than substitute one species of action at a
                    distance instead of another. There is good reason to think that absolute contact
                    never takes place in the component parts of the hardest and most compact solid
                    bodies. This seems to be an unavoidable consequence of the fact, well
                    established by experience, that all bodies contract in their bulk by cold, and
                    expand by heat. It is therefore not only not impossible, but it is even in some
                    degree probable, that the communication of motion may, in every instance, be a
                    case of action at a distance.</p>
                <p>If, then, we are apt to think that impulse is a clearer physical principle than
                    attraction, there is in reality no good ground for the distinction; it has its
                    origin in prejudice, and in our mistaking the proper object of natural
                    philosophy. All our researches in nature are confined to the phenomena we
                    observe, and to the laws by which they are regulated. A physical cause is no
                    other than a general fact discovered by a careful observation and an attentive
                    comparison of many particular and subordinate facts. We have no evidence,
                    independent of ex√ perience, that any consequence, deduced from a physical '
                    cause, will actually take place. There is in this case no necessary connection
                    from which we can, with absolute certainty, infer the expected event. If, then,
                    we regard impulse and attraction as principles founded in fact, and regulated by
                    laws confirmed by observation and experiment, they are both equally entitled to
                    be classed as physical causes, and they ought both to be admitted as of equal
                    authority in explaining the phenomena of the universe.</p>
                <p>If we turn our attention to the different kinds of attraction enumerated above,
                    and inquire what progress has been made in the investigation of their laws of
                    action, we shall find that, generally speaking, this branch of physics has been
                    little advanced. We are very imperfectly acquainted with magnetical and
                    electrical attraction. We know still less of those attractive powers which take
                    place at small distances, and which are confined within such narrow limits that
                    their mode of action escapes the observation of our senses. Attraction is,
                    indeed, much used by philosophers to account for many important natural
                    phenomena; but their explanations are often vague, and destitute of that
                    precision which ought always to be aimed at in physical science. There is only
                    one class of phenomena in which the laws of attraction have been fully
                    developed. We allude to gravitation, that principle which occasions the fall of
                    heavy bodies at the surface of the earth, and which retains the planets and
                    comets in their orbits. Referring the other species of attraction, which are
                    little susceptible of general discussion, to their several heads, we shall now
                    confine our attention to gravitation</p>
                <p>Traces of the principle of gravitation are to be found] in writers of great
                    antiquity; but their speculations on <hi rend="superscript"> (</hi> this subject
                    do not go beyond a vague notion of a tendent cy which the planets have to one
                    another, or to a common centre. It would contribute little either to
                    entertainment or instruction to collect all the passages of ancient authors that
                    speak of this principle. The revival of the true system of the world by
                    Copernicus introduced the most admirable simplicity in the explanation of the
                    planetary motions, and likewise led to more just conjectures concerning the laws
                    by which they are upheld. Copernicus himself attributed the round figure of the
                    planets to a tendency which their parts possess of uniting with one another,
                    thus extending to all the planets that attraction which we observe at the
                    surface of the earth. He stopt short indeed at this point, conceiving attraction
                    to be confined to the matter of each planet, without making it extend from one
                    planet to another, so as to actuate all the bodies of the system. This step was
                    made by the bold and systematic genius of Kepler. Adopting the opinion of Dr
                    Gilbert of Colchester, that the earth is a great magnet, Kepler formed to
                    himself a notion of attraction, in some respects remarkably just. He says that
                    the earth and moon attract one another, and, were it not for some powers which
                    retain them in their orbits, they would move towards one another, and would meet
                    in their common centre of gravity. He attributes the tide to the moon’s
                    attraction <hi rend="italic">(virtus tractoria</hi><hi rend="italic">quae in
                    luna</hi><hi rend="italic">est),</hi> which heaps up the waters of the ocean
                    immediately under her. But in many respects his notions of attraction were
                    fanciful and extravagant; a more perfect knowledge of the laws of motion than
                    had been attained to in his time, and a new geometry, were both wanting in order
                    to guide him in this research without danger of wandering. Yet he was able to
                    penetrate so far into the causes of the planetary motions, as to foresee that
                    they would not long continue latent; and he tells us, he was persuaded that “the
                    full discovery of those mysteries was reserved for the next age, when God <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193191590?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0704-1590-0175"/>
                    would reveal them.” ' So full an exposition of a physical system of the world as
                    is contained in the writings of Kepler could not fail to draw the attention of
                    succeeding philosophers. Many remarks concerning the principle of gravitation
                    arc to be found in the writings of Fermat, Roberval, Borelli, and other authors;
                    but no one before Newton entertained so clear and systematic a view of the
                    doctrine of universal gravitation as Dr Robert Hooke. In his work on the motion
                    of the earth, published in 1674, twelve years before the appearance of Newton’s
                    <hi rend="italic">Principia,</hi> he lays down these three positions as the
                    foundations of his system, viz. :—</p>
                <p>« Isŕ, That all the heavenly bodies have not only a gravitation of their parts to
                    their own proper centre, but likewise that they mutually attract each other
                    within their spheres of action.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">«</hi><hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> That all bodies having a
                    simple motion will continue to move in a straight line, unless continually
                    deflected from it by some extraneous force, causing them to describe a circle,
                    or an ellipse, or some other curve.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi rend="italic">3dly,</hi> This attraction is so much
                    the greater as the bodies are nearer.”</p>
                <p>The principle of universal gravitation is here very precisely enunciated. Dr
                    Hooke seems to have clearly perceived that the planetary motions are the result
                    of an attraction towards the sun, and of a rectilineal motion produced by a
                    projectile force. Not having discovered the law according to which the force
                    diminishes as the distance from the sun increases, he contrived experiments to
                    elucidate his theory. Having suspended a ball by means of a long thread, he
                    placed another ball upon a table immediately under the point of suspension, and
                    he caused the suspended ball to revolve round the stationary one. When the
                    movable ball was pushed laterally with a force properly adjusted to its
                    deviation from the perpendicular, it described an exact circle round the ball on
                    the table: in other cases it described an ellipse, or an oval resembling an
                    ellipse, having the other ball in the centre. Dr Hooke observed, that although
                    this experiment in some measure illustrated the planetary motions, yet it did
                    not represent them accurately; because the ellipses which the planets describe
                    have the sun placed in one focus, and not in the centre. Thus, at the appearance
                    of Newton, many things were known, or rather surmised, that prepared the way for
                    the discovery of the principle which regulates the celestial motions. This does
                    not detract in any degree from the glory of Newton, who, discarding the
                    conjectures of his predecessors, proposed to himself to investigate, with
                    mathematical strictness, the law of the attractive force, and to ascertain with
                    precision its sufficiency to retain the planets in their orbits. He invented a
                    new kind of geometry, which was necessary to enable him to accomplish his
                    purpose. With this help, and by admitting nothing without the sanction of the
                    established principles of Dynamics, he deduced from the motions of the celestial
                    bodies the law of universal gravitation, the most important and the most general
                    truth hitherto discovered by the industry and the sagacity of man, viz. “that
                    all the particles of matter attract one another, directly as their masses, and
                    inversely as the squares of their distances.”</p>
                <p>Having arrived at a principle which belongs to every part of matter, another
                    inquiry comes into view. Setting out from this principle, it is now necessary to
                    proceed in an inverted order, and deduce from it, by synthetical reasoning, the
                    phenomena which we observe in the universe. The first step in this process is to
                    find out the attractive force of the planets, which arises from the united
                    attractions of their component parts. Two things only are involved in this
                    investigation, viz. the known law of attraction between the particles of matter,
                    and the figure of the attracting bodies. This is a subject of great importance,
                    and it is connected with some principal points of the system of the world, with
                    the theory of the figure of the planets, that of the tides, and many other
                    phenomena. It is but imperfectly discussed in Newton’s immortal work; and there
                    is no part of his philosophy which has been improved more slowly by the labours
                    of his followers. We now propose to treat of it at some length, endeavouring to
                    lay before our readers as complete a view of this part of science as the nature
                    of our work will permit.</p>
                <p>We begin with laying down some definitions, and demonstrating some properties, of
                    elliptical spheroids.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Def.</hi> 1. A solid generated by the revolving of an ellipse
                    about either axis is called a spheroid of revolution. If the ellipse revolve
                    about the less axis, the spheroid is oblate; if about the greater axis, it is
                    oblong.</p>
                <p>Let <hi rend="italic">k</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h!</hi> denote the two axes of

                    ellipsoid, is a solid bounded by a finite surface of the second order. Let ACB
                    and ADE (Plate CL fig. 1: this figure represents one eighth of an ellipsoid
                    contained in one of the solid angles formed by the three principal sections) be
                    two ellipses that have the same axis AO, the same centre 0, and their planes
                    perpendicular to one another: from any point K in the common axis, let there be
                    drawn ordinates in both ellipses, as KC and KD; then, having described an
                    ellipse of which KC and KD are the semiaxes, the periphery DMC of that ellipse
                    will be in the surface of the ellipsoid. This solid figure has a centre, three
                    axes crossing one another at right angles in the centre, and three principal
                    sections made by planes passing through every two of its axes.</p>
