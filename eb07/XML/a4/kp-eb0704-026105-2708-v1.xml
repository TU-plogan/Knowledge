                <p><label type="entry">AZËRBIJAN</label>, a province of Persia, part of the ancient
                    Media. It is separated from Armenia on the north by the river Araxes, and from
                    Irak on the south by the Kizilozein or Golden stream. It has the Caspian Sea and
                    Ghilan on the east, and Armenia and Kurdistan on the west, lhe country is
                    superior to the southern provinces of Persia, being richly diversified with wood
                    and water. It differs entirely from the provinces of Fars and Irak, as it
                    consists of a regular succession of undulating eminences, partially cultivated,
                    and opening into plains, such as Anjan, Tabreez, and Urumea or Ooroomea or Van.
                    To the south the mountains of Sahund rise in an accumulated mass to the clouds;
                    and on the north the black rocks of the district of Karabang disappear in the
                    luxuriant vegetation of the plain of Mogam, which is 225 miles in length by
                    seventy-five in breadth, and famed for its luxuriant pastures. Azerbijan is a
                    fertile country, and of a most pleasing aspect. It is reckoned one of the most
                    productive provinces</p>
                <p>Persia, and the villages have a more pleasing appear- <hi rend="superscript">
                    aιl</hi> ce than those of Irak. The orchards and gardens, in W ∏ch they are for
                    the most part embosomed, yield delicious fruits of almost every description.
                    Provisions are c leap and abundant, and wine is made in considerable quantities.
                    This province is watered by several considerable rivers, namely, the Araxes, the
                    Kizilozein, and the Jugatty, which issues from the mountains of Ardelan, and is
                    perhaps larger than either. The other rivers are the Yezdican, which has its
                    source sixty miles east of Lake Urumea, and joins the Araxes; the Agi, whose
                    waters are drained away in irrigation; and the Shar, which falls into the lake
                    of Urumea. This is a great lake, about 300 miles in circumference. Its waters
                    are more intensely salt than the sea. It is surrounded by some of the most
                    fertile districts in Persia. The country to the north and west, namely, the
                    districts of Ooroomea and Selmart, contains, the first 400 villages, and the
                    second between 300 and 400 villages, flourishing and populous. This is the most
                    picturesque and the most prosperous part of Azerbijan; yet even here the
                    traveller from the more civilized regions of Europe laments at every step the
                    sloth and want of enterprise among the inhabitants, who entirely neglect the
                    natural advantages of their country. There are many rivers which fall into the
                    lake, by which the produce of the rich and well-cultivated valleys through which
                    they run might be transported across its waters, and dispersed among the
                    different towns in the province. But there is not a single boat on this
                    extensive expanse of water. The truth is, that individual exertion is damped by
                    the tyranny of the government; the inhabitants fearing, that if boats were
                    constructed for the navigation of the lake, they would be subjected to heavy
                    duties, or arbitrarily impressed into the service of government. The bulk of the
                    people are so held down by their rulers, that, in the hope of bettering their
                    condition, they would hail with pleasure the approach of a Russian army. Lead,
                    copper, saltpetre, and sulphur, are found within the confines of Azerbijan; also
                    a kind of beautiful transparent marble or jasper, which takes the highest
                    polish, and is usedin the buildings ofTabreez, Schiraz,and1spahan, under the
                    name of Tabreez marble. The province is divided into twelve districts. The chief
                    towns are Tabriz or Tabreez, containing 30,000 inhabitants; Meanna, Ardebil,
                    Shebus-ter; Tasouj, in ruins; Selmart, with 2000 inhabitants; Khoee, with
                    25,000; Ooroomea, with 12,000; andMaraga, with 15,000. The climate is healthful,
                    in summer and autumn hot, but cold in winter, which is severely felt by the
                    lower orders, owing to the want of fuel, for which there is no substitute except
                    dried cow-dung mixed with straw. The spring is temperate and delightful in the
                    plains, but on the mountains snow lies for eight months in the year; and hail
                    storms are so violent as frequently to destroy cattle in the fields. The best
                    soils yield from fifty to sixty fold when abundantly irrigated; and supplies of
                    water for this purpose are drawn from the many small rivers by which the
                    province is intersected. Oxen are generally used to draw the plough. (Kinneir’s
