                <p><label type="entry">ASTRUC, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    physician, was born in the year 1684, at the town of Sauves, in the province of
                    Languedoc. His father, who was a Protestant clergyman, bestowed particular pains
                    upon the earlier part of his education; after which he went to the university of
                    Montpelier, where he took the degree of master of arts in the year 1700. He then
                    began the study of medicine, and in two years obtained the degree of bachelor,
                    having upon that occasion written a dissertation on tlιe cause of fermentation,
                    which he defended in a very spirited manner. On the 25th of January 1703 he was
                    created doctor of physic; after which, before arriving at extensive practice, he
                    applied to the study of medical authors, both ancient and modern, with uncommon
                    assiduity. The good effects of this study soon appeared; for in the year 1710 he
                    published a treatise concerning muscular motion, from which he acquired very
                    high reputation. In the year 1717 he was appointed to teach medicine at
                    Montpelier; which he did with such perspicuity and eloquence, that it was
                    universally said he had been born to be a professor. His fame soon rose to such
                    á height, that the king assigned him an annual salary; and he was, at the same
                    time, appointed to superintend the mineral waters in the province of Languedoc.
                    But as Montpelier did not afford sufficient scope for his aspiring genius, he
                    went to Paris with a great stock of manuscripts, which he intended to publish,
                    after subjecting them to the examination of the learned. Soon after, however, he
                    left it, having in the year 1729 accepted the office of first physician to the
                    king of Poland. In this capacity he remained only for a short time, and again
                    returned to Paris. Upon the death of the celebrated Geoffroy, in the year 1731,
                    he was appointed regius professor of medicine at Paris. The duties of this
                    office he discharged in such a manner as to answer even the most sanguine
                    expectations. He taught the practice of physic with so great applause, as to
                    draw from other universities to that of Paris a great concourse of medical
                    students, foreigners as well as natives of France. At the same time he was not
                    more celebrated as a professor than a practitioner. And even at an advanced age
                    he persevered with unwearied assiduity in that intense study which first raised
                    his reputation. Hence it is that he has been enabled to transmit to posterity so
                    many valuable monuments of his medical erudition. He died on the 15th of May
                    1766, in the 82d year of his age. The following are the titles of his principal
