                <p><label type="entry">MOHILEW</label>, a province of the European Russian empire.
                    It is situated in N. lat. from 51. 58. tó 55. 13., and in E. long, from 28. 47.
                    to 32. 53., and is bounded on the north by Witepsk, on the north-east by
                    Smolensk, on the southeast and south by Tschernigow, and on the west by Minsk.
                    It contains 45,008 square worsts, or 17,978 square miles. It is divided into
                    twelve circles, and contains 1,084,600 inhabitants, who live in twelve cities,
                    fifty-five towns, and so great a number of small villages and farms, that they
                    have not been accurately ascertained. There is a subdivision into a kind of
                    Greek parishes, each surrounding the 310 churches of that religion. Mohilew is
                    one of the districts which was taken from Poland in the year 1772, and, with
                    Witepsk, formed one province under the name of White Russia; but, in 1802, a
                    division was made into two provinces, the one called that of Witepsk, and the
                    other that of Mohilew. The people of this province, from being a mixture of
                    Russians and Poles, have formed for themselves a peculiar dialect, compounded of
                    the language of these two races, with an intermixture of Latin, Moldavian, and
                    German. The greater part of the inhabitants adhere to the orthodox Greek church,
                    but many are of the united Greek religion; and there are many Catholics, who
                    have an archbishop, and several churches and monasteries. There are also 40,000
                    Jews, who have synagogues in most of the towns. The province is generally a
                    level plain, intersected by numerous streams; and the soil, though for the most
                    part sandy, is moderately fertile. More corn is grown than the consumption
                    requires in almost every year, and, after a deficient harvest in Poland and
                    Germany, large supplies are furnished to these countries. The woods are
                    extensive, and yield large stores of timber of every description required either
                    for fuel or for the construction of houses or ships. The chief productions,
                    besides corn and wood, are black cattle, sheep; wool, hemp and flax, and their
                    seed; honey, wax, bacon and bristles, with tallow and hides. These are conveyed
                    both to the Baltic and to the Black Sea by means of the navigable rivers. Some
                    iron is found, which is used for making scythes and other agricultural
                    implements; but the mines do not yield a quantity sufficient for the demand.</p>
