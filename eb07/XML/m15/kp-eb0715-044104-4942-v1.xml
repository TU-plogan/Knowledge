                <p>Amongst the ancients, the moon was an object of particular homage. By the Hebrews
                    she was more regarded than the sun, and they were inclined to worship her as a
                    deity. The new moons, or first days of every month, were kept as festivals
                    amongst them, and were celebrated with the sound of trumpets, with
                    entertainments and sacrifices. (See Numb, xviii. 11, x. 16; 1 Sam. xx. 5-18).
                    People were not obliged to rest on these days. The feasts of new moons were a
                    miniature representation of the feast of trumpets, held on the first of the
                    month of Tisri, which was the beginning of the civil year. The Jews not being
                    acquainted with the physical causes of eclipses, looked upon them as signs of
                    the divine displeasure. The Grecians looked upon the moon as favourable to
                    marriage; and the full moons, or the times of conjunction of sun and moon, were
                    held the most lucky seasons for celebrating marriages, because they imagined
                    that the moon had great influence over generation. The full moon was held
                    favourable for many undertakings by the Spartans; and no motive could induce
                    them to enter upon an expedition, march an army, or attack an enemy, until the
                    moon was full. The moon was supposed, both by Greeks and Romans, to preside over
                    child-birth. The patricians at Rome wore a crescent on their shoes, to
                    distinguish them from the other orders of men. This crescent was called <hi
                    rend="italic">lunula.</hi> Some say it was of ivory, others that it was worked
                    upon the shoe, and others that it was only a particular kind of <hi
                    rend="italic">fibula</hi> or buckle.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Harvest-M00N.</hi> It is remarkable that the moon, during the
                    week in which she is full in harvest, rises sooner after sunset than she does in
                    any other full moon week in the year; and by doing so, she affords an immediate
                    supply of light after sunset, which is very beneficial to the farmers for
                    reaping and gathering in the fruits of the earth. Hence they distinguish this
                    full moon from all the others in the year, by calling it the <hi rend="italic"

                    philosophers, as equally unreasonable in itself, and contrary to fact. As the
                    most accurate and sensible barometer is not affected by the various positions of
                    the moon, it is not thought likely that the human body should be influenced by
                    them. Several learned and ingenious men, however, still consider Dr Mead’s
                    doctrine as far from being unfounded.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Moon,</hi><hi rend="italic">influence of, on the earth's
                    atmosphere.</hi> It has been the opinion of the vulgar in almost all ages and
                    countries, that the changes which take place in the state of our atmosphere, or
                    the changes of the weather, depend, in a great measure, on certain situations of
                    the moon. It can scarcely be doubted that an opinion so generally received must
                    be founded on something more than fancy or prejudice; and indeed the
                    observations of meteorologists have contributed materially to favour this
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>From the observations of Signior Toaldo, made at Padua, during fifty years, on
                    the state of the weather, which corresponded to certain changes of the moon, he
                    found that these changes were always accompanied by good or bad weather; and he
                    at length became enabled to foretell, with some degree of certainty, what would
                    be the state of the atmosphere which should follow any situation of the moon.
                    There are ten situations of the moon, which, according to Toaldo, are capable of
                    producing a sensible effect upon the earth’s atmosphere. These are the <hi
                    rend="italic">syzigies,</hi> or new and full moon; the quadratures; the <hi
                    rend="italic">apsides,</hi> or apogee and perigee; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lunistices,</hi> or those points when the moon is nearest to our zenith and at
                    the greatest distance from it; and the moon’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >equinoxes.</hi></p>
                <p>He also calculated a series of probabilities that a change of weather will take
                    place on the approach of any one of ten situations, and these he expressed in a
                    tabular form, as follows:</p>

                <p>The observations of Μ. Lamarck, though they confirm the opinion of the moon’s
                    general influence on the atmosphere, do not agree with those of Toaldo, as to
                    the situations of that luminary which correspond to the changes of the weather.
                    He could not find that agreement between the syzigies and quadratures of the
                    moon and a change of weather which has been so much dwelt on by Toaldo; but he
                    is of opinion, that we are to consider the declination of the moon as the
                    principal cause of her influence on the atmosphere.</p>
                <p>Lalande had conceived the idea that when the moon entered the northern
                    hemisphere, or had north declination, the weather was most likely to be cold and
                    dry, and that when she passed to the south of the equator, it was likely to be
                    rainy. The observations of Lamarck, however, tend to establish the contrary
                    opinion.</p>
                <p>Lamarck considers the two following principles as established by his
                    observations, viz. “1. That it is in the elevation of the moon above, and her
                    depression below, the equator, that we are to search for those regularly varied
                    effects which she produces on our atmosphere. 2. That the determinable
                    circumstances which conspire to increase or diminish the moon’s influence in her
                    different declinations, are her apogees and perigees, her conjunctions with and
                    oppositions to the sun; and, lastly, the solar solstices and equinoxes.”</p>
                <p>Considering that every lunar month, or every revolution of the moon in the
                    zodiac, may be divided into two distinct portions, each containing about
                    fourteen days, and each giving occasion to a particular atmospheric
                    constitution, we may assume these as two circumstances of importance in
                    meteorology, and call the one the <hi rend="italic">boreal</hi> or northern
                    constitution, being that in which the moon passes through the six northern signs
                    of the zodiac, and the other the <hi rend="italic">austral</hi> or southern
                    constitution, being that in which she traverses the six southern signs.</p>
                <p>Lamarck was convinced by observation, that in these climates, during a boreal
                    constitution, there chiefly prevailed southerly, south-westerly, and westerly
                    winds, though sometimes, in the summer, the winds passed to the southeast. In
                    general, during this constitution, the barometer exhibits only moderate
                    elevations of the mercury; most commonly the season is rainy or moist, and the
                    air is loaded with clouds. And, lastly, it is particularly during this
                    constitution that we observe the effects of storms and tempests, when the causes
                    which occasion them become active. On the contrary, during an austral
                    constitution, the winds which chiefly predominate blow from the north and
                    north-west, and in the summer north-east, and even easterly winds prevail. In
                    general, during this constitution, the barometer exhibits considerable
                    elevations in the column of mercury, at least if the wind be not very strong;
                    the weather is then most usually clear, cold, and dry, and in the summer it is
                    seldom, we might almost say never, during this constitution that storms are
                    formed.</p>
                <p>These atmospherical constitutions are not, however, so permanently characterized
                    as to render it easy to distinguish them at all times by the state of the
                    atmosphere. The atmospherical air is a moveable fluid, and so easily displaced,
                    that it is not surprising that in the temperate zones, where, from various
                    causes, which counteract the regular influence of the moon, and tend to alter
                    its effects, the influence of the heavenly bodies acts less strongly than
                    between the tropics.</p>
                <p>The perturbations which these variable causes produce on the regular effects of
                    the influence of the moon on the atmosphere, occasion many variations in the two
                    atmospherical constitutions which we have been describing; and this is doubtless
                    the reason why they have been hitherto disregarded. Lamarck positively asserts,
                    that these perturbations, although frequent, and sometimes very considerable, do
                    not prevent the character of each of these constitutions from being remarked in
                    the greatest number of cases. The probability which he finds, according to his
                    observations, is estimated at five out of eight; that is to say, out of
                    forty-eight atmospherical constitutions comprehended in the lunar year, he
                    estimates that there will be found at least thirty agreeing with the principles
                    pointed out in his memoir; and he adds, that amongst the disturbing causes which
                    modify the before-mentioned effects, several maybe foreseen, and perhaps even
                    appreciated as to their quantity of effect. He considers what is here pointed
                    out as a fact, that is, as an order of things which any one may prove by
                    observation.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>See Journal
                    de Phιjslpιe, vol. iff.; and Nicholson’s Journal, 4to, vol. iv.</p></note></p>
                <p>Μ. Cotte also bestowed much attention on the subject of the moon’s influence; but
                    he appears to think that our observations are not sufficiently numerous nor
                    accurate to deduce any thing like a correct theory, and he is not disposed to go
                    as far as Μ. Lamarck. He agrees in general <pb break="no"
