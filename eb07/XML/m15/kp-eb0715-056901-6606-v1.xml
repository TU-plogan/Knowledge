                <p><label type="entry">MOSELLE</label>, a department in the north-east of France,
                    formed out of the district of Messin, of French Luxembourg, and of a part of
                    German Lorraine. It extends in east longitude from 5. 20. to 7. 45., and in
                    north latitude from 48. 55. to 49. 30. It is bounded on the north by the
                    department of the Lower Rhine and the duchy of Luxembourg, on the east by that
                    duchy and the Bavarian circle of the Rhine, on the south by the department of
                    the Meurthe, and on the west by that of the Meuse. It extends over 2473 square
                    miles, or 609,000 hectares, which are apportioned in the following manner, viz.
                    278,920 arable, 48,490 meadows and pastures, 151,365 woods and forests, 4940
                    vineyards, 10,216 gardens, and the remainder consisting of the course of rivers
                    and roads, the site of towns and villages, and utterly uncultivated land, which
                    latter constitutes nearly one fourth of the whole department. The subsoil is
                    generally calcareous, often covered with a heavy clay difficult to plough, but
                    in some parts mixed with sand or stone; and its power of production varies from
                    moderate fertility to absolute barrenness. It produces some good wheat and rye,
                    but the corn does not equal the consumption, though the culture of potatoes has
                    been much extended of late years. The chief river, the Moselle, which begins to
                    be navigable at Metz, and falls into the Rhine at Coblentz, receives the waters
                    of the smaller streams. It is a rapid river, often causing great damage by the
                    overflowing of its banks. Besides the common grain, much flax and some hemp are
                    grown. The vine is much cultivated, but the wine is not of a good flavour, as
                    most of that known by the name of Moselle wine throughout Europe grows on the
                    banks of that river after it has quitted the French territory. The hills around
                    Metz have their sides covered with vines, but the grapes are more used for the
                    purposes of making vinegar and brandy than wine. There are <pb break="no"

                    iron worked, and the material is converted into heavy articles for the use of
                    ships, and for casting cannon. Some linen and woollen cloths are made, and there
                    are fabrics of paper, glass, and earthenware. The population amounts to 350,000
                    persons, who are mostly of the Catholic religion, though there are some few
                    Calvinists, Anabaptists, and Jews, mostly in Metz. The French language is
                    commonly spoken only in the cities. In the villages a patois called Lorraine is
                    most prevalent; but in the eastern part a corrupted German prevails, and the
                    inhabitants have the marks of that nation in their dress, countenances, and
                    manners. The department sends four deputies to the legislative body. It is
                    divided into four arrondissements, 27 cantons, and 834 communes.</p>
