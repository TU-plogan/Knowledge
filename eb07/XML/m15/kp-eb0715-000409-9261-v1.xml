                    celebrated biblical critic, and author of many esteemed works, was the eldest
                    son of Dr Christian Benedict Michaelis, professor in the university of Halle, in
                    Lower Saxony, and was born at that place on the 27th of February 1717. His
                    father devoted him at an early age to an academical life; and with that view he
                    received the first part of his education in a celebrated Prussian seminary
                    called the Orphan-house, at Glanche, in the neighbourhood <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> his native place. He commenced his academical career at Halle in 1733,
                    and took his master’s degree in the faculty of philosophy.in 1739. In 1741 he
                    made an excursion to this country, where his superior knowledge of the oriental
                    languages, which was considerably increased by his indefatigable researches in
                    the Bodleian Library at Oxford, introduced him to the acquaintance, and gained
                    him the esteem, of our first literary characters, with several of whom,
                    particularly Bishop Lowth, he afterwards corresponded for many years. On his
                    return to Halle, after an absence of fifteen months, he began to read lectures
                    on the historical books of the Old Testament, which he continued after his
                    removal to Göttingen in 1745. In 1746 he was appointed professor extraordinary,
                    and soon afterwards professor of philosophy, in that university. The next year
                    he obtained the place of secretary to the Royal Society there, of which he was
                    director in 1761, and he was soon afterwards made aulic counsellor by the court
                    of Hanover. In 1764 his distinguished talents, and a publication relative to a
                    journey to Arabia, which was undertaken by several literary men at the
                    expense.'of the king of Denmark, in consequence of his application through Count
                    Bernsdorf, procured him the honour of being chosen a corresponding, and
                    afterwards a foreign, member of the Academy of Inscriptions at Paris, of which
                    class the institution admitted only eight; and in the same year he became a
                    member of the society of Haerlem. In 1775 Count Hopkin, who, eighteen years
                    before, had prohibited the use of his writings at Upsal, when he was chancellor
                    of that university, prevailed upon the king of Sweden to confer upon him the
                    order of the Polar Star, as a national compensation. In 1786 he was raised to
                    the distinguished rank of privy counsellor of justice by the court of Hanover;
                    and in 1788 he received his last literary honour, by being unanimously elected a
                    fellow of the Royal Society of London. His great critical knowledge of the
                    Hebrew language, which he displayed in a new translation <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the Bible, and in other works, raised him to a degree of eminence
                    almost unknown before in Germany; and his indefatigable labours were only
                    equalled by his desire of communicating the knowledge he had acquired to the
                    numerous students of all countries who frequented his admirable lectures, which
                    he continued to deliver, in half-yearly courses, on various parts of the sacred
                    writings, and on the Hebrew, Arabic, and Syriac languages, to the last year of
                    his life. He was forty-five years professor in the university of Göttingen, and
                    during that long period he filled the chair with dignity, credit, and
                    usefulness. He died on the 22d of October 1791, in the seventy-fourth year of
                    his age.</p>
