                <p><label type="entry">CADIZ</label>, the most important maritime city of Spain. It
                    is situated in the province of Seville, one of the four divisions of Andalusia.
                    Its situation is peculiarly favourable for foreign commerce, especially with the
                    western world, as being more southerly and westerly than any other considerable
                    port. Its harbour, or rather bay, is a most secure port; and the entrance,
                    though obstructed by some groups of rocks, which, being visible, may be avoided,
                    is both easy and safe. The anchorage-ground is good for holding, and it is well
                    protected by strong fortifications. Vessels cannot indeed approach the wharfs,
                    but must be loaded and unloaded by the assistance of barges; and but for this
                    drawback, it would perhaps be the best port in Europe. It is situated at the
                    extremity of a long ridge of sand, which connects it with the Isla de Leon, and
                    separates the bay from the ocean. If those who defend Cadiz are masters of the
                    sea, it is perhaps the most impregnable fortress in the world; but by means of a
                    superior naval force and a large army, it is thought by the best judges to be
                    liable to capture. The spot on which the city is built being very contracted,
                    and incapable of extension, the streets are in consequence narrow, and the
                    houses lofty, so that those of the public buildings which are not near the walls
                    have their magnificence hid from the eye of common observers.</p>
                <p>From its situation, Cadiz is destitute of good water; and though most of the
                    houses have reservoirs for the preservation of rain, a scarcity is felt, and
                    expensively removed by means of numerous boats, which are constantly occupied in
                    the conveyance of water across the bay from the city of Santa Maria. They yearly
                    expend 180,000 guelders in this necessary article. Its principal buildings are
                    the general hospital, which is excellently regulated, and where the aged, the
                    infirm, the sick, and orphans, are relieved. The cathedral, though rich in
                    ornaments, is inferior to most of the episcopal churches in Spain; but a new
                    one, which has been more than ninety years in building, will, if ever it be
                    finished upon the present plan, be extremely magnificent. The other churches are
                    numerous, elegant, and in general richly endowed, and many of them decorated
                    with pictures, the productions of Murillo-Velasquez, Zubaron, and the other
                    great masters of the Spanish school.</p>
                <p>When Spain possessed a navy, the principal arsenal was at Caraccas, which is
                    reached by the largest ships through an inlet from the bay of Cadiz. The
                    magazines and stores are beautiful, and well adapted for the design; and the
                    arsenal is well guarded by a deep ravine on one side, which separates it from
                    the continent, and by impassable marshes on the other.</p>
                <p>As Cadiz is situated on the extremity of a sand-bank, its commerce depends on the
                    country around it, and on the security which its port affords to all property
                    when once within it. It has hence become the entrepôt for almost the whole
                    extensive commerce of the Spanish empire in the western hemisphere. The articles
                    required for the <hi rend="superscript"> su</hi> pply θf these colonies from
                    Russia, Germany, England, Holland, and France, as well as the manufactures of
                    Spain, are first collected here, and from hence distributed over the whole
                    surface of Spanish America. The whole of the gold and silver from Mexico and
                    Peru, and the other valuable productions of those countries, centre here, and
                    are then diffused over the surface of Europe, in return for the various
                    commodities that have been furnished. The imports from America in 1805 amounted
                    in merchandise to 45,865,396, and in silver to 77,328,403 guelders. Besides this
                    commerce with America, Cadiz is the focus into which are collected the wines and
                    oils which Andalusia produces, and the other valuable commodities of the
                    adjacent country.</p>
                <p>The custom-house is a well-regulated establishment, and enjoys in its various
                    store-houses great conveniences for the reception of such goods as are brought
                    to it to be re-exported. The trade of Cadiz, like that of most of the other more
                    eminent maritime cities in the Spanish dominions, is under the regulation of a
                    body called the Consulado, consisting of the principal merchants, who have very
                    considerable power and wealth as a corporation, and are besides a tribunal for
                    determining such legal questions as are purely commercial.</p>
                <p>The police of the city is regulated by the cabildo or municipal corporation, to
                    whom, under the orders of the governor, is intrusted the preservation of the
                    public walks and buildings, the cleansing and lighting of the streets, the care
                    of the prisons and hospitals, and other similar objects.</p>
                <p>Several establishments in this city bespeak an attention not merely to commerce,
                    but to science. There is a college, in which both the classics and mathematics
                    are taught, as well as the theology of the Peninsula. There is an astronomical
                    observatory, in which observations are continually rriade, and where a nautical
                    ephemeris is composed, which does not suffer by comparison with those of
                    Greenwich or of Paris. Some of the best maps extant have been framed by those
                    who were educated here; and the names of Malaspina, Lopez, Tofini, and Rios de
                    Mendoza, will be of equal authority with any that England or France has
                    produced.</p>
                <p>This city was known before the Roman conquest as a place of trade, and not
                    improbably was the port of Tarshish, to which the ships of Solomon resorted.
                    Under the name of Gades it was long occupied by the Romans, and was a place of
                    great importance to Caesar in his wars with the Pompeys. A bridge called Puente
                    de Suarzo, leading from the continent to the city, was, according to tradition,
                    constructed by that commander; but though it is now known to be of more recent
                    erection, it is highly probable, from the importance of the passage, that a
                    bridge on the spot was erected by the Roman conqueror.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of Cadiz, in ordinary times, amount to about 75,000. During the
                    late war, when it was the ultimate refuge of the government, they are said to
                    have been trebled; but of this, and the other occurrences of the war, the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Spain</hi> will narrate the particulars. Very
                    accurate observations have fixed the observatory to be in north latitude 36.
                    32., and west longitude 2. 33. 54. from Madrid, or 5. 45. 54. from Greenwich.
