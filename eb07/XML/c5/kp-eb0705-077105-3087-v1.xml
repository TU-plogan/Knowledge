                <p><label type="entry">CÀERMÀRTHENSHIRE</label>, a county in South Wales, containing
                    926 square miles, or about 590,640 acres. The northern and eastern parts are
                    mountainous. Near the sea the land is flat, but the general surface of the
                    county is hilly. It is intersected in almost every direction' by valleys, from
                    the sides of which the hills rise abruptly. These valleys are, for the most
                    part, very narrow. The most celebrated for fertility and picturesque beauty, as
                    well as the most extensive, is the vale of Towy, which stretches thirty miles up
                    the county, with a breadth of only two miles. From the celebrated Grongar Hill,
                    and the ruins of the Castle of Dynevor, the picturesque beauties of this vale
                    are seen to the greatest advantage.</p>
                <p>The principal rivers in Càermàrthenshire are the lowy, the Teivy or Tair, the
                    Cothy, the Dulas, and the Gwilly. The Towy rises in Cardiganshire. It enters
                    Caermarthėn-shire at its north-eastern corner, &gt; crossing towards the
                    south-west, and, passing Caermarthen, it empties itself into the large bay
                    between the counties of Glamorgan and Pembroke,.called Caermarthen Bay. Many
                    rivulets join the Towy in its course, among which is the Cothy. This stream
                    rises on the north side of the county, and, running mostly in a southern
                    direction, unites with the Towy about six miles above Caermarthen. The Teivy
                    rises in Cardiganshire, between which county and Caer-marthcnshirc it afterwards
                    forms the boundary: soon after receiving the Keach, it enters the county of
                    Pembroke.</p>
                <p>The principal ports in this county are Llanelly, Kidwelly, Caermarthen, and
                    Llaugharnc. Llanelly has a good port for vessels of ten feet draught, formed by
                    an inlet oí the sea called Burry River, which divides this county and
                    Glamorganshire. Llanelly is the port of entry of Kidwelly and Caermarthen: its
                    exports are coal and tinned iron plates. Kidwelly is situated on two small
                    streams called Givandraeth, which form a little haven, but mostly choked with
                    sand. From this town a canal has been cut, at the expense of a private
                    gentleman, between three and four miles long, to his coal-mines and
                    lime-quarries; and by means of this canal Kidwelly has been enabled to export a
                    considerable quantity of coals. Vessels of 250 tons burden ascend to the bridge
                    of the town of Caermarthen on the Towy, but the entrance of the river is rather
                    difficult, in consequence of a bar across it. The principal exports of
                    Caermarthen are tin plates and cast iron. Llaugharne, on a creek, is chiefly
                    remarkable for a considerable flat tract in the vicinity, embanked from the sea,
                    and of singular fertility.</p>
                <p>The climate of this county is soft and mild, but moist; the soil of the lower
                    districts is fertile, being for the most part either a rich clay or a sharp or
                    deep loam. Little wheat is grown; and, except on the lighter soils, barley is
                    not a common crop; but oats are extensively cultivated, and, in respect both of
                    produce and quality, are a very profitable crop. Great quantities are exported,
                    chiefly to Bristol. The pasture lands, especially where the soil is suitable,
                    support a heavy stock; they are applied either to the dairy or to the breeding
                    of black-cattle and horses. The latter are reared in great numbers on the hills,
                    and constitute the principal article of trade at the fairs of this and the
                    adjacent counties. Much butter is exported. It is computed that 114,000 acres
                    are in tillage, and about double that number in pasture; the rest is unfit for
                    cultivation, though by no means unprofitable. According to the original
                    agricultural report of this county, there are only about 170,000 acres of wastes
                    and commons. This county was formerly extremely well wooded; but of late years
                    great waste has been made <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the timber. Its rivers and
                    sea-coast abound in fish, especially salmon of excellent quality, and a species
                    of trout, called <hi rend="italic">suen,</hi> in high request with epicures.</p>
                <p>Càermàrthenshire is rich in mineral productions. Coals and lead are the most
                    abundant and profitable. The greatest lead-mines are not far from Llandowry.
                    Limestone also abounds, and there are considerable quantities of iron ore. The
                    sands in the vicinity of Llaugharne, according to Mr Donovan, abound in shells
                    of great rarity and beauty. On the road from Caermarthen to Llandillo Vawr a
                    medicinal spring has lately been discovered, containing carbonic acid gas,
                    carbonate of iron and lime, muriate of soda and lime, and sulphate of lime. At
                    Kastell-Karreg there is a fountain which ebbs and flows twice in twenty-four
                    hours. There are several remains of antiquity, chiefly Roman, to be seen in
                    Caermarthenshire&lt;</p>
                <p>The inhabitants who are not engaged in agriculture arc principally employed in
                    working the mines, in manufacturing the produce of these mines, and in making
                    woollen stockings. The most extensive manufactures of tinned iron plates are
                    carried on at Kidwelly, where are also other <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193743100?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3100-0772"/> [manufactures
                    of iron, for which there are large and excellent furnaces, forges,
                    flatting-mills, &amp;c. Tinned plates and cast iron are also manufactured at
                    Caermarthen, and the works in both branches are extensive. In the neighbourhood
                    of Llandowry the woollen-stocking manufactory principally prevails.</p>
                <p>The money raised for the maintenance of the poor in 1803 was L.17,046, at the
                    rate of 12s. 9d. in the pound. In the year ending· the 25th of March 1815, there
                    was paid, in parochial rates, the sum of L.30,354. 6s. 9⅜d∙ from eighty-three
                    parishes alone, the remaining forty-three not having made any return. By the
                    population returns in the year 1800 there were 13,449 inhabited houses, 67,317
                    inhabitants, 31,439 males, and 35,878 females; of this number 32,862 were
                    returned as employed in agriculture, and 4343 as employed in trade. The
                    following are the results of the population returns in 1811, 1821, and
                    1831..</p>
