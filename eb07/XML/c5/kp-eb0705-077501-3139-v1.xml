                    the family of the Julii, who pretended they were descended from Venus by AEneas.
                    The descendants <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Ascanius, sons of AEneas and Creüsa,
                    and surnamed Julius, lived in Alba till that city was ruined by Tullus
                    Hostilius, king of Rome, who carried them to Rome, where they afterwards
                    flourished. We do not find that they produced more than two branches. The first
                    bore the name of Tullus, the other that of Caesar. The most ancient of the
                    Caesars were those who held public employments in the eleventh year of the first
                    Punic war. After that time some of the family always enjoyed public offices in

                    the subject <hi rend="italic">of</hi> this article. He was born at Rome the 12th
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the month Quintilis, in the year of the city 653, and
                    lost his father in 669. By his valour and eloquence he soon acquired the highest
                    reputation both in the field and in the senate. Beloved and respected by his
                    fellow-citizens, he enjoyed successively every magisterial and military honour
                    the republic couhΓbestow consistently with its own free constitution. But at
                    length having subdued Pompey, the great rival of his growing power, his
                    boundless ambition effaced the glory of his former actions. For, pursuing his
                    favourite maxim, that he had rather be the first man in a village than the
                    second in Rome, he caused himself to be chosen perpetual dictator; and, not
                    -content with this unconstitutional power, his faction had resolved to raise him
                    to the imperial dignity; when the friends of the civil liberties of the republic
                    rashly assassinated him in the senate-house, instead of seizing and bringing him
                    to a legal trial for usurpation. By this impolitic measure they defeated their
                    own purpose; involved the city in consternation and terror, which produced
                    general anarchy; and paved the way for the revolution which they wished to
                    prevent, the monarchical government being absolutely founded on the murder of
                    Julius Caesar. He fell in the fifty-sixth year of his age, and the forty-third
                    before the Christian era. His <hi rend="italic">Commentaries</hi> contain a
                    history of his principal voyages, battles, and victories. The London edition in

                    rend="smallcaps">Caesar,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Roman Antiquity,</hi> a title
                    borne by all the emperors, from the time <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Julius Caesar
                    till the destruction of the empire. It was also used as a title of distinction
                    for the intended or presumptive heir <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the empire, as
                    <hi rend="italic">King of the łłomans</hi> was latterly used for that of the
                    German empire.</p>
                <p>This title took its rise from the surname of C. Julius Caesar, which, by a decrcc
                    of the senate, all the succeeding emperors were to bear. Under his successor,
                    the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Augustus</hi> being appropriated to the
                    emperors, in compliment to the prince of that name, the title <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caesar</hi> was given to the second person in the empire, though still it
                    continued to be given to the first; and hence the difference betwixt Caesar used
                    simply, and Caesar with the addition of Imperator Augustus.</p>
                <p>The dignity of Caesar remained to the second of the empire, till Alexius Comnenus
                    having elected Nicephorus Melissenus Caesar by contract, and it being necessary
                    to confer some higher dignity on his own brother 1saacius, he created him
                    Sebastocrator, with the precedency over Melissenus; ordering, that in all
                    acclamations, Isaacius <pb break="no" facs="nls:193743152?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-3152-0776"/> Sebastoerator should be narñed the seeond, and
                    Melíssenus Caesai* the third.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Caesar,</hi><hi rend="italic">Sir Julius,</hi> a learned
                    civilian, was descended by the fcmalc line from the Duke de Cessarini in Italy,
                    and was born near Tottenham in Middlesex in the year 1557. Hc was educated at
                    Oxford, and afterwards studied in the university of Paris, where, in the year
                    1581, he was created doctor of the civil law, and two years afterwards was
                    admitted to the same degree at Oxford, and also beeame doctor of the eanon law.
                    He was advanced to many honourable employments, and for the last twenty years of
                    his life was master of the rolls. He was remarkable for his extensive bounty and
                    charity to ail persons of worth, so that he seemed to be the ahnoner-gencral of
                    the nation. He died in 1639, in the seventy-ninth year of his age. It is very
                    remarkable that the manuscripts of this lawyer were offered, by the executors of
                    some of his descendants, to a cheesemonger as waste paper; but being timely
                    inspected by Mr Samuel Paterson, this gentleman discovered their value, and had
                    the satisfaction to find his judgment confirmed by the profession, to whom they
                    were sold in lots, for upwards of L.500, in the year 1757.</p>
