                <p><label type="entry">CAILLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Nicholas Louis de
                    la</hi></label>, an eminent mathematician and astronomer, was born at a small
                    town in the diocese of Rheims in 1713. His father had served in the army, which
                    he quitted, and in his retirement studied mathematics, and amused himself with
                    mechanic exercises, in which he proved the fortunate author of several
                    inventions of considerable use to the public. Nicholas almost in his infancy
                    took a fancy to mechanics, which proved of signal service to him in his maturer
                    years. He was sent young to school at Mantes-sur-Seine, where he discovered
                    early tokens of genius. In 1729 he repaired to Paris, where lie studied the
                    classics, philosophy, and mathematics; and he afterwards went to study divinity
                    at the college de Navarre, proposing to embrace an ecclesiastical life. At the
                    end of three years he was ordained as a deacon, and officiated as such in the
                    church of the college de Mazarin several years; but he never entered into
                    priest’s orders, apprehending that his astronomical studies, to which he had
                    become most assiduously devoted, might interfere too much with his religious
                    duties. In 1739 he was conjoined with Μ. de Thury, son to M. Cassini, in
                    verifying the meridian of the royal observatory throughout the whole extent of
                    the kingdom of France. In the month of November the same year, whilst he was
                    engaged day and night in the operations which this grand undertaking required,
                    and at a great distance from Paris, he was, without any solicitation, elected to
                    the vacant mathematical chair which the celebrated Μ. Varignon had so worthily
                    filled. Here he began to teach about the end of 1740; and an observatory was
                    ordered to be erected for his use in the college, and furnished with a suitable
                    apparatus of the best instruments. In May 1741, Μ. de la Caille was admitted
                    into the Royal Academy of Sciences as an adjoint member for astronomy. Besides
                    many excellent papers dispersed through their Memoirs, he published elements of
                    geometry, mechanics, optics, and astronomy. Moreover, he carefully computed all
                    the eclipses of the sun and moon that had happened since the Christian era;
                    which were printed in a book published by two Benedictines, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">ĽArt de Verifier les Dates,</hi> Paris, 1750, in 4to. Besides
                    these, he compiled a volume of astronomical ephemerides for the years 1745 to
                    1755; another for the years 1755 to 1765; a third for the years 1765 to 1775; an
                    excellent work entitled <hi rend="italic">Astronomiae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fundamenta novissimis</hi><hi rend="italic">Solis</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Stellarum observationibus stabilita</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the most
                    correct solar tables which had ever appeared. Having performed a seven years’
                    series of astronomical observations in his own observatory, he formed a project
                    of going to observe the southern stars at the Cape of Good Hope. This was highly
                    approved of by the academy, as well as by the prime minister Comte de Argenson,
                    and very readily agreed to by the states of Holland. Upon this lie drew up a
                    plan of the method he intended to pursue in his southern observations; setting
                    forth, that, besides settling the places of the fixed stars, he proposed to
                    determine the parallaxes of the Moon, Mars, and Venns. But as this required
                    contemporaneous observations to be made in the northern parts of the world, he
                    sent to those of his correspondents who were expert in practical astronomy
                    previous notice in print, what observations he designed to make at particular
                    times for the above purpose. At length, on the 21st of November 1750, he sailed
                    for the Cape, and arrived there on the 19th of April 1751. He forthwith got his
                    instruments on shore; and, with the assistance of some Dutch artificers, set
                    about building an astronomical observatory, in which his apparatus of
                    instruments was properly disposed of as soon as the building was in a fit
                    condition to receive them.</p>
                <p>The sky at the Cape is generally pure and serene, unless when a south-east wind
                    blows; but this is often the case; and when the wind in question blows, it is
                    attended with some strange and striking effects. The stars look bigger, and seem
                    to quiver; the moon has an undulating tremor; and the planets have beards like
                    comets. Two hundred and twenty-eight nights did our astronomer survey the face
                    of the southern heavens, during which space of time he observed more than 10,000
                    stars; and as the ancients had filled the heavens with monsters and old wives’
                    tales, the Abbé de la Caille chose rather to adorn them with the instruments and
                    machines which modern philosophy has made use of for the conquest of nature.
                    With no less success did he attend to the parallaxes of the Moon, Mars, Venus,
                    and the Sun. Having thus executed the purpose of his voyage, and no present
                    opportunity offering for his return, he thought of employing the vacant time in
                    another arduous attempt, which was no less than that of taking the measure of
                    the earth, as he had already done that of the heavens. This indeed had, through
                    the munificence of the French king, been done before by different sets of
                    learned men, both in Europe and America, some determining the extent of a degree
                    under the equator, and others its extent under the arctic circle; but it had not
                    as yet been decided whether in the southern parallels of latitude the same
                    dimensions obtained as in the northern. His labours, however, were rewarded with
                    the satisfaction he wished for, having determined a distance of 410,814 feet
                    from ä place called Klip Fontyn to the Cape, by means of a base of 38,802 feet,
                    ascertained by three actual measure-ménts<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193743178?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0705-3178-0778"/>; and in this
                    way he discovered a new secret of nature, namely, that the radii of the
                    parallels in south latitude are not the same as those of the corresponding
                    parallels in north latitude. About the twenty-third degree of south latitude he
                    found a degree on the meridian to contain 342,222 Paris feet. He returned to
                    Paris on the 27th of September 1754, having, in his almost four years’ absence,
                    expended no more than 9144 livres on himself and his companion; and at his
                    coming into port he refused a bribe of 100,000 livres, offered by one who
                    thirsted less after glory than gain, to share his immunity from customhouse
                    searches.</p>
                <p>After receiving the congratulatory visits of his more intimate friends and of the
                    astronomers, he first of all employed himself in drawing up a reply to some
                    strictures which Professor Euler had published relative to the meridian; and
                    then he settled the results of the comparison of his own with the observations
                    of other astronomers for the parallaxes. That of the sun he fixed at 9⅜", that
                    of the moon at 56' 56", that of Mars in his opposition at 36", that of Venus at
                    38". He also settled the laws by which astronomical refractions are varied in
                    consequence of the different density or rarity of the air, owing to heat or cold
                    and dryness or moisture. And, lastly, he showed an easy, and by common
                    navigators practicable, method of finding the longitude at sea by means of the
                    moon; which he illustrated by examples selected from his own observations during
                    his voyages. His fame being now established upon a firm basis, the most
                    celebrated academies of Europe claimed him as their own; and he was unanimously
                    elected a member of the Royal Society at London, of the Institute of Bologna, of
                    the Imperial Academy at Petersburg, and of the Royal Academies of Berlin,
                    Stockholm, and Göttingen. In the year 1760, Μ. de la Caille was. attacked with a
                    severe fit of the gout, which, however, did not interrupt the course of his
                    studies; for he then planned out a new and immense work, which was no less than
                    the history of astronomy through all ages, with a comparison of the ancient and
                    modern observations, and the construction and use of the instruments employed in
                    making them. In order to pursue the task he had imposed upon himself in a
                    suitable retirement, he obtained a grant of apartments in the royal palace of
                    Vincennes; and whilst his astronomical apparatus was erecting there, he began
                    printing his <hi rend="italic">Catalogue of the Southern Stars,</hi> and the
                    third volume of his <hi rend="italic">Ephemerides.</hi> But towards the end of
                    the year 1763, the state of his health became greatly reduced. His blood grew
                    inflamed; he had pains of the head, obstructions of the kidneys, and loss of
                    appetite, with a plethoric oppression on the whole system. His mind remained
                    unaffected, and hc resolutely persisted in his studies as usual. In the month of
                    March medicines were administered to him, which rather aggravated than
                    alleviated his symptoms; and he was now sensible, that the same distemper which
                    in Africa, ten years before, had yielded to a few simple remedies, would in his
                    native country bid defiance to the best physicians. This induced him to settle
                    his affairs: his manuscripts he committed to the care and discretion of his
                    esteemed friend Μ. Maraldi. It was at last determined that a vein should bc
                    opened; but this brought on an obstinate lethargy, of which he died, at the age
                    of forty-nine.</p>
