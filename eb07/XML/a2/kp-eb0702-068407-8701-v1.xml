                    or separation of parts by cutting, applied to organized bodies, is used to
                    denote the artificial separation of their component parts in order to obtain an
                    exact knowledge of their situation, shape, and structure.</p>
                <p>A more just idea of the nature and objects of anatomy may be given by defining it
                    as that science, the province of which is to ascertain the structure of living
                    and organized bodies.</p>
                <p>All the objects of the material world may be arranged in two great divisions,
                    according as they are organized or void of organization. Inorganic bodies <hi
                    rend="italic">(corpora</hi><hi rend="italic">bruta)</hi> are distinguished by
                    the homogeneous characters of their internal structure, any one portion of
                    which, in the same mass, presents the same appearance and properties as any
                    other. Endowed also with the general properties of matter, as weight, cohesion,
                    impenetrability, and atomic attraction, or that resident in the constituent
                    particles, they are subject to physical laws only. All the changes which
                    inorganic bodies undergo consist either in mechanical changes of placę or shape,
                    or in change of chemical constitution; and the consideration of the mode in
                    which these changes take place, of the agents by which they are effected, and
                    the laws by which they are regulated, constitutes the sciences of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mechanics</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Chemistry.</hi></p>
                <p>In organic bodies <hi rend="italic">(corpora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >organica,</hi><hi rend="italic">c. viva),</hi> on the contrary, we recognise a
                    peculiar structure, in which the parts, though arranged in a certain order, are
                    heterogeneous, or consist of different kinds of matter. In other words, not only
                    do organized bodies consist of different kinds of substance, but these component
                    substances may be again resolved into material elements, differing from each
                    other in mechanical, chemical, and vital properties.</p>
                <p>Observation further shows, that organic are distinguished from inorganic bodies
                    by the presence of a series and combination of actions and processes, which are
                    collectively known under the abstract denomination of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Life.</hi> Of this term, however familiar it may appear, it has been found
                    difficult to give a satisfactory arid unobjectionable definition; and
                    physiological authors have found it requisite, in order to avoid obscurity, to
                    define it from its tendency, its obvious effects, or, negatively, from what
                    experience shows to ensue upon its termination. Life is an attribute of living
                    bodies, and is known only as it manifests its presence in these; and hence,
                    instead of saying what it is, we are compelled to specify only the circumstances
                    which denote its existence. Attentively considered, all the varieties of
                    organized and living bodies may be said to be distinguished from those which are
                    inorganic by two great characters,—growth or the reproduction of the individual,
                    and generation or the reproduction of the species. Growth, or increase of size,
                    includes the general processes of assimilation and nutrition, with all the
                    subordinate actions of which these are composed; and since it consists in the
                    conversion of brüte or inorganic into living or organic matter, it constitutes
                    one of the most essential characters of life and organization. By virtue of
                    this, living bodies are the seat of an incessant change in their interior
                    structure; whereas inorganic bodies remain in the same state, unless from the
                    operation of chemical laws. The formation of a new body similar to others of the
                    same class, order, and kind, however various in its mode, is also a uniform
                    attribute of all living and orga<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038714?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8714-0685"/>nized bodies.
                    To one or other of, these two general purposes, then, all the actions and
                    processes of living bodies, however complex and multifarious they seem, may be
                    ultimately referred. To these two characters of living bodies Cuvier adds a
                    third,—death, or the termination of life; but as this is a negative
                    circumstance, and is included in the idea of life as a process having beginning
                    and end, it is superfluous in the general idea of the term. The knowledge of the
                    actions and processes of living and organized bodies, and of the laws to which
                    they are subject, constitutes the science of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Physiology,</hi> or, as it has been also denominated, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoonomy</hi><hi rend="italic">(ζωη</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vομoς, laws of

                    doctrine of life).</hi></p>
                <p>Life supposes organization or the arrangement of matter and material particles
                    peculiar, to living bodies; and, reciprocally, organization, though not the
                    cause of life and living processes, invariably implies their existence, either
                    present or previous. In other words, every organized body either is or must have
                    been living; and every living body is endowed with the peculiar internal
                    structure termed <hi rend="italic">organic.</hi> Though it is difficult to
                    specify by definition the characters of this structure, some idea of it may be
                    communicated by stating, that all living bodies possess material Organs of
                    definite shape, subátance, ’ and structure, consisting of certain parts, and
                    placed in proper positions. While it is the province of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Physiology</hi> to study the actions and processes of living bodies, and to
                    investigate the laws by which they are regulated, the exclusive object of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> is to distinguish and describe their constituent
                    parts,—to determine the shape, position, and structure of their organs,—and, in
                    short, to develope their structure. The term is not free from objection, since
                    it literally denotes one only of the means employed to acquire the information
                    requisite. But the objection is not obviated by the substitution of such terms
                    as i <hi rend="italic">morphology</hi> and <hi rend="italic">organology,</hi> in
                    so far as the study of anatomy is not confined either to the shapes of parts or
                    the knowledge of organs alone, but considers their position, their intimate
                    structure, and their organization; in short, all the circumstances relating to
                    the material constitution of living bodies.</p>
                <p>All living and organized bodies, though agreeing in the general character of
                    possessing organs for assimilation and nutrition, and organs of reproduction,
                    differ nevertheless Ìin the possession or .the want of organs for two other
                    functions, viz. those for recognising the presence of foreign bodies, or organs
                    of <hi rend="italic">sensation,</hi> and those for changing place, or organs of
                    <hi rend="italic">locomotion.</hi> The possession of these organs· distinguishes
                    those living beings denominated <hi rend="smallcaps">animals</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">;</hi> the want of them, in'like manner characterizes those
                    termed <hi rend="smallcaps">plants</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">vegetables.</hi>
                    Upon this principle anatomy, or the science of organic structures, resolves
                    itself into two great divisions,— <hi rend="smallcaps">Animal Anatomy,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Zootomy</hi><hi rend="italic">(ζωov</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">τομιf),</hi> the object of which is the investigation of the
                    structure of animal bodies; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Veget-</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript smallcaps"> ,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">able Anatomy,</hi> or

                    rend="italic">rομη),</hi> the object of which is to explain the structure
                    peculiar to the vegetable tribes.</p>
                <p>Animal anatomy, again, naturally resolves itself into several divisions,
                    according as the object is to explain the structure of the animal kingdom at
                    large, or that of certain classes, orders, tribes, families, or genera only. The
                    most, ordinary and convenient division, however, is into that which treats of
                    the anatomy of the known animal tribes in general, and that which treats of the
                    structure peculiar to the human subject. The accidental circumstance of the
                    former being studied chiefly in comparison with the latter, the organic forms of
                    which are regarded as the standard of reference, has given it the denomina-</p>
                <p>685</p>
                <p>tion of <hi rend="smallcaps">Comparative Anatomy,</hi> though that of <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Zootomy</hi> would be more
                    appropriate.</p>
                <p>The latter has generally been named <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy</hi> simply, or
                    the Anatomy of the Human Body, and occasionally <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Anthropotomy</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Human Anatomy.</hi></p>
                <p>, The connection which subsists between the latter and the several divisions of
                    the art of healing, renders it interesting to the medical, the surgical, and the
                    philosophical reader generally, and invests it with the highest importance to
                    all. Comparative Anatomy, nevertheless, possesses the peculiar advantage of
                    directing the mind of the inquirer to general resemblances, to universal facts,
                    and to comprehensive analogies. Independent of the important services, which its
                    knowledge renders to several of the arts, it is of the greatest use in throwing
                    light on some of the obscurest parts of physiology; by the extensive chain of
                    analogical facts which it traces, it tends to explain difficulties in
                    organization and function, which could not otherwise be intelligible; and by
                    establishing the connection between external characters and habits with
                    peculiarities of internal structure, it affords the only rational basis for the
                    classifications and distinctions of zoology. Comparative or Animal Anatomy
                    constitutes the great source of what may be termed the Philosophy of Animal
                    Life.</p>
                <p>Of the present treatise, the greater part will be devoted to the subject of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Human Anatomy,</hi> or the explanation of the structure of the
                    human frame in the healthy state. In a smaller proportion, it is proposed to
                    give a view of the structure of animal bodies generally, with occasional
                    observations on those peculiarities in configuration and structure which
                    distinguish classes, orders, and genera, from each other. This will constitute
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Comparative Anatomy.</hi></p>
                <p>In a separate article, devoted to <hi rend="smallcaps">Vegetable Anatomy,</hi>
                    the peculiarities of structure observed in plants will be unfolded.</p>
                <p>Previous to entering on the subject of Animal Anatomy, however, and its two
                    divisions, Human and Comparative Anatomy, it is requisite to take an historical
                    view of the progress of the science from its origin to the present time.</p>
                <p>In tracing the history of the origin of anatomy, it may History, be justly said
                    that more learning than judgment has been displayed. Some writers claim for it
                    the highest anti-B.C. 1957- quity, and pretend to find its first rudiments
                    alternately in 1537· the animal sacrifices of the shepherd kings, the-Jews, and
                    other ancient nations; and in the art of embalming, as practised by the Egyptian
                    priests. Even the descriptions 1184. of ’ wounds in the Iliad have been supposed
                    adequate to prove that, in the time of Homer, mankind had distinct notions of
                    the structure of the human body. Of the first, it may be said that the rude
                    information obtained by the slaughter of animals for sacrifice does not imply
                    profound anatomical knowledge; and those who adduce the sëcotìđ as evidence, are
                    deceived by the language of the poet of the Trojan war, which, distinguishing
                    certain parts by their ordinary Greek epithets, as afterwards used by
                    Hippocrates, Galen, and all anatomists, has been rather too easily supposed to
                    prove that the poet had studied systematically the structure of the human
                    frame.</p>
                <p>With’ not much greater justice has the cultivation of anatomical knowledge been
                    ascribed to Hippocrates, who, because he is universally allowed to be the father
                    of medicine, has also been thought to be the creator of the science of anatomy.
                    Of the seven individuals of the fa-4G0-377∙ mily of the Heracleidae who bore
                    this celebrated name, the second, who was son of Heraclides and Phenarita, and
                    grandson of the first Hippocrates, was indeed distinguished <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038727?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8727-0686"/> as the author
                    of medical observation and experience, and the first who appreciated the value
                    of studying accurately the phenomena, effects, and terminations of disease. It
                    does not appear, however, notwithstanding the vague and general panegyrics of
                    Riolan, Bartholin, Le Clerc, and Portal, that the anatomical knowledge of this
                    illustrious person was either accurate or profound. Of the works ascribed to
                    Hippocrates, five only are genuine. Most of them were written either by
                    subsequent authors of the same name, or by one or other of the numerous
                    impostors who took advantage of the zealous munificence of the Ptolemies, by
                    fabricating works under that illustrious name. Of the few which are genuine,
                    there is none expressly devoted to anatomy; and of his knowledge on this
                    subject, the only proofs are to be found in the exposition of his physiological
                    opinions, and his medical or surgical instructions. From these it appears that
                    he had some accurate notions on osteology; but that of the structure of the
                    human body in general, his ideas were at once superficial and erroneous. In his
                    book on injuries of the head, and in that on fractures, he shows that he knew
                    the sutures of the cranium, and the relative situation of the bones; and that he
                    had some notion of the shape of the bones in general, and of their mutual
                    connections. Of the muscles, of the soft parts in general, and of the internal
                    organs, his ideas are confused, indistinct, and erroneous. The term <hi
                    rend="italic">φ^KiZς</hi> he seems, in imitation of the colloquial Greek, to
                    have used generally to signify a blood-vessel, without being aware of the
                    distinction of vein and artery; and the term αgr&gt;jg∕α, or air-holder, is
                    restricted to the windpipe. He appears to have been unaware of the existence of
                    the nervous chords; and the term is used by him, as by Grecian authors in
                    general, to signify a <hi rend="italic">sinew</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >tendon.</hi> On other points his knowledge is so much combined with peculiar
                    physiological doctrines, that it is impossible to assign them the character of
                    anatomical facts; and even the works in which these doctrines are contained are
                    with little probability to be ascribed to the second Hippocrates. If, however,
                    we overlook this difficulty, and admit what is contained in the genuine
                    Hippocratic writings to represent at least the sum of knowledge possessed by
                    Hippocrates and his immediate descendants, we find that he represents the brain
                    as a gland, from which exudes a viscid fluid; that the heart is muscular and of
                    pyramidal shape, and has two ventricles separated by a partition, the fountains
                    of life—and two auricles, receptacles of air; that the lungs consist of five
                    ash-coloured lobes, the substance of which is cellular and spongy, naturally
                    dry, but refreshed by the air; and that the kidneys are glands, but possess an
                    attractive faculty, by virtue of which the moisture of the drink is separated,
                    and descends into the bladder. He distinguishes the bowels into colon and rectum
                    (ó αgχβi)∙</p>
                <p>The knowledge possessed by the second Hippocrates was transmitted in various
                    degrees of purity to the descendants and pupils, chiefly of the family of the
                    Hera-cleidae, who succeeded him. Several of these, with feelings of grateful
                    affection, appear to have studied to preserve the written memory of his
                    instructions, and in this manner to have contributed to form part of that
                    collection of treatises which have long been known to the learned world under
                    the general name of the <hi rend="italic">Hippocratic writings.</hi> Though
                    composed, like the genuine remains of the physician of Cos, in the Ionian
                    dialect, all of them differ from these in being more diffuse in style, more
                    elaborate in form, and in studying to invest their anatomical and medical matter
                    with the fanciful ornaments of the Platonic philosophy. Hippocrates had the
                    merit of early recognising the value of facts apart from opinions, and of those
                    facts especially which lead to general results; and in the few genuine writings
                    which are now extant, it is easy to perceive that he has recourse to the
                    simplest language, expresses himself in terms which, though short and pithy, are
                    always precise and perspicuous, and is averse to the introduction of
                    philosophical dogmas. Of the greater part of the writings collected under his
                    name, on the contrary, the general character is verbosencss, prolixity, and a
                    great tendency to speculative opinions. For these reasons, as well as for others
                    derived from internal evidence, while the Aphorisms, the Epidemics, and the
                    works above mentioned, bear distinct marks of being the genuine remains of

                    ∣ ΦυΛο; A νιώσου as entirely the composition of that physician; and it appears
                    more reasonable to view it as the work of some one of the numerous disciples to
                    whom the author had communicated the results of his observation, which they
                    unwisely attempted to combine with the philosophy of the Platonic school and
                    their own mysterious opinions.</p>
                <p>Among those who aimed at this distinction, the most fortunate in the preservation
                    of his name is Polybus, the son-in-law of the physician of Cos. This person, who
                    must not be confounded with the monarch of Corinth immortalized by Sophocles in
                    the tragic story of OEdipus, is represented as a recluse, severed from the world
                    and its enjoyments, and devoting himself to the study of anatomy and physiology,
                    and to the composition of works on these subjects. To him has been ascribed the
                    whole of the book on <hi rend="italic">the Nature of the Child,</hi> and most of
                    that <hi rend="italic">on Man</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> both physiological
                    treatises, interspersed with anatomical sketches. His anatomical information,
                    with which at present is our chief concern, appears to have been rude and
                    inaccurate, like that of his preceptor. He represents the large vessels of the
                    body to consist of four pairs: the first proceeding from the head by the back of
                    the neck and spinal chord to the hips, lower extremities, and outer ankle; the
                    second, consisting of the jugular vessels <hi rend="italic">(α</hi> ∣ <hi
                    rend="italic">eφαγ</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">- rιδις),</hi> proceeding to the
                    loins, thighs, hams, and inner ankle; the third proceeding from the temples by
                    tlιe neck to the <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> and lungs, and thence by mutual
                    intercrossings to the spleen and left kidney, and the liver and right kidney,
                    and finally to the rectum; and the fourth from the fore-part of the neck to the
                    upper extremities, the fore-part of the trunk, and the organs of generation.</p>
                <p>This specimen of the anatomical knowledge of one of the most illustrious of the
                    Hippocratic disciples differs not essentially from that of Syennesis, the
                    physician of Cyprus, and Diogenes, the philosopher of Apollonia, two authors,
                    for the preservation of whose opinions we are indebted to Aristotle.<note

                    as representing the state of anatomical knowledge among the most enlightened men
                    at that time, and they only show how rude and erroneous were their ideas on the
                    structure of the animal body. It may indeed, without injustice, be said, that
                    the anatomy of the Hippocratic school is not only erroneous, but fanciful and
                    imaginary, in often substituting mere supposition and assertion for what ought
                    to be matter of fact. From this censure it is impossible to exempt even the name
                    of Plato himself, for whom some notices in the Timaeus on the structure of the
                    animal body, as taught by Hippocrates and Polybus, have procured a place in the
                    history of the science.</p>

                <p>Amidst the general obscurity in which the early history of anatomy is involved,
                    only two leading facts may be admitted with certainty. The first is, that
                    previous to the time of Aristotle there was no accurate knowledge of anatomy;
                    and the second, that all that was known was derived from the dissection of the
                    lower animals only. By the appearance of Aristotle, this species of knowledge,
                    which was hitherto acquired in a desultory and irregular manner, began to be
                    cultivated systematically and with a definite object; and among the services
                    which the philosopher of Stagira rendered to mankind, one of the greatest and
                    most substantial is, that he was the founder of Comparative Anatomy, and was the
                    first to apply its facts to the elucidation of zoology. The works of this ardent
                    and original naturalist show that his zootomical knowledge was extensive, and
                    often accurate; and from several of his descriptions it is impossible to doubt
                    that they were derived from frequent personal dissection.</p>
                <p>Aristotle, who was born 384 years before the Christian era, or in the first year
                    of the 99th Olympiad, was, at the age of 39, requested by Philip to undertake
                    the education of his son Alexander. During this period, it is said, he composed
                    several works on anatomy, which however are now lost. The military expedition of
                    his royal pupil into Asia, by laying open the animal stores of that vast and
                    little known continent, furnished Aristotle with the means of extending his
                    knowledge, not only of the animal tribes, but of their structure, and of
                    communicating more accurate and distinct notions than were yet accessible to the
                    world. A sum of 800 talents, and the concurrent aid of numerous intelligent
                    assistants in Greece and Asia, were intended to facilitate his researches in
                    composing a system of zoological knowledge; but it has been observed, that the
                    number of instances in which he was thus compelled to trust to the testimony of
                    other observers, led him to commit errors in description, which personal
                    observation might have enabled him to avoid.</p>
                <p>The first three books of the <hi rend="italic">History of Animals,</hi> a
                    treatise consisting of ten books, and the four books on the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Parts of Animals,</hi> constitute the great monument of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Aristotelian Anatomy.</hi> From these we find that Aristotle was the first who
                    corrected the erroneous statements of Polybus, Syennesis, and Diogenes,
                    regarding the bloodvessels, which they made, as we have seen, to arise from the
                    head and brain. These he represents to be two in number, placed before the
                    spinal column, the larger on the right, the smaller on the left, which, he also
                    remarks, is by some calledßorta(aogr?j),the first time, we observe, which
                    thisepi-thet occurs in the history. Both he represents to arise from the heart,
                    the larger from the largest upper cavity, the smaller or aorta from the middle
                    cavity, but in a different manner, and forming a narrower canal. He also
                    distinguishes the thick, firm, and more tendinous structure of the aorta from
                    the thin and membranous structure of the vein. In describing the distribution of
                    the latter, however, he confounds the <hi rend="italic">vena cava</hi> and
                    pulmonary artery, and, as might be expected, he confounds the ramifications of
                    the former with those of the arterial tubes in general. While he represents the
                    lung to be liberally supplied with blood, he describes the brain as an organ
                    almost destitute of this fluid. His account of the distribution of the aorta is
                    wonderfully correct. Though he does not notice the coeliac, and remarks that the
                    aorta sends no direct branches to the liver and spleen, he had observed the
                    mesenteric, the renal, and the common iliac arteries. It is nevertheless
                    singular, that though he remarks particularly that the renal branches of the
                    aorta go to the substance and not the <hi rend="italic">pelvis (×οfha)</hi> of
                    the kidney, he appears to mistake the ureters for branches of the aorta.</p>
                <p>Of the nerves (vεugα) he appears to have the most confused notions. Making them
                    arise from the heart, which he says has nerves (tendons) in its largest cavity,
                    he represents the aorta to be a nervous or tendinous vein <hi rend="italic"
                    >(νευξωδης &lt;fKzZς).</hi> By afterwards saying that all the articulated bones
                    are connected by <hi rend="italic">nerves,</hi> he makes them the same as
                    ligaments; while the character of divisibility in the long direction identifies
                    them rather with tendons; and the assertion that no part destitute of them has
                    sensation, makes them approach to the nervous chords of the modern anatomistś.
                    He distinguishes suet, fat, and marrow, from each other; and though he admits
                    the spinal chord to consist of the latter substance, he differs from those
                    authors who regard the brain of the same nature, because while brain is cold,
                    marrow is hot.</p>
                <p>He distinguishes the windpipe or air-holder (agr?;g/a) from the oesophagus,
                    because it is placed before the latter, because food or drink passing into it
                    causes distressing cough and suffocation, and because there is no passage from
                    the lung to the stomach. He knew the situation and use of the epiglottis, seems
                    to have had some indistinct notions of the larynx, represents the windpipe to be
                    necessary to convey air to and from the lungs, and appears to have a tolerable
                    understanding of the structure of the lungs. He repeatedly represents the heart,
                    the shape and site of which he describes accurately, to be the origin of the
                    blood-vessels, in opposition to those who made them descend from the head; yet,
                    though he represents it as full of blood, and the source and fountain of that
                    fluid, and even speaks of the blood flowing from the heart to the veins,<note

                    opinion that the former were air-vessels.</p>
                <p>Hitherto anatomical inquiry was confined to the examination of the bodies of
                    brute animals. We have, indeed, <pb break="no"

                    of the human body being submitted to examination previous to the time of
                    Erasistratus and Hero-philus; and it is vain to look for authentic facts on this
                    point before the foundation of the Ptolemaic dynasty of sovereigns in Egypt.
                    This event, which, as is generally known, succeeded the death of Alexander, 320
                    years before the Christian era, collected into one spot the scattered embers of
                    literature and science, which were beginning to languish in Greece under a weak
                    and distracted government, and an unsettled state of society. The children of
                    her divided states, whom domestic discord and the uncertainties of war rendered
                    unhappy at home, wandered into Egypt, and found, under the fostering hand of the
                    Alexandrian monarchs, the means of cultivating the sciences, and repaying with
                    interest to the country of Thoth and Osiris, the benefits which had been
                    conferred on the infancy of Greece by Thales and Pythagoras. Alexandria became
                    in this manner the depository of all the learning and knowledge of the civilized
                    world; and while other nations were sinking under the effects of internal
                    animosities or mutual dissensions, or ravaging the earth with the evils of war,
                    the Egyptian Greeks kept alive the sacred flame of science, and preserved
                    mankind from relapsing into their original barbarism.</p>
                <p>These happy effects are to be ascribed in an eminent degree to the enlightened
                    government and liberal opinions of Ptolemy Soter, and his immediate successors
                    Philadelphus and Euergetes. The two latter princes, whose authority was equalled
                    only by the zeal with which they patronised science and their professors, were
                    the first who enabled physicians to dissect the human body, and prevented the
                    prejudices of ignorance and superstition from compromising the welfare of the
                    human race. To this happy circumstance Herophilus and Erasistratus are indebted
                    for the distinction of being known to posterity as the first anatomists who
                    dissected and described the parts of the human body. Both of these physicians
                    flourished under Ptolemy Soter, and probably Ptolemy Philadelphus, and were
                    indeed the principal supports of what has been named in medical history the
                    Alexandrian School, to which their reputation seems to have attracted numerous
                    pupils.</p>
                <p>But though the concurrent testimony of antiquity assigns to these physicians the
                    merit of dissecting the human body, time, which wages endless war with the
                    vanity and ambition of man, has dealt hardly with the monuments of their
                    labours. As the works of neither have been preserved, great uncertainty prevails
                    as to the respective merits of these ancient anatomists; and all that is now
                    known of their anatomical researches is obtained from the occasional notices of
                    Galen, Oribasius, and some other writers. From these it appears that
                    Erasistratus recognised the valves of the heart, and distinguished them by the
                    names of <hi rend="italic">tricuspid</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sigmoid;</hi>
                    that he studied particularly the shape and structure of the brain, and its
                    divisions, and cavities, and membranes, and likened the convolutions to the
                    folds of the jejunum; that he first formed a distinct idea of the nature of the
                    nerves, which he made issue from the brain; and that he discovered lymphatic
                    vessels in the mesentery, first in brute animals, and afterwards, it is said, in
                    man. It is not uninteresting to observe, that he appears to have distinguished
                    the nerves into those of sensation and those of motion.</p>
                <p>Of Herophilus it is said that he had extensive anatomical knowledge, acquired by
                    dissecting, not only brutes, but human bodies. Of these he probably dissected
                    more than any of his predecessors or contemporaries. But it is almost
                    superfluous to remind the classical reader, that the passage of Tertullian, in
                    which he is said to have dissected 600 corpses, is not to be understood
                    literally, and means only that he had dissected many; and that this language is
                    employed by an author who speaks of him in terms of execration, and who
                    evidently exaggerates in order to prejudice the reader against the anatomist.
                    Devoted to the assiduous cultivation of anatomy, he appears to have studied with
                    particular attention those parts which were least understood. He recognised the
                    nature of the pulmonary artery, which he denominates <hi rend="italic">arterwus
                    vein</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> he knew the vessels of the mesentery, and
                    showed that they did not go to the <hi rend="italic">vena portae,</hi> but to
                    certain glandular bodies; and he first applied the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >twdιx~inch</hi> or <hi rend="italic">duodenum (δωδιxaδaxnλoς)</hi> to that part
                    of the alimentary canal which is next to the stomach. Like Erasis-tratus, he
                    appears to have studied carefully the configuration of the brain; and we learn
                    from Galen that he first compared the linear furrow at the bottom of the fourth
                    ventricle to the cavity of a writing pen; and though like him he distinguishes
                    the nerves into those of sensation and those of voluntary motion, he adds to
                    them the ligaments and tendons. A tolerable description of the liver by this
                    anatomist is preserved in the writings of Galen.<note anchored="true"

                    the name of choroid or vascular membrane to that which is found in the cerebral
                    ventricles; he knew the fourth or straight sinus, which still Eears his name; he
                    described the posterior end of the vault or fornix as the principal seat of the
                    sensations; and to him the linear furrow at the bottom of the fourth ventricle

                <p>The celebrity of these two great anatomists appears to have thrown into the
                    shade, for a long period, the names of all other inquirers; for among their
                    numerous and rather celebrated successors in the Alexandrian school, it is
                    impossible to recognise a name which is entitled to distinction in the history
                    of anatomy. In a chasm so wide it is not uninteresting to find, in one who
                    combined the character of the greatest orator and philosopher of antiquity, the
                    most distinct traces of attention to anatomical knowledge. Cicero, in his
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Natura Deorum,</hi> in a
                    short sketch of physiology, such as it was taught by Aristotle and his
                    disciples, introduces various anatomical notices, from which the classical
                    reader may form some idea of the state of anatomy at that time. The Roman orator
                    appears to have formed a pretty distinct idea of the shape and connections of
                    the windpipe and lungs; and though he informs his readers that he knows the
                    alimentary canal, he omits the details through motives of delicacy. In imitation
                    of Aristotle, he talks of the blood being conveyed by the veins <hi
                    rend="italic">(vxnae),</hi> that is, blood-vessels, through the body at large;
                    and, like Praxagoras, of the air inhaled by the lungs being conveyed through the
                    arteries.</p>
                <p>Aretaeus, though chiefly known as a medical author, makes some observations on
                    the lung and the pleura, maintains the glandular structure of the kidney, and
                    describes the anastomosis or communications of the capillary extremities of the
                    <hi rend="italic">vena cava</hi> with those of the portal vein.</p>
                <p>The most valuable depository of the anatomical knowledge of these times is the
                    work of Celsus, one of the most judicious medical authors of antiquity. He left,
                    indeed, no express anatomical treatise; but from the introductions to his 4th
                    and 8th books, <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Medicina,</hi> with
                    incidental remarks in his 7th, the modern reader may <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038766?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8766-0689"/> form very just
                    ideas of the anatomical attainments of the Roman physician. From these it
                    appears that Celsus was well acquainted with the windpipe and lungs, and the
                    heart; with the difference between the windpipe and oesophagus <hi rend="italic"
                    >(stomachus),</hi> which leads to the stomach <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ventriculus)</hi>; and with the shape, situation, and relations of the
                    diaphragm. He enumerates also with accuracy the principal facts relating to the
                    situation of the liver, the spleen, and the kidneys. His description of the
                    situation and connections of the stomach is interesting. He appears, however, to
                    have, been unaware of the distinction of <hi rend="italic">duodenum</hi> or
                    twelve-inch bowel, already admitted by Herophilus, and represents the stomach as
                    directly connected by means of the <hi rend="italic">pylorus</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">jejunum</hi> or upper part of the small intestine. His account of
                    the rest of the alimentary canaI, though brief and cursory, is accurate; and his
                    subsequent descriptions of diseases seated in these parts show that he had
                    formed ideas, upon the whole very just, of the relative positions of these
                    parts.</p>
                <p>The 7th and 8th books, which are devoted to the consideration of those diseases
                    which are treated by manual operation, contain sundry anatomical notices
                    necessary to explain the nature of the diseases, or mode of treatment. Of these,
                    indeed, the merit is unequal; and it is not wonderful that the ignorance of the
                    day prevented Celsus from understanding rightly the mechanism of the pathology
                    of hernia. He appears, however, to have formed a tolerably just idea of the mode
                    of cutting into the urinary bladder; and even his obstetrical instructions show
                    that his knowledge of the uterus, vagina, and appendages was not contemptible.
                    It is in osteology, however, that the information of Celsus is chiefly
                    conspicuous. He enumerates the sutures and several of the holes of the cranium,
                    and describes at great length the superior and inferior maxillary bones and the
                    teeth. With a good deal of care he describes the vertebrae and the ribs, and
                    gives very briefly the situation and shape of the <hi rend="italic">scapula,
                    humerus, radius,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulna,</hi> and even the carpal and
                    metacarpaI bones, and then of the different bones of the pelvis and lower
                    extremities. He had formed a just idea of the articular connections, and is
                    desirous to impress the fact, that none is formed without cartilage. From his
                    mention of many minute holes <hi rend="italic">(mulla et tenuia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">foramina),</hi> in the recess of the nasal cavities, it is evident
                    that he was acquainted with the perforated plate of the ethmoid bone; and from
                    saying that the straight part of the auditory canal becomes flexuous, and
                    terminates in numerous minute cavities <hi rend="italic">(multa et
                    tenuia</hi><hi rend="italic">foramina</hi><hi rend="italic">diducitur),</hi> it
                    is inferred by Portal that he knew the semicircular canals.</p>
                <p>Though the writings of Celsus show that he cultivated anatomical knowledge, it
                    does not appear that the science was much studied by the Romans; and there is
                    reason to believe, that after the decay of the school of Alexandria it
                    languished in neglect and obscurity. It is at least certain that the appearance
                    of Marinus during the reign of Nero is mentioned by authors as an era remarkable
                    for anatomical inquiry, and that this person is distinguished by Galen as the
                    restorer of a branch of knowledge which had been before him suffered to fall
                    into undeserved neglect. From Galen also we learn that he gave an accurate
                    account of the muscles, that he studied particularly the glands, that he
                    discovered those of the mesentery, and that he improved much the anatomical
                    history of the nerves. The number of the latter he fixed at seven; he observed
                    the palatine nerves, which he rated as the fourth pair; and described as the
                    fifth the auditory and facial, which he regards as one pair; and the hypoglossal
                    as the sixth.</p>
                <p>Not long after Marinus, appeared Ruffus of Ephesus, a Greek physician, who in the
                    reign of Trajan was much attached to physiology, and as a means of cultivating
                    this science studied Comparative Anatomy, and made sundry experiments on living
                    animals. Of the anatomical writings of this author, there remains only a list or
                    catalogue of names of different regions and parts of the animal body. He
                    appears, however, to have directed the attention particularly to the tortuous
                    course of the uterine vessels, and to have recognised even at this' early period
                    the Fallopian tube. He distinguishes the nerves into those of sensation and
                    those of motion. He knew the recurrent nerve. His name is further associated
                    with the ancient experiment of compressing in the situation of the carotid
                    arteries the pneumogastric nerve, and thereby inducing insensibility and loss of
                    voice.</p>
                <p>Of all the authors of antiquity, however, none possesses so just a claim to the
                    title of anatomist as Claudius Galenus, the celebrated physician of Pergamus.
                    This person, who was born about the 131st year of the Christian era, and lived
                    under the reigns of Trajan, Antoninus, Commodus, and AElius, was trained by his
                    father Nicon, whose memory he embalms as an eminent mathematician, architect,
                    and astronomer, to all the learning of the day, and initiated particularly into
                    the mysteries of the Aristotelian philosophy. In an order somewhat whimsical he
                    afterwards studied philosophy successively in the schools of the Stoics, the
                    Academics, the Peripatetics, and the Epicureans. While at the <hi rend="italic"
                    >age</hi> of 17, his father, he informs us, was admonished by a dream to devote
                    his son to the study of medicine; but it was fully two years after, that Galen
                    entered on this pursuit, under the auspices of an instructor, whose name he has
                    thought proper to conceal. Shortly after, he betook himself to the study of
                    anatomy under Satyŕus, a pupil of Quintus, and of medicine under Stratonicus, a
                    Hippocratic physician, and AEschrion, an empiric. He had scarcely attained the
                    age of 20, when he had occasion to deplore the loss of the first and most
                    affectionate guide of his studies; and soon after he proceeded to Smyrna to
                    obtain the anatomical instructions of Pelops, who, though mystified by some of
                    the errors of Hippocrates, is commemorated by his pupil as a skilful anatomist.
                    After this he appears to have visited various cities, distinguished for
                    philosophical or medical teachers; and, finally, to have gone to Alexaridria
                    with the view of cultivating more accurately and intimately the study of anatomy
                    under Heraclianus. Here he remained till his 28tlι year, when he regarded
                    himself as possessed of all the knowledge then attainable through the medium of
                    teachers. He now returned to Pergamus, to exercise the art which he had so
                    anxiously studięd, and received, in his 29th year, an unequivocal testimony of
                    the confidence which his fellowcitizens reposed in his skill, by being intrusted
                    with the treatment of the wounded gladiators; and in this capacity he is said to
                    have treated with success several wounds which used to be fatal. A seditious
                    tumult appears to have caused him to form the resolution of quitting Pergamus
                    and proceeding to Rome, at the age of 32. Here, however, he remained only five
                    years; and returning once more to Pergamus, after travelling for some time,
                    finally settled in Rome as physician to the emperor Com-modus.</p>
                <p>The anatomical writings ascribed to Galen, which are numerous, are to be viewed
                    not merely as the result of personal research and information, but as the common
                    depository of the anatomical knowledge of the day, arid as combining all that he
                    had learnt from the several teachers under whom he successively studied, with
                    whatever personal study had enabled him to acquire. It is on this account not
                    always easy to distinguish what Galen had himself ascertained by personal
                    research, from that which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038779?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8779-0690"/> was known by other anatomists. This, however,
                    though of moment to the history of Galen as an anatomist, is of little
                    consequence to the seienee itself; and, from the anatomical remains of this
                    author, a pretty just idea may be formed, both of the progress and of the actual
                    state of the science at that time.</p>
                <p>The osteology of Galen is undoubtedly the most perfect of the departments of the
                    anatomy of the ancients. He names and distinguishes the bones and sutures of the
                    cranium nearly in the same manner as at present. Thus he notices the
                    quadrilateral shape of the parietal bones; he distinguishes the squamous, the
                    styloid, and the mastoid portions, and the lithoid or petrous portions of the
                    temporal bones; and he remarks the peculiar situation and shape of the
                    wedge-like or sphenoid bone. Of the ethmoid, which he omits at first, he
                    afterwards speaks more at large in another treatise. The malar he notices under
                    the name of zygomatic bone; and he describes at length the upper maxillary and
                    nasal bones, and the connection of the former with the sphenoid. He gives the
                    first clear account of the number and situation of the vertebrae, whieh he
                    divides into <hi rend="italic">cervical, dorsal,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >lumbar,</hi> and distinguishes from the sacrum and coccyx. Under the head <hi
                    rend="italic">Bones of the Thorax,</hi> he enumerates the sternum, the ribs (αi
                    íŵeuga/), and the dorsal vertebrae, the connection of which with the former he
                    designates as a variety of <hi rend="italic">diarthrosis.</hi> The description
                    of the bones of the extremities and their articulations concludes the
                    treatise.</p>
                <p>Though in myology Galen appears to less advantage than in osteology, he
                    nevertheless had carried this part of anatomical knowledge to greater perfection
                    than any of his predecessors. He describes a frontal muscle, the six muscles of
                    the eye, and a seventh proper to animals; a muscle to each <hi rend="italic">ala
                    nasi,</hi> four muscles of the lips, the thin cutaneous muscle of the neck,
                    which he first termed <hi rend="italic">platysma myoides,</hi> or muscular
                    expansion, two muscles of the eyelids, and four pairs of museles of the lower
                    jaw, the temporal to raise, the masseter to draw to one side, and two
                    depressors, corresponding to the digastric and internal pterygoid muscles. After
                    speaking of the muscles which move the head and the scapula, he adverts to those
                    by whieh the windpipe is opened and shut, and the intrinsic or proper museles of
                    the larynx and hyoid bone. Then follow those of the tongue, pharynx, and neck,
                    those of the upper extremities, the trunk, and the lower extremities
                    successively; and in the course of this description he swerves so little from
                    the actual facts, that most of the names by whieh he distinguishes the principal
                    museles have been retained by the best modern anatomists. It is .chiefly in the
                    minute account of these organs, and especially in reference to the minuter
                    muscles, that he appears inferior to the moderns.</p>
                <p>The angiological knowledge of Galen, though vitiated by the erroneous physiology
                    of the times, and ignorance of the separate uses of the arteries and veins,
                    exhibits, nevertheless, some accurate facts which show the diligence of the
                    author in dissection. Though, in opposition to the opinions of Praxagoras and
                    Erasistratus, he proved that the arteries in the living animal contain not air,
                    but blood, it docs not appear to have occurred to him to determine in what

                    nevertheless traces the distribution of the branches of the aorta with some
                    accuracy. The <hi rend="italic">vena azygos</hi> also, and the jugular veins,
                    have contributed to add to the confusion of his description, and to render his
                    angiology the most imperfect of his works.</p>
                <p>In neurology we find him to be the author of the dogma, that the brain is the
                    origin of the nerves of sensation, and the spinal chord of those of motion; and
                    he distinguishes the former from the latter by their greater softness or less
                    consistence. Though he admits only seven cerebral pairs, he has the merit of
                    distinguishing and tracing the distribution of the greater part of both classes
                    of nerves with great accuracy.</p>
                <p>His description of the brain, though derived from dissection of the lower
                    animals, is accurate; and his distinctions of the several parts of the organ
                    have been retained by modern anatomists. His mode of demonstrating this organ,
                    which indeed is clearly described, consists of five different steps. In the
                    first the bisecting membrane, z. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> the falx <hi

                    anterior extremity of the great fissure, separates the hemispheres gently as far
                    as the <hi rend="italic">torcular,</hi> and exposes a smooth surface <hi

                    or the middle band. In the second he exposes by successive sections the
                    ventricles, the choroid plexus, and the middle partition. The third exhibits the
                    conoid body <hi rend="italic">(ΰωμα</hi> κωιwoss) or conarium, concealed by a
                    membrane with numerous veins, meaning that part of the plexus whieh is now known

                    passage from the third to the fourth ventricle. In the fifth he gives an

                    sac with a circular basis corresponding to the base of the heart, and a conieal
                    apex; and after an account of the tunics of the arteries and veins, he speaks
                    shortly of the lung, and more at length of the heart, which, however, he takes
                    some pains to prove not to be muscular, because it is harder, its fibres are
                    differently arranged, and its action is incessant, whereas that of muscle
                    alternates with the state of rest. In the particular description of the parts of
                    the organ he ascribes to the auricles a more cuticular structure than to the
                    other parts; he gives a good account of the valves and of the vessels; and
                    notices especially the bony ring formed in the heart of the horse, elephant, and

                    urinary apparatus, is still more minute, and in general very accurate. Our
                    limits, however, do not permit us to give any abstract of them; and it is
                    sufficient in general to say, that Galen gives correct views of the structure
                    and distribution of the peritoneum and omentum, and distinguishes accurately the
                    several divisions of the alimentary canal, and the internal structure of its
                    component tissues. In the liver, which he allows to receive an envelope from the
                    peritoneum, he admits, in imitation of Erasistratus, a proper substance or <hi
                    rend="italic">parenchyma,</hi> interposed between the vessels, and capable of
                    removal by suitable dissection.</p>
                <p>His description of the organs of generation is rather brief, and is, like most of
                    his anatomical sketches, too much blended with physiological dogmas.</p>
                <p>This short sketch may communicate some idea of the condition of anatomical
                    knowledge in the days of Galen, who indeed is justly entitled to the character
                    of rectifying and digesting, if not of creating, the science of anatomy among
                    the ancients. Though evidently confined, perhaps entirely, by the circumstances
                    of the times, to the dissection of brute animals, so indefatigable and judicious
                    was he in the mode of acquiring knowledge, that many of his names and
                    distinctions are still retained with advantage in the writings of the modems.
                    Galen was a practical anatomist, and not only describes the organs of the animal
                    body from actual dissection, but gives ample instructions for the proper mode of
                    exposition. His language is in general clear, his style as correct as in most of
                    the authors of the same period, and his manner is animated. It is indeed
                    impossible to imagine any thing so interesting as the description of the process
                    for demonstrating the brain and other internal organs, which is given by this
                    patient and enthusiastic observer of nature. To some it may appear absurd to
                    speak of any thing like good anatomical description in an author who writes in
                    the Greek language, or any thing like an interesting and correct manner in a
                    writer who flourished at a period when taste was depraved or extinct, and
                    literature corrupted,—when the philosophy of Antoninus, and the mild virtues of
                    Aurelius, could do little to soften the iron sway of Lucius Verus and Commodus;
                    but the habit of faithful observation in Galen seems to have been so powerful,
                    that, in the description of material objects, his genius invariably rises above
                    the circumstances of his age. Though not so directly connected with this
                    subject, it is nevertheless proper to mention, that he appears to have been the
                    first anatomist who can be said, on authentic grounds, to have attempted to
                    discover the uses of organs by vivisection and experiments on living animals. In
                    this manner he ascertained the position and demonstrated the action of the
                    heart; and he mentions two instances in which, in ąonsequence of disease or
                    injury, he had an opportunity of observing the motions of this organ in the
                    human body.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>∏ioι
                    Avατβ∕i∕κω&gt; lib. VII.</p></note> In short, without eulogizing an ancient
                    author at the expense of critical justice, or commending his anatomical
                    descriptions as superior to those of the moderns, it must be admitted that the
                    anatomical writings of the physician of Pergamus form a remarkable era in the
                    history of the science; and that by diligence in dissection, and accuracy in
                    description, he gave tlιe science a degree of importance and stability which it
                    has retained through the lapse of many centuries.</p>
                <p>The death of Galen, which took place at Pergamus in the 90th year of his age, and
                    the 193d of the Christian era, may be regarded as the downfall of anatomy in
                    ancient times. After this period we recognise only two names of any celebrity in
                    the history of the science,— those of Soranus and Oribasius, with the more
                    obscure ones of Meletius and Theophilus, the latter the chief of the imperial
                    guard of Heraclius.</p>
                <p>Soranus, who was an Ephesian, and flourished under the emperors Trajan and
                    Hadrian, distinguished himself by his researches on the female organs of
                    generation. He appears to have dissected the human subject; and this perhaps is
                    one reason why his descriptions of these parts are more copious and more
                    accurate than those of Galen, who derived his knowledge from the bodies of the
                    lower animals. He denies the existence of the hymen, but describes accurately
                    the clitoris. Soranus the anatomist must be distinguished from the physician of
                    that name, who was also a native of Ephesus.</p>
                <p>Oribasius, who was born at Pergamus, is said to have been at once the friend and
                    physician of the emperor Julian, and to have contributed to the elevation of
                    that apostate to the imperial throne. For this he appears to have suffered the
                    punishment of a temporary exile under Valens and Valentinian; but was soon
                    recalled, and lived in great honour till the period of his death. By Le Clerc,
                    Oribasius is regarded as a compiler; and indeed his anatomical writings bear so
                    close a correspondence with those of Galen, that the character is not altogether
                    groundless. In various points, nevertheless, he has rendered the Ga-lenian
                    anatomy more accurate; and he has distinguished himself by a good account of the
                    salivary glands, which were overlooked by Galen.</p>
                <p>To the same period generally is referred the anatomical introduction of an
                    anonymous author, first published in 1618 by Lauremberg, and more recently by
                    Bernard. It is to be regarded as a compilation formed on the model of Galen and
                    Oribasius. The same character is applicable to the treatises of Meletius and
                    Theophilus.</p>
                <p>The decline indicated by these languid efforts soon sunk into a state of total
                    inactivity; and the unsettled state of society during the latter ages of the
                    Roman empire became extremely unfavourable to the successful cultivation of
                    science. The sanguinary conflicts in which the southern countries of Europe were
                    repeatedly engaged with their northern neighbours, between the second and eighth
                    centuries, tended gradually to estrange their minds from scientific pursuits;
                    and the hordes of barbarians by which the Roman empire was latterly overrun,
                    while they urged them to the necessity of making hostile resistance, and
                    adopting means of self-defence, introduced such habits of ignorance and
                    barbarism, that science was almost universally forgotten; and the art most
                    essential to the success of military operations was either neglected or debased
                    by the grossest ignorance. While the art of healing was professed only by some
                    few ecclesiastics, or by itinerant practitioners, anatomy was utterly neglected;
                    and no name of anatomical celebrity occurs to diversify the long and
                    uninteresting period commonly distinguished as the middle ages.</p>
                <p>Anatomical learning, thus neglected by European nations, is believed to have
                    received a temporary cultivation from the Asiatics. Of these, several nomadic
                    tribes, known to Europeans under the general denomination of Arabs and Saracens,
                    had gradually coalesced under various leaders; and by their habits of endurance,
                    as well as of enthusiastic valour, in successive expeditions against the eastern
                    division of the Roman empire, had acquired such military reputation, as to
                    render them formidable where-ever<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038805?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8805-0692"/> they appeared.
                    After a century and a half of fo- ' reign warfare or internal animosity, under
                    the successive dynasties of the Ommiades and Abassides, in which the propagation
                    of Islamism was the pretext for the extinction of learning and civilisation, and
                    the most remorseless system of rapine and destruction, the Saracens began, under
                    the latter dynasty of princes, to recognise the value of science, and especially
                    of that which prolongs life, heals disease, and alleviates the pain of wounds
                    and injuries. The caliph Almansor combined with his official knowledge of Moslem
                    law, the successful cultivation of astronomy; but to his grandson Almamon, the
                    seventh prince of the line of the Abassides, belongs the merit of undertaking to
                    render his subjects philosophers and physicians. By the directions of this
                    prince, the works of the Greek and Roman authors were translated into Arabic;
                    and the favour and munificence with which literature and its professors were
                    patronised, speedily raised a succession of learned Arabians. The residue of the
                    rival family of the Ommiades, already settled in Spain, was prompted by motives
                    of rivalry or honourable ambition to adopt the same course; and while the
                    academy, hospitals, and library of Bagdad bore testimony to the zeal and
                    liberality of the Abassidcs, the munificence of the Ommiades was not less
                    conspicuous in the literary institutions of Cordova, Seville, and Toledo.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the efforts of the Arabian princes, however, and the diligence of
                    the Arabian physicians, little was done for anatomy, and the science made no
                    substantial acquisition. The Koran denounces as unclean the person who touches a
                    corpse; the rules of Islamism forbid dissection; and whatever their instructors
                    taught was borrowed from the Greeks. Abu Bekr A1- Rasi, Abu-Ali Ibn-Sina,
                    Abul-Casem, and Abu-Walid Ibn-Roschd, the Razes, Avicenna, Albucasis, and
                    Aver-hoes of European authors, are their most celebrated names in medicine; yet
                    to none of these can the historian with justice ascribe any anatomical merit.
                    Al-Rasi has indeed left descriptions of the eye, of the ear and its <hi
                    rend="italic">meatus,</hi> and of the heart; and Ibn-Sina, Abul-Casem, and
                    Ebn-Roschd, give anatomieal descriptions of the parts of the human body. But of
                    these the general character is, that they are copies from Galen, sometimes not
                    very just, and in all instances mystified with a large proportion of the
                    fanciful and absurd imagery and inflated style of the Arabian writers. The chief
                    reason of their obtaining a place in anatomical history is, that, by the
                    influence which their medical authority enabled them to exercise in the European
                    schools, the nomenclature which they employed was adopted by European
                    anatomists, and continued till the revival of ancient learning restored the
                    original nomenclature of the Greek physicians. Thus, the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>From the general character now given, justice requires that we except
                    Abdollatiph, the annalist of Egyptian affairs. This author, who maintains that
                    it is impossible to learn anatomy from books, and that the authority of Galen
                    must yield to personal inspection, informs us, that the Moslem doctors did not
                    neglect opportunities of studying the bones of the human body in cemeteries; and
                    that he himself, by once examining a collection of bones in this manner,
                    ascertained that the lower jaw is formed of one piece; that the sacrum, though
                    sometimes composed of several, is most generally of one; and that Galen is
                    mistaken when he asserts that these bones are not single.</p>
                <p>The era of Saracen learning extends to the 13th century; and after this we begin
                    to approach happier times. The university of Bologna, which, as a school of
                    literature and law, was already celebrated in the twelfth century, became, in
                    the course of the following one, not less distinguished for its medical
                    teachers. Though the misgovernment of the municipal rulers of Bologna had
                    disgusted both teachers and students, and given rise to the foundation of
                    similar institutions in Padua and Naples, —and though the school of Salerno, in
                    the territory of the latter, was still in high repute,— it appears, from the
                    testimony of Sarti, that medicine was in the highest esteem in Bologna, and that
                    it was in such perfection as to require a division of its professors into
                    physicians, surgeons, physicians for wounds, barber-surgeons, oculists, and even
                    some others. Notwithstanding these indications of refinement, however, anatomy
                    was manifestly cultivated rather as an appendage of surgery than a branch of
                    medical science; and, according to the testimony of Guy de Chauliac, the
                    cultivation of anatomical knowledge was confined to Roger, Roland, Jamerio,
                    Bruno, and Lan-franc; and this they borrowed chiefly from Galen. For this and
                    similar reasons, physicians were not in all instances respected by the best
                    informed men of the age; and they fell, perhaps not altogether undeservedly,
                    under the bitter lash of the satirical Petrarch.</p>
                <p>In this state matters appear to have proceeded with the medical school of Bologna
                    till the commencement of the fourteenth century, when the circumstance of
                    possessing a teaeher of originality enabled this university to be the agent of
                    as great an improvement in medical science as she had already effected in
                    jurisprudence. This era, indeed, is distinguished for the appearance of Mondino,
                    under whose zealous cultivation the science first began to rise from the ashes
                    in which it had been buried. This father of modern anatomy, who taught in
                    Bologna about the year 131ő, quickly drew the curiosity of the medical
                    profession, by well-ordered demonstrations of the different parts of the human
                    body. In 1315 he dissected and demonstrated the parts of the human body in two
                    female subjects; and in the course of the following year he accomplished the
                    same task on the person of a single female. But while he seems to have had
                    sufficient original force of intellect to direct his own route, Riolan accuses
                    him of copying Galen; and it is certain that his descriptions are corrupted by
                    the barbarous leaven of the Arabian schools, and his Latin defaced by the exotic
                    nomenclature of Ebn-Sina, and Abu-Bekr Al-Rasi. He died, according to
                    Tiraboschi, in 1325.</p>
                <p>Mondino divides the body into three cavities <hi rend="italic">(ventres),</hi>
                    the upper containing the animal members, as the head, the lower containing the
                    natural members, and the middle containing the spiritual· members. He first
                    delivers the anatomy of the lower cavity or the abdomen, then proceeds to the
                    middle or thoracic organs, and concludes with the upper, comprising the head,
                    and its contents and appendages. His general manner is to notice shortly the
                    situation and shape or distribution of textures or membranes, and then to
                    mention the disorders to which they are subject. The peritoneum he describes
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">siphac,</hi> in imitation of the Arabians,
                    the omentum under that of <hi rend="italic">zirbus,</hi> and the mesentery or
                    <hi rend="italic">eucharus</hi> as distinct from both. In speaking of the
                    intestines, he treats first of the rectum, then the colon, the left or sigmoid
                    flexure of which, as well as the transverse arch and its connection with the
                    stomach, he particularly remarks; then the caecum or <hi rend="italic"
                    >monoculus,</hi> after this the small intestines in general under the heads of
                    ileum and jejunum, and latterly the duodenum, making in all six bowels. The
                    liver and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038818?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8818-0693"/> its vessels are minutely, if not accurately
                    examined; and the <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi> under the name <hi rend="italic"
                    >chilis,</hi> a corruption from the Greek <hi rend="italic">xοιkη,</hi> is
                    treated at length, with the emulgents and kidneys. His anatomy of the heart is
                    wonderfully accurate; and it is a remarkable fact, which seems to be omitted by
                    all subsequent authors, that his description contains the rudiments of the
                    circulation of the blood. “Postea vero versus pulmonem est aliud orificium venae
                    arterialis, quae <hi rend="italic">portat</hi> sanguinem ad pulmonem a corde;
                    quia cum pulmo deserviat cordi secundum modum dictum ut ei recompenset, cor ei
                    <hi rend="italic">transmittit</hi> sanguinem per hanc venam, quae vocatur vena
                    arterialis, et vena quae portat sanguinem, et arterialis, quia habet duas
                    tunicas; et habet duas tunicas, primo quia vadit ad membrum quod existit in
                    continuo motu, et secundo quia portat sanguinem valde subtilem et cholericum.”
                    The merit of these distinctions, however, he afterwards destroys, by repeating
                    the old assertion, that the left ventriele ought to contain spirit or air, which
                    it generates from the blood.</p>
                <p>His osteology of the scull is erroneous. In his account of the cerebral
                    membranes, though short, he notices the principal characters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">dura mater.</hi> He describes shortly the lateral ventricles, with
                    their anterior and posterior <hi rend="italic">cornua,</hi> and the choroid
                    plexus as a blood-red substance, like a long worm. He then speaks of the third
                    or middle ventricle, and one posterior, which seems to correspond with the
                    fourth; and describes the infundibulum under the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacuna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">emboton.</hi> The inferior recesses he
                    appears to have omitted. In the base of the organ he remarks, first, two
                    mammillary caruncles, the origins of the olfactory nerves, which, however, he
                    overlooks; the optic nerves, which he reckons the first pair; the
                    oculo-muscular, which he accounts the second; the third, which appears to be the
                    sixth of the moderns; the fourth; the fifth, evidently the seventh; a sixth, the
                    <hi rend="italic">nervus</hi><hi rend="italic">vagus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and a seventh, which is the ninth of the moderns.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the misrepresentations into which this early anatomist was
                    betrayed, his book is valuable, and has been illustrated by the successive
                    commentaries of Achillini, Berenger,' and Dryander.</p>
                <p>Matthew de Gradibus, a native of Gradi, a town in Friuli, near Milan,
                    distinguished himself by composing a series of treatises on the anatomy of
                    various parts of the human body. He is the first who represents the ovaries of
                    the female in the correct light in which they were subsequently regarded by
                    Steno.</p>
                <p>Similar objections to those already urged in speaking of Mondino apply to another
                    eminent anatomist of those times. Gabriel de Zerbis, who flourished at Verona
                    towards the conclusion of the 15th century, is celebrated as the author of a
                    system, in which he is obviously more anxious to astonish his readers by the
                    wonders of a verbose and complicated style, than to instruct by precise and
                    faithful description. In the vanity of his heart he assumed the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Medicus</hi><hi rend="italic">Theoricus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but though like Mondino he derived his information from the dissection
                    of the human subject, he is not entitled to the merit either of describing truly
                    or of adding to the knowledge previously acquired. He is superior to Mondino,
                    however, in knowing the olfacient nerves.</p>
                <p>Eminent in the history of the science, but more distinguished than any of this
                    age in the history of cerebral anatomy, Alexander Achillini of Bologna, the
                    pupil and commentator of Mondino, appeared at the close of the !5th century.
                    Though a follower of the Arabian school, the assiduity with which he cultivated
                    anatomy has rescued his name from the inglorious obscurity in which the
                    Arabesque doctors have in general slumbered. He is known in the history of
                    anatomical discovery as the first who described the two tympanal bones, termed
                    <hi rend="italic">malleus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">incus.</hi> In 1503 he
                    showed that the tarsus consists of seven bones; he re-discovered the fornix and
                    the infundibulum; and he was fortunate enough to observe, the course of the
                    cerebral cavities into the inferior <hi rend="italic">cornua,</hi> and to remark
                    peculiarities to which the anatomists of a future age did not advert. He
                    mentions the orifices of the ducts afterwards described by Wharton. He knew the
                    ileo-caecal valve; and his description of the duodenum, ileum, and colon, shows
                    that he was better acquainted with the site and disposition of these bowels than
                    any of his predecessors or contemporaries.</p>
                <p>Not long after, the science boasts of one of its most distinguished founders.
                    James Berenger of Carpi, in the Modenese territory, flourished at Bologna at the
                    beginning of the 16th century. In the annals of medicine his name will be
                    remembered not only as the most zealous and eminent in cultivating the anatomy
                    of the human body, but as the first physician who was fortunate enough to calm
                    the alarms of Europe, suffering under the ravages of syphilis, then raging with
                    uncontrollable virulence. In the former character he surpassed both predecessors
                    and contemporaries; and it was long before the anatomists of the following age
                    could boast of equalling him. His assiduity was indefatigable; and he declares
                    that he dissected above 100 human bodies. He is the author of a compendium, of
                    several treatises which he names introductions <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Isagogce),</hi> and of commentaries on the treatise of Mondino. Like him, he
                    is tinged with the mysticism of the Arabian doctrines; and though he employs the
                    Grecian nomenclature in general, he never forgets to give the Arabian terms, and
                    often uses them exclusively. In his commentaries on Mondino, which constitute
                    the most perspicuous and complete of his works, he not only rectifies the
                    mistakes of that anatomist, but delivers minute and in general accurate
                    anatomical descriptions.</p>
                <p>He is the first who undertakes a systematic view of the several textures of which
                    the human body is composed; and in a preliminary commentary he treats
                    successively of the anatomical characters and properties of fat, of membrane in
                    general <hi rend="italic">(panniculus),</hi> of flesh, of nerve, of <hi
                    rend="italic">villus</hi> or fibre <hi rend="italic">(filum),</hi> of ligament,
                    of sinew or tendon, and of muscle in general. He then proceeds to describe with
                    considerable precision the muscles of the abdomen, and illustrates their site
                    and connections by wooden cuts, which, though rude, are spirited, and show that
                    anatomical drawing was in that early age beginning to be understood. In his
                    account of the peritoneum, he admits only the intestinal division of that
                    membrane, and is at some pains to prove the error of Gentilis, who justly admits
                    the muscular division also. In his account of the intestines, he is the first
                    who mentions the vermiform process of the caecum; he remarks the yellow tint
                    communicated to the jejunum by the gall-bladder; and he recognises the opening
                    of the common biliary duct into the duodenum <hi rend="italic">(quidam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">porus</hi><hi rend="italic">portans choleram).</hi> In the account
                    of the stomach he describes the several tissues of which that organ is composed,
                    and which, after Almansor, he represents to be three, and a fourth from the
                    peritoneum; and afterwards notices the <hi rend="italic">rugae</hi> of its
                    villous surface. He is at considerable pains to explain the organs of generation
                    in both sexes, and gives a long account of the anatomy of the foetus. He was the
                    first who recognised the larger proportional size of the chest in the male than
                    in the female, and conversely the greater capacity of the female than of the
                    male pelvis. In the larynx he discovered the two arytenoid cartilages. He gives
                    the first good description of the thymus; distinguishes the oblique
                    situa-tioíi<pb break="no" facs="nls:193038831?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8831-0694"/> of the heart; describes the pericardium, and
                    maintains the uniform presence of pericardial liquor. He then describes the
                    cavities of the heart; but perplexes himself, as all the anatomists of that age,
                    about the spirit supposed to be contained. The aorta he properly makes to arise
                    from the left ventricle; but confuses himself with the <hi rend="italic">arteria
                    venalis</hi> (pulmonary vein), and the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">arterialis,</hi> the pulmonary artery. His account of the brain is
                    better. He gives a minute and clear account of the ventricles, remarks the <hi
                    rend="italic">corpus striatum,</hi> and has the sagacity to perceive that the
                    choroid plexus consists of veins and arteries; he then describes the middle or
                    third ventricle, the infundibulum or <hi rend="italic">lacuna</hi> of Mondino,
                    and the pituitary gland; and, lastly, the passage to the fourth ventricle, the
                    <hi rend="italic">conarium</hi> or pineal gland, and the fourth or posterior
                    ventricle itself, the relations of which he had studied accurately. He rectifies
                    the mistake of Mon-dino as to the olfactory or first pair of nerves, gives a
                    good account of the optic and others, and is entitled to the praise of
                    originality in being the first observer who contradicts the fiction of the
                    wonderful net, and indicates the principal divisions of the carotid arteries. He
                    enumerates the tunics and humours of the eye, and gives an account of the
                    internal ear, in which he notices the <hi rend="italic">malleus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">incus.</hi></p>
                <p>It hgd been written in the book of the destinies, that the science of anatomy was
                    to be cultivated first in Italy; and that the country, already so illustrious in
                    literature, should be honoured in giving birth to the first eminent anatomists
                    in Europe. This distinction she long retained; and the glory she acquired in the
                    names of Mondino, Achi∏ini, Carpi, and Massa, was destined to become more
                    conspicuous in the labours of Columbus, Fallopius, and Eustachius. While Italy,
                    however, was thus advancing the progress of science, the other nations of Europe
                    were either in profound ignorance or in the most supine indifference to the
                    brilliant career of their zealous neighbours. The sixteenth century had
                    commenced before France began to acquire any anatomical distinction in the names
                    of Dubois, Fernel, and Etienne; and even these celebrated teachers were less
                    solicitous in the personal study of the animal body, than in the faithful
                    explanation of the anatomical writings of Galen. The infancy of the French
                    school had to contend with other difficulties. The small portion of knowledge
                    which had been hitherto diffused in the country was so inadequate to eradicate
                    the prejudices of ignorance, that it was either difficult or absolutely
                    impossible to procure human bodies for the purposes of science; and we are
                    assured, on the testimony of Vesalius and other competent authorities, that the
                    practical part of anatomical instruction was obtained entirely from the bodies
                    of the lower animals. The works of the Italian anatomists were unknown; and it
                    is a proof of the tardy communication of knowledge, that while the structure of
                    the human body had been taught in Italy for more than a century by Mondino and
                    his followers, they are never mentioned by Etienne, who flourished long
                    after.</p>
                <p>Such was the aspect of the times at the appearance of Jacques Dubois, who, under
                    the Romanized name of Jacobus Sylvius, according to the fashion of the day, has
                    been fortunate in acquiring a reputation to which his researches do not entitle
                    him. For the name of James Dubois, the history of anatomy, it is said, is
                    indebted to his inordinate love of money. At the instance of his brother
                    Francis, who was professor of eloquence in the College of Tournay at Paris, he
                    repaired to this university, and devoted himself to the study of the learned
                    languages and mathematics; but discovering that these elegant accomplishments do
                    not invariably reward their cultivators with the goods of fortune, Dubois betook
                    himself to medicine. After the acquisition of a medical degree in the university
                    of Montpellier, at the ripe age of fifty-one Dubois returned to Paris to resume
                    a course of anatomical instructions which had been interrupted by the canonical
                    interference of the medical faculty. Here he taught anatomy to a numerous
                    audience in the college of Trinquet; and, on the departure of Vidus Vidius for
                    Italy, was appointed to succeed that physician as professor of surgery to the
                    Royal College. His character is easily estimated. With a greater portion of
                    coarseness in his manners and Ianguage than even the rude state of society can
                    palliate, with much varied learning and considerable eloquence, he was a blind,
                    indiscriminate, and irrational admirer of Galen, and interpreted the anatomical
                    and physiological writings of that author, in preference to giving
                    demonstrations from the subject. Without talent for original research or
                    discovery himself, his envy and jealousy made him detest every one who gave
                    proofs of either. We are assured by Vesalius, who was some time his pupil, that
                    his manner of teaching was calculated neither to advance the science nor to
                    rectify the mistakes of his predecessors. A human body was never seen in the
                    theatre of Dubois; the carcasses of dogs and other animals were the materials
                    from which he taught; and so difficult even was it to obtain human bones, that
                    unless Vesalius and his fellow-students had collected assiduously from the
                    Innocents and other cemeteries, they must have committed numerous errors in
                    acquiring the first principles. This assertion, however, is contradicted by
                    Riolan, and more recently by Sprengel and Lauth, the last of whom decidedly
                    censures Vesalius for this ungrateful treatment of his instructor. It is certain
                    that opportunities of inspecting the human body were by no means so frequent as
                    to facilitate the study of the science. Though his mention of injections has
                    made him be thought the discoverer of that art, he appears to have made no
                    substantial addition to the information already acquired; and the first
                    acknowledged professor of anatomy to the university of Paris appears in history
                    as one who lived without true honour, and died without just celebrity. He must
                    not be confounded with Franciscus Sylvius (De le Boe), who is mentioned by
                    Ruysch and Malacame as the author of a particular method of demonstrating the
                    brain.</p>
                <p>Almost coeval maybe placed Charles Etienne, a younger brother of the celebrated
                    printers, and son to Henry, who Hellenized the family name by the classical
                    appellation of Stephen (Σηρανο;). It is uncertain whether he taught publicly.
                    But his tranquillity was disturbed, and his pursuits interrupted, by the
                    oppressive persecutions in which their religious opinions involved the family;
                    and Charles Etienne drew the last breath of a miserable life in a dungeon in
                    1564. Etienne, though sprung of a family whose classical taste has been their
                    principal glory, betrays not the same servile imitation of the Galenian anatomy
                    with which Dubois is charged, and is the first anatomical author who deviates
                    from the beaten path. He appears to have been the first to detect valves in the
                    orifice of the hepatic veins. He was ignorant, however, of the researches of the
                    Italian anatomists; and his description of the brain is inferior to that given
                    60 years before by Achil-lini. His comparison of the cerebral cavities to the
                    human ear has persuaded Portal that he knew the inferior <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornua,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hippocampus,</hi> and its prolongations; but
                    this is no reason for giving him that honour, to the detriment of the reputation
                    of Achillini, to whom, so far as historical testimony goes, the first knowledge
                    of this fact is due. The researches of Etienne into the structure of the
                    nervous<pb break="no" facs="nls:193038844?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8844-0695"/> system are, howéver, neither useless nor
                    inglorious; and the circumstance of demonstrating a canal through the entire
                    length of the spinal chord, which had neither been suspected by contemporaries
                    nor noticed by successors, till Μ. Senac made it known, is sufficient to place
                    him high among the class of anatomical discoverers.</p>
                <p>The French anatomy of the sixteenth century was distinguished by two
                    circumstances unfavourable to the advancement of the science,—extravagant
                    admiration of antiquity, with excessive confidence in the writings of Galen, and
                    the general practice of dissecting principally the bodies of the lower animals.
                    Both of these errors were much amended, if not entirely removed, by the
                    exertions of a young Fleming, whose appearance forms a conspicuous era in the
                    history of cerebral anatomy. Andrew Vesalius, a native of Brussels, after
                    acquiring at Louvain the ordinary classical attainments of the day, began, at
                    the age of 14, to study anatomy under the auspices of Dubois. Though the
                    originality of his mind soon led him to abandon the prejudices by which he was
                    environed, and take the most direct course for attaining a knowledge of the
                    structure of the human frame; yet he neither underrated the Galenian anatomy,
                    nor was he indolent in the dissection of brute animals. The difficulties,
                    however, with which the practical pursuit of human anatomy was beset in France,
                    and the dangers with which he had to contend, made him look to Italy as a
                    suitable field for the cultivation of the science; and in 1536 we find him at
                    Venice, at once pursuing the study of human anatomy with the utmost zeal, and
                    requested, ere he had attained his 22d year, to demonstrate publicly in the
                    university of Padua. After remaining here about seven years, he went by express
                    invitation to Bologna, and shortly afterwards to Pisa; and Vesalius, thus
                    professor in three universities, appears to have carried on his anatomical
                    investigations and instructions alternately at Padua, Bologna, and Pisa, in the
                    course of the same winter. It is on this account that Vesalius, though a Fleming
                    by birth, and trained originally in the French school, belongs, as an anatomist,
                    to the Italian, and may be viewed as the first of an illustrious line of
                    teachers by whom the anatomical reputation of that country was in the course of
                    the sixteenth century raised to the greatest eminence.</p>
                <p>Vesalius is known as the first author of a comprehensive and systematic view of
                    human anatomy. The knowledge with which his dissections had furnished him,
                    proved how many errors were daily taught and learned under the broad mantle of
                    Galenian authority; and he perceived the necessity of a new system of anatomical
                    instruction, divested of the omissions of ignorance and the misrepresentations
                    of prejudice and fancy. The early age at which he effected this object has been
                    to his biographers the theme of boundless commendations; and we are told that he
                    began at the age of 25 to arrange the materials he had collected, and
                    accomplished his task ere he had completed his 28th year.</p>
                <p>Soon after this period wc find him invited as imperial physician to the court of
                    Charles V., where he was occupied in the duties of practice, and answering the
                    various charges which were unceasingly brought against him by the Galenian
                    disciples. After the abdication of Charles, he continued at court in great
                    favour with his son Philip II. To this he seems to have been led principally by
                    the troublesome controversies in which his anatomical writings had involved him.
                    It is painful to think, however, that even imperial patronage bestowed on
                    eminent talents does not insure immunity from popular prejudice; and the fate of
                    Vesalius will be a lasting example of the barbarism of the times, and of the
                    precarious tenure of the safety even of a great physician. On the preliminary'·
                    circumstances authors are not agreed; but the most general account states, that
                    when Vesalius was inspecting, with the consent of his kinsmen, the body of a
                    Spanish grandee, it was observed that the heart still gave some feeble
                    palpitations when divided by the knife. The immediate effects of this outrage to
                    human feeling were to denounce the anatomist to the inquisition; and Vesalius
                    escaped the merciful dispensations of this tribunal only by the influence of the
                    king, and by promising to perform a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. He forthwith
                    proceeded to Venice, from which he sailed with the Venetian fleet, under James
                    Malatesta, for Cyprus. When he reached Jerusalem, he received from the Venetian
                    senate a message requesting him again to accept the Paduan professorship, which
                    had become vacant by the death of his friend and pupil Fallopius. His destiny,
                    however, which pursued him fast, suffered him not again to breathe the Italian
                    air. After struggling for many days with adverse winds in the Ionian Sea, he was
                    wrecked on the island of Zante, where he quickly breathed his last in such
                    penury, that unless a liberal goldsmith had defrayed the funeral charges, his
                    carcass must have been devoured by beasts of prey. At the time of his death he
                    was scarcely 50 years of age.</p>
                <p>To form a correct estimate of the character and merits of Vesalius, we must not
                    compare him, in the spirit of modern perfection, with the anatomical authors
                    either of later times or of the present day. Whoever would frame a just idea of
                    this anatomist, must imagine himself living in the days of Charles V., when
                    learning did not uniformly liberalize,—when the rekindling light of ancient
                    times shone on nothing but its own glories,—when education consisted in the
                    knowledge of ancient opinions, and the authority of Grecian and Roman names
                    usurped in the temple of science the legitimate worship of nature. He must
                    imagine, not a bold innovator without academical learning,—not a genius coming
                    from a foreign country, unused to the forms and habits of Catholic Europe,—nor a
                    wild reformer, blaming indiscriminately every thing which accorded not with his
                    opinions ;—but a young student scarcely emancipated from the authority of
                    instructors,andwhose intellect was still influenced by the doctrines with which
                    it had been originally imbued,—an individual strictly trained in the opinions of
                    the time, living amidst men who venerated Galen as the oracle of anatomy and the
                    divinity of medieinc,—exercising his reason to estimate the soundness of the
                    instructions then in use, and proceeding, in the way least likely to offend
                    authority and wound prejudice, to rectify errors, and to establish on the solid
                    basis of observation the true elements of anatomical science. Vesalius has been
                    denominated the founder of human anatomy; and though we have seen that in this
                    career he was preceded with honour by Mondino and Be-renger, still the small
                    proportion of correct observation which their reverence for Galen and Arabesque
                    doctrines allowed them to communicate, will not in a material degree impair the
                    original merits of Vesalius. The errors which he rectified, and the additions
                    which he made, are .so numerous, that it is impossible, in such a sketch as the
                    present, to communicate a just idea of them.</p>
                <p>Besides the first good description of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the
                    sternum consists of three portions, and the sacrum of five or six; and described
                    accurately the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone. He not only
                    verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, but he
                    described well the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos,</hi> and discovered the canal
                    which passes in the foetus between the umbilical vein and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vena cava,</hi> since nam,- <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038857?mode=fullsize"

                    >venosus.</hi> He described the omentum, and its connections with the stomach,
                    the spleen, and the colon; gave the first correct views of the structure of the
                    pylorus; remarked the small size of the caecal appendix in man; gave the first
                    good account of the mediastinum and pleura, and the fullest description of the
                    anatomy of the brain yet advanced. He appears, however, not to have understood
                    well the inferior recesses; and his account of the nerves is confused by
                    regarding the optic as the first pair, the third as the fifth, and the fifth as
                    the seventh.</p>
                <p>The labours of Vesalius were not limited to the immediate effect produced by his
                    own writings. His instructions and example produced a multitude of anatomical
                    inquirers of different characters and varied celebrity, but by whom the science
                    was extended and rectified. Of these it belongs not to this place to speak in
                    detail; but historical justice requires us to notice shortly those towhose
                    exertions the science of anatomy has been most indebted.</p>
                <p>The first that claims attention on this account is Bar-tholomco Eustachi of San
                    Severino, near Salerno, who though greatly less fortunate in reputation than
                    Vesalius, divides with him the merit of creating the science of human anatomy.
                    He extended the knowledge of the internal ear, by re-discovering and describing
                    correctly the tube which bears his name; and if we admit that Ingras-sias
                    anticipated him in the knowledge of the third bone of the tympanal cavity, the
                    <hi rend="italic">stapes,</hi> he is still the first who described the internal
                    and anterior muscles of the <hi rend="italic">malleus,</hi> as also the <hi
                    rend="italic">stapedius,</hi> and the complicated figure of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cochlea.</hi> He is the first who studied accurately the anatomy
                    of the teeth, and the phenomena of the first and second dentition. The work,
                    however, which demonstrates at once the great merit and the unhappy fate of
                    Eustachius, is his <hi rend="italic">Anatomical Engravings,</hi> which, though
                    completed in 1552, nine years after the impression of the work of Vesalius, the
                    author was unable to publish. First communicated to the world in 1714 by
                    Lancisi, afterwards in 1740 by Cajetan Petrioli, again in 1744 by Albinus, and
                    more recently at Bonn, in 1790, they show that Eustachius had dissected with the
                    greatest care and diligence, and taken the utmost pains to give just views of
                    the shape, size, and relative position of the organs of the human body.</p>
                <p>The first seven plates illustrate the history of the kidneys, and some of the
                    facts relating to the structure of the ear. The eighth represents the heart, the
                    ramifications of the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos,</hi> and the valve of the
                    <hi rend="italic">vena cava,</hi> named from the author. In the seven subsequent
                    plates îs given a succession of different views of the viscera of the chest and
                    abdomen. The seventeenth contains the brain and spinal chord; and the eighteenth
                    more accurate views of the origin, course, and distribution of the nerves than
                    were then given. Fourteen plates arc devoted to the muscles.</p>
                <p>Eustachius did not confine his researches to the study of relative anatomy. He
                    investigated the intimate structure of organs with assiduity and success. What
                    was too minute for unassisted vision he inspected by means of glasses.
                    Structure, which could not be understood in the recent state, he unfolded by
                    maceration in different fluids, or rendered more distinct by injection and
                    exsiccation. The facts unfolded in these figures are so important, that it is
                    justly remarked by Lauth, that if the author himself had been fortunate enough
                    to publish them, anatomy would have attained the perfection of the 18th century
                    two centuries earlier at least. Their seclusion for that period in the papal
                    library has given celebrity to many names, which would have been known only in
                    the verification of the discoveries of Eustachius.</p>
                <p>Eustachius was the contemporary of Vesalius. Columbus and Fallopius were his
                    pupils. The former, as his immediate successor in Padua, and afterwards as
                    professor at Rome, distinguished himself by rectifying and improving the anatomy
                    of the bones; by giving correct accounts of the shape and cavities of the heart,
                    of the pulmonary artery and aorta, and their valves, and tracing the course of
                    the blood from the right to the left side of the heart; by a good description of
                    the brain and its vessels, and by correct understanding of the internal ear, and
                    the first good account of the ventricles of the larynx. The latter, who after
                    being professor at Pisa in 1548, and at Padua in 1551, died at the age of 40,
                    studied the general anatomy of the bones; described better than heretofore the
                    internal ear, especially the tympanum and its osseous ring, the two <hi
                    rend="italic">fenestrae,</hi> and their communication with the vestibule and
                    cochlea; and gave the first good account of the stylo-mastoid hole and canal, of
                    the ethmoid bone and cells, and of the lacrymal passages. In myology he
                    rectified several mistakes of Vesalius. He made some curioup researches into the
                    organs of generation in both sexes, and discovered the utero-peritoneal canal
                    which still bears his name.</p>
                <p>Osteology nearly at the same time found an assiduous cultivator in John Philip
                    Ingrassias, a learned Sicilian physician, who, in a skilful commentary on the
                    osteology of Galen, corrected numerous mistakes. He gave the first distinct
                    account of the true configuration of the sphenoid and ethmoid bones, and has the
                    merit of first describing the third bone of the tympanum, called <hi
                    rend="italic">stapes,</hi> though this is also claimed by Eustachius and
                    Fallopius. He appears also to have known the <hi rend="italic">fenestrae,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="italic">chorda</hi><hi rend="italic">tympani,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">cochlea,</hi> the semi-circular canals, and the mastoid cells.</p>
                <p>The anatomical descriptions of Vesalius underwent the scrutiny of various
                    inquirers, actuated, some by motives of hostility to the individual, others by
                    the more honourable wish to ascertain if his representations accorded with
                    nature. Of the latter, Fallopius was one; but the most distinguished by the
                    importance and veracity of their researches, as well as the temperate tone of
                    their observations, were Julius Caesar Aranzi, anatomical professor for 32 years
                    in the university of Bologna, and Constantio Varoli, physician to Pope Gregory
                    XIII. To the former we are indebted for the first correct account of the
                    anatomical peculiarities of the foetus, and for being the first to show that the
                    muscles of the eye do not, as was falsely imagined, arise from the <hi
                    rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> but from the margin of the optic hole. He also,
                    after considering the anatomical relations of the cavities of the heart, the
                    valves, and the great vessels, corroborates the views of Columbus regarding the
                    course which the blood follows in passing from the right to the left side of the
                    heart. I have already mentioned Alexander Achillini as the reputed and probable
                    discoverer of the inferior recesses of the cerebral cavities; but whether he
                    knew them or not, certain it is that neither his contemporaries nor successors
                    gave any proof that they were acquainted with these regions of the brain. Aranzi
                    is the first anatomist who describes them distinctly, who recognises the objects
                    by which they are distinguished, and who gives them the name by which they are
                    still known <hi rend="italic">(bombyx,</hi><hi rend="italic">hippocampus)</hi>;
                    and his account is more minute and perspicuous than that of the authors of the
                    subsequent century. He speaks at large of the choroid plexus, and gives a
                    particular description of the fourth ventric!e under the name of <hi

                <p>Italy, though rich in anatomical talent, has produced probably none greater than
                    Constantio Varoli of Bologna, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038870?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8870-0697"/> Though limited in the measure of his existence to
                    the short space of 32 years, he acquired reputation not inferior to that of the
                    most eminent of his contemporaries. He is now known chiefly as the author of an
                    Epistle, inscribed to Hieronymo Mercuriali, on the optic nerves, in which he
                    describes a new method of dissecting the brain, and communicates many
                    interesting particulars relating to the anatomy of the organ. Overlooking the
                    fanciful comparison of the transverse eminence and the prolongations <hi
                    rend="italic">(crura)</hi> of the brain and cerebellum to a bridge over the
                    water of an aqueduct, though he examines the lower surface of the organ with
                    tedious minuteness, he gives evidence that he formed a more accurate and just
                    idea of its configuration than any of the best modern anatomists. He observes
                    the threefold division of the inferior surface or base, defines the limits of
                    the anterior, middle, and posterior eminences, as marked by the compartments of
                    the scull, and justly remarks that the cerebral cavities are capacious,
                    communicate with each other, extending first backward and then forward, near the
                    angle of the pyramidal portion of the temporal bone, and that they are folded on
                    themselves, and finally lost above the middle and inferior eminence of the
                    brain. He appears to have been aware that at this point they communicate with
                    the exterior or convoluted surface. He recognised the impropriety of the term
                    <hi rend="italic">corpus callosum,</hi> seems to have known the communication,
                    called afterwards <hi rend="italic">foramen Monroianurn,</hi> and describes the
                    <hi rend="italic">hippocampus</hi> more minutely than had been previously
                    done.</p>
                <p>Among the anatomists of the Italian school, as a pupil of Fallopius, Eustachius,
                    and Aldrovandus, is generally enumerated Volcher Coiter of Groningen. He
                    distinguished himself by accurate researches on the cartilages, the bones, and
                    the nerves, recognised the value of morbid anatomy, and made some experiments on
                    living animals to ascertain the action of the heart and the influence of the
                    brain.</p>

                    both English works published at this time, are tolerable compilations, partly
                    from Be-renger, partly from Vesalius, and much tinged by the Galenian and
                    Arabian distinctions.</p>
                <p>The celebrity of the anatomical school of Italy was worthily maintained by
                    Hieronymo Fabricio of Aqua-pendente, who, in imitation of his master Fallopius,
                    laboured to render anatomical knowledge more precise by repeated dissections,
                    and to illustrate the obscure by researches on the structure of animals in
                    general. In this manner he investigated the formation of the foetus, the
                    structure of the oesophagus, stomach, and bowels, and the peculiarities of the
                    eye, the ear, and the larynx. The discovery, however, on which his surest claims
                    to eminence rest, is that of the membranous folds, which he names <hi
                    rend="italic">valves,</hi> in the interior of veins. Several of these folds had
                    been observed by Fcmel, Sylvius, and Vesalius; and in 1547 Cannani observed
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but no
                    one appears to have offered any rational conjecture on their use, or to have
                    traced them through the venous system at large, until Fabricius in 1574, upon
                    this hypothesis, demonstrated the presence of these valvular folds in all the
                    veins of the extremities.</p>
                <p>Fabricius, though succeeded by his pupil Julius Casserius of Placenza, may be
                    regarded as the last of that illustrious line of anatomical teachers by whom the
                    science was so successfully studied and taught in the universities of Italy. The
                    discoveries which each made, and the errors which their successive labours
                    rectified, tended gradually to give anatomy the character of a useful as well as
                    an accurate science, and to pave the way for a discovery which, though not
                    anatomical, but physiological, is so intimately connected with correct knowledge
                    of the shape and situation of parts, that it exercised the most powerful
                    influence on the future progress of anatomical inquiry. This was the knowledge
                    of the circular motion of the blood,—a fact which, though obscurely conjectured
                    by Aristotle, Mon-dino, and Berenger, and partially taught by Servetus,
                    Columbus, Caesalpinus, and Fabricius, it was nevertheless reserved to William
                    Harvey fully and satisfactorily to demonstrate.</p>
                <p>I have already shown that Mondino believed that the blood proceeds from the heart
                    to the lungs, through the <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >arterialis</hi> or pulmonary artery, and that the aorta conveys the spirit into
                    the blood, through all parts of the body. This doctrine was adopted with little
                    modification by Berenger, who further demonstrated the existence and operation
                    of the tricuspid valves in the right ventricle, and of the sigmoid valves at the
                    beginning of the pulmonary artery and aorta, and that there were only two
                    ventricles separated by a solid impervious septum. These were afterwards
                    described in greater detail by Vesalius, who nevertheless appears not to have
                    been aware of the important use which might be made of this knowledge. It was
                    Michael Servet or Servetus, <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> a Spanish monk, who
                    in his treatise <hi rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Trinitatis
                    Erroribus,</hi> published at Basil in 1531, or, according to Sprengel, in 1552,
                    first maintained the imperviousness of the septum, and the transition of the
                    blood by what he terms an unknown route, namely, from the right ventricle by the
                    <hi rend="italic">vena</hi><hi rend="italic">arteriosa</hi> (pulmonary artery)
                    to the lungs, and thence into the <hi rend="italic">arteria venosa</hi> or
                    pulmonary vein, and left auricle and ventricle, from which, he adds afterwards,
                    it is conveyed by the aorta to all parts of the body. <hi rend="superscript">

                <p>* The passage of Servetus is so interesting, that our readers may feel some
                    curiosity in perusing it in the language of the author; and it is not
                    unimportant to remark, that Servetus appears to have been led to think of the
                    course of the blood, by the desire of explaining the manner in which the animal
                    spirits were supposed to be generated. “Vitalis spiritus in sinistro cordis

                    sketched thus early by one who, though a philosopher, was attached to the
                    church, it was only in his work <hi rend="italic">De Re</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomica,</hi> published at Venice in 1559, that Columbus formally and
                    distinctly announced the circular course of the blood as a discovery of his own;
                    and maintained, in addition to the imperviousness of the septum, the fact that
                    the <hi rend="italic">arteria venalis</hi> (pulmonary vein) contains not air,
                    but blood mixed with air brought from the lungs to the left ventricle of the
                    heart, to be distributed through the body at large.</p>
                <p>Soon after, views still more complete of the small or pulmonary circulation were
                    given by Andrew Caesalpinus of Arezzo, who not only maintained the analogy
                    between the structure of the arterious vein or pulmonary artery and the aorta,
                    and that between the venous artery or pulmonary veins, and veins in general, but
                    was the first to remark the swelling of veins below ligatures, and to infer from
                    it a refluent motion of blood in these vessels. The discoveries of Aranzi and
                    Eustachius in the vessels of the foetus, tended at first to perplex, and
                    afterwards to elucidate some of these notions. At length it happened, that
                    between the years 1598 and 1600, a young Englishman, pursuing his anatomical
                    studies at Padua under Fabricius of Aquapendente, learnt from that anatomist the
                    existence of the valves in the veins of the extremities, and undertook to
                    ascertain the use of these valves by experimental inquiry. It is uncertain
                    whether he learnt from the writings of Caesalpinus the fact observed by that
                    author, of the tumescence of a vein below the ligature; but he could not fail to
                    be aware, and indeed he shows that he was aware, of the small circulation as
                    taught by Servetus and Columbus. Combining these facts already known, he, by a
                    series of well-executed experiments, demonstrated clearly the existence, not
                    only of the small, but of a general circulation from the left side of the heart
                    by the aorta and its subdivisions, to the right side by the veins. This
                    memorable truth was first announced in the year 1619.</p>
                <p>It belongs not to this place, either to consider the arguments and facts by which
                    Harvey defended his theory, or to notice the numerous assaults to which he was
                    exposed, and the controversies in which his opponents wished to involve him. It
                    is sufficient to say, that after the temporary ebullitions of spleen and envy
                    had subsided, the doctrine of the circular motion of the blood was admitted by
                    all enlightened and unprejudiced persons, and finally was universally adopted,
                    as affording the most satisfactory explanation of many facts in anatomical
                    structure which were either misunderstood or entirely overlooked. The inquiries
                    to which the investigation of the doctrine gave rise produced numerous
                    researches on the shape and structure of the heart and its divisions, of the
                    lungs, and of the blood-vessels and their distribution. Of this description were
                    the researches of Nicolas Steno on the structure of the heart, the classical
                    work of Richard Lower, the dissertation of Pechlin, the treatise of Vieussens,
                    the work of Malpighi on the structure of the lungs, several sketches in the
                    writings of Mayow, and other treatises of less moment. Systematic treatises of
                    anatomy began to assume a more instructive form, and to breathe a more
                    philosophical spirit. The great work of Adrian Spigelius, which appeared in
                    1627, two years after the death of the author, contains indeed no proof that he
                    was aware of the valuable generalization of Harvey; but in the institutions of
                    Caspar Bartholin, as republished and improved by his son Thomas in 1651, the
                    anatomical descriptions and explanations are given with reference to the new
                    doctrine. A still more unequivocal proof of the progress of correct anatomical
                    knowledge was given in the lectures delivered by Peter Dionis, at the Jardin
                    Royal of Paris, in 1673 and the seven following years, in which that intelligent
                    surgeon gave most accurate demonstrations of all the parts composing the human
                    frame, and especially of the heart, its auricles, ventricles, and valves, and
                    the large vessels connected with it and the lungs. These demonstrations, first
                    published in 1690, were so much esteemed, that they underwent in the space of 30
                    years seven editions, were translated into English, and formed for a long time
                    the best and only anatomical system in Europe.</p>
                <p>The progress of anatomical discovery continued in the mean time to advance. In
                    the course of the 16th century, Eustachius, in studying minutely the structure
                    of the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos,</hi> had recognised in the horse a white
                    vessel full of watery fluid, connected with the internal jugular vein, on the
                    left side of the vertebral column, corresponding accurately with the vessel
                    since named <hi rend="italic">thoracic dud</hi> Fallopius also described vessels
                    belonging to the liver, distinct from arteries and veins; and similar vessels
                    appear to have been noticed by Nicolaus Massa. The nature and properties of
                    these vessels were, however, entirely unknown. On the 23d July 1622 Gaspar
                    Asellius, professor of anatomy at Pavia, while engaged in demonstrating the
                    recurrent nerves in a living dog, first observed numerous white delicate
                    filaments crossing the mesentery in all directions; and though he took them at
                    first for nerves, the opaque white fluid which they shed quickly convinced him
                    that they were a new order of vessels. The repetition of the experiment the
                    following day showed that these vessels were best seen in animals recently fed;
                    and as he traced them from the villous membrane of the intestines, and observed
                    the valves with which they were liberally supplied, he inferred that they were
                    genuine chyliferous vessels. By confounding them with the lymphatics, he made
                    them proceed to the pancreas and liver,—a mistake which appears to have been
                    first rectified by Francis De le Boe. The discovery of Asellius was announced in
                    1627; and the following year, by means of the zealous efforts of Nicolas
                    Peiresc, a liberal senator of Aix, the vessels were seen in the person of a
                    felon who had eaten copiously before execution, and whose body was inspected an
                    hour and a half after. In 1629 they were publicly demonstrated at Copenhagen by
                    Simon Pauli, and the same year the thoracic duct was observed by Mentel for the
                    first time since it was described by Eustachi. Five years after (1634), John
                    Wesling, professor of anatomy and surgery at Venice, gave the first delineation
                    of the lacteals from the human subject, and evinced more accurate knowledge than
                    his predecessors, of the thoracic duct and the lymphatics. Highmore in 1637
                    demonstrated unequivocally the difference between the lacteals and the
                    mesenteric veins; and though some perplexity was occasioned by the discovery of
                    the pancreatic duct by Wirsung, yet this mistake was corrected by Thomas
                    Bartholin; and the discovery by Pecquet in 1647, of the common trunk of the
                    lacteals and lymphatics, and of the course which the chyle follows to reach the
                    blood, may be regarded as the last of the series of isolated facts by the
                    generalization of which the extent, distribution, and uses of the most important
                    organs of the animal body were at length developed.</p>
                <p>To complete the history of this part of anatomical science one step yet
                    remained,—the distinction between the lacteals and lymphatics, and the discovery
                    of the termination of the latter order of vessels. The honour of this discovery
                    is divided between Jolyffe, an English anatomist, and OIaus Rudbeck, a young
                    Swede. The former, according to the testimony of Glisson and Wharton, was aware
                    of the distinct existence of the lymphatics in 1650, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038896?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8896-0699"/> and
                    demonstrated them as such in 1652. It is nevertheless doubtful whether he knew
                    them much before the latter period; and it is certain that Rudbeck observed the
                    lymphatics of the large intestines, and traced them to glands, on the 27th
                    January 1651, after he had, in the course of 1650, made various erroneous
                    conjectures regarding them, and, like others, attempted to trace them to the
                    liver. The following year he demonstrated them in presence of Queen Christina,
                    and traced them to the thoracic duct, and the latter to the subclavian vein.
                    Their course and distribution were still more fully investigated by Thomas
                    Bartholin, Wharton, Swammerdam, and Blaes, the two last of whom recognised the
                    existence of valves; while Antony Nuck of Leyden, by rectifying various errors
                    of his predecessors, and adding several new and valuable observations, rendered
                    this part of anatomy much more precise than formerly.</p>
                <p>After this period anatomists began to study more accurately organs and textures
                    already known, and to obtain more precise knowledge of the intimate structure
                    and organization of the human body. Francis Glisson distinguished himself by a
                    minute description of the liver, and a clearer account of the stomach and
                    intestines than had yet been given. Thomas Wharton investigated the structure of
                    the glands with particular care; and though rather prone to indulge in fanciful
                    generalization, he developed some interesting views of these organs; while
                    Charle-ton, who appears to have been a person of great genius, though addicted
                    to hypothesis, made some good remarks on the communication of the arteries with
                    the veins, the foe-ļ tai circulation, and the course of the lymphatics. But the
                    circumstance which chiefly distinguished the history of anatomy at the beginning
                    of the seventeenth century, was the appearance of Thomas Willis, who rendered
                    himself eminent not only by the first good researches on the brain and nerves,
                    but by many judicious observations on the structure of the lungs, the
                    intestines, the blood-vessels, and the glands. His anatomy of the brain and <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> nerves is so minute and elaborate, and abounds so
                    much in new information, that the reader is struck by the immense chasm between
                    the vague and meagre notices of his predecessors, and the ample and correct
                    descriptions of Willis. This excellent work, however, is not the i result of his
                    own personal and unaided exertions; and the character of Willis derives
                    additional lustre from the: candid avowal of his obligations to Wren and
                    Millington, and, above all, to the diligent researches of his fellowanatomist
                    Richard Lower.</p>
                <p>Willis was the first who correctly numbered the nerves, and described their
                    origins in the order in which they have been generally named till the recent
                    improvements of Soemmering. His observation of the connection of the eighth pair
                    with the slender nerve which issues from the beginning of the spinal chord is
                    known to all. He remarked the parallel lines of the mesolobe, afterwards
                    minutely described by Vicq ďAzyr. He seems to have recognised the communication
                    of the convoluted and figurate surfaces of the brain, and that between the
                    lateral cavities beneath the <hi rend="italic">fornix.</hi> He designates the
                    objects of the central surface— the anterior as the lentiform eminences, with
                    the striated appearance of their internal substance—the posterior as the optic
                    chambers or <hi rend="italic">thalami;</hi> the four orbicular eminences, with
                    the bridge, which he first named <hi rend="italic">annular protuberance</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the white pisiform bodies, since called mammillary
                    eminences, behind the <hi rend="italic">infundibulum.</hi> In the cerebellum he
                    remarks the arborescent arrangement of the white and grey matter, and gives a
                    good account of the internal carotids, and the communications which they make
                    with the branches of the basilar artery. Wep-fer had already demonstrated the
                    peculiar curvature of the former vessels in the carotic canal, and refuted the
                    fiction of the <hi rend="italic">rete mirabile.</hi></p>
                <p>About the same time the researches of Malpighi tended greatly to improve the
                    knowledge of minute structure. He gave the first distinct ideas on the
                    organization of the lung, and the mode in which the bronchial tubes and vessels
                    terminate in that organ. By the microscope he traced the transition of the
                    arteries into the veins. He examined the omentum, and inquired into the manner
                    in which fat and marrow are secreted. He endeavoured to unfold, by dissection
                    and microscopic observation, the minute structure of the brain. He demonstrated
                    the organization of the skin, and considered its constituents as the organ of
                    touch. He studied the structure of bone, and rectified the errors of Gagliardi;
                    he traced the formation and explained the structure of the teeth; and he finally
                    carried his researches into the substance of the liver, the spleen, the kidneys,
                    and the conglobate glands. In these difficult inquiries the observations of
                    Malpighi are in general faithful, and his descriptions are accurate. He may be
                    regarded as the founder of that part of anatomical science which treats of
                    structure and organization; and, even in the present day, his writings are both
                    interesting and instructive.</p>
                <p>Nicolas Steno described with accuracy the lacrymal gland and passages, and
                    re-discovered the parotid duct. Bellini studied the structure of the kidneys,
                    and described the tongue and tonsils with some care; and Drelincourt laboured to
                    investigate the changes effected on the uterus by impregnation, and to elucidate
                    the formation of the foetus. The science might have derived still greater
                    advantages from the genius of Regnier de Graaf, who investigated with accuracy
                    the structure of the pancreas and of the organs of generation in both sexes, had
                    he not been cut off at the early age of 32. Lastly, Wepfer, though more devoted
                    to morbid anatomy, made, nevertheless, some just observations on the anatomical
                    disposition of the cerebral vessels, the glandular structure of the liver, and
                    the termination of the common duct in the duodenum.</p>
                <p>The appearance of Frederic Ruysch, who was born in 1638, and became professor of
                    anatomy at Amsterdam in 1665, gave a new impulse to anatomical research, and
                    tended not only to give the science greater precision, but to extend its limits
                    in every direction. The talents of Ruysch are said to have been developed by
                    accident. To repel the audacious and calumnious aspersions with which De Bils
                    attacked De le Boe and Van Horne, Ruysch published his tract on the valves of
                    the lymphatics, which completely established his character as an anatomist of
                    originality and research. This, however, is the smallest of his services to the
                    science. The art of injecting, which had been originally attempted by Eustachi
                    and Varoli, and was afterwards rudely practised by Glisson, Bellini, and Willis,
                    was at length carried to greater perfection by De Graaf and Swammerdam, the
                    former of whom injected the spermatic vessels with mercury and variously
                    coloured liquors, while the latter, by employing melted wax with other
                    ingredients, made the first approach to the refinements of modern anatomy. By
                    improving this idea of using substances, which, though solid, may be rendered
                    fluid at the period of injecting, Ruysch carried this art to the highest
                    perfection.</p>
                <p>By the application of this happy contrivance, he was enabled to obtain more
                    correct views than his predecessors of the arrangement of minute vessels in the
                    interior of organs, and to demonstrate peculiarities of organization which
                    escaped the scrutiny of previous anatomists. Scarcely<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038909?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8909-0700"/> a part of the
                    human body eluded the penetration of his syringe; and his discoveries were
                    proportionally great. His account of the valves of the lymphatics, of the
                    vessels of the lungs, and their minute structure; his researches on the vascular
                    structure of the skin, of the bones, and their epiphyses, and their mode of
                    growth and union; his observations on the spleen, the <hi rend="italic">glans
                    penis,</hi> the clitoris, and the womb impregnated and unimpregnated, were
                    sufficient to give him the reputation of a skilful and accurate anatomist.
                    These, however, were but a limited part of his anatomical labours. He studied
                    the minute structure of the brain; he demonstrated the organization of the
                    choroid plexus; he described the state of the hair when affected with Polish
                    plait; he proved the vascular structure of the teeth; he injected the <hi
                    rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> the pleura, the pericardium, and peritoneum; he
                    unfolded the minute structure of the conglomerate glands; he investigated that
                    of the synovial apparatus placed in the interior of the joints; and he
                    discovered several curious particulars relating to the lacteals, the lymphatics,
                    and the lymphatic glands. So assiduously, indeed, did Ruysch study by injection
                    the tissue of the organs of the animal body, that it is less easy to say what he
                    did than what he neglected. To him we are indebted for many of the facts of
                    which anatomy at the present day consists. The success of his injections,
                    however, though it enabled him to trace the most delicate terminations of
                    vessels in the substance of organs, perhaps exercised an unfavourable bias in
                    making him look for vessels exclusively in the minute structure of all the
                    tissues.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, Meibomius re-discovered the palpebral glands, which were known to
                    Casserius; Swammerdam studied the action of the lungs, described the structure
                    of the human <hi rend="italic">uterus,</hi> and made numerous valuable
                    observations on the <hi rend="italic">coeca</hi> and pancreatoid organs of
                    fishes; and Kerckringius attempted to explain the process of ossification, and
                    determine its different stages. John Conrad Brunner, in the course of
                    experiments on the pancreas, discovered the muciparous glands of the duodenum,—a
                    fact to which Conrad Peyer gave a more generalized character by his description
                    of the muciparous glands of the intestinal canal at large.' Leonard Tassin,
                    distinguished for original observation, rendered the anatomical history of the
                    brain more accurate than heretofore, and gave particular accounts of the
                    intestinal tube, the pancreatic duct, and the hepatic ligaments. About the same
                    time much light was thrown on the intimate constitution of several of the
                    tissues, and on the minute communications of the arterial and venous tubes by
                    the microscopical observations of Leeuwenhoeck.</p>
                <p>That France might not be without participation in the glory of advancing the
                    progress of anatomical knowledge, the names of Duverney and Vieussens are
                    commemorated with distinction. The former, born in 1648, and first introduced
                    into public life in 1676 in the Royal Academy of Sciences, decorated with the
                    honorary title of professor of anatomy to the Dauphin, and appointed in 1679
                    professor at the Jardin Royal, distinguished himself by the first accurate
                    account of the organ of hearing, and by his dissections of several animals at
                    the academy, supplied valuable materials for the anatomical details of the
                    natural history of animals published by that learned body. He appears to have
                    been the first who demonstrated the fact, that the cerebral sinuses open into
                    the jugular veins, and to have been aware that the former receive the veins of
                    the brain, and are the venous receptacles of the organ. He understood the
                    cerebral cavities, and their mode of communication; distinguishes the posterior
                    pillars of the vault from the <hi rend="italic">pedes hippocampi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> recognises the two plates of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >septum</hi><hi rend="italic">lucidum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, what is
                    still more remarkable, he first indicates distinctly the crossing or plaiting of
                    the cerebral chords in the linear furrow between the right and left pyramidal
                    bodies,—a fact afterwards verified by the researches of Mistichelli, Petit, and
                    Santorini. He studied the ganglions attentively, and gives the first distinct
                    account of the formation, connections, and distribution of the intercostal
                    nerve. It is interesting to remark, that his statement that the veins or sinuses
                    of the spinal chord terminate in the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos</hi> has been
                    verified by the recent researches of Dupuytren and Breschet, which show that the
                    vertebral veins communicate by means of the intercostal and superior lumbar
                    veins with the azygos and demi-azygos. His account of the structure of bones,
                    and of the progress of ossification, is valuable. He recognised the vascular
                    structure of the spleen; and he gives a correct account of the excretory ducts
                    of the prostate gland, the <hi rend="italic">verumοntanurn,</hi> and the
                    anteprostates.</p>
                <p>One of the circumstances which the history of this period of anatomical science
                    shows tended considerably to its improvement, is the attention with which
                    Comparative Anatomy was beginning to be cultivated. In ancient times, and at the
                    revival of letters, the dissection of the lower animals was substituted for that
                    of the human body; and the descriptions of the organs of the latter were too
                    often derived from the former. The obloquy and contempt in which this abuse
                    involved the study of animal anatomy made it be neglected, or pursued with
                    indifference, for more than two centuries, during which anatomists confined
                    their descriptions, at least very much, to the parts of the human body. At this
                    period, however, the prejudice against Comparative Anatomy began to subside; and
                    animal dissection, though not substituted for that of the human body, was
                    employed, as it ought always to have been, to illustrate obscurities, to
                    determine doubts, and to explain difficulties, and, in short, to enlarge and
                    rectify the knowledge of the structure of animal bodies generally.</p>
                <p>For this revolution in its favour, Comparative Anatomy was in a great measure
                    indebted to the learned societies which were established about this time in the
                    different countries of Europe. Among these the Royal Society of London, embodied
                    by charter by Charles II. in 1660, and the Academy of Sciences of Paris, founded
                    in 1665 by Colbert, are undoubtedly entitled to the first rank. Though later in
                    establishment,the latter institution was distinguished by making the first great
                    efforts in favour of Comparative Anatomy; and Perrault, Pecquet, Duverney, and
                    Mery, by the dissections of rare animals obtained from the royal menagerie,
                    speedily supplied valuable materials for the anatomical naturalist. In England,
                    Nehemiah Grew, Edward Tyson, and Samuel Collins, cultivated the same department
                    with diligence and success. The first has left an interesting account of the
                    anatomical peculiarities of the intestinal canal in various animals; and the
                    second, in the dissection of a porpoise, an opossum, and an ourang outang,
                    adduces some valuable illustrations of the comparative differences between the
                    structure of the human body and that of the lower animals. To the third belongs
                    the merit of conceiving, and executing on an enlarged plan, a comprehensive
                    system, embodying all the information then extant. W’ith the aid of Tyson and
                    his own researches, which were both extensive and accurate, he composed a system
                    of anatomical knowledge, in which he not only delivers ample and accurate
                    descriptions of the structure of the human body, and the various morbid changes
                    to which the organs are liable, but illustrates the whole by accurate and
                    interesting sketches of the peculiarities of the lower animals. The matter of
                    this work <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038922?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8922-0701"/> is so excellent, that it can only be ascribed to
                    ignorance that it has received so little attention. Though regarded as a
                    compilation, and though indeed much of the human anatomy is derived from
                    Vesalius, it has the advantage of the works published on the Continental that
                    time, that it embodies most of the valuable facts derived from Malpighi, Willis,
                    and Vieussens. The Comparative Anatomy is almost all original, and acquired from
                    personal research and dissection; and the pathological observations, though
                    occasionally tinged with the spirit of the times, show the author to have been
                    endowed with the powers of observation and judicious reflection in no ordinary
                    degree.</p>
                <p>About this time also we recognise the first attempts to study the minute atomic
                    constitution of the tissues, by the combination of the microscope and the
                    effects of chemical agents. Bone furnished the first instance in which this
                    method was put in use; and though Gagliardi, who undertook the inquiry, had
                    fallen into some mistakes which it required the observation of Malpighi to
                    rectify, this did not deter Clopton Havers and Nesbitt, in England, and
                    Courtial, Du Hamel, and Delasone, and afterwards Hérissant, in France, from
                    resuming the same train of investigation. The mistakes into which these
                    anatomists fell belong to the imperfect method of inquiry. The facts which they
                    ascertained have been verified by recent experiment, and constitute no
                    unessential part of our knowledge of the structure of bone.</p>
                <p>Ten years after the publication of the work of Collins, Henry Ridley, another
                    English anatomist, distinguished himself by a monograph on the brain, which,
                    though not free from errors, contains nevertheless some valuable ob- ‘
                    servations. Ridley is the first who distinguishes by name the restiform
                    processes, or the posterior pyramidal eminences. He recognised the figure of the
                    four eminences in the human subject; he remarked the mammillary bodies; and he
                    discovered the sinus which passes under his name.</p>
                <p>Raymond Vieussens, by the publication of his great work on neurography in 1684,
                    threw new light on the configuration and structure of the brain, the spinal
                    chord, and the nerves; and gave a description of the arrangement and
                    distribution of the latter more precise than heretofore. Of the formation and
                    connections of the sympathetic nerve especially he gave views which have <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> been generally adopted by subsequent anatomists. His
                    new arrangement of the vessels, published in 1705, contains several curious and
                    some hypothetical opinions. His observations on the structure of the heart,
                    published in 1706, and enlarged in 1715, exhibit the first correct views of the
                    intimate structure of an organ, which afterwards was most fully developed by the
                    labours of Lancisi and Senac. His treatise on the ear is not superior to that of
                    Duverney.</p>
                <p>To the same period belong the rival publications of Godfrey Biđloo and William
                    Cowpcr, the last of whom, however, stained a reputation otherwise good, by
                    publishing as his own the engravings of the former. Cowper further đistinguishcd
                    himself by a minute account of the urethral glands, already known to Columbus
                    and Mery; a good description of the intestinal glands, discovered by Brunner and
                    Peyer; and by demonstrating the communication of the arteries and veins of the
                    mesentery.</p>
                <p>The anatomical genius of Italy, which had slumbered since the death of Malpighi,
                    was destined once more to revive in Lancisi, Valsalva, and his illustrious <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> pupils Santorini and Morgagni. Valsalva especially
                    distinguished himself by his description of the structure of the ear, which, in
                    possessing still greater precision and minuteness than that of Duverney, is
                    valuable in setting the example of rendering anatomy altogether a science of
                    description.</p>
                <p>Santorini, who was professor at Venice, was no unworthy friend of Valsalva and
                    Morgagni. His anatomical observations, which relate to the muscles of the face,
                    the brain, and several of the nerves, the ducts of the lacrymal gland, the nose
                    and its cavities, the larynx, the viscera of the chest and belly, and the organs
                    of generation in the two sexes, furnish beautiful models of essays distinguished
                    for perspicuity, precision, and novelty, above any thing which had then
                    appeared. These observations, indeed, which bear the impress of accurate
                    observation and clear conception, may be safely compared with any anatomical
                    writings which have appeared since. Those on the brain are particularly
                    interesting. Morgagni, though chiefly known as a pathological anatomist, did not
                    neglect the healthy structure. His <hi rend="italic">Adversaria,</hi> which
                    appeared between 1706 and 1719, and his <hi rend="italic">Epistles,</hi>
                    published in 1728, contain a series of observations to rectify the mistakes of
                    previous anatomists, and to determine the characters of the healthy structure of
                    many parts of the human body. Many parts he describes anew, and indicates facts
                    not previously observed. All his remarks show how well he knew what true
                    anatomical description ought to be. In this respect, indeed, the three
                    anatomists now mentioned may be said to have anticipated their contemporaries
                    nearly a century; for, while other authors were satisfied with giving loose and
                    inaccurate or meagre notices of parts, with much fanciful supposition, Valsalva,
                    Santorini, and Morgagni, laboured to determine with precision the anatomical
                    characters of the parts which they describe.</p>
                <p>The same character is due to Winslow, a native of Denmark, but, as pupil and
                    successor of Duverney, as well as a convert to Catholicism, naturalized in
                    France, and finally professor of anatomy at the Royal Garden. His exposition of
                    the structure of the human body is distinguished for being not only the first
                    treatise of descriptive anatomy, divested of physiological details and
                    hypothetical explanations foreign to the subject, but for being a close
                    description derived from actual objects, without reference to the writings of
                    previous anatomists. About the same time Cheselden in London, the first Monro in
                    Edinburgh, and Albinus in Leyden, contributed by their several treatises to
                    render anatomy still more precise as a descriptive science. The <hi
                    rend="italic">Osteographia</hi> of the former was of much use in directing
                    attention to the study of the skeleton, and the morbid changes to which it is
                    liable. This work, however, magnificent as it was, was excelled by that of
                    Albinus, who, in 1747, published engravings descriptive of the bones and
                    muscles, which, perhaps, will never be surpassed cither in accuracy of outline
                    or beauty of execution. The several labours of this author, indeed, constitute
                    an important era in the history of the science. He was the first who classified
                    and exhibited the muscles in a proper arrangement, and applied to them a
                    nomenclature which is still retained by the consent of the best anatomists. He
                    gives a luminous account of the arteries and veins of the intestines, represents
                    with singular fidelity and beauty the bones of the foetus, inquires into the
                    structure of the skin, and the cause of its colour in different races;
                    represents the changes incident to the womb in different periods of pregnancy,
                    and describes the relations of the thoracic duct and the <hi rend="italic">vena
                    azygos</hi> with the contiguous parts. Besides these large and magnificent
                    works, illustrated by the most beautiful engravings, six books of Academical
                    Annotations were the fruits of his long and assiduous cultivation of anatomy.
                    These contain valuable remarks on the sound structure and morbid deviations of
                    numerous parts of the human body.</p>
                <p>To render the knowledge of the skeleton more complete, Duhamel and Delasone
                    studied the minute structure <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038935?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8935-0702"/> of bone, and the process of ossification; William
                    Hunter and Hérissant investigated the texture of the cartilages; and Weitbrecht
                    gave a copious and minute account of the ligaments. Μ. Lieutaud also, who had
                    already laboured to rectify many errors in anatomy, described with much accuracy
                    the structure and relations of the heart and its cavities, and rendered the
                    anatomy of the bladder very precise, by describing the triangular space and the
                    mammillary eminence at its neck.</p>
                <p>Albinus found a worthy successor in his pupil Albert Von Haller, who, with a mind
                    imbued with every department of literature and science, directed his chief
                    attention, nevertheless, to the cultivation of anatomical and physiological
                    knowledge. Having undertaken at an early age (21) to illustrate, with
                    commentaries, the physiological prelections of his preceptor Boerhaave, he
                    devoted himself assiduously to the perusal of every work which could tend to
                    facilitate his purpose; and as he found numerous erroneous or imperfect
                    statements, and many deficiencies to supply, he undertook an extensive course of
                    dissection of human and animal bodies, to obtain the requisite information. For
                    17 years, during which he was professor at Goettingen, he dissected 400
                    bodies,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Pene
                    quadringentis mea manu dissectis hominum cadaveribus.” (Praefatio ad tom. vi.
                    <hi rend="italic">Elementorum Physiologiae.)</hi></p></note> and inspected their
                    organs with the utmost care. The result of these assiduous labours appeared at
                    intervals in the form of dissertations by himself, or under the name of some one
                    of his pupils, finally published in a collected shape, between 1746 and 1751 <hi
                    rend="italic">(</hi><hi rend="italic">Disputationes Anatomicae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Selectiores)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in eight numbers of
                    most accurate and beautiful engravings, representing the most important parts of
                    the human body, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the diaphragm, the uterus, ovaries
                    and vagina, the arteries of the different regions and organs, with learned and
                    critical explanatory observations. Some years after, when he had retired from
                    his academical duties at Goettingen, he published, between 1757 and 1765, the
                    large and elaborate work which, with singular modesty, he styled <hi
                    rend="italic">Elements of Physiology.</hi> This work, though professedly devoted
                    to the latter science, rendered nevertheless the most essential services to the
                    former. Haller, drawing an accurate line of distinction between the two, gave
                    the most clear, precise, and complete descriptions of the situation, position,
                    figure, component parts, and minute structure of the different organs and their
                    appendages. The results of previous and coeval inquiry, obtained by extensive
                    reading, he sedulously verified by personal observation; and though he never
                    rejected facts stated on credible authorities, he in all cases laboured to
                    ascertain their real value by experiment. The anatomical descriptions are on
                    this account not only the most valuable part of his work, but the most valuable
                    that had then or for a long time after appeared; and it is perhaps a sufficient
                    proof of their intrinsic merit, that they are still resorted to by the anatomist
                    as the most faithful guide to many of his researches. It is painful,
                    nevertheless, to think, that the very form in which this work is composed, with
                    copious and scrupulous reference to authorities, made it be regarded as a
                    compilation only; and that the author was compelled to show, by a list of his
                    personal researches, that the most learned work ever given to the physiologist,
                    was also the most abundant in original information.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Ibid.</hi></p></note></p>
                <p>With the researches of Haller, it is proper to notice those of his contemporary,
                    John Frederick Meckel, and his pupil John Godfrey Zinn. The former, who was
                    professor of anatomy at Berlin, described with unrivalled accuracy the Gasserian
                    ganglion, the first pair of nerves and its distribution, and that of the facial
                    nerves generally, and discovered the spheno-palatine ganglion. He' made some
                    original and judicious observations on the tissue of the skin and the mucous
                    net; and above all, he recognised the connection of the lymphatic vessels with
                    the veins,—a doctrine which, though neglected, has been lately revived by
                    Fohmann and Lippi. He also collected several valuable observations on the morbid
                    states of the heart and brain. At the same time Zinn, who was professor of
                    medicine at Goettingen, published on the eye a classical treatise, which
                    demonstrated at once the defects of previous inquiries, and how much it was
                    possible to elucidate, by accurate research and precise description, the
                    structure of one of the most important organs of the human frame. As a general
                    proof of the extraordinary merit of this work, it is sufficient to say, that in
                    critical learning and descriptive accuracy it has not been equalled, and
                    probably will never be surpassed. It was re-published after his death by
                    Wrisberg.</p>
                <p>General anatomy, and the study of the atomic constitution of the tissues which
                    had originally been commenced by Leeuwenhoeck, Malpighi, and Ruysch, began at
                    this period to attract more general attention. De Bergen had already
                    demonstrated the general distribution of cellular membrane, and shown that it
                    not only incloses every part of the animal frame, but forms the basis of every
                    organ,—a doctrine which was adopted, and still more fully expanded, by his
                    friend Haller, in opposition to what was asserted by Albinus,<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Αnnot.

                    tissue. William Hunter at the same time gave a clear and ingenious statement of
                    the difference between cellular membrane and adipose tissue, in which he
                    maintained the general distribution of the former, and represented it as forming
                    the serous membranes, and regulating their physiological and pathological
                    properties,— doctrines which were afterwards confirmed by his brother John
                    Hunter. A few years after, the department of general anatomy first assumed a
                    substantial form, in the systematic view of the membranes and their mutual
                    connections traced by Andrew Bonn of Amsterdam. In his inaugural dissertation
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Continuationibus Membranarum,</hi>
                    published at Leyden in 1763, this author, after some preliminary observations on
                    membranes in general and their structure, and an exposition of that of the skin,
                    traces its transition into the mucous membranes and their several divisions. He
                    then explains the distribution of the cellular membrane and the aponeurotic
                    expansions, and the periosteum and perichondrium, by either of which, he shows,
                    every bone of the skeleton is invested and connected. He finally gives a very
                    distinct view of the arrangement of the internal membranes of cavities, those
                    named serous and fibro-serous, and the manner of their distribution over the
                    contained organs. This essay, which is a happy example of generalization, is
                    remarkable for the interesting general views of the structure of the animal body
                    which it exhibits; and to Bonn belongs the merit of sketching the first outlines
                    of that system which it was reserved for the genius of Bichat to complete and
                    embellish. Lastly, Bordeu, in an elaborate essay on the mucous tissue, or
                    cellular organ, as he' terms it, brought forward some interesting views of the
                    constitution, nature, and extent of the cellular membrane.</p>
                <p>Though anatomy was hitherto cultivated with much success as illustrating the
                    natural history and morbid states of the human body, yet little had been done
                    for the elucidation of local diseases, and the surgical means by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193038948?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-8948-0703"/> which they may
                    be successfully treated. The idea of applying anatomical knowledge directly to
                    this purpose appears to have originated with Bernardin Genga, a Roman surgeon,
                    who published in 1672, at Rome, a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Surgical
                    Anatomy, or the Anatomical History of the Bones and Muscles of the Human Body,
                    with the description of the Blood-vessels.</hi> This work, which reached a
                    second edition in 1687, is highly creditable to the author, who appears to have
                    studied intimately the mutual relations of different parts. It is not improbable
                    that the example of Genga led Palfyn, a surgeon at Ghent, to undertake a similar
                    task about 30 years after. For this, however, he was by no means well qualified;
                    and the work of Palfyn, though bearing the name of Surgical Anatomy, is a
                    miserable compilation, meagre in details, inaccurate in description, and
                    altogether unworthy of the honour of being republished, as it afterwards was, by
                    Antony Petit.</p>
                <p>While these two authors, however, were usefully employed in showing what was
                    wanted for the surgeon, others were occupied in the collection of new and more
                    accurate facts. Albinus, indeed, ever assiduous, had, in his account of the
                    operations of Rau, given some good sketches of the relative anatomy of the
                    bladder and urethra; and Cheselden had already, in his mode of cutting into the
                    urinary bladder, shown the necessity of exact knowledge of the relations of
                    contiguous parts. The first decided application, however, of this species of
                    anatomical research it was reserved for a Dutch anatomist of the 18th century to
                    make. Peter Camper, professor of Anatomy at Amsterdam, published in 1760 and
                    1762 his anatomico-pathological demonstrations of the parts of the human arm and
                    pelvis, of the diseases incident to them, and the mode of relieving them by
                    operation. These observations are of the utmost value. The situation of the
                    blood-vessels, nerves, and important muscles, is explained with the greatest
                    clearness; and though the engravings are rather bold and accurate than elegant,
                    they constitute a work indispensable to the anatomical reader. His remarks on
                    the lateral operation of lithotomy, which contain all that was then known on the
                    subject, are exceedingly interesting and valuable to the surgeon. It appears
                    further that he was the first who examined anatomically the mechanism of
                    ruptures, his delineations of which were published in 1801 by Soemmering.</p>
                <p>It had been originally observed by Riolan, Severinus, Rndbeck, Harvey, and De
                    Graaf, that in the foetus the testicles are situate in the abdomen; but this
                    observation, so pregnant with important results, appears to have been
                    overlooked, nay doubted, till verified by Haller, who showed that their removal
                    from this region is connected with the formation of congenital hernia. The
                    situation of the testicles previous to birth, their gradual descent into the
                    scrotum, and the mode in which a portion of intestine may slip down with them,
                    was still more fully investigated by William Hunter, by Camper, and finally by
                    John Hunter; and the peculiarities of the inguinal canal, and the manner in
                    which its persistence after birth, or its re-opening, may occasion hernial
                    protrusions, have been well explained by Sandifort, Scarpa, Sir Astley Cooper,
                    Allan Burns, and Lawrence, and more recently by Hesselbach and Langenbeck.</p>
                <p>The attention of anatomists was now directed to the elucidation of the most
                    obscure and least explored parts of the human frame—the lymphatic vessels and
                    the nerves. Although, since the first discovery of the former by Asellius,
                    Rudbeck, and Pecquet, much had been done, especially by Ruysch, Nuck, Meckel,
                    and Haller, many points, notwithstanding, relating to their origin, and
                    distribution in particular organs, and in the several classes of animals, were
                    imperfectly ascertained or <hi rend="subscript"> x</hi> entirely unknown.
                    William Hunter investigated their arrangement, and proposed the doctrine that
                    they are absorbents; and John Hunter, who undertook to demonstrate the truth of
                    this hypothesis by experiment, discovered, in 1758, lymphatics in birds in the
                    neck. As this doctrine required the existence of this order of vessels, not only
                    in quadrupeds and birds, but in reptiles and fishes, the inquiry attracted
                    attention among the pupils of Hunter; and William Hewson at length communicated,
                    in December 1768, to the Royal Society of London, an account of the lacteals and
                    lymphatics in birds, fishes, and reptiles, as he had discovered and demonstrated
                    them. The subject appears about the same time to have been investigated by the
                    second Monro, who indeed claimed the merit of discovering these vessels in the
                    classes of animals now mentioned But whatever researches this anatomist may have
                    instituted, Hewson, by communicating his observations to the Royal Society, must
                    be allowed to possess the strongest as well as the clearest claim to discovery.
                    The same author, in 1774, gave the first complete account of the anatomical
                    peculiarities of the lymphatic system in man and other animals, and thereby
                    supplied an important gap in this department. Hewson is the first who
                    distinguishes the lymphatics into two orders, the superficial and the deep, both
                    in the extremities and in the internal organs. He also studied the structure of
                    the intestinal <hi rend="italic">villi,</hi> in which he verified the
                    observations of Lieberkuhn; and in inquiring into the minute structure of the
                    glands, he adopted the views of Ruysch. He finally applied his anatomical
                    discoveries to explain many of the physiological and pathological phenomena of
                    the animal body. Ten years after, John Sheldon, another pupil of Hunter, gave a
                    second history and description of the lymphatics, which, though divested of the
                    charm of novelty, contains many interesting anatomical facts. He also examined
                    the structure of the <hi rend="italic">villi.</hi> And, lastly, Cruikshank, in
                    1786, published a very valuable history of the anatomy of the lymphatic system,
                    in which he maintains the accuracy of the Hunterian doctrine, that the
                    lymphatics are the only absorbents; gave a more minute account than heretofore
                    of these vessels, of their coats and valves; and supplied the defect left by
                    Hewson, by explaining the structure of the lymphatic glands. He also injected
                    the <hi rend="italic">villi,</hi> and examined them microscopically, verifying
                    most of the observations of Lieberkuhn. The origin of the lymphatics he
                    maintains rather by inference than direct demonstration. To these three works,
                    though in other respects very excellent, it is a considerable objection that the
                    anatomical descriptions are much mixed with hypothetical speculation and
                    reasonings on properties, and that the facts are by no means always
                    distinguished from mere matters of opinion. At the same time Haase published an
                    account of the lymphatics of the skin and intestines, and the plexiform nets of
                    the pelvis.</p>
                <p>To complete this sketch of the history of the anatomy of the lymphatic system, it
                    may be added that Mascagni, who had been engaged from the year 1777 to 1781 in
                    the same train of investigation, first demonstrated to his pupils several
                    curious facts relating to the anatomy of the lymphatic system. When at Florence
                    in 1782, he made several preparations, at the request of Peter Leopold, grand
                    duke of Tuscany; and when the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris announced the
                    anatomy of this system for their prize essay appointed for March 1784, Mascagni
                    resolved on communicating to the public the results of his researches—the first
                    part of his commentary, with four engravings. Anxiety, however, to complete his
                    preparations detained him at Florence till the close of 1785; and from these
                    causes his work did <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038961?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8961-0704"/> not appear till 1787. These delays, however,
                    unfavourable as they were to his claims of priority to Sheldon and Cruikshank,
                    were on the whole advantageous to the perfection of his work, which is not only
                    the most magnificent, but also the most complete, that ever was published on the
                    lymphatics. In his account of the vessels and their valves, he confirms some of
                    Hewson’s observations, and rectifies others. Their origins he proves by
                    inference much in the same manner as Cruikshank; but he anticipates this author
                    in the account of the glands, and he gives the most minute description of the
                    superficial and deep lymphatics, both in the members and in the internal
                    organs.</p>
                <p>General accounts of the nerves had been given with various degrees of accuracy by
                    Willis, Vieussens, W inslow, and the first Monro; and the subject had been much
                    rectified and improved by the indefatigable Haller. The first example of minute
                    descriptive neurography was given in 1748 by J. F. Meckel, whose account of the
                    fifth pair, and their connection with the intercostal, and of the nerves of the
                    face, will long remain a lasting proof of accuracy and research. The same
                    subject was investigated in 1765 by Hirsch, and in 1777 by Wrisberg. In 1766
                    Metzger examined the origin, distribution, and termination of the first pair,—a
                    point which was afterwards very minutely treated by Scarpa in his anatomical
                    disquisitions published in 1780; and the internal nerves of the nostrils were
                    examined in 1791 by Haase. The optic nerve, which had been studied originally by
                    Varoli, and afterwards by Mery, Duverney, Henkel, Moeller, Hein, and Kaldschmid,
                    was examined with extreme accuracy, with the other nerves of the organ of
                    vision, by Zinn, in his elaborate treatise. The phrenic nerves, and the
                    oesophageal branches of the eighth pair, were studied by Haase; the phrenic, the
                    abdominal, and the pharyngeal nerves, by Wrisberg; those of the heart most
                    minutely by Andersch; and the origins, formation, and distribution of the
                    intercostal nerve, by Iwanoff, Ludwig, and Girardi. The labours of these
                    anatomists, however, were eclipsed by the splendid works of Walter on the nerves
                    of the chest and belly; and those of Scarpa on the distribution of the 8th pair,
                    and splanchnic nerves in general. In minuteness of description, and in beauty of
                    engraving, these works have not yet been equalled, and will never perhaps be
                    surpassed. About the same time Scarpa, so distinguished in every branch of
                    anatomical research, investigated the minute structure of the ganglions and
                    plexuses.</p>
                <p>The brain was also studied with great attention by Ma-lacarne, Vicq d’Azyr, and
                    Soemmering; more recently Reil examined the minute structure of the organ and
                    its component parts with unrivalled research and accuracy; and Rolando studied
                    the structure of the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum.</hi></p>
                <p>Lastly, the anatomy of the gravid uterus, which had been originally studied by
                    Albinus, Roederer, and Smel-lie, was again illustrated most completely by
                    William Hunter, whose engravings will remain a lasting memorial of scientific
                    zeal and sculptorial talent.</p>
                <p>The perfection which anatomical science has attained, has been evinced during the
                    last 30 years in the improved character of the systems published by anatomists.
                    The first who gave a good modern system was Sabatier; but his work was speedily
                    eclipsed by the superior merits of the treatises of Soemmering, Bichat, and
                    Portal. To the first belongs the character of being at once the most learned and
                    critical, and at the same time the most precise, yet published. The General
                    Anatomy of Bichat is a monument of his philosophical genius, which will last as
                    long as the structure and functions of the human body are objects of interest.
                    His Descriptive Anatomy is distinguished by clear and natural arrangement,
                    precise and accurate description, and the general ingenuity with which the
                    subject is treated. The physiological observations' are in general correct,
                    often novel, and always highly interesting. It is unfortunate, however, that the
                    ingenious author was cut off prematurely during the preparation of the third
                    volume. It must nevertheless be acknowledged, that if the two last ones betray
                    the want of the genius of Bichat, they are pervaded with the general spirit by
                    which the others are impressed, and are highly creditable to the learning, the
                    judgment, and the diligence of MM. Roux and Buisson. The system of Portal is a
                    valuable and correct digest of anatomical and pathological knowledge, which, in
                    exact literary information, is worthy of the author of the History of Anatomy
                    and Surgery, and, in accuracy of descriptive details, shows that Μ. Portal
                    trusts not to the labours of his predecessors only. Since the appearance of
                    these standard works, Meckel published a Manual, which combines the
                    philosophical generalizations of Bichat with the precise description and
                    pathological knowledge of Portal. This work has been recently translated into
                    French. Lastly, Cloquet formed, on the model of the Descriptive Anatomy of
                    Bichat, a system in which he avails himself of the literature and precision of
                    Soemmering, and the details of Portal. The system of Gordon is imperfect, its
                    completion being interrupted by the death of the author; but, so far as it goes,
                    it gives a correct summary of General Anatomy, and some accurate descriptive
                    details of the heart and brain. The work of Dr Monro is entitled to mention in
                    this place, as an elementary treatise, containing, with anatomical description,
                    a good deal of physiological and pathological matter. These, however, must be
                    considered foreign to the subject.</p>
                <p>Of treatises on particular departments, those of Blumenbach on the bones, Innes
                    and Sandifort on the muscles, the several anatomical writings and engravings of
                    Charles Bell on the arteries, the nerves, and the brain, Barclay on the
                    arteries, Tiedemann on the nerves of the uterus, and the same author’s engraved
                    delineations of the arteries, and Harrison’s excellent work on the arteries,
                    deserve notice. The minute structure of bone which had been examined by Scarpa,
                    was again studied by that indefatigable inquirer, and in this country by
                    Howship. The structure of the lungs was investigated by Reisseissen, by
                    Magendie, and Sir E. Home. On the anatomy of the nervous system numerous
                    treatises have lately appeared. Joseph and Charles Wenzel investigated the
                    minute structure of the brain in man and the lower animals; Tiedemann traced the
                    development of the organ in the foetus, and rectified many errors on its
                    formation and minute structure; Sir Everard Home and Μ. Bauer investigated its
                    atomic constitution by the microscope; Lobstein investigated the structure and
                    distribution of the great sympathetic nerve; Bellangeri published an accurate
                    description of the spinal chord and its nerves; and, lastly, Charles Bell, in
                    his great work on the nervous system, developes and establishes the truth of the
                    ancient theory of the separate nature of the nerves of motion and those of
                    sensation. Comparative Anatomy has been diligently cultivated by Daubenton,
                    Pallas, Haller, John Hunter, and the second Monro, and more recently by Cuvier,
                    Dumeril, Home, Tiedemann, and Meckel.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing account we have been anxious to trace merely a general sketch of
                    the progressive advancement of anatomical discovery, from the first cultivation
                    of the art to the present time. To mention every circumstance is impracticable,
                    and would have extended this outline much beyond its legitimate limits. Though
                    no name of genuine <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038974?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8974-0705"/> importance, however, has been omitted, every one
                    not directly connected with strict anatomy has been excluded. At the same time
                    it has been found impossible to specify every individual who has contributed at
                    different periods to the improvement of the science; and these we shall in
                    general notice occasionally as we require to speak of them in the account of
                    particular parts. For more minute and detailed information, we refer in general
                    to the elaborate History of Anatomy and Surgery by Portal, the <hi

                    and the critical and learned history of Lauth. It is unfortunate that the latter
                    work is not completed· But by combining its perusal with that of the works
                    already mentioned, and several of the chapters of Sprengeľs History of Medicine,
                    the anatomical inquirer will form very just ideas of the literary history of his
                    science.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>HUMAN ANATOMY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">All</hi> animal bodies agree in the possession of certain
                    general characters, by which they are distinguished equally from inorganic
                    bodies and from vegetables.</p>
                <p>Besides the round shape by which organic bodies are distinguished, most animals
                    are, externally at least, symmetrical, or present on each side of the mesial
                    plane, lateral halves mutually alike. The substances of which they consist are
                    not entirely solid, but are soft, compressible, distensible, and elastic, and
                    contain a proportion of liquid matter, which is generally in the ratio of
                    majority to that of the solid. These substances are enveloped in a thready or
                    filamentous matter, named areolar or cellular, from the interstitial spaces
                    which result from the intersection of its filaments; and the whole is inclosed
                    in a general covering, which in several classes is soft, membranous, and
                    elastic, but in others is hard, crustaceous, and even homy. The body is
                    perforated by an internal cavity for the reception of food; and this cavity is
                    lined by a membranous covering, which is continuous with that by which the
                    exterior is involved. In several classes of animals there are tubular canals,
                    distributed in an arborescent form, for conveying, in definite directions, the
                    nutritious matter to all parts of the frame. These are named bloodvessels, or
                    organs of circulation. One modification of these, arranged in such manner that
                    this matter is subjected to the influence of the atmospheric air, forms lungs,
                    gills, or organs of <hi rend="italic">respiration</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and another, in which part of it is separated from the whole, constitutes
                    secreting organs or glands. The genital or reproductive organs consist of a
                    cavity, from which the germs or <hi rend="italic">ova</hi> are detached. For the
                    purpose of motion, animals further possess organs generally of a fibrous
                    structure, and which have the remarkable property of undergoing contraction on
                    the application of a stimulus or irritating agent. These organs are denominated
                    muscles <hi rend="italic">(lacerti,</hi><hi rend="italic">tori)</hi>; and their
                    contractile property is termed <hi rend="italic">irritability</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">contractility.</hi> For receiving the impression of external
                    objects, they are provided with one or more organs of sensation, of structure
                    more or less complex. And in almost all animal bodies, except the very lowest,
                    there are found soft, gray, or whitish cords, inelastic, but marked in their
                    course by fusiform, spheroidal, or irregular-shaped swellings, and connected at
                    their further extremity with the muscles, with the organs of sensation, or with
                    the exterior or interior coverings. It is remarkable that the purpose of these
                    cords, which are named nerves, is not exactly known. They neither communicate
                    mobility to the muscles, nor sensibility to the organs of sensation; but they
                    render the actions of the former steady, regular, and voluntary; and the
                    impressions received by the latter they certainly serve to convey to the centre
                    of the nervous system.</p>
                <p>The faculty ascribed to the nerves is named <hi rend="italic">nervous</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">action,</hi><hi rend="italic">nervous energy, nervous power,
                    nervous inβuence,</hi> or simply <hi rend="italic">innervation.</hi></p>
                <p>In chemical composition, animal bodies consist of gelatine, albumen, fibrin, fat
                    or oleaginous matter, a modification of mucus, and various saline substances.
                    Subjected to combustion, or spontaneous decomposition, while vegetable
                    substances furnish water, çarbonic acid, and carburetted hydrogen, animal
                    matters furnish also ammonia,—a circumstance which shows that they contain
                    azote. They furnish also sulphuretted hydrogen, apparently from the
                    decomposition of albuminous matters.</p>
                <p>The fluids of animal bodies <hi rend="italic">(liquores, latices, humores)</hi>
                    are contained in tubular canals or vessels. If these fluids move through the
                    vessels, they are denominated generally blood, whatever be their colour. All the
                    fluids consist either of this, or of some modification separated from it by
                    means of glandular action; and of the fluids so separated, some are destined for
                    purposes within the economy, and are therefore secretions proper; others are
                    intended to be eliminated immediately, and may therefore be regarded as
                    excretions. Though it is impossible to estimate accurately the proportion of the
                    fluids, some idea of it may be formed by the fact, that an animal body may be
                    reduced by desiccation to ⅜ or ∙⅛ even of its previous weight. The proportion
                    may be stated, in general terms, to vary from 9 or 6 of fluid, to 1 of solid
                    matter.</p>
                <p>The various forms of animal bodies may be referred to general divisions or
                    classes, according to certain peculiarities in configuration and structure.
                    These divisions are, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata, Mollusca,
                    Articulata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiata.</hi></p>
                <p>In the first class the central portion of the nervous system, consisting of the
                    brain and spinal chord, is inclosed in a case of hard matter, containing much
                    calcareous earth, and denominated bone. While one portion of this forms, by the
                    union of its pieces, a cavity named the scull or <hi rend="italic">cranium,</hi>
                    the other is composed of separate pieces, which by their union constitute at
                    once a continuous canal and a sort of internal pillar or column for attaching
                    and supporting the soft parts. These pieces are named <hi rend="italic"
                    >vertebrae (δ-zοvδυλοι)</hi>; and their presence is so uniform, that they
                    constitute the character of the class, which are therefore named <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vertebrated Animals;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Animalia
                    Vertebris</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">praedita,</hi><hi rend="italic">sive</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata).</hi></p>
                <p>The presence of vertebrae is accompanied with other peculiarities of structure.
                    Thus the vertebrated animals have red blood and a muscular heart; a system of
                    tubes for conveying blood from this to the different organs,—the distributory,
                    or arteries; another system for returning it,—the regredient, or veins; and a
                    particular system of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193038987?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-8987-0706"/> vessels for exposing the latter blood to the
                    influence of the atmosphere. They have further a mouth with two horizontal jaws;
                    distinct organs of vision, hearing, smell, and taste, lodged in the cavities of
                    the face; never more than four members; separate sexual organs; and considerable
                    similarity in the arrangement of the central masses and the ramified chords of
                    the nervous system. In all the vertebrated animals the blood which serves for
                    the secretion of bile is the venous, which has circulated in the intestines, and
                    which is afterwards made to undergo a ramifying distribution in the portal vein.
                    In all the vertebrated animals also a peculiar secretion is formed from the
                    arterial blood by two large glands, denominated kidneys.</p>
                <p>In the second general division, which are destitute of those firm pieces named
                    bones, the central portion of the nervous system, instead of being inclosed in
                    portions of the skeleton, is placed on the oesophagus, and, with the other
                    internal organs, is inclosed in a general soft envelope, contractile,
                    corresponding to the skin, to which the muscles are attached, and in which stony
                    patches named shells are occasionally formed. Of the four proper organs of
                    sensation, those only of taste and sight are observed; and the last are often
                    wanting. One family only are provided with organs of hearing. There is always a
                    complete system of circulation, and organs for respiration. Those of digestion
                    and secretion are almost as complicated as in the vertebrated animals. The
                    division of the animal world thus distinguished have been named <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Molluscous Animals</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Animalia Mollusca).</hi></p>
                <p>In the third general division, the nervous system consists of two chords
                    extending longitudinally along the belly, and swelling at intervals into knots
                    or ganglions. The first of these, placed on the oesophagus, and distinguished as
                    the brain, is scarcely larger than the others. The covering of the trunk is
                    divided by transverse folds into a number of rings, the integuments of which may
                    be hard or soft, but to the interior of which muscles are in all cases attached.
                    The sides of the trunk, though often provided with, are nevertheless often
                    without, articulated members. The annular appearance of the trunk has given
                    these animals the character of <hi rend="smallcaps">Articulated;</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Animalia Articulata).</hi> They have been occasionally named
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Annulosa.</hi></p>
                <p>This class of animal bodies is remarkable for presenting the first transition
                    from circulation in close tubes or vessels, to nutrition by imbibition, and the
                    corresponding transition from respiration in circumscribed organs to that which
                    takes place in air-tubes distributed through the whole body. The only distinct
                    organs of sensation are those of taste and sight.; and a single family have
                    organs of hearing. The jaws, when present, are lateral.</p>
                <p>In these three divisions of animals the organs of motion and sensation are
                    arranged symmetrically on both sides of an axis or imaginary line. In a fourth
                    class they are distributed circularly round a centre. In these, which in
                    homogeneous structure approach the nature of plants, neither distinct nervous
                    system nor proper organs of sensation are observed. Scarcely do we recognise
                    traces of circulation. The organs for respiration are almost always at the
                    surface of the body. Most of them have for intestine a sac without vent; and
                    some present only a homogeneous pulp, movable and sensible. To this class, which
                    comprehends those beings denominated since the time of Aristotle <hi
                    rend="italic">zoophytes</hi><hi rend="italic">(ζωόφυτα),</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">animal plants,</hi> the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Radiated
                    Animals</hi> has been recently applied; <hi rend="smallcaps">(Animalia
                    Radiata).</hi></p>
                <p>The vertebrated animals, however similar in general characters, present certain
                    peculiarities by which they are naturally distinguished into classes. The first,
                    and perhaps the most striking difference, is in the mode of birth, one large
                    division being separated from the body of the female parent in a state of
                    complete life, and therefore denominated viviparous; the other being detached in
                    the form of an <hi rend="italic">ovum</hi> or egg, which, though possessed of
                    the elements of life, is not yet endowed with it, and requires for the full
                    developement of that principle the assiduous care of the parent. This
                    difference, however obvious, is more apparent than real. In viviparous birth the
                    foetus or new animal remains attached to the inner surface of the womb by means
                    of nutrient bl∞d-vessels, and is enveloped in membranes, which correspond very
                    accurately to the coverings of the <hi rend="italic">ova</hi> of oviparous
                    animals. The rupture of these membranes at the moment of birth or detachment
                    from the body of the parent is the only circumstance which constitutes a
                    material difference between viviparous and oviparous generation. The viviparous
                    animals, nevertheless, are further distinguished by nursing their offspring by
                    means of teats or <hi rend="italic">mamrnae,</hi> glands destined for separating
                    from the mass of blood the oleo-albuminous fluid denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >milk.</hi></p>
                <p>A still more important source of distinction among the vertebrated animals is
                    found in the disposition of the vascular organs destined for respiration. The
                    blood, which proceeds from the heart by the distributing tubes or arteries to
                    the different organs, thereby undergoes a certain change, in consequence of
                    which it is no longer capable of answering the several purposes of nutrition,
                    secretion, &amp;c. which are necessary to the maintenance of the animal body in
                    the healthy state. To fit it once more for these purposes, the blood, in whole
                    or in part, is, by means of the veins, brought back to the heart, and thence
                    conveyed by means of a system of arborescent tubes to the surface of an organ,
                    where it is, through the interposition of a thin membrane, exposed more or less
                    freely to the atmospheric air. When it is exposed directly to this fluid
                    introduced into the body by means of a single tube divided into ramifying
                    branches, the respiratory organ is denominated <hi rend="italic">lungs.</hi>
                    When the blood, on the other hand, is exposed to atmospheric air by means of
                    water, which passes over a pectiniform organ, the latter is denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">gills.</hi> Respiration varies, therefore, according as the
                    structure of the organ allows the whole or part of the blood to be exposed to
                    air, and according as this exposure is direct or indirect.</p>
                <p>Taken together, these circumstances may be viewed as the integrant or constituent
                    elements of the quantity, extent, or degree of respiration, which conversely,
                    indeed, depends on two circumstances,—the quantity of blood present in the
                    respiratory organ at any given moment, and the relative quantity of oxygen in
                    the respired fluid.</p>
                <p>The organs of circulation may be double, so that the whole mass of blood which is
                    brought by the veins from the remote parts must circulate in the respiratory
                    organ before it is again distributed by the arteries ;—or they may be single, so
                    that one portion only of the regredient blood is made to pass through the
                    respiratory organ, while the residue is distributed by the arteries without
                    undergoing this circulation. Of this mode of respiration an example is given by
                    the class of animals denominated <hi rend="italic">Reptiles;</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Reptilia</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">;</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Animalia Repentia)</hi>; in which the heart is so constructed that only part of
                    the blood is conveyed to the lungs, and in which, consequently, the amount or
                    degree of respiration, and the concomitant qualities, vary according to the
                    proportion of this fluid which goes to the lungs at each pulsation.</p>
                <p>In Fishes, on the other hand, though the circulation is two-fold, that is,
                    distributory by means of arteries, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039000?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9000-0707"/> regredient by
                    means of veins, the respiratory organ is formed for respiration through the
                    medium of Water, and the blood thus exposed to air receives the influence of
                    that only which is mingled or held in solution by the water. Their extent of
                    respiration is therefore supposed to be less than that of reptiles, by reason of
                    the imperfect exposure to the operation of the air. Their respiration may be
                    termed <hi rend="italic">hydro-aerial.</hi></p>
                <p>In mammiferous animals, again, though the circulation is two-fold, or
                    distributory and regredient, the respiration is single, or confined to the lungs
                    only. Their extent of respiration is' therefore superior to that of the
                    reptiles, by reason of the shape of their circulatory organs, and to that of
                    fishes by reason of the nature of the element in which they live. Their
                    respiration is <hi rend="italic">aerial.</hi></p>
                <p>In another class of vertebrated animals, however, respiration assumes a form
                    still more perfect and extensive, since not only is the circulation two-fold,
                    and the respiration aerial, as in the <hi rend="italic">mammalia,</hi> but their
                    structure is such that the air of the trachea communicates with other cavities,
                    especially those of the bones, and surrounds the branches of the aorta as
                    completely as it does those of the pulmonary artery. The effect of this
                    arrangement with regard to the ambient atmosphere is at once to render these
                    animals specifically lighter, and enable them to support themselves in the air,
                    and to restore and change the regredient or venous blood so completely, that
                    when again distributed it may impart to the various organs the highest degree of
                    energy of which they are susceptible.</p>
                <p>From these characters a division of vertebrated animals may be formed in the
                    following manner. 1sZ, Quadrupeds, in which the extent of respiration is
                    moderate, and which are distinguished for walking or running, or other muscular
                    exertion with strength; 2&lt;rf, Birds, in which the extent of respiration is
                    the greatest possible, and is connected with the levity of substance and energy
                    of muscle requisite for flight; 3√, Reptiles, in which the small extent of
                    respiration is connected with languor of motion and occasional seasons of
                    torpor; and, 4∆4, Fishes, in which the still more limited form of the
                    respiratory organ requires a fluid of nearly equal specific weight to their own
                    bodies to enable them to move with facility. These characters are necessarily
                    general; but they are so essential, that between them and the other
                    circumstances of organization proper to each class, and especially those
                    relating to motion and sensation, a necessary relation exists.</p>
                <p>To the quadrupeds, mammiferous animals, or viviparous vertebrated animals, which
                    form the first of these great classes, this place belongs, not only by the mode
                    of generation and respiration, but by the more perfect form of the animal
                    functions, and the higher degree of intelligence which their habits and actions
                    indicate. They are less under the influence of that blind animal propensity
                    denominated instinct, which, like the properties of inorganic matter, seems to
                    operate regularly and uniformly, independent either of sensation or
                    volition.</p>
                <p>This class of animals is distinguished by great uniformity and regularity of
                    structure and organization. In all of them the upper jaw forms part of the
                    cranium; and upon this the lower jaw, consisting of two pieces only, articulated
                    by a prominent condyle to the temporal bone, is made to move. The neck consists
                    of seven, and, in one species only, of nine vertebrae; to the sternum are
                    attached certain of the ribs, therefore named <hi rend="italic"
                    >sterno-vertel&gt;ral</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the thoracic extremity is
                    supported by a flat bone named shoulderblade <hi rend="italic">(scapula,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ωμοπλάτη),</hi> not articulated, but simply suspended in the
                    muscles, and in some species supported on the sternum by an intermediate bone,
                    named collar-bone or clavicle <hi rend="italic">(clavicula,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">×λη</hi> ∣ <hi rend="italic">ς)</hi>; in all excepting the <hi
                    rend="italic">cetacea</hi> or whale-like animals, the first part of the pelvic

                    bones, the <hi rend="italic">os ilium,</hi> which is attached to the spine, the
                    <hi rend="italic">os pubis,</hi> which constitutes the anterior or abdominal
                    part of the pelvis, and the <hi rend="italic">os ischium,</hi> which constitutes
                    the most remote lateral portions of the pelvis. At the point of junction of
                    these three bones on each side is a spherical cavity, in which the articular
                    head of the thigh-bone is lodged.</p>
                <p>The scull, articulated by two prominent convex surfaces with the first vertebra,
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">atlas,</hi> may be represented as consisting of
                    three annular portions, an anterior formed by the frontal and ethmoid bones, a
                    middle by the parietal and sphenoid bones, and a posterior by the occipital
                    bone; the temporal bones, which are common to the face and scull, being
                    interposed between the sphenoid, the occipital, and the parietal bones.</p>
                <p>The face is formed essentially by the superior and inferior maxillary bones.
                    Between the former is the cavity of the nostrils above, separated by the azygos
                    bone named <hi rend="italic">vomer</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> before are the
                    intermaxillary bones, and behind are the two palate bones. The entrance of the

                    cavity are attached the inferior turbinated bones, so as to cover partially the
                    entrance into the maxillary sinus.</p>
                <p>The brain consists of two similar hemispherical halves, united by a white mass,
                    fibrous, especially in the transverse direction, named mesolobe, middle-band, or

                    each other, and with a third situate on the mesial plane, and extending by a
                    narrow canal to a fourth situate between the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata.</hi> The proper matter of the cerebral
                    and cerebellic hemispheres is united on the mesial plane in a mass named <hi

                    the lower surface of which is marked by transverse fibres, while the upper is
                    moulded into four roundish eminences named <hi rend="italic">nates</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">testes,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quadrigemina.</hi></p>
                <p>In the eye, lodged in a cavity of the cranium named orbit, and provided with two
                    eye-lids and the vestige of a third, the crystalline lens is fixed by the
                    ciliary processes; and the sclerotic, though firm, is cellular. The ear consists
                    of a cavity named <hi rend="italic">tympanum,</hi> closed externally by a
                    membrane, and containing four minute but articulated and movable bones; an oval
                    cavity or vestibule, in the orifice of which, one of these bones, the <hi
                    rend="italic">stapes,</hi> is fixed, and which communicates with three
                    semi-circular canals; and, lastly, a spiral and tapering cavity, termed <hi
                    rend="italic">cochlea,</hi> parted by a thin plate into two spiral canals, one
                    of which communicates with the tympanum, the other with the vestibule. The
                    tongue is fleshy, and is supported by a joαrα6oZα-shaped bone, attached to the
                    cranium by ligaments, and to the larynx by membranes.</p>
                <p>The lungs, in number two, consisting of numerous tubular canals, proceeding from
                    the windpipe, and terminating in an infinity of minute intersecting canals,
                    named cells or vesicles, are inclosed without attachment, in a cavity formed by
                    the ribs on each side, the diaphragm abdominally, and on the mesial plane by a
                    membranous partition named mediastinum, and lined all over by a thin transparent
                    membrane; <hi rend="italic">(pleura).</hi> At the guttural extremity of the
                    windpipe is placed a particular apparatus, formed of cartilages put in motion by
                    muscles, and which serves at once to regulate the quantity of air admitted into
                    the tube, and to form the voice. This is named the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039013?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9013-0708"/> larynx. A
                    membranous fleshy production, suspended from the palate bones like a veil or
                    valve, also moved at the will of the animal, establishes a direct communication
                    between the larynx and the posterior nostrils.</p>
                <p>The intestinal canal is suspended to a duplicature of the peritoneum, named
                    mesentery, between the folds of which the blood-vessels, nerves, lymphatics, and
                    lymphatic glands pertaining to the canal, are lodged. The peritoneum, after
                    passing over the intestines, forms a similar duplicature, which in the manner of
                    a prolongation hangs freely before them.</p>
                <p>The urine, after secretion by the kidneys, is retained for a time shorter or
                    longer in a distensible musculo-membranous bladder, and is expelled at various
                    periods by a canal which opens, with few exceptions, in common with that of the
                    organs of generation.</p>
                <p>. The latter function is, in all the mammiferous animals, essentially viviparous.
                    The ovum, consisting of the foetus and the enveloping membranes, immediately
                    after conception is conveyed by appropriate tubes into the womb, to the inner
                    surface of which it is attached by one or more plexiform clusters of vessels
                    named <hi rend="italic">placentoe,</hi> and which furnish the blood requisite to
                    the nourishment of the new body. In the earliest periods of uterine life,
                    however, the mammiferous animals present a bladder or <hi rend="italic"
                    >vesicula</hi> (vitellar membrane), analogous to that which contains the yolk of
                    the oviparous animals, and receiving also mesenteric vessels.</p>
                <p>The peculiar mode in which viviparous animals nurse their offspring has been
                    already noticed as that which distinguishes them particularly from the other
                    three divisions of vertebrated animals.</p>
                <p>Another character peculiar to this class, are the hairs with which their
                    integuments are provided, and which, though analogous to the feathers or quills
                    of birds,are nevertheless so characteristic, that they cannot be properly
                    omitted in this enumeration. They are found in all mammiferous animals except
                    the cetacea, in which marine residence is supposed to render them less
                    necessary. Lastly, the blood of the mammalia is said to differ from that of
                    oviparous animals in the shape of the coloured particles. In the former they are
                    represented as lenticular, or of the shape of flat or oblate spheroids; in the
                    latter they are ovoidal, or like oblong spheroids.</p>
                <p>The mammiferous animals may be subdivided into subordinate groups or orders,
                    according to certain natural characters in organization, which imply again
                    peculiarities of habit and mode of life. These characters are derived from the
                    organs of touch or prehension, on which depends their degree of ability or
                    address; and from the organs of mastication, which always bear a certain
                    relation to the nature of the food on which the individual animal subsists.</p>
                <p>The delicacy of the organ of touch depends on the number and mobility of the
                    toes, and on the extent to which their tips are enveloped in nail or hoof. The
                    latter, enveloping entirely the part of the foot which touches the ground,
                    impairs sensation, and renders the foot or paw incapable of prehension. When, on
                    the contrary, a single plate of nail covers one of the surfaces of the tip of
                    the toe, it not only leaves the other all its natural nicety of touch, but gives
                    each toe that free and unembarrassed motion which enables the animal to seize
                    and hold by the claws.</p>
                <p>The nature of the aliment used by animals bears a relation to.the teeth, with the
                    form of which, again, the articulation of the jaws corresponds. To divide flesh,
                    incisive teeth, like a saw, and jaws mutually opposed, like the blades of
                    scissors, which simply open and shut, are requisite. In order to break grains or
                    roots, teeth with a flat crown, ’ and jaws admitting of horizontal motion, are
                    required. The crowns of these teeth must further be unequal or tuberculated,
                    like the surface of a mill-stone, and their substance must be unequally firm,
                    since certain parts are more exposed to attrition than others.</p>
                <p>All hoofed animals are necessarily herbivorous, or have flat-crowned teeth, since
                    their feet do not allow them to seize living prey. Unguiculated animals, again,
                    are susceptible of greater variety in the shape of the teeth, and their aliment
                    depends on the mobility and delicacy of their toes. One character of this
                    description, which exercises great influence on their address, and multiplies
                    their means of industry, is the faculty of opposing the great toe to the others,
                    or the thumb to the fingers,— a circumstance which essentially constitutes what
                    is termed the hand, and which is carried to its highest perfection in the case
                    of man, in whom the pectoral extremity is entirely free and susceptible of every
                    mode of prehension.</p>
                <p>The several combinations now mentioned furnish characters for distinguishing the
                    mammalia into the following orders.</p>

                <p>Of these subdivisions, the first three orders are known by the common character
                    of possessing all the three varieties of teeth, molar, canine, and incisive.
                    They differ from each other in the possession of complete hands on the thoracic
                    extremities, of imperfect hands on the four extremities, and in the want of
                    thumb or opposable toe on the four extremities. The fourth order is peculiar in
                    wanting canine teeth, and having incisors constructed for gnawing. In the fifth
                    the toes are much constrained in motion, being sunk in large claws; and the
                    incisors are wanting. Some genera want the canine teeth, and some are void of
                    teeth entirely.</p>
                <p>This distribution of unguiculated animals would be complete, and would form a
                    regular series, were it not interrupted by a small lateral series from New
                    Holland, the native soil of the Marsupial animals. Of these, it is the peculiar
                    distinction, that while some of their genera correspond to the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> others to the RoDENTJA,and a third set to the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> in the form of teeth and nature<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039026?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9026-0709"/> of
                    food, all of them agree in the common character of having a large sac or purse
                    <hi rend="italic">(marsupium)</hi> for retaining some time after birth their
                    offspring, which are detached from the body of the parent in a state of
                    imperfection, corresponding nearly to the foetus of other mammiferous animals
                    shortly after conception. ∙</p>
                <p>In the series of hoofed animals, which are less numerous, less irregularity is
                    also observed. The order of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminant</hi> animals is well
                    distinguished by cloven feet, the absence of incisors in the upper jaw, and the
                    quadruple stomach, or that with four compartments. The other hoofed quadrupeds
                    maybe unitedin one order, distinguished by the absence of the ruminating
                    stomach, and a peculiar density of integuments, from which they are named <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Paciiydermata.</hi> The elephant alone constitutes a distinct
                    family, and is allied, by the form and mechanism of the teeth, with the family
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi> A third family of hoofed quadrupeds is
                    distinguished by one apparent toe and one hoof in each foot; though beneath the
                    skin, on each side of the <hi rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">metatarsus,</hi> are prominences corresponding to lateral toes.
                    This small family <hi rend="smallcaps">(Solidipeda)</hi> includes the horse,
                    ass, zebra, and quagga.</p>
                <p>Lastly, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetaceous</hi> or whale-like animals form a
                    family by themselves, so peculiar, that though viviparous and mammiferous, they
                    might readily be regarded as belonging to the class of fishes. Their
                    organization, however, immediately shows their proper place in the
                    classification; and even the fact observed by the ancients, that, though
                    pisciform, they have warm blood, demonstrates their title to the character of
                    Mammalia.</p>
                <p>Man, who, as the most perfect specimen of mammiferous animal with which we are
                    acquainted, is placed at the head of this class, partakes of the general
                    characters of structure and function belonging to the class, and possesses also
                    certain peculiarities by which he is distinguished. The study of the facts of
                    the former description belongs properly to Comparative or Animal Anatomy. That
                    of the latter constitutes Human Anatomy proper. It is, however, expedient to
                    waive this distinction, and trace the anatomical history of the human body,
                    without supposing the reader already minutely acquainted with the structure of
                    mammiferous animals in general. In the course of this description, however, it
                    is requisite to recur frequently to the lower animals, and to derive from them
                    information more or less direct, tending to illustrate the structure of the
                    human subject.</p>
                <p>The external appearance of the human frame it is superfluous to describe
                    minutely. Naturalists distinguish man as a bimanous and biped animal, or as one
                    possessing two complete hands, and supporting himself in the vertical position
                    by the two pelvic extremities. These characters are neither arbitrary nor
                    unessential. Both depend on invariable peculiarities of structure; and whatever
                    attempts have been made by men, more distinguished for ingenious paradox than
                    accurate observation, to show that man was naturally quadruped, are readily
                    refuted by appealing to the anatomical configuration and disposition of the four
                    members, and their relation to the trunk.</p>
                <p>Another character of the human subject is the globular or rather spheroidal shape
                    of the skull, and its large size in proportion to the rest of the frame, with
                    the general tendency of the plane of the faee to the vertical direction. In no
                    other mammiferous animal does the head make so near an approach to the
                    spheroidal shape; and in no other is the plane of the face so nearly vertical.
                    In the other Mammalia, the skull is angular-oblong, and the face acquires a
                    peculiar character, which is readily ascribed to the lower animals by the
                    extreme projection of the mouth, or, in other words, by the length to which the
                    two jaws are prolonged. Even in the monkey tribe, the similitude of which to the
                    human face was remarked by the poet Ennius, this remarkable character is by no
                    means lost; and the upper and lower jaws make a much more conspicuous projection
                    than in the human skull.</p>
                <p>The great characteristic of the human race, however, is articulate or oral
                    speech, which, combined with the perfect developement of which the mental
                    faculties are susceptible, constitutes a very wide distinction between man and
                    the lower animals. The latter possess what may be termed laryngeal voice, or
                    that which is formed in the larynx. To man is superadded the faculty of
                    articulate speech by means of the lips, tongue, and teeth.</p>
                <p>All the known individuals of the human species, though agreeing in the possession
                    of the general characters now enumerated, and therefore to be regarded as
                    unigenous, or of one general family, differ nevertheless by certain
                    peculiarities in external characters, which have been supposed sufficient to
                    justify the separation into individual races or breeds. Of these, three appear
                    to be very distinct, the <hi rend="smallcaps">White</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Caucasan,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Tawny</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mongolian,</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Negro</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ethiopian</hi>; and to one or other of these all the various forms which the
                    human body assumes in different climates and countries may be referred.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Caucasan</hi> race is distinguished by the oval shape of
                    the head, the softened aspect, and symmetrical harmony of the general person,
                    and the high degree of cultivation of which the intellectual faculties admit.
                    The colour of the skin and of the hair varies. In warm climates the former is
                    dark or olive-coloured, and the latter is black and glossy. In colder regions
                    the skin is fair and light-coloured, or ruddy, and the hair becomes chesnut,
                    fair, or even red.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Mongolian</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Altaic</hi> race
                    is distinguished by prominent cheek-bones, flat countenance, oblique eyes,
                    parted by a small interval, straight black hair, slender beard, and olive,
                    tawny, or copper-coloured complexion. This race has formed great empires in
                    China and Japan, and has sometimes extended its conquests beyond the Great
                    Desert; but its civilisation has remained stationary.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Negro</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ethiopian</hi> race
                    is confined to the south of the Atlas. Black complexion, crisp woolly hair,
                    compressed skull, and flat nose, prominent mouth, and large thick or everted
                    lips, form its distinguishing external characters. The tribes of which it
                    consists have ever remained barbarous.</p>
                <p>The first of these races, from which Europe, Asia, and the north and east of
                    Africa have been peopled, is denominated <hi rend="smallcaps">Caucasan,</hi>
                    because tradition and the natural affinity of nations seem to justify the
                    opinion that this race had originally inhabited the mountainous range between
                    the Caspian and Black Seas, from which it has spread by radiation. In
                    confirmation of this, it may be observed that the tribes of the Caucasus, the
                    Circassians, the Georgians, and the Armenians, afford at the present hour the
                    most perfect and beautiful specimens of the human form. This race may be
                    distinguished, by the analogy of languages spoken by them, into three principal
                    branches.</p>
                <p>1. The Aramaean or Syrian branch, proceeding to the south, gave birth to the
                    Assyrians, the Chaldeans, the Arabs ever unsubdued, and who, after Mahomet,
                    aspired at the sovereignty of the world; the Phoenicians, the Jews, the
                    Abessins, colonies of the Arabs, and probably the Egyptian or Koptic race. From
                    this first branch, ever prone to mysticism, the most extended forms of religious
                    belief have issued. Science and literature, occasionally flourishing among them,
                    have, nevertheless, beep always disguised or corrupted by fanciful ceremonials
                    and a style highly figurative.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039039?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9039-0710"/>
                <p>2. The Indian, German, and Pelasgic branch was mueh earlier divided into tribes,
                    and much more extensively diffused. The most numerous affinities may
                    nevertheless be traced between its four principal languages,— the Sanscrit, at
                    present the sacred language of the Hindoos, and the parent of all the dialects
                    of Hindostan; the ancient language of the Pelasgi, the common parent of the
                    Greek, the Latin, of many extinct languages, and of all the present dialects of
                    southern Europe; the Gothic or Tudesc, from which are derived the languages of
                    the north and north-west, for instance the German, Dutch, Anglo-Saxon, and
                    English, the Danish, Swedish, and their dialects; lastly, the Sclavonian, from
                    which are sprung the languages of the north-east, the Russ, the Polish, the
                    Bohemian, and the Vend.</p>
                <p>By this branch of the Caucasan race, philosophy, the sciences, and the arts, have
                    been carried to the highest degree of perfection; and of these they may be
                    regarded as the chief depositaries. In Europe this race is believed to have been
                    preceded by the <hi rend="italic">Celtae</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >Titano-</hi><hi rend="italic">Celtae,</hi> whose tribes, proceeding by the
                    north, and formerly very extensive, were nevertheless confined to the most
                    western points; and by the Cantabrians, who passed from Africa to Spain, and who
                    are now almost lost among the numerous nations, the posterity of which is
                    mingled in the European peninsula. The ancient Persians are derived from the
                    same source as the Indians; and their descendants still bear the most
                    conspicuous marks of connection with the European nations.</p>
                <p>3. The Scythian and Tartar branch, bending first to the north and north-east,
                    ahvays erratic in the immense plains of these countries, have returned only to
                    ravage the happier establishments of their brethren. From this branch issued the
                    Scythians, who anciently distinguished themselves by inroads into Upper Asia;
                    the Parthians, who destroyed the Greek and Roman dominions; the Turks, who
                    subverted that of the Arabs, and subdued in Europe the last remnant of the
                    Hellenic nation. The Fins and Hungarians are tribes of the same family
                    disseminated among the Sclavonian and Judaic nations. The north and east of the
                    Caspian, their native soil, still maintains tribes which have the same origin
                    and speak similar languages; but they are intermingled with numerous other small
                    septs of different origin and speech. The Tartar tribes remained more unchanged
                    in that tract from which they long threatened Russia, which has at length
                    subdued them, from the mouths of the Danube to beyond the Irtish. Their blood,
                    nevertheless, has been mixed with that of the Mongols, many traces of which may
                    be seen in the younger Tartars.</p>
                <p>On the east of this Tartar branch of the Caucasan race begins the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mongolian,</hi> which thence extends to the shores of the
                    Eastern Ocean. Its branches, still nomadic, the Calmucks and the Kalkas, roam
                    the Great Desert. Three times have their ancestors, under Attila, Gengĩs, and
                    Timour, spread the terror of their name among the settled inhabitants of Europe
                    and Asia. The Chinese constitute the branch most early civilized, not only of
                    this race, but of known nations. The Mantchoux, a third branch, who recently
                    conquered, still retain, China. To the same race in great part belong the
                    Japanese and the Coreans, and almost all the hordes which stretch to the north
                    of Siberia, under the sway of the Russians. Excepting some learned Chinese, the
                    whole Mongolian race are attached to the sects addicted to the worship of
                    Fo.</p>
                <p>The origin of this great race appears to be in the mountaiņs of the Altaic range,
                    as that of the Asio-Euro-pean is in the elevation of Caucasus. It is impossible,
                    however, to trace the filiation of its branches with the same accuracy. The
                    history of these nomadic nations is as transitory as their establishments; and
                    that of the, Chinese, confined to the bosom of their empire, furnishes only
                    short and unconnected views of the contiguous nations. The affinities of their
                    modes of speech are further too little known to guide us in this labyrinth.</p>
                <p>The languages spoken in the north of the Ultra-Gan-getic peninsula, as well as
                    that of Thibet, present some relations, at least in monosyllabic character, with
                    the Chinese; and the nations by whom they are spoken are not void of features of
                    physical resemblance to the other Mongolian tribes. The south of this peninsula,
                    however, is inhabited by the Malays, a much handsomer race, whose breed and
                    language have spread to the coasts of all the islands of the Indian Archipelago,
                    and have occupied the greater number of those of the South Sea. In the largest
                    of the former, especially in the wildest places, dwell other tribes, with crisp
                    hair, black complexion, and negro features, all extremely barbarous. The best
                    known are denominated Papous, which may be applied to the whole.</p>
                <p>Neither the Malays nor the Papous can be readily referred to any one of the three
                    great races. The former it is difficult to distinguish from the neighbouring
                    races on each side the Caucasan Indians and the Mongolian Chinese. The Papous
                    may be negroes anciently cast away in the Indian Seas; but to determine this
                    point we require both accurate figures and descriptions.</p>
                <p>The inhabitants of the north of the two continents, the Samoieds, the Laplanders,
                    and the Esquimaux, spring, according to some, from the Mongolian breed;
                    according to others, they are degenerate slips of the Scythian and Tartar branch
                    of the Caucasan breed.</p>
                <p>The Americans have not yet been clearly traced either to one or other of the
                    races of the ancient continent; yet they are void of character sufficiently
                    precise and constant to constitute a peculiar race: their copper-coloured skin
                    is inadequate: by the dark hair and slender beard they approach to the Mongols;
                    but from these again they are distinguished by the well-marked features and the
                    prominent nose. The modes of speech are as numerous as their tribes; and neither
                    between themselves nor with those of the ancient world has any satisfactory
                    analogy been traced.</p>
                <p>Of the various breeds now enumerated, the Caucasan or Asio-European is supposed
                    to furnish the most perfect model of the human frame; and from this, therefore,
                    anatomists derive their descriptions both of the body at large and of individual
                    parts and organs.</p>
                <p>The structure of the human body may be studied in two modes, either as an
                    assemblage of organic substances endowed with characteristic physical and vital
                    properties, or as an assemblage of organs destined to effect particular and
                    definite purposes.</p>
                <p>The human body, like that of every other mammiferous animal, consists of several
                    kinds of animal organic substances endowed with appropriate characters and
                    properties. The substances thus distinguished have been named <hi rend="italic"
                    >elementary textures,</hi> since into them, as into so many elements or
                    integrant principles, the human body is supposed capable of being resolved. To
                    enumerate tlιese elementary textures, to ascertain their minute structure or
                    organization, to investigate their distinctive properties, and to determine the
                    extent to which they enter into the composition of particular organs, is the
                    province of <hi rend="smallcaps">General Anatomy.</hi> In this department the
                    anatomist, abstracting from the shape, position, and mechanical configuration of
                    parts, studies only their intimate and distinctive characters as organic
                    substances.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039052?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9052-0711"/>
                <p>The human body may further be regarded as an assemblage of organs, and sets of
                    organs, destined to effect certain purposes. These purposes may be referred to
                    two general heads; those which are common to plants and animals, and those which
                    are proper to the latter. The first comprehends nutrition and generation, and
                    have been named vital, organic, or automatic functions; the second embraces
                    muscular action, sensation, and nervous influence or innervation, and are
                    distinguished as animal functions. Since these purposes are effected by certain
                    processes going on successively and simultaneously by the action of one or more
                    organs, they are distinguished by the general name of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >functions,</hi> or orders of functions. Each function consists of several
                    integrant and individual processes; every process consists of one or more
                    actions; each action depends on certain properties; and properties in living
                    bodies, though mechanical, chemical, or vital, are always connected either with
                    the intimate structure of parts or with the configuration of organs. Thus
                    nutrition is at once termed a function, and is said to consist of the several
                    functions of digestion, absorption, circulation, respiration, and secretion.
                    Generation, on the other hand, is said to be a function consisting of several
                    processes—the formation of germs or <hi rend="italic">ova,</hi> the secretion of
                    semen, impregnation, gestation, and exclusion. Of the functions proper to
                    animals, muscular action, modified in various modes, produces locomotion,
                    gesture, voice, and several motions necessary to the performance of nutrition
                    and generation. Sensation may be said in all cases to depend on nervous action
                    and the mechanism peculiar to each species of sensation. Nervous energy, again,
                    may be said to consist of three properties, those of receiving, transmitting,
                    and recognising impressions. Lastly, a form of faculties connected with the
                    immaterial or thinking part of the system peculiar to man constitutes what are
                    named the intellectual functions.</p>
                <p>This division of the phenomena of living bodies into certain assemblages or
                    functions, has given rise to a similar division of these bodies into organs. An
                    organ may be defined to be a part of a living body, of a definite shape,
                    consisting of certain parts, composed of various elementary textures, the seat
                    of one or more actions, and placed in a certain position and region. It rarely
                    happens that one organ only is sufficient for the performance of a function.
                    Several are commonly required to concur to the same general purpose; and henee
                    the organs are arranged in classes, sets, or assemblages, according to the
                    functions to which they are subservient. Thus the organs subservient to the
                    function of digestion consist of the teeth, tongue, and mouth, as organs of
                    mastication; the pharynx and oesophagus as the tube of deglutition; the stomach
                    as the organ of chymification; the duodenum and small intestines as that of
                    chylification; and the large intestines as the temporary receptacle of the
                    exerementi-tial residue of food and drink. Such assemblages of organs have
                    received, for want of better, the denomination of apparatuses; and the
                    anatomist, when he designates a class of organs devoted to the performance of a
                    specific function, is compelled to distinguish them as the apparatus of
                    digestion, the apparatus of absorption, of circulation, of respiration, of
                    secretion, and so forth. To this method of distinction it may indeed be
                    objected, that scarcely in one instance are all the organs of any apparatus
                    exclusively directed to the performance of the function of that apparatus; and
                    an organ concerned in the function of digestion may also contribute to that of
                    circulation or respiration. Thus the larynx, though more particularly the organ
                    of voice, is also an organ of respiration; the tongue and teeth, though
                    belonging in one sense to the organs of digestion, are not less important as
                    those of speech; the diaphragm and abdominal muscles, though organs of
                    respiration, are also accessary agents of digestion. These, however, are only to
                    be regarded as examples of the ingenuity with which one organ in the animal body
                    is made to answer several purposes; and since all arrangements are artificial,
                    or bear relation, not to the purpose of construction, but to the mind of the
                    observer, the best course is to choose that which is least so, and which makes
                    the nearest approach to the apparent objects of nature.</p>
                <p>To acquire a just knowledge of the organs of the human body, with the views now
                    stated, it is requisite to study their external shape and configuration, their
                    position and contiguous relations, their ordinary size and dimensions, the
                    mechanical divisions of which they consist, their external characters and
                    physical properties, their intimate structure and the elementary textures of
                    which they are composed, their chemical constitution, their vital properties and
                    consequent actions, and the uses to which they are obviously applied. The
                    history of the organs, arranged upon these principles, constitutes the business
                    of <hi rend="smallcaps">Descriptive, Particular,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Special Anatomy.</hi> The term <hi rend="italic">Topographical Anatomy,</hi>
                    which has also been proposed, is inadequate, since it indicates one class only
                    of facts,—those belonging to local relations. That of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Morphology</hi> is equally objectionable. The term <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organology,</hi> though preferable by reason of greater generality, is not
                    sufficiently appropriate to justify its adoption, to the exclusion of the one
                    already in general use.</p>
                <p>GENERAL ANATOMY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> human body consists of solid and fluid substances,
                    the former of which are organized, and determine the shape of the body and its
                    parts. These organized solids are not in a strict physical sense solid and
                    impenetrable. Most of them are soft, compressible, and elastic, by reason of the
                    fluid matter contained in their interstices; and when deprived of this by
                    desiccation, they shrink in various degrees, and lose both bulk and weight. The
                    general ratio of the fluid to the solid parts has been already stated to vary
                    from 7 to 1, to 9 to 1. An adult carcass weighing perhaps from 9 to 10 stones,
                    has been reduced by desiccation to 7⅜ lbs. In short, a human body may be reduced
                    to nearly the weight of its skeleton, which varies from 150 ounces =9⅜ lbs. to
                    200 ounces = 12 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 2</hi>
                    lbs.</p>
                <p>These organized solids agree in the possession of certain general characters.
                    Their internal structure appears to consist of a union of solid and liquid
                    matter, which is observed to exude in drops more or less abundant from the
                    surface of sections. The solid parts are generally arranged in the form of
                    collateral lines, sometimes oblique, sometimes perfectly parallel, sometimes
                    mutually intersecting. Such lines are denominated <hi rend="italic">fibres,</hi>
                    and occasionally <hi rend="italic">filaments.</hi> In other instances the solids
                    are observed to consist of minute globular or spheroidaI particles, connected
                    generally by delicate filaments. Most of these solids anatomists and
                    miscroscopical observers have attempted to resolve into what they conceive to be
                    an ultimate fibre or last element; but this inquiry leads beyond the bounds of
                    strict observation.</p>
                <p>Most of the solids may be demonstrated to be penetrated<pb break="no"

                    ramifying tubes or blood-vessels, which traverse their substance in every
                    direction, and in which is contained the greater part, perhaps the whole, of the
                    fluid matter found in the solids. In a few in which ramifying vessels cannot be
                    positively demonstrated, their existence is inferred by analogy from those in
                    which they can. The filamentous, fibrous, or globular arrangement, with the
                    distribution of arborescent vessels, constitutes organization. The substances so
                    constructed are named <hi rend="italic">organized tissues (teloe,</hi><hi

                <p>The organized solids also resemble each other in chemical constitution. They may
                    be resolved into proximate principles, either the same or very closely allied.
                    The proximate principles most generally found are albumen, fibrin, and gelatine,
                    one or other of which, sometimes more, form the basis of every tissue of the
                    human body. Next to these are mucus, and oily or adipose matter. Osma-zome or
                    extractive matter is mund in certain tissues. And lastly, several saline
                    substances, as phosphate of lime, carbonate of lime, soda, hydrochlorate of
                    soda, are found in variable proportions in most of them. Of these principles
                    albumen and fibrin, which are closely allied and pass into each other, are the
                    most common and abundant. Osmazome, which is probably a modification of fibrin,
                    is less frequent. These also are contained in the blood, and probably derived
                    from that fluid. Gelatine, though not found in the blood, is nevertheless a
                    principle of extensive distribution, being found in skin, cellular tissue,
                    tendon, cartilage, and bone. These proximate principles are resolved, in
                    ultimate analysis, into carbon, oxygen, hydrogen, azote, phosphorus, and
                    sulphur. From the saline substances, calcium, potassium, sodium, chlorine, iron,
                    and manganese may be obtained.</p>
                <p>The organized solids which enter into the composition of the human body, though
                    agreeing in the characters now mentioned, differ nevertheless in other respects.
                    The most remarkable differences of this kind consist in peculiarities in the
                    arrangement of their constituent fibres, peculiarities in the nature of these
                    fibres, and different proportions or modifications of their proximate chemical
                    principles. From one or other of these circumstances the organized solids may be
                    referred to the following 17 elementary tissues:—Filamentous or cellular tissue,
                    including ordinary cellular membrane and adipose membrane; artery, vein, with
                    their minute communications, termed capillary vessels, and the erectile vessels;
                    lymphatic vessel, and gland; nerve, plexus, and ganglion; brain, or cerebral
                    matter; muscle; white fibrous system, including ligament, periosteum, and
                    fascia; yellow fibrous system, including the yellow ligaments, &amp;c. bone and
                    tooth; gristle or cartilage; fibro∙∙cartilage; skin; mucous membrane; serous
                    membrane; synovial membrane; and lastly, glandular structure, or the peculiar
                    matter which forms the liver, the pancreas, the kidneys, the female breast, the
                    testicle, and other organs termed glands.</p>
                <p>These tissues may be distinguished into orders, according to the mode of their
                    distribution in the animal frame. Several, for instance filamentous tissue,
                    artery and vein, lymphatic vessel, and nerve, are most extensively distributed,
                    and enter into the composition of all the other simple tissues. To these,
                    therefore, which are named by Bichat general or generating systems, the
                    character of <hi rend="italic">textures of distribution</hi> may be applied. A
                    second order, consisting of substances confined to particular regions and
                    organs, and placed in determinate situations, viz. brain, muscle, white fibrous
                    system, yellow fibrous system, bone, cartilage, fibro-cartilage, and gland, may
                    be denominated <hi rend="italic">particular tissues.</hi> To a third order,
                    consisting of substances which assume the form of a thin membrane, expanded over
                    many different tissues and organs, may be referred skin, mucous membrane, serous
                    membrane, and synovial membrane, under the denomination of <hi rend="italic"
                    >enveloping tissues.</hi> It may indeed be objected, that the circumstance of
                    mechanical disposition is insufficient to communicate a distinctive or
                    appropriate character, and several of the tissues referred to the second head,
                    <hi rend="italic">e. g. fascia,</hi> must, on this principle, be referred to the
                    third. The objection is not unreasonable. But it may be answered, that it is
                    almost vain to expect an arrangement entirely faultless; and the present is
                    convenient in being on the whole more natural, and therefore more easily
                    remembered, than any other. A distinct idea of it may be formed from the
                    following tabular view.</p>

                <p>The fluids of the animal body are various, but may be distinguished into three
                    sorts; the circulating nutritious fluid named the blood, the fluids which are
                    incessantly mixed with the blood for its renewal, and those which are separated
                    from it by secretion.</p>
                <p>The blood is well known to be a viscid liquid, of red colour, peculiar odour, and
                    saline, something nauseous taste. Its temperature in the living body is about
                    97°; its specific gravity is about 105 to water as 100. Its quantity is in the
                    adult considerable, varying from 8 or 10 to 80 or 100 pounds.</p>
                <p>According to the results of microscopic observation it consists of red particles
                    suspended in a serous fluid. On the shape of these red particles various
                    opinions have been maintained. Generally represented as globular, Hewson
                    describes them as flattened spheroids, or lenticular bodies, a view which is
                    partly confirmed by the observations of Prevost and Dumas, and also of Bedard.
                    The opinion of Home and Young, that the flattening of these globules is a
                    process posterior to the discharge of the fluid, is not improbable. These
                    particles have indeed since the time òf Hewson been almost universally
                    represented as consisting of a central transparent whitish globule, inclosed in
                    a red translucent vesicle, which gives them the shape of an oblate spheroid. The
                    diameter of these particles is estimated, by the subdivided scale of Kater, the
                    micrometer of Wollaston, and the eriometer of Young, at <hi rend="subscript">
                    j</hi> +θ, and by the common micrometer, at - <hi rend="subscript"> r7</hi> ⅛θ
                    of an inch. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.)</hi> This description applies to
                    the blood circulating in the vessels.</p>
                <p>Discharged from the vessels, it exhales, during the process of cooling, a thin
                    watery vapour, consisting of water suspending animal matter capable of
                    impressing the sense of smell, and undergoing decomposition. During the same <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039078?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9078-0713"/>
                    space it is observed to be converted into a firm mass, which, though still soft
                    and elastic, is entirely void of fluidity. As this process advances, a thin
                    watery fluid, straw-coloured, not perfectly transparent, is observed to exude
                    from every part of the solid mass, which also diminishes in size, till at length
                    it is found floating like a tolerably thick cake in the thin watery fluid. The
                    thick solid mass is named the clot or <hi rend="italic">coagulum;</hi> the
                    watery fluid is denominated <hi rend="italic">serum;</hi> and the process of the
                    separation, which is spontaneous, is termed <hi rend="italic">coagulation.</hi>
                    The blood at the same time is said to discharge carbonic acid.</p>
                <p>The clot, if divided and washed in water often changed, or in alcohol or <hi
                    rend="italic">aqua potasses,</hi> may be deprived of its red colour, and made to
                    assume a gray or bluish-white tint. This gray mass, which is tough, coherent,
                    opaque, and more or less dense, homogeneous, but void of traces of organic
                    structure, consists chiefly of albumen or fibrin, or a substance partaking of
                    several of the characters of both. To this substance the blood owes its
                    viscidity and its property of spontaneous coagulation; and from the circumstance
                    of its resemblance to the lymph or albuminous fluid which is effused from wounds
                    and inflamed surfaces, and to the fibrin of muscle, and the albumen of many of
                    the tissues, it may be regarded as the most vital and nutritious part of that
                    fluid. It is a mistake nevertheless to assert, as is done by Bedard and others,
                    that this substance presents to the microscope the aspect and structure of
                    muscular fibre. Its aspect is by no means so regular as this, nor can its
                    particles be said to present tracés of organic structure or arrangement.</p>
                <p>The red matter removed by washing is a mixture of serum, of globules, and of a
                    peculiar colouring matter. Modern chemistry shows that the latter is a
                    particular substance, insoluble in water, but susceptible of suspension in it to
                    an extreme extent, and consisting of animal matter combined with peroxide of
                    iron. It is distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">zoohematine.</hi>
                    Deprived of this, the globules are estimated by Bauer at g- <hi
                    rend="strikethrough">ð¾-ð</hi> of an inch in diameter.</p>
                <p>The serum, with the taste and odour of the blood, rather alkaline, coagulates at
                    162° F. or on the addition of acids, nitrate of silver, or corrosive sublimate,
                    and then resembles boiled white of egg. The coagulated matter is albumen; and a
                    little water containing soda and salts of soda may be separated. It is a
                    remarkable difference between this albumen, which is suspended in the serum, and
                    that which constitutes the clot, that while the former requires heat as a
                    re-agent, the latter assumes the solid form spontaneously.</p>
                <p>Blood also contains occasionally some oily matter, the presence of which renders
                    the serum opaque and milky.</p>
                <p>The colour of the blood varies in different parts of the system. In the left
                    auricle, ventricle, and arterial trunks generally, its colour is bright scarlet,
                    a tint which it loses in the capillary vessels. In the veins, venous trunks,
                    right auricle, right ventricle, and pulmonary artery, its colour is a dark or
                    purple-red, or modena. As it moves from the trunk and branches through the
                    minute divisions of the pulmonary artery, it gradually parts with this tint; and
                    in the branches of the pulmonary veins it is found to have acquired the bright
                    scarlet colour which it has in ∙'.e left auricle, ventricle, and aorta. Hence
                    the modena or dark-coloured blood is distinguished as venous, or proper to the
                    veins; and the bright red or scarlet-coloured as proper to the arteries.</p>
                <p>In the foetus, the blood contains little coagulable matter; and this principle is
                    entirely wanting in the blood of the menstrual discharge.</p>
                <p>The fluids received by the blood are chyle and lymph. Chyle is derived from
                    chyme, a gray pulpy substance, formed from the alimentary mass in the stomach
                    and duodenum. Detached from this substance, and received by the chyliferous
                    tubes, it is whitish and scarcely coagulable. In the mesenteric glands it
                    becomes more coagulable, and assumes a rose colour. Lastly, in the thoracic
                    duct, and before joining the mass of blood, it is distinctly rose-coloured,
                    coagulable, and globular in its particles. In the branches of the pulmonary
                    artery it appears to become perfect blood. Lymph is a colourless, viscid,
                    albuminous fluid, imperfectly known.</p>
                <p>Of the fluids separated from the blood, all cannot be said to belong to the
                    animal body. Several, for instance the perspired fluid of the skin and lungs,
                    the fluid of the cutaneous and mucous follicles, and the urine, become, after
                    secretion, foreign to the body, and require to be removed. Those belonging to
                    the body are such as are prepared for some purpose within it, and after this are
                    either re-absorbed, or, being decomposed, are expelled. Of the former kind, fat,
                    serum of serous membranes, and synovia, afford examples. To the latter
                    description belong tears, saliva, pancreatic fluid, bile, the seminal fluid of
                    the male, and the milk of the female, all of which are the result of a distinct
                    glandular secretion for a specific purpose, after which they are expelled from
                    the economy. The urine, though also the result of glandular secretion, is
                    nevertheless exempt from this rule, and though separated from arterial blood, is
                    forthwith eliminated. Its chief purpose seems to be to afford a convenient
                    vehicle for ridding the system of superfluous azote, and to maintain the due
                    proportion between this and the other ultimate principles, carbon, hydrogen, and
                    oxygen. The fluids which fulfil a purpose in the economy are regarded as
                    secretory, and are remarkable for a predominance of alkali; those which do not
                    are excrementitial, and are generally acid.</p>

                <p>The general distribution of the filamentous or cellular tissue was first
                    maintained by Haller and Charles Augustus de Bergen, aιld afterwards made the
                    subject of elaborate discussion by William Hunter and Bordeu. It may be
                    described as a substance consisting of very minute thready lines, which follow
                    no uniform or invariable direction, but which, when gently raised by the
                    forceps, present the appearance of a confused and irregular net-work. As these
                    minute lines cross each other, they form between them spaces of a figure not
                    easily determined, and perhaps not uniform. By some authors these spaces or
                    intervals have been named cells; but, accurately speaking, the term is not
                    fortunately applied. The component lines, which do not exceed the size of the
                    silk-worm threads, are so slender, that they do not form those distinct
                    partitions which the term <hi rend="italic">cell</hi> implies; and though by
                    forcible distension, such as takes place in insufflation, or separation by
                    forceps, cavities appear to be formed, these, it will be found, are artificial,
                    and result from the separation of an infinity of the slender filaments of which
                    the part is composed. These interlinear spaces necessarily communicate on every
                    side with each other; and indeed the most dis-tĩnct<pb break="no"

                    a true idea of the structure of the cellular tissue, is to suppose a certain
                    space of the animal body which is divided and intersected into an infinite
                    multitude of minute spaces <hi rend="italic">(areolae)</hi> by slender thready
                    lines crossing each other. This description, derived from personal observation,
                    renders the name of <hi rend="italic">filamentous</hi> more appropriate to this
                    tissue than that of <hi rend="italic">cellular,</hi> by which it is generally
                    known.</p>
                <p>The interstitial spaces resulting from the interlacement of these filaments do
                    not exist as distinct cavities in the healthy state, so that they cannot be said
                    to contain any substance solid or fluid. But when an incision is made into this
                    tissue in the living body, it is found, that if we except those fluids which
                    issue from divided vessels, nothing is observed to escape but a thin exhalation
                    or vapour, which is evidently of an aqueous nature. This is what some authors
                    have termed, from its resemblance to the serous part of the blood, the <hi
                    rend="italic">cellular</hi> serosity (Bichat), and the quantity of which has
                    been greatly exaggerated. In the living body it appears not to exist as a
                    distinct fluid, but merely as a thin vapour, which communicates to the tissue
                    the moist appearance which it possesses.</p>
                <p>This fluid is understood to be derived from the minute colourless capillaries
                    named <hi rend="italic">exhalants;</hi> and it is supposed to be no sooner
                    poured forth in an insensible manner, than it is removed by the absorbing power
                    of lymphatics, minute veins, or both. It is further believed, that whatever
                    serous fluid is secreted into the interstitial spaces or cells of the
                    filamentous tissue, is in the healthy state speedily removed; so that exhalation
                    implies absorption; and the filamentous tissue is therefi&gt;re represented as
                    the seat of incessant exhalation and absorption.</p>
                <p>The serous fluid of the filamentous tissue varies in quantity in different
                    regions. In the cellular tissue of those parts which are free from fat, as in
                    the eyelids, the prepuce, the <hi rend="italic">nymphee</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">labia,</hi> and the scrotum, it is said to be more abundant than
                    in others. The peculiar structure of those parts, which is cellular, may render
                    any excess of serous fluid more conspicuous; for it is matter of observation,
                    that in many persons otherwise healthy these parts are not unfrequently
                    distended with serous fluid. On the other hand, it must be remarked that the
                    submucous cellular tissue, and that which surrounds arteries, veins, and
                    excreting ducts, which is de-Iicatė in substance and compact in structure,
                    contains but a small proportion of serous fluid, and does not readily admit its
                    presence.</p>
                <p>This fluid has been generally said to be of an albuminous nature; and if it be
                    identical with the serum of the blood, from which it is believed to be secreted,
                    this character is not unjustly given it. Bichat, who maintained this opinion,
                    injected alcohol into the filamentous tissue of an animal previously rendered
                    emphysematous, and found in various parts whitish <hi rend="italic"
                    >fiocculi,</hi> which he regarded as coagulated albumen. He also obtained the
                    same result by immersing a portion of the scrotum in weak nitric acid; and when
                    a considerable quantity of this tissue was boiled, it furnished much whitish
                    foam, which Bichat regarded as albuminous.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">AηαtoπΛe Generate,</hi> tom. i. p.
                    õO.</p></note> These experiments, however, are liable to this objection, that
                    the effects inquestion may have arisen from coagulation of part of the
                    filamentous tissue itself, which contains a considerable proportion of
                    albuminous matter. The best mode of determining the point is to obtain the fluid
                    apart, and to try the effects of the usual tests on it when isolated from the
                    tissue in which it is lodged.</p>
                <p>The description here given applies to the proper filamentous tissue. This
                    substance was shown by Ruysch, and afterwards by William Hunter and Mascagni, to
                    be penetrated by arteries and veins. Exhalants, absorbents, and nerves, it is
                    also said to receive. The arteries certainly belong in the healthy state to the
                    order of colourless capillaries, which are nearly the same with exhalants. It
                    does not appear that the nervous twigs observed to pass through this tissue are
                    lost in it; for in general they have been traced to some contiguous part.</p>
                <p>Such are the general properties of this tissue, considered as an elementary
                    organic substance extensively diffused through the body. In particular regions
                    it undergoes some modifications, which may be referred to the following heads
                    :—1. beneath the skin, or rather under the adipose membrane—the subcutaneous and
                    intermuscular cellular tissue; 2. beneath the villous or mucous membranes —the
                    submucous cellular tissue; 3. beneath the serous membranes—the subserous
                    cellular tissue; 4. round bloodvessels, excreting ducts, or rather organs—the
                    inclosing tissue, vascular sheaths, &amp;c.; 5. in the substance of organs—the
                    penetrating cellular tissue.</p>
                <p>The situation of the subcutaneous filamentous tissue deserves particular notice.
                    Though generally represented as below the skin, it is not immediately under this
                    membranous covering. The skin rests on the adipose membrane, beneath which again
                    is placed the filamentous tissue, extending like a web over the muscles and
                    bloodvessels, penetrating between the fibres and bundles of the former,
                    surrounding the tendons and ligaments, and connected by these productions with a
                    deep-seated layer, on which the muscles move, where they do not adhere to the
                    periosteum and to bones.</p>
                <p>The extensive distribution of the subcutaneous filamentous tissue, the mutual
                    connection of its parts, and its ready communication with the filamentous tissue
                    of the mucous and serous membranes, were demonstrated by Haller, William Hunter,
                    and Bordeu, and have been clearly explained by Portal and Bichat. The principal
                    points worthy of attention may be stated in the following manner.</p>
                <p>The filamentous tissues of the head and face communicate freely with each other,
                    and with that of the brain by the cranial openings, and with the submucous
                    tissue of the eyelids, nostrils, lips, and the inner surface of the mouth and
                    cheeks. It communicates also with the subcutaneous tissue of the neck all round;
                    and at the angle of the jaw, in the vicinity of the parotid gland, is the common
                    point of re-union. To this anatomical fact is referred the frequency of
                    swellings and purulent collections in the region of the parotid in the course of
                    various diseases of the head, face, and neck.</p>
                <p>The filamentous tissue of the neck may be viewed as the connecting medium between
                    that of the head and trunk. From the former region it may be traced downwards
                    along the back, loins, breast, sides, flanks, and belly. At the cervical region,
                    and between the shoulders, it is dense and abundant; and, surrounding the dorsäl
                    part of the vertebral column, it is connected with the mediastinal tissue, the
                    submucous tissue of the lungs, and the subserous tissue of the costal pleura. At
                    the fore part of the neck it is in like manner connected with the abundant
                    tissue of the pectoral region, and by means of that surrounding the larynx and
                    trachea, lsr, with the submucous tissue of the bronchi; and, 2ď, with the
                    anterior mediastinum. Passing downwards, the same communication may be traced
                    with the intermuscular tissue <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039104?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9104-0715"/> of the loins and belly, the tissue surrounding
                    the lumbar and sacral portion of the vertebral column, that connecting the
                    mesentery and large vessels to the vertebrae, and extending all round under the
                    muscular peritoneum, and into the pelvis, where, by means of the tissue at the
                    posterior surface of the abdominal muscles, at the anterior surface of the <hi
                    rend="italic">iliavus</hi><hi rend="italic">internus,</hi> and through the
                    obturator hole and ischiadic notch, it communicates with the filamentous tissue
                    of the lower extremities. From the rectum and branches of the ischium it is
                    continued along the perineum by the urethra, and into the scrotum.</p>
                <p>In the whole of this course, it is abundant in the space before the vertebrae,
                    round the <hi rend="italic">psoae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iliacus
                    internus</hi> muscles, and round the bladder, rectum, prostate gland, and womb.
                    The tissue surrounding the vertebral column communicates with that in the
                    interior of the column by the intervertebral holes.</p>
                <p>The armpit &gt;may bc considered as the point of union between the filamentous
                    tissue of the trunk and that of the upper extremities, while the groin is the
                    corresponding spot for the lower extremities. These facts should be kept in mind
                    in observing the phenomena of diseases of this tissue.</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding this general connection, however, certain parts of the tissue are
                    so dense and close as to diminish greatly the facility of communication. Thus,
                    along the median line it is so firm, that air injected invariably stops, unless
                    impelled by a force adequate to tear open its filaments; and water is rarely
                    found effused in this situation. In the neighbourhood of some parts of the
                    skeleton also, as at the crest of the ilium, over the great trochanter, and on
                    the shin, the filamentous tissue is very dense and coherent.</p>
                <p>In chemical composition it consists principally of gelatine, but contains some
                    albuminous matter.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Adipose Tissue. (Tela</hi><hi rend="italic">Adiposa,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—Tissu Adipeux,—Tissu Graisseux.)</hi></p>
                <p>The separate existence of an adipose membrane was suspected by Malpighi,
                    maintained by De Bergen and Morgagni, and demonstrated by William Hunter. It
                    was, however, confounded with the filamentous tissue, under the general name of
                    cellular membrane, adipose membrane, and cellular fat, by Winslow, Portal,
                    Bichat, and most of the continental anatomists, till distinguished and described
                    by Μ. Bedard.</p>
                <p>According to the dissections of De Bergen and Morgagni, the demonstrations of
                    Hunter, and the observations of Bedard, its structure consists of rounded
                    packets or parcels <hi rend="italic">(pelotons)</hi> separated from each other
                    by furrows of various depth, of a figure irregularly oval, or rather spheroidal,
                    varying in diameter from a line to half an inch, according to the degree of
                    corpulence and the part submitted to examination. Each packet is composed of
                    small spheroidal particles, which may be easily separated by dissection, and
                    which are said to consist of a cluster of vesicles still more minute, and
                    agglomerated together by delicate cellular tissue. The appearance of these
                    ultimate vesicles is minutely described by Wolff in the subcutaneous fat, and by
                    Monro and Clopton Havers in the marrow of bones, in which the last two authors
                    compared them to strings of minute pearls. If the fat with which tlιese vesicles
                    arc distended should disappear, as happens in dropsy, the vesicles collapse,
                    their cavity is obliterated, and they are confounded with the contiguous
                    cellular tissue, without leaving any trace of their existence.</p>
                <p>Hunter, however, asserts, that in such circumstances the cellular tissue differs
                    from the tissue of adipose vesicles, in containing no similar cavities; and
                    justly remarks that the latter is much more fleshy and ligamentous than the
                    filamentous tissue, and contends, that though the adipose receptacles are empty
                    and collapsed, they still exist. When the skin is dissected from the adipose
                    membrane it is always possible to distinguish the latter from the filamentous
                    tissue, even if it contain no fat, by the toughness of its fibres, and the
                    coarseness of the web which they make.</p>
                <p>The distinguishing characters between the cellular or filamentous and the adipose
                    tissue may be stated in the following manner :—1sZ, The vesicles of the adipose
                    membrane are closed all round, and, unlike cellular tissue, they cannot be
                    generally penetrated by fluids which are made to enter them. If the temperature
                    of a portion of adipose membrane be raised by means of warm water to the
                    liquefying point of the contents, they will remain unmoved so long as the
                    structure of the vesicles is not injured by the heat. If, again, an adipose <hi
                    rend="italic">peloton</hi> bc exposed to a solar heat of + 40 centĩgr. though
                    the fat be completely liquefied, not a drop escapes until the vesicles are
                    divided or otherwise opened, when it appears in abundance. The adipose matter,
                    therefore, though fluid or semifluid in the living body, does not, like
                    dropsical infiltration, obey the impulse of gravity. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi>
                    The adipose vesicles do not form, like cellular tissue, a continuous whole, but
                    are simply in mutual contiguity. This arrangement is demonstrated by actual
                    inspection, but becomes more conspicuous in the case of dropsical effusions,
                    when the filamentous tissue interposed between the adipose molecules is
                    completely infiltrated, while the latter are entirely unaffected. 3⅛ The
                    anatomical situation of the adipose tissue is different from that of the
                    filamentous tissue. The former is found, Isŕ, in a considerable layer
                    immediately beneath the skin; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> between the peritoneal
                    folds which form the omentum and mesentery; 3√, between the serous and muscular
                    tissues of the heart; and, 4∕∕z, round each kidney.</p>
                <p>In each of these situations it varies in quantity and in physical properties. In
                    the least corpulent persons a portion of fat is deposited in the adipose
                    membrane of the cheeks, orbits, palms of the hand, soles of the feet, pulp of
                    the fingers and toes, flexures of the joints, round the kidney, beneath the
                    cardiac serous membrane, and between the layers of the mesentery and omentum. In
                    the more corpulent, and chiefly in females, it is found not merely in these
                    situations, but extended in a layer of some thickness almost uniformly over the
                    whole person; and is very abundant in the neck, breasts, belly, <hi
                    rend="italic">nions</hi><hi rend="italic">veneris,</hi> and flexures of the
                    joints.</p>
                <p>Besides the delicate cellular tissue by which the packets and vesicles arc
                    united, the adipose tissue receives arterial and venous branches, the
                    arrangement of which has been described by various authors, from Malpighi, who
                    gave the first accurate account, to Mascagni, to whom we are indebted for the
                    most recent. According to the latter, who delineates these vessels, the furrow
                    or space between each packet contains an artery and vein, which, being
                    subdivided, penetrate between the minute grains or particles of which the packet
                    is composed, and furnish each with a small artery and vein. The effect of this
                    arrangement is, that each individual grain or adipose particle is supported by
                    its artery and vein as by a foot-stalk or peduncle, and that those of the same
                    packet are kept together, not only by contact, but by the community of
                    ramifications from the same vessel. These grains are so closely attached, that
                    Mascagni, who examined them with a good lens, compares them to a cluster of
                    fish-spawn. Grutz-macher found much the same arrangement in the grains and
                    vesicles of the marrow of bones.</p>

                <p>It has been supposed that the adipose tissue receives nervous filaments; and
                    Mascagni conceives-he has demonstrated its lymphatics. Both points, however, are
                    so problematical, that of neither of these tissues is the distribution
                    known.</p>
                <p>The substance contained in these vesicles is entirely inorganic. Always solid in
                    the dead body, it has been represented as fluid during life by Winslow, Haller,
                    Portal, Bichat, and ' most authors on anatomy. The last writer indeed states,
                    that under the skin it is more consistent, and that in various living animals he
                    never found it so fluid as is represented. The truth is, that in the human body,
                    and in most mammiferous animals during life, the fat is neither fluid nor
                    semifluid. It is simply soft, yielding, and compressible, with a slight degree
                    of transparency or rather translucence. This is easily established by observing
                    it during incisions through the adipose membrane, either in the human body or in
                    the lower animals.</p>
                <p>The properties and composition of fat form a subject for chemical rather than
                    anatomical inquiry; and in this respect its nature has been particularly
                    investigated by Μ. Chevreul. According to the researches of this chemist, fat
                    consists essentially of two proximate principles, <hi rend="italic">stearine
                    (&lt;rτεαg, sebum, sαpo),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">elaine (ελαιοv,
                    oleum).</hi> The former is a solid substance, colourless, tasteless, and almost
                    inodorous, soluble in alcohol, and preserving its solidity at a temperature of
                    138° centigrade. Elaine, on the contrary, though colourless, or at most of a
                    yellow tint, und lighter than water, is fluid at a temperature of from 17° to
                    18° centigrade, and is greatly more soluble in alcohol. Of this substance marrow
                    appears to be merely a modification; and the membranous cavities or medullary
                    membrane in which it is contained may be viewed as an intra-osseous adipose
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>Little doubt can be entertained that animal fat is the result of a process of
                    secretion; but it is no easy matter to determine the mode in which this is
                    effected. Malpighi, departing, however, from strict observation, imagined a set
                    of ducts issuing from glands, in which he conceived the fat to be elaborated and
                    prepared. To this he appears to have been led by his study of the lymphatic
                    glands, and inability to comprehend how the process of secretion could be
                    performed by arteries only. This doctrine, however, was overthrown by the strong
                    arguments which Ruysch derived from his injections; and Malpighi himself
                    afterwards acknowledged its weakness and renounced it. In short, neither the
                    glands nor the ducts of the adipose membrane have ever been seen.</p>
                <p>Winslow, though willing to adopt the notion of Malpighi, admits, however, that
                    the particular organ by which the fat is separated from the blood is unknown.
                    Haller, on the contrary, aware of the permeability of the arteries, and their
                    direct communication with the cells of the adipose tissue, and trusting to the
                    testimony of Malpighi, Ruysch, Glisson, and Morgagni, that it existed in the
                    arterial blood, saw no difficulty in the notion of secretion, or rather of a
                    process of separation; and upon much the same grounds the opinion is adopted by
                    Portal and others. Bichat, again, contends that no fat can be recognised in the
                    arterial blood, and justly adduces the fact, that none can be distinguished in
                    blood drawn from the temporal artery. The accuracy of this fact is confirmed by
                    subsequent observation. This result is not at variance with the fact observed by
                    Dr Traill, who found oily matter in venous blood in two instances. In wounds in
                    the human body during life, and in living animals, oily particles may be seen
                    floating on the surface of the blood; but these proceed from division of the
                    adipose vesicles.</p>
                <p>That fat does not .exist in the arterial blood may be therefore admitted as an
                    established point. The idea that it is separated or strained from this fluid,
                    therefore, must also be gratuitous; and as such it is viewed by Bichat, who
                    considers the deposition of fat as the effect of exhalation, which is little
                    more than a different name for the process termed by Haller <hi rend="italic"
                    >secretion.</hi> Lastly, an opinion has been delivered by Mascagni, that while
                    the arteries depositor pour forth an imperfect or crude oily fluid, the
                    lymphatics absorb the thin parts, and leave the residue in a more solid and
                    perfect form. In conclusion, all that can be affirmed regarding the formation of
                    this substance is, that it is deposited by the blood-vessels, but by what
                    particular process, or in what form, is entirely unknown. The process by which
                    the arteries of the adipose membrane secrete fat appears to be equally
                    mysterious as that by which the vessels of muscle deposit fibrin, those of bone
                    deposit osseous matter, and those of cartilage form that animal substance.</p>

                <p>The structure of the arteries has been so much the subject of examination at all
                    periods of the history of anatomy, that to mention the authors by whom it has
                    been .described would be much the same as to enumerate all the anatomists who
                    have ever written. To omit Galen, and some of those who wrote shortly after the
                    revival of literature, descriptions of the structure of arteries have been given
                    with different degrees of minuteness and accuracy by W <hi rend="superscript">
                    7</hi> illis, Vieussens, Verheyen, Lancisi, Bidloo, the first Monro, Morgagni,
                    Ludwig, Haller, Delasone, Bichat, Gordon, Magendie, and by Mondini. Yet the
                    descriptions given by these observers are discordant, and, with the exception of
                    those given by the last four authors, do not accord with the characters which
                    this substance actually presents.</p>
                <p>The following account is derived principally from repeated examination of the
                    arteries of the human subject, occasionally compared with those of the more
                    familiar domestic animals.</p>
                <p>Every arterial tube greater than one line in diameter is visibly composed of one
                    adventitious and two essential substances: the first, the sheath, reputed to
                    consist of condensed filamentous tissue; the two last, the proper arterial and
                    internal tissues. <hi rend="italic">( Tunica propria</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">meηιbrαηα intima.)</hi></p>
                <p>1. The inner surface of the arterial tube is formed by a very thin
                    semitransparent polished membrane, which is said to extend not only in the one
                    direction over the inner surface of the left ventricle, auricle, and pulmonary
                    veins, but in the other to form the minute vascular terminations which are
                    distributed through the substance of the different organs. This membrane is
                    particularly described by Bichat under the name of <hi rend="italic">common
                    membrane of the system of red blood,</hi> because he believed it to exist
                    wherever red blood was moving,—in the pulmonary veins, in the left side of the
                    heart, and over the entire arterial system.</p>
                <p>The inner membrane may be demonstrated by cutting open or inverting any artery of
                    moderate size, when it may be peeled off iri the form of thin slips by the
                    forceps. Or, if the tube be fitted on a glass rod, by removing the layers of the
                    proper membrane in successive portions, the inner one at length comes into view
                    in the form of a thin translucent pellicle, of uniform, homogeneous aspect,
                    without fibres or other obvious traces of organization. This membrane is
                    supposed to be prolonged to form those minute vessels in which the proper coat
                    cannot be traced. It is very brittle, and is distinguished during life by a
                    remarkable activity in forming the morbid states to which <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039130?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9130-0717"/> arteries are
                    liable. In other respects it is deemed by Bichat peculiar, and, though similar
                    to the proper membrane, is to be considered as unlike any other tissue. Its
                    chemical composition is not known.</p>
                <p>2. Exterior to this <hi rend="italic">common</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inner</hi>
                    membrane is placed a dense strong tissue of considerable thickness, of a dun
                    yellowish colour, which is found to consist of fibres disposed in concentric
                    circles placed contiguous to each other round the axis of the artery. If this
                    substance be examined either from without or in the opposite direction, it will
                    be found that, by proper use of forceps, its fibres can be separated to an
                    indefinite degree of minuteness, even to that of a hair, and that they uniformly
                    separate in the same direction. Longitudinal fibres are visible neither in this
                    nor in any other tissue of the arterial tube. This is the proper arterial
                    tissue; <hi rend="italic">(tunica propria.')</hi> Its uniform dun yellow colour
                    is perceived through the semitransparent inner membrane, and is most conspicuous
                    either when this is removed, or when the outer cellular envelope is detached and
                    the component threads separated from each other; and if it be less distinct in
                    the smaller branches, it is because the tissue on which the colour depends is
                    here considerably thinner. In this respect it varies in different regions.
                    Though in general less dense and abundant as the arteries recede from the heart,
                    it is thicker, <hi rend="italic">ccetcris paribus,</hi> in those of the lower
                    than in those of the upper extremities. In the vertebral and internal carotid
                    arteries, and in those distributed in the substance of the liver, spleen,
                    &amp;c., it is thinner than in vessels of the same size in the muscular
                    interstices.</p>
                <p>The nature of this tissue has been the subject of much controversy. It was long
                    believed to be muscular, and to possess the properties of muscular fibre. Bichat
                    showed that the arguments by which this opinion was supported are inconclusive,
                    and that the arterial tissue has very few qualities in common with the muscular.
                    The circumstances from which he derived his proofs were its physical and
                    physiological properties.</p>
                <p>The arguments derived from the physical properties of this tissue are chiefly the
                    following :—The arterial tissue is close, elastic, fragile, and easily divided
                    by ligature; muscular fibre is more loose in structure, by no means elastic;
                    and, instead of being divided or cut by ligature as artery is, undergoes a sort
                    of strangulation. The action of alcohol, diluted acids, and caloric, by means of
                    hot fluids which are not corrosive, affords a proof of the chemical difference
                    of these animal substances. All of them produce in the arterial tunic a species
                    of shrivelling or crispation, which seems to depend on more complete coagulation
                    of one of the chemical principles; but no similar effect takes place in muscular
                    fibres. According to Berzelius, the proper arterial tunic contains no
                    fibrin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    however, asserts that he has ascertained that it contains a portion of this
                    principle; but nevertheless hesitates to consider it as a muscular or fibrinous
                    tissue, and expresses his opinion that it would be with greater propriety
                    referred to that order of substances which he has named yellow or tawny fibrous
                    system.</p>
                <p>The consideration of the physiological or organic properties leads to similar
                    results. Neither mechanical nor chemical agents applied as stimulants produce
                    any change or motion in the living arterial membrane. 1. The arteries <hi

                    spark, and those of Vassalli-Eandi, Giulio, and Rossi with the galvanic pile,
                    may be considered as disproved by the experiments of Nysten,<note

                    death, while the heart and other muscles could still be excited. In performing
                    the same experiment with the artery of the living dog, this physiologist was
                    equally disappointed. 3. The circular contraction of the calibre of an artery,
                    cither partially or wholly divided, depends not on irritability, but cither on
                    its elasticity, or on that property which it possesses of contracting strongly
                    the instant the distending agent is removed. This power, which was rather
                    happily named by Bichat <hi rend="italic">contractilité</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >par</hi><hi rend="italic">defaut</hi><hi rend="italic">đextension,</hi> is
                    quite different from muscular contraction or irritability, and must not be
                    confounded with them; but it depends in a degree not much less on the living
                    state of the body and the individual arterial tube. 4. The contraction said to
                    take place in living arteries after the application of alcohol, acids, or
                    alkalies, is to be ascribed to the chemical <hi rend="italic">crispation,</hi>
                    and not to stimulant power. It does not relax. 5. These inferences are not
                    inconsistent with the experiments of Thomson, Philips, Hastings, and others, on
                    minute arterial tubes, which may be admitted to possess something like
                    irritability, or rather susceptibility of contraction, without the necessity of
                    supposing the same property in the large branches and trunks. 6. This is so much
                    more probable, as in these minute arteries the proper arterial tunic is either
                    wanting, or is so much thinner and so modified, that it is impossible to
                    conceive its presence capable of affecting the result of experiments made to
                    determine the degree or kind of arterial contraction.</p>
                <p>3. The outer surface of the proper arterial tissue is enveloped, as above
                    noticed, in a layer of dense filamentous or cellular membrane, which is very
                    firmly attached to it, and which was formerly considered as part of the arterial
                    tissue. It is adventitious; a modification of filamentous or cellular texture,
                    which establishes a communication between the artery and the contiguous parts,
                    and is necessary to the nutrition and healthy state of the vessel. It incloses
                    and transmits the minute vessels anciently denominated <hi rend="italic">vasa
                    vasorum</hi><hi rend="italic">(arteriolae</hi><hi rend="italic">arteriarum,</hi>
                    Haller); and if detached even through a trifling extent, the arterial portion
                    thus divided is sure to become dead, to be affected with inflammatory and
                    sloughing action, and ultimately to give way and discharge the contents of the
                    vessel. Μ. Bcclard considers it a fibro-cellular membrane, which may in the
                    larger arteries be divided into two layers; one exterior, similar to the general
                    filamentous tissue; the other inside, between the outer layer and the proper
                    tissue, yellowish and firm, but still sufficiently distinct from the proper
                    tunic. In the cerebral arteries it is wanting, and in most parts of the chest
                    and belly its. absence is supplied by a portion of pericardium, pleura, or
                    peritoneum. Yet even there a thin layer of fine cellular tissue appears to
                    connect these membranes to the proper tunic. In the extremities the cellular
                    sheath is removed in dissecting arterial preparations.</p>
                <p>At different periods several anatomists have maintained the existence of
                    longitudinal fibres in arterial tissue; and even at the present day this notion
                    is not entirely abandoned. Morgagni was the first who, trusting to mere
                    observation, the only sure guide in anatomical science, doubted the existence of
                    these fibres, and was not ashamed to say he was unable to perceive them.<note

                    examined almost every considerable artery of the human body, and I have never
                    been able to recognise any longitudinal fibres, either in the middle or proper
                    coat, or in the thin internal membrane, as taught by Willis, Douglas, and

                    aorta at its origin is supplied with minute arteries from the right and left
                    coronary, and in some instances with a proper vessel adjoining to the orifice of
                    the right coronary artery, which Haller regards as a third coronary. The rest of
                    the thoracic aorta derives its vessels from the upper bronchials, from twigs of
                    the internal mammary arteries, from the bronchials, from the oesophagcals, and
                    from the phrenics. The abdominal portion is supplied from the spermatics, the
                    lumbar, and in some instances the mesocolic artery. The same arrangement nearly
                    is observed with regard to the veins.</p>
                <p>Few textures are more liberally supplied with nerves than arteries are. Almost
                    every considerable trunk or vessel is surrounded by numerous plexiform filaments
                    of nerves, many of which may be traced into the tissue of the artery. The
                    anterior part of the arch of the aorta is abundantly supplied with branches from
                    the superficial cardiac nerves, which Haller was unable to trace beyond the
                    artery. The coeliac, the mesenteric, and the mesocolic arteries are invested
                    with numerous plexiform nervous filaments derived from the large semilunar
                    ganglion of the splanchnic nerve. The renal arteries in like manner are
                    surrounded by numerous twigs of the renal plexus; and each of the intercostal
                    arteries at its origin receives nervous threads from the intercostal nerves.
                    This arrangement, which is observed chiefly in the blood-vessels going to the
                    internal organs, led Bichat to announce it as a general fact, that the arteries
                    derive their nerves almost exclusively from the ganglions and the gangliar
                    nerves.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Le grand arbre

                    evidently owes its birth to the hypothetical opinions of this ingenious
                    physiologist. All the arteries going to the extremities, the axillary, and
                    iliac, and their branches, receive nerves from the neighbouring nervous trunks,
                    which are formed chiefly from cerebral or spinal nerves, and have no immediate
                    connection with the system of the ganglions. In the internal carotid and the
                    vertebral arteries, and their branches, nerves cannot be distinctly traced.<note

                <p>Organized in the manner now described, it is requisite to take a short view of
                    the anatomical connections of the arterial system, or to consider it in its
                    origin, its course, and its termination.</p>
                <p>The arterial system of the animal body may be viewed as one large trunk divided
                    into several branches, which again are subdivided and ramified to a degree of
                    minuteness which exceeds all calculation. It is requisite, therefore, to
                    consider the origin, Isí, of the aorta, the large trunk; <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛dly,</hi> of the branches which arise from it; and, 3c?(y, of the small
                    vessels into which these are divided.</p>
                <p>Every one knows that the aorta is connected at its origin with the upper and
                    anterior part of the left ventricle. The manner of this connection has been well
                    examined by Lancisi, by Ludwig, and particularly by Bichat. It may be
                    demonstrated by dissection, but is much more distinctly shown by boiling the
                    heart with the blood-vessels attached. In a heart so treated, the thin internal
                    membrane may be traced passing from the interior of the ventricle along the
                    margin of its orifice to the inside of the arterial tube. Exactly at the point
                    of union it is doubled into three semicircular folds, forming semilunar valves,
                    and thence is continued along the whole course of the artery. This membrane is
                    entirely distinct from the proper or fibrous coat. Of the latter, the cardiac
                    extremity or beginning is notched into three semicircular sections, each of
                    which corresponds to the base or attached margin of a semilunar valve. These
                    sections are attached to the aortic orifice of the ventricle by delicate
                    filamentous tissue, but are not connected with the fleshy fibres of the heart;
                    and at the angle or point of attachment the thin inner membrane is folded in so
                    as to fill up a space or interval which is left between the margin of the
                    orifice and the circumference of the proper arterial tissue, where it is notched
                    or trisected.</p>
                <p>The aorta is soon divided into branches, which again are subdivided into small
                    vessels. With the mathematical physiologists it was a favourite problem to
                    ascertain the number of branches into which any vessel might be subdivided.
                    Keill made them from forty to fifty. Haller states that, counting the minutest
                    ramifications, he has found scarcely twenty. The inquiry is vain, and cannot be
                    subjected to accurate calculation. In no two subjects is the same artery found
                    to be subdivided the same number of times; and in no two subjects are the same
                    branches found to arise from the same trunk.</p>
                <p>A branch issuing from a trunk generally forms with it a particular angle. Most
                    generally, perhaps, these angles are acute; but in particular situations they
                    approach nearly to a right angle. Thus the <hi rend="italic">innominata,</hi>
                    left carotid, and left subclavian, issue from the arch of the aorta nearly at a
                    right angle, at least to the tangent of the arch. The intercostals form a right
                    angle with the thoracic aorta; the renal and lumbar arteries form a large acute
                    angle, approaching to right, with the abdominal; and the coeliac comes off
                    nearly in the same manner from the anterior part of the vessel. The internal and
                    external carotids, again, the external and internal iliacs, the branches of the
                    humeral, and those of the femoral, form angles more or less acute with each
                    other. The angle which the spermatics make is, generally speaking, the most
                    acute in the arterial system.</p>
                <p>I have already alluded to the structure of the arterial tissue at the
                    divarications. These changes relate both to the inner and to the proper
                    membrane. In the inside of the vessel the inner membrane is folded somewhat so
                    as to form a prominent or elevated point, the disposition of which varies
                    according to the angle of divarication. Is?, When this is rectangular, the
                    prominence of the inner membrane is circular, and is equally distinct all round.
                    2c?, When the angle is obtuse, as in the mesenteric artery, the prominence is
                    distinct, and resembles a semicircular ridge between the continuation of the
                    trunk and the branch given off, but indistinct on the opposite side where the
                    angle is obtuse. 3c?, If the angle is acute, and that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039156?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9156-0719"/> formed by the
                    branch with the continuation of the trunk is obtuse, the beginning of the artery
                    presents an oblique circle, the elevated half of which is near the heart, the
                    other more remote.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of the fibres of the proper tissue is described by Ludwig from
                    the divarication of the iliac arteries, and may be seen in any part of the
                    arterial system where the vessels are large. The circular fibres separating form
                    on each side a half-ring, from which is produced a complete ring, which incloses
                    the smaller rings formed by the circular fibres of the vessel given off. These
                    circular fibres proceed to the prominence of the internal membrane already
                    described, and are arranged round it much in the same manner in which those of
                    the large vessel surround its inner membrane. In this, however, no continuity
                    between the rings of the large vessel and those of the small one can be
                    recognised. The latter are inserted as it were into the former, and they are
                    connected by the continuity of the inner membrane only.</p>
                <p>In observing the course or transit of arterial tubes, the principal point
                    deserving notice is the sheltered situation which they generally occupy, their
                    tortuous course, and their mutual communications. In the extremities they are
                    always found towards the interior or least exposed part of the limb, generally
                    deep between muscles, and sometimes lying along bones. When they are minutely
                    subdivided, they enter into the interior of organs, without, however, sinking at
                    once into their intimate substance. In the muscles they are lodged between the
                    fibres; in the brain, in the convolutions; in glands, between their component
                    lobes. In such situations they are generally observed to be more or less
                    tortuous in the course which they follow. On the reasons of this much difference
                    of opinion still prevails. (Bichat and Magendie.)</p>
                <p>In the course of the arteries, no circumstance is of greater moment than their
                    mutual communications or inosculations <hi rend="italic">(anastomoses').</hi> Of
                    this there may be two forms, the first when two equal trunks unite, the second
                    when a large vessel unites with a smaller one. Of the first, three varieties
                    have been mentioned. <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> Two equal trunks may unite at
                    an acute angle to form one vessel. Thus, in the foetus, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ductus arteriosus</hi> and the aorta are conjoined; and the two vertebral
                    arteries unite to form the basilar trunk. 2d, Two trunks may communicate by a
                    transverse branch, as the two anterior cerebral arteries do in forming the
                    anterior segment of the circle of Willis. 3d, Two trunks may, by mutual union,
                    form an arch, from the convexity of which the minute vessels arise, as is seen
                    in the branches of the mesenteric arteries. (Plate XXIX. fig. 4.)</p>
                <p>The second mode of inosculation is frequent in the extremities, especially round
                    the joints. The multiplied communications of the arterial system in these
                    regions, though well known to anatomists, and enumerated by Haller, were first
                    clearly and systematically explained by Scarpa, and afterwards by Cooper and
                    Hodgson. The importance of this arrangement, in facilitating the motions of the
                    circulation,—in obviating the effects of local impediment in any vessel or set
                    of vessels,—and in enabling the surgeon to tie an arterial trunk when wounded,
                    affected with aneurism or any other disease,—has been clearly established by
                    these authors. Their researches have shown, that there is not a single vessel
                    which may not be tied with full confidence in the powers of the collateral
                    circulation. Even the aorta has in four instances been found obstructed in the
                    human subject, and a ligature has been put on its abdominal portion.
                    (Cooper.)</p>
                <p>To ascertain the several modes in which arteries terminate has been a problem of
                    much interest ţo the physiologist, and of no small difficulty to the anatomist.
                    The alleged terminations, as believed to be established, are minutely and
                    elaborately enumerated by Haller, who, however, multiplied them too much
                    according to the modern acceptation of the term.</p>
                <p>1. The first undoubted termination of arteries is immediately in veins. It is
                    unnecessary to adduce in support of this fact the long list of observers
                    enumerated by Haller. It is sufficient to say that it was clearly established by
                    the microscopical observations of Leeuwenhoeck, Cowper, and Baker, by Haller
                    himself, and by Spallanzani in his beautiful experiments on the circulation of
                    the blood.</p>
                <p>2. The second termination which may be mentioned here is that into the colourless
                    artery, <hi rend="italic">(arteria</hi><hi rend="italic">non rubra).</hi> This
                    is sufficiently well established by the phenomena of injections.</p>
                <p>3. A third termination which is supposed to exist, but of which no sensible
                    proofs can be given, is that into colourless vessels supposed to open by minute
                    orifices on various membranous surfaces, and therefore termed exhalants. The
                    nature of these vessels shall be considered afterwards.</p>
                <p>Haller admits a termination in, or communication with, lymphatic vessels, but
                    allows that it is highly problematical. Partial communications have been traced
                    between arteries and lymphatics by several anatomists; but the point requires to
                    be again submitted to accurate researches.</p>
                <p>Another mode of termination, that namely into excreting ducts, admitted by
                    Haller, scarcely requires particular mention. So far as an artery can be said to
                    terminate in such a manner, it would come under the head of that into exhalant
                    vessels. Many of the proofs mentioned by Haller, however, may be shown to be
                    examples of a morbid state of the mucous membranes of these ducts, in which
                    their capillary vessels are disorganized.</p>
                <p>In considering the several terminations of arteries, it is not unimportant to
                    advert to the distribution of these vessels. Injections show that they penetrate
                    into every texture and organ of the animal body, excepting one or two substances
                    in which they have never yet been traced. But in different textures they are
                    found in different degrees; and they may vary in extent even in the same texture
                    in two different conditions. The parts which receive the largest and most
                    numerous vascular ramifications are the brain and spinal chord, the glandular
                    organs, the muscles voluntary and involuntary, the mucous membranes, and the
                    skin. In bones, on the contrary, in the fibrous membranes, and their
                    modifications, tendons, and ligaments, and in the serous membranes, few arteries
                    are seen to penetrate; and these are generally minute, sometimes only colourless
                    capillaries. In some textures arteries cannot be traced, though their properties
                    indicate that they must receive vessels of some kind. Such are cartilage and the
                    arachnoid membrane. (Ruysch and Haller.) Lastly, arteries are not found in the
                    scarf-skin, in nails, the enamel of the teeth, .the hair, nor in the membranes
                    of the umbilical chord. In early life bones are much more vascular than in adult
                    age; and in the bones of young subjects arteries may be traced going out through
                    the epiphyses into the cartilages, in which they cannot at a later period of
                    life be demonstrated. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> No. 470.)</p>

                    writings of Willis, Glass, and Clifton Wintringham, comprise all that was

                    minuteness and accuracy by John Hunter, Bichat, Magendie, Gordon, Marx,<note

                    Meckel. In the following account, the facts collected by these observers have
                    been compared with the appearance and visible organization presented by veins in
                    different parts of the human body.</p>
                <p>The veins are membranous tubes extending between the right side or pulmonary
                    division of the heart and the different organs in which their minute branches
                    are ramified.</p>
                <p>Every venous tube greater than one line in diameter consists of three kinds of
                    distinct substance. The outermost is a modification of the filamentous tissue
                    <hi rend="italic">(membrana cellulosa),</hi> and though less compact and less
                    thick than the arterial filamentous envelope, is in every other respect quite
                    similar, and is in general intimately connected with it. The innermost <hi
                    rend="italic">(membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">intima)</hi> is a smooth very thin
                    membrane. Between these is found a tunic somewhat thicker, which is termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">proper venous tissue (tunica propria venae).</hi> The
                    structure and aspect of this proper membrane shall be first considered.</p>
                <p>l,s√, When the loose filamentous tissue in which the blood-vessels are inclosed,
                    and the more delicate and firm layer immediately contiguous to the veins, are
                    removed, the observer recognises a red or brown-coloured membrane, not thick or
                    strong, but somewhat tough, which is the outer surface of the proper venous
                    tunic. If dissected clean it is tolerably smooth; but however much so it can be
                    made, a glass of moderate powers, or even a good eye, will perceive numerous
                    filaments adhering to it, which appear to be the residue of the cellular
                    envelope.</p>
                <p>According to Bichat, parallel longitudinal fibres, forming a very thin layer, may
                    be distinguished in the larger veins; but he admits, although they are quite
                    real, that they are always difficult to be seen at the first glance. In the
                    trunk of the inferior great vein <hi rend="italic">(vena cava inferior),</hi>
                    they are always seen, he observes, more distinctly than in that of the superior;
                    and they are always more obvious in the divisions of the former than in those of
                    the latter vessel, and also in the superficial than in the deep-seated veins.
                    These longitudinal fibres, he asserts, are more distinct in the saphena than in
                    the crural vein, which accompanies the artery. Lastly, he remarks, these fibres
                    are proportionally more conspicuous in branehes than in trunks. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anatomie Générale,</hi> tom. i. p. 399.)</p>
                <p>Notwithstanding the apparent correctness of this description, Magendie informs us
                    he has sought in vain for the fibres of the proper venous membrane; and he
                    remarks that, though he has observed very numerous filaments interlacing in all
                    directions, yet these assume the longitudinal and parallel appearance only when
                    the tube is folded longitudinally,—a disposition often seen in the larger
                    veins.</p>
                <p>By Meckel, on the contrary, the accuracy of the observation of Bichat is
                    maintained. This anatomist states that he has, by the most minute dissections,
                    assured himself that these fibres are longitudinal; but he admits that they are
                    not uniformly present in all parts of the venous system, and that in degree and
                    abundance they are liable to great variation. He follows Bichat also in
                    representing these fibres as thicker and more distinct in the system of the
                    inferior than in that of the superior <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi> and in the
                    superficial than in the deep veins.</p>
                <p>In the inferior cava of the human subject, certainly, filaments or fibres may be
                    recognised. But instead of being longitudinal, they may be made to assume any
                    direction, according to the manner in which the filamentous tissue is removed.
                    For this reason probably these fibres are to be viewed as part of the
                    filamentous sheath. In the saphena vein of the leg oblique fibres may be seen
                    decussating each other; but it is doubtful whether these belong to the proper
                    venous tissue or to the filamentous covering.</p>
                <p>The nature of this proper membrane, or venous fibre, as it is sometimes named
                    (Bichat), is not at all known. Its great extensibility, its softness, its want
                    of elasticity in the circular direction, or fragility, its colour and general
                    aspect, distinguish it from the arterial tunic. It possesses some elasticity in
                    the longitudinal direction, and is retracted vigorously when stretched. It
                    possesses considerable resistance, or in common language is tough. The
                    experiments of Clifton Wintringham show that it sustains a considerable weight
                    without breaking, and that this toughness is greater in early life, or in the
                    veins of the young subject, than at a later period.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Experimental Inquiry on
                    tome parts of the Animal Structure.</hi> London, 1740.</p></note> In short, it
                    may be stated as a general fact, that venous tissue, though thinner, possesses
                    greater elasticity and tenacity than arterial tissue. According to the
                    experiments of the same inquirer, this property depends on that of the superior
                    density of the venous tissue; the specific gravity of the matter of the <hi
                    rend="italic">vena cava</hi> being invariably greater than that of the aorta in
                    the same subject, both in man and in brute animals.</p>
                <p>From some experiments Magendie is disposed to consider it of a <hi rend="italic"
                    >fibrinous</hi> character. But it exhibits in the living body no proof of
                    muscular structure or irritable power. When punctured by a sharp instrument, or
                    exposed to the electric or galvanic action, it undergoes no change or sensible
                    motion.</p>
                <p>This tunic is wanting in those divisions of the venous system termed <hi
                    rend="italic">sinuses,</hi> in which its place is supplied by portions of the
                    hard membrane <hi rend="italic">(dura meninx).</hi><hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi>
                    The inner surface of any vein which has been laid open and well washed is found
                    to be smooth, highly polished, and of a bluish or blue-white colour. This is the
                    inner or free surface of the inner venous membrane <hi rend="italic"
                    >(membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">intima).</hi> It is exceedingly thin, much more
                    so than the corresponding arterial membrane, much more distensible and less
                    fragile. It bears a very tight ligature without giving way as the arterial does;
                    but it also sustains considerable weight, which shows that it is tough and
                    resisting. This is the membrane termed by Bichat <hi rend="italic">common
                    membrane of dark or modena blood.</hi> According to the views of this anatomist,
                    it forms the inner or free surface, not only of all the venous twigs, branches,
                    and trunks composing this system of vessels, but it is extended from the
                    superior and inferior great veins over the inner surface of the right auricle
                    and ventricle, and thence over that of the pulmonary artery and its divisions;
                    and through this whole tract it is the same in structure and properties.</p>
                <p>This doctrine has not yet been controverted. But perhaps it may be doubted, both
                    with regard to the inner arterial membrane, that the inner tunic of the aorta
                    and of the pulmonary veins is quite the same; and in regard to this inner venous
                    membrane, whether that of the veins in general is quite the same with that of
                    the pulmonary artery. The subject demands further research. Meanwhile strong
                    confirmation is found in the interesting remark of Bichat, that the osseous or
                    calcareous depositions which are common in various spots of the inner arterial
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039182?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9182-0721"/>
                    membrane, and especially at the mitral and aortic valves, are never found in the
                    inner venous membrane, or at the tricuspid valve, or in the semilunar valves of
                    the pulmonary artery. Have these depositions been found inside the pulmonary
                    veins, and not inside the pulmonary artery? This fact is still wanting to
                    complete even their pathological similarity.</p>
                <p>The inner or common venous membrane is, however, the most extensive and the most
                    uniform of all the venous tissues. It is the only one which is found in the
                    substance of organs, and is present where the cellular and proper membranes are
                    wanting. This is the case not only with venous branches and minute canals as
                    they issue from the substance of muscles, bones, and such organs as the liver,
                    kidneys, spleen, &amp;c., but is also very remarkably observed with regard to
                    the venous canals of the brain. I have already noticed the absence of the
                    cellular and proper tissues in these tubes; and I have now to remark, that the
                    cerebral veins consist solely of the inner membrane while in the brain or
                    membranes, and when in the sinuses, of this inner membrane, placed between two
                    folds of the <hi rend="italic">dura mater.</hi> When the jugular vein reaches
                    the temporo-occipital sinuosity, it loses its proper membrane, while its common
                    or inner membrane passes into the hollow of the <hi rend="italic">dura
                    mater,</hi> called <hi rend="italic">sinus,</hi> and thus forms the venous
                    canal. This fact is readily demonstrated by slitting open either the lateral or
                    the superior longitudinal sinus, when a thin delicate membrane, quite distinct
                    from the fibrous appearance of the <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> will be
                    found to line the interior of these canals.</p>
                <p>The inner surface of many veins presents membranous folds projecting obliquely
                    into the cavity of the vessel. These folds, which, from their mechanical office,
                    have been named <hi rend="italic">valves (valvulae),</hi> are parabolic in
                    shape, have two margins, an attached and free,—and two surfaces, a concave
                    turned to the cardiac end of the vein, and a convex turned in the opposite
                    direction. The attached margin is not straight, as may be imagined, but
                    circular, and adheres to the inner surface of the vessel. The free margin
                    resembles in shape an oblong parabola; and the direction of the valve is such,
                    that a force applied to its convex surface would urge it more closely to the
                    vein, whereas a force applied to the concave surface would either obliterate the
                    circular area of the vessel, tear the valve from the vein, or otherwise meet
                    with resistance.</p>
                <p>The size of the valves is variable. In some instances they are sufficiently large
                    to fill the canal of the vessel, and in others they are too small to produce
                    this effect. The obliteration of the circular area of the vessel is most perfect
                    when there are two or three at the same point. Bichat ascribed the variable
                    state of this quality to the dilated or contracted condition of the veins at the
                    moment of death. This, however, is denied by Magendie.</p>
                <p>In structure these valvular or parabolic folds are said to consist of a doubling,
                    or two-fold layer of the inner membrane; and with this statement no fact of
                    which we are aware is at variance. A hard prominent line, which generally marks
                    the attachment of their fixed margin to the vein, is asserted by Bichat to
                    consist of the proper venous tissue, the fibres of which, he says, alter their
                    direction for this purpose; and when the common or inner membrane reaches this
                    line, it doubles or folds itself to form the valve, which thus consists of two
                    layers of the inner or common membrane. This, however, is denied by Hunter,<note

                <p>Valves are not uniformly present in all veins. They are found, 1⅛√, in the
                    following branches of the superior great vein—the internal jugular, the azygos,
                    the facial veins, those of the arms, &amp;c.; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> in the
                    following branches of the inferior great vein—the divisions of the posterior
                    iliac, of the femoral, tibial, internal and external saphena, and in the
                    spermatic veins of the male.</p>
                <p>They are wanting in the trunk of the inferior great vein <hi rend="italic">(cava

                    portal vein, in the cerebral sinuses, in the veins of the brain and spinal
                    chord, in the veins of the heart, of the womb generally, and of the ovaries, and
                    perhaps in all other veins less than a line in diameter.<note anchored="true"

                    established by Mayer of Bonn.</p>
                <p>In situation the valves vary considerably. In general they are found in those
                    parts of venous canals at which a small vein opens into a larger. But even from
                    this arrangement there are deviations. The only valve which is definite and
                    invariable in its situation is the Eustachian <hi rend="italic">(valvula
                    Eustachiana,</hi><hi rend="italic">valvula nobilis),</hi> which is always placed
                    at the cardiac end or beginning of the inferior <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi>
                    where that vessel is attached to the sinus of the right auricle. Shaped in
                    general like a crescent, the attached margin of which is the arch of a large
                    circle, and the free that of a small one, it proceeds from the left extremity of
                    the sinus downwards, forwards, and towards the left side, where it is insensibly
                    lost on the membrane of the auricular <hi rend="italic">septum.</hi> At its
                    lower end it generally covers the orifice of the large coronary vein. This
                    membranous production is always larger, more perfect, and more distinct in the
                    foetus and in the infant, than in the adult. In the latter it is almost always
                    reticulated; and sometimes the only vestige of its existence is a thin chord or
                    two representing its anterior margin. I have seen it reticulated even at the age
                    of sixteen or seventeen, and almost destroyed beyond thirty. Haller was much
                    perplexed to account for the use of this membranous fold.<note anchored="true"

                <p>Dr Gordon mentions a third partial substance, which is occasionally found in

                <p>Besides the cellular or filamentous envelope, veins receive capillary arteries,
                    to which there are corresponding veins. The arteries rise from the nearest small
                    ramifying arteries; and the corresponding veins do not terminate in the cavity
                    of the vein to which they belong, but pass off from its body, and join some
                    others from different parts; and at last terminate in the common trunk somewhere

                    reference to the veins, they become convertible terms; and it is the <pb

                    usage even of writers on anatomy to represent the veins as arising where the
                    arteries terminate, and terminating at the organ from which the latter arise.

                <p>The organic extremity or origin of the venous system is more obscure and
                    difficult to be understood. It is indeed impossible to trace the origin of the

                    in general cold-blooded. From the experiments of these observers, we know that a
                    very small vessel, evidently tending and conveying blood <hi rend="italic"
                    >towards</hi> a larger, connected with a venous branch, may be seen passing

                    rend="italic">from</hi> a larger, which is connected with the arterial system.
                    All that we know from this, however, is, that a vein containing red blood may
                    rise from an artery conveying red blood. This is matter of pure observation; and
                    all beyond is little more than conjectural.</p>
                <p>Haller, indeed, admits origins of veins as manifold as the terminations of the
                    arterial system, a view in which he has been followed by almost all subsequent
                    authors; and Bichat states it as a leading proposition, that the veins arise
                    from the general capillary system. Neither conclusion is founded on strict
                    observation; and while that of the former physiologist is derived chiefly from
                    uncertain facts and loose analogies, the statement of the latter is too
                    hypothetical and general to be either entirely true or wholly false.</p>
                <p>Of one fact only are we certain. The blood which is conveyed into the small
                    vessels and the substance of the tissues and organs is brought back by the
                    veins. We have seen that the only origin which is strictly susceptible of
                    demonstration is that of the red vein from the red artery. The point then to be
                    ascertained is, whether colourless veins and absorbent veins arise from the
                    several textures, as colourless and exhalant arteries terminate in them. The
                    proper place for the further examination of this question is the subsequent
                    section.</p>
                <p>I must not omit to mention, nevertheless, that the veins have been shown to be
                    connected at their ramified extremities with the lymphatics.</p>
                <p>When the veins become distinct vessels, branches, and trunks, they become once
                    more objects of sensible examination. In their course from their organic to
                    their cardiac extremities they present various circumstances which merit
                    attention.</p>
                <p>1. In general every artery is accompanied by a venous tube, which is divided in
                    the same manner, and furnishes or receives an equal number of branches. Thus the
                    descending aorta is accompanied by the <hi rend="italic">vena cava
                    inferior</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the common iliac arteries by common iliac
                    veins; the anterior iliac, femoral, and popliteal, by anterior iliac, femoral
                    and popliteal veins. These veins are deep-seated, and are generally named the
                    concomitant veins <hi rend="italic">(venae comites vel venae satellites).</hi>
                    In some situations an artery may be accompanied either in its trunk or in its
                    branches by two veins of equal size. Thus in general the brachial artery, and
                    its branches the radial and ulnar, are each accompanied by two veins. The only
                    situations in which the number of veins can be said to be exactly equal to that
                    of the arteries, are in the stomach, in the intestinal canal, in the spleen, in
                    the kidneys, in the testicles, and in the ovaries.</p>
                <p>2. In the extremities and in the external regions of the trunk we find, in
                    addition to the concomitant veins, an external layer of venous tubes immediately
                    beneath the skin, <hi rend="italic">(venae</hi><hi rend="italic">subter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cutern dispersae,</hi> Pliny). These subcutaneous or superficial
                    veins do not correspond to any artery; but as they are chiefly destined to
                    convey the blood from the skin and other superficial parts, they open into the
                    deep-seated veins. Thus in the case of the basilic and cephalic, two superficial
                    veins of the arm, the former, after passing the bicipital fascia, forms in the
                    sheath the brachial vein; and becoming the axillary in the axilla, receives the
                    latter vessel. In the same manner the saphena (pλ≡-ψ <hi rend="italic">δa^η</hi>
                    ∖ <hi rend="italic">ης, vena</hi><hi rend="italic">manifesta),</hi> or
                    superficial vein of the leg, passes through the falciform process of the <hi
                    rend="italic">fascia lata</hi> to join the femoral vein.</p>
                <p>From this it results that the venous canals are on the whole more numerous than
                    the arterial. In a few situations only a single vein corresponds to two
                    arteries, as in the penis, the clitoris, the gall-bladder, and the umbilical
                    chord. Often also in the renal capsules and the kidneys two or more arteries
                    have only one corresponding vein. In such circumstances the vein is always large
                    and capacious.</p>
                <p>It has been generally stated that the calibre and area of the venous tubes are
                    much larger than those of the corresponding arteries, and consequently that the
                    capacity of the venous system is much greater than that of the arterial. I
                    acknowledge that I know not on what exact evidence the former of these
                    propositions, the only one with which the anatomist is concerned, is made to
                    rest. If it be mere inspection in the dead subject, or the effects of injection,
                    little doubt can be entertained that the alleged greater calibre depends chiefly
                    on the Iaxityand distensible nature of the venous fibre. The arterial tubes
                    appear small in consequence of annular contraction, or the tendency which they
                    have to collapse, when the distending force has ceased to operate. The venous
                    canals appear large by reason of their distension and distensibility during
                    life, from the tendency to accumulation in their branches in most kinds of
                    death, except that by hemorrhage, and from a smaller degree of the physical
                    property of shrinking and annular contraction when empty.</p>
                <p>When a vascular sheath is exposed in the human subject, as in the operation for
                    aneurism, or in the lower animals in the way of experiment, the vein generally
                    appears larger than the corresponding.artery. This, however, is never so
                    considerable as it is represented by most authors, and certainly cannot afford
                    grounds for the estimates which Keill, Jurin, and other mathematical
                    physiologists have assigned to the relative capacity of the arteries and veins.
                    It is also to be observed that something of this greater size depends on the
                    increase of dilatation resulting from removing the pressure of incumbent parts.
                    In young animals also the difference between the size of the veins and their
                    corresponding arteries is so trifling as to be scarcely discernible. This shows
                    that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039208?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9208-0723"/> something is to be ascribed to the incessant
                    operation of a dilating force increasing uniformly with the duration of
                    life.</p>
                <p>Upon the whole, it is chiefly on the ground of their larger numerical arrangement
                    that the veins collectively can be said to be more capacious than the arteries.
                    On this subject some observations of Bichat are entitled to attention.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                <p>3. The veins in general accompany the arteries. The venous trunk placed
                    contiguous to the arterial in the same sheath, is divided into branches at the
                    same points, and is distributed into the substance of organs much in the same
                    manner. From this arrangement, however, certain deviations are observed in
                    particular regions. Thus, in the brain, neither the internal carotid, nor the
                    basilar artery, nor their large branches, are accompanied with veins. The small
                    branches only have corresponding veins, which, as they unite to form large ones,
                    pour their blood into the venous canals termed sinuses, the arrangement of which
                    is unlike any other part of the venous system. In the chest also a different
                    disposition of the venous from the arterial tubes is observed. The <hi
                    rend="italic">venae cavae,</hi> though conveying the blood to the pulmonic
                    division of the heart, as the aorta conveys it from it, do not, however,
                    correspond with the latter either in situation or in dependent branches. The <hi
                    rend="italic">azygos</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">demiazygos</hi> veins, in
                    like manner, which receive the intercostal veins, have no concomitant artery,
                    but open into the superior <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi> to which they may be
                    viewed as appendages. <hi rend="italic">Lastly,</hi> The portal vein, which is
                    formed of the united trunks of the splenic, superior mesenteric and inferior
                    mesenteric veins, corresponds to no individual arterial trunk, and forms of
                    itself a peculiar arrangement in the venous system.</p>
                <p>Some anatomists have dwelt much on the more superficial and less sheltered
                    situation of the veins than of the arteries. On this point no positive
                    inferences can be established. In the extremities the former are in general most
                    superficial; but in the interior of the body, especially in the chest, the
                    venous trunks are quite as deep-seated as the arterial.</p>
                <p>The course of the venous canals is in general more rectilineal and less tortuous
                    than that of the arteries. In no part of the venous system is such an inflection
                    presented as that which the internal carotid makes in the carotic canal. The
                    general result of this is, that a set of venous tubes is shorter than a
                    corresponding set of arterial ones. The trunks also are less inflected than the
                    branches.</p>
                <p>4. The mutual communications of the venous system <hi rend="italic">(anastomoses,
                    inosculationes,)</hi> are more numerous and frequent than those of the arterial.
                    1. The minute veins communicate so freely as to form a perfect net-work. 2. In
                    the twigs, though more rare, these communications are still frequent. 3. In the
                    branches, though less numerous, they are nevertheless observed; and in this
                    respect alone the venous must be greatly more numerous than the arterial
                    inosculations, which are confined chiefly to the smaller and more remote parts
                    of the system. These inosculations, indeed, between the venous branches
                    constitute one of the most peculiar and important characters of their
                    arrangement, in so far as by their means the communication is maintained between
                    the superficial and deep-seated vessels of the system. Thus the emissary veins
                    are the channel of communication between the cerebral sinuses and the temporal,
                    occipital, and other external veins. The external and internal jugulars
                    communicate by one or two considerable vessels; and the free communication
                    between the basilic and cephalic by the median veins, that between them and the
                    deep brachial vessel, and that between the saphena and its branches and the
                    femoral vein, are sufficiently well known. The application of these anatomical
                    facts to the ready motion of the venous blood is obvious.</p>
                <p>But of all the communications between the branches or large vessels of the venous
                    system, the most important, both anatomically and physiologically, is that
                    maintained by means of the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos</hi> between the
                    superior and inferior <hi rend="italic">cavae.</hi> The azygos itself is
                    connected at its upper or bronchial extremity with the superior <hi
                    rend="italic">cava,</hi> and at its lower extremity it is in some subjects
                    connected directly with the inferior <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi> in others by
                    means of the right renal vein, and in most by the first lumbar veins. By means
                    of the <hi rend="italic">demiazygos,</hi> again, it is connected with the left
                    renal vein, or the lumbars of the same side, and in some instances directly with
                    the inferior <hi rend="italic">cava.</hi> To the azygos and demiazygos,
                    therefore, belongs the remarkable property of connecting not only the venous
                    canals of the upper and lower divisions, but those of the right and left halves
                    of the body.</p>

                    intermediate system between the arteries and veins, but the origin of all the
                    exhalant and excreting vessels.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    modes in which arteries have been said to terminate, and veins to take their
                    origin, we find, that in this view of the capillary system there are some things
                    which are doubtful, and some which are inconsistent with the rest.</p>
                <p>Haller, and most of the physiological authorities since his time, concluded,
                    chiefly from the phenomena of injections, sometimes from microscopical
                    observation, and, where these failed, from the obscure and uncertain evidence of
                    analogy, that an artery traced to its last or minute divisions will be found to
                    terminate in one or other of the following modes. 1sZ, Either directly in a red
                    vein or veins; 2ď, in excreting ducts, as in the lacrymal and salivary glands,

                    follicular glands; 4/Ä, in smaller vessels, for instance lymphatics; and, <hi

                <p>A similar application of the same facts has assigned to the veins a mode of
                    origin not unlike. If, therefore, we admit the definition given by Bichat, it
                    follows that the capillary system consists, <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> of
                    minute arteries communicating with veins; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> of
                    excreting ducts; 3d, of exhalants; and, <hi rend="smallcaps">4/ä,</hi> of minute
                    arteries or veins containing a colourless portion of the blood. It is obvious,
                    however, that it is absurd to say that the system of capillary vessels at once
                    comprehends and gives origin to the ex-cretorics and exhalants. In other
                    respects the whole of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039221?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9221-0724"/> this theory, for little of it is matter of strict
                    observation, rests on very hypothetical grounds.</p>
                <p>Of the different kinds of terminations assigned to arteries, and of origins
                    assigned to veins, one only admits of sensible demonstration.. Arteries, when
                    they have so much diminished as to become <hi rend="italic">capillary,</hi> are
                    seen by the microscope, in some instances by the naked eye, to pass directly
                    into corresponding capillary veins, or to end abruptly in some organ or membrane
                    unconnected with any other vessel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Gordon, p. 5G..</p></note> It is likewise certain that the
                    microscope shows every capillary vein to arise from a capillary artery; and if
                    there be any other mode of origin, it has not yet been demonstrated.<note

                    p 2G.</p></note> Only one other circumstance requires to be taken into account
                    •in this inquiry. This is, that the capillary artery and vein may contain either
                    red or colourless blood; for, according to the size of the vessels, and the
                    nature of the organs or tissues in which they are distributed, the blood which
                    flows through them will be coloured or colourless. This view of the
                    communication of minute arteries and veins, which is perfectly consistent with
                    the known facts, affords the only explanation which it is possible to give, of
                    the singular division of the capillary system which Bichat has chosen.</p>
                <p>This author considers the capillary system under three general heads: ∖ <hi
                    rend="italic">st,</hi> In organs in which it contains blood only, for instance,
                    in the muscles, the spleen, some parts of the mucous membranes; <hi
                    rend="italic">2d,</hi> in organs in which it contains blood and other fluids,
                    for example, in bone, cellular tissue, serous membrane, part of the fibrous
                    system, the skin, the vascular <hi rend="italic">parietes,</hi> glands, &amp;c.;
                    and, 3&lt;⅝ in organs in which it contains no blood, the instances of which are,
                    tendon, cartilage, ligament, hair, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Now, it is of little consequence to say that the tissues of the two last
                    divisions contain other fluids than blood, when we are also told that the
                    phenomena of injections, which prove that their capillaries communicate directly
                    with arteries conveying red blood, the effect of irritating applications
                    mechanical or chemical, and the phenomena of acute or chronic inflammation, show
                    that they may receive and convey red blood. The conclusion of this in common
                    language is, that the capillary arteries and veins •of the second order of
                    tissues do not all contain red blood, but that many of them contain a colourless
                    part of that fluid; and that all the capillary arteries and veins of the third
                    order of tissues convey in the natural state colourless blood only. What then is
                    the precise idea which ought to be formed of the intermediate system which
                    Bichat conceived to exist between the minute arteries and veins, or what have
                    been termed the venous <hi rend="italic">radiculce</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >?</hi></p>
                <p>From the present state of facts it results that nothing more can be admitted to
                    constitute the capillary system than those minute vessels, whether conveying
                    coloured or colourless blood, in which inspection, microscopic observation, and
                    injections show that arterial branches at once terminate, and minute veins <hi
                    rend="italic">(radiculce venosoe)</hi> have their origin. It is clear that,
                    physiologically speaking, these vessels can neither be regarded as arteries nor
                    as veins strictly; for the characters on which this distinction is founded are
                    necessarily obliterated in this system of vessels. There is no precise point at
                    which the arterial tissue can be said to terminate, and none at which the venous
                    structure can be said to commence. Here inspection or microscopic observation
                    affords little or no aid; for the vessels are too small to allow their structure
                    to be examined correctly. If, however, we adopt the doctrines of Bichat with
                    regard to the inner arterial and venous tunics forming the ultimate tube of
                    small arteries and small veins, we must conclude that the arterial membrane is
                    lost in the venous, and that the common membrane of red blood is identified with
                    the common membrane of dark or modena blood. This conclusion involves nothing
                    absurd or improbable, and, though not founded on observation, it is more natural
                    than many similar ideas which have been formed on the nature of this system of
                    vessels. It may be added, that it is not at variance with what is observed in
                    these vessels in the living body. It is found that the blood in a minute artery
                    is not of the bright red colour which it possesses in the trunk and large branch
                    from which the minute artery derives its blood, but is gradually acquiring the
                    dark hue which belongs to the blood of the venous branches and trunks.</p>
                <p>By some, however, this direct communication of minute arteries and veins is
                    denied. Thus, according to Doellinger, the arteries at their last ramifications
                    are void of proper membranous walls; the blood moves in immediate contact with
                    the solid matter of the body, which is in truth the fundamental or penetrating
                    filamentous tissue; and from this it passes into the venous tubes and
                    lymphatics, which also arise from this substance.</p>
                <p>According to Wilbrand, again, who equally denies this direct communication of
                    arteries and veins, all the blood is converted into organic fibres and
                    secretions; and these organic fibres, becoming gradually fluid, are converted
                    into blood and lymph, which continue the circulation.</p>
                <p>These notions are too fanciful and too incapable of demonstration to become the
                    object of serious attention to the anatomist. It is of little moment whether the
                    vessels in the ultimate ramifications possess tunics or not. When they cease to
                    possess tunics they cease to be vessels; and to carry observation beyond this
                    point is either impracticable or useless. In other respects the investigation of
                    this point belongs to the subject of the exhalant vessels.</p>
                <p>Bichat describes two great capillary systems in the human body: Isř, The general
                    one, or that which consists of the minute terminations of the aortic divisions,
                    and the origins of the superior and inferior great veins; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >2d,</hi> the pulmonary capillary system, or that which consists of the minute
                    terminations of the pulmonary artery, and the origins of the pulmonary veins. It
                    is evident that the manner in which the first of these systems is here
                    represented communicates a very incorrect idea of its true character, and that
                    there is in truth an individual capillary system, not only for every organ, but
                    in some instances for every tissue. The brain possesses an individual capillary
                    system; and that of the membranes is evidently distinct from that belonging to
                    the organ itself. The heart and the kidneys possess each an individual capillary
                    system; and the liver may be said to have two, one formed by the communication
                    of the hepatic artery and veins, and another consisting of the divisions of the
                    portal vein, with the branches of the hepatic hollow vein; (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Vena cava</hi><hi rend="italic">hepatica).</hi></p>
                <p>The organic properties of the capillary vessels are as little known as their
                    structure. Many physiological and pathological writers, especially
                    experimentalists, have ascribed to them a power which has at different times
                    been called muscular, tonic, irritable, contractile; and have asserted that,
                    because the larger arteries are provided with a fibrous membrane, which they
                    have called muscular, and to which they have ascribed irritability, or the power
                    of contraction when stimulated, their minute or <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039234?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9234-0725"/> capillary
                    terminations must have the same property. This conclusion is completely
                    unfounded for two reasons. Isí, I have already shown that the proper arterial
                    tunic is not muscular in structure, and, according to the best experiments,
                    possesses no property of contraction when stimulated. 2√, Although it be
                    admitted that the proper arterial tissue is muscular and irritable, it is quite
                    certain that observation has not hitherto shown that this tunic can be
                    recognised in arteries smaller than a line in diameter; and in the capillaries
                    properly so called, that is, in vessels which partake of the nature of artery
                    and vein, no such structure has yet been observed.</p>
                <p>It is not improbable, however, that the capillaries possess certain organic or
                    vital properties; but all that has been taught on this subject is either
                    hypothetical or derived from an insufficient and imperfect collection of facts.
                    It is certain that the blood which moves through them is beyond the direct
                    influence of the action of the heart, and can be affected by this only so far as
                    it keeps the larger vessels constantly distended with a column of blood which
                    cannot retrograde, and must therefore move forward in the only direction left to
                    it. It has been therefore argued that the capillaries must have an inherent
                    power of contraction, by which this motion is favoured. Is it not sufficient to
                    say that they act merely as resisting canals, to prevent their contents from
                    escaping, and to minister to the various tissues and organs those supplies of
                    blood which the several processes of nutrition, secretion, &amp;c. require?</p>
                <p>The effects which the application of mechanical irritants, or chemical
                    substances, as alcohol, acids, and alkalies, produced in the experiments of
                    Hunter, Wilson Philip, Thomson, and Hastings, have been supposed to demonstrate
                    the irritable nature of the capillary vessels. The conclusion is illegitimate,
                    in so far as the results of these experiments are open to several sources of
                    fallacy. In some instances these effects are to be ascribed to incipient
                    inflammation, in others to shrivelling of the capillary structure, or crispation
                    by chemical action, in others to actual coagulation of the blood of the
                    capillaries; but none of them prove satisfactorily any peculiar properties in
                    the vessels of which the capillary system is composed.</p>
                <p>While the views of Reuss, and the recent experiments of Dutrochet and Wedemeyer,
                    render it probable that the capillaries possess some contractile power, they by
                    no means prove that this is adequate to impel the blood through them,
                    independently of the impulse of the heart. According to the hypothesis of Reuss,
                    the arterial system is in a state of positive, and the venous in that of
                    negative, electricity; and by the operation of this agent the blood is made to
                    move from the former class of vessels through the capillaries into the latter.
                    From the experiments of Dutrochet, again, on the transmission of fluids through
                    organic membranes, that author infers that, by means of the inward and outward
                    impulse, or that property which he denominates <hi rend="italic">Endosmose</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Exosmose,</hi> the blood flows through the capillaries
                    into the veins. Lastly, Wedemeyer, who further maintains that the impulsive
                    force of the heart is propagated to the capillary system, concludes, from the
                    effects of injecting fluids, both mild and irritative, and from microscopic
                    observation, combined with the effects of mechanical and chemical irritants,
                    that the capillaries possess considerable contractile power, the ope ration of
                    which is under the influence of galvanism, or nervous energy, or both; but that
                    this, instead of promoting, ought to resist the motion of the blood through
                    them.</p>

                <p>The system of capillary arteries and veins does not present the same arrangement
                    in all situations and in all the tissues of the human body. A peculiar
                    arrangement of these vessels was early recognised by our countryman William
                    Cowper, who states that he demonstrated the direct communication of arterial and
                    venous canals, not only in the lungs, but in the spleen and penis, “in which,”
                    says he, “I have found these communications more open than in other parts.”<note

                    however, was long overlooked by subsequent anatomists.</p>
                <p>Among the terminations of arteries enumerated by Haller, one which he referred to
                    the head of exhalants was that of a red artery or arteries pouring their blood
                    into the spongy or cellular structure of the cavernous bodies of the nipple, the
                    clitoris, and the penis, that of the wattles of the turkey, and the comb of the
                    cock.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    examination of those parts shows, that, with a correct knowledge of their
                    anatomical structure, he had not a very distinct conception of the manner in
                    which their vessels are disposed. It was afterwards pbserved, however, by John
                    Hunter, that the spongy structure of the urethra and glans consists of a plexus
                    of veins.</p>
                <p>Bichat remarked that the spleen, and the cavernous body of the penis, instead of
                    presenting, as the serous surfaces, a vascular or capillary net-work, in which
                    the blood oscillates in different directions according to the impulse which it
                    receives, exhibit only spongy or lamellar tissues, still little known in their
                    structure, in which the blood appears often to stagnate instead of moving. As
                    this peculiar structure was known in the cavernous body to be the seat of a
                    motion long known by the name of <hi rend="italic">erection,</hi> MM. Dupuytren
                    and Richerand distinguished this arrangement of arteries and veins as a peculiar
                    tissue, under the name of <hi rend="italic">erectile,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >—</hi> a distinction which, though partly understood before, has only now been
                    admitted as well founded in the writings of anatomical authors. According to the
                    recent arrangements of Μ. Bedard this tissue comprehends not only the structure
                    of the cavernous body, but that of the spongy substance <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It is unfortunate that the researches of anatomists on this erectile tissue have
                    been restricted chiefly to the spongy body of the urethra and the cavernous body
                    of the penis; and it is rather by analogy than direct proof that similarity of
                    structure between them and the other parts referred to the same head is

                <p>The cavernous body of the penis is in like manner represented to be a part of a
                    spongy nature, or to consist of innumerable sacs or cells separated by plates
                    and fibres, which at the moment of erection are distended with blood poured from
                    the arteries, and which is afterwards removed by some absorbing power of the
                    veins.</p>
                <p>This opinion, which was that of many subsequent anatomists, even Bichat
                    himself,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                    apparently from the facility with which the blood so deposited escapes, not, as
                    it was believed, from divided vessels, but from <hi rend="italic">areolae,</hi>
                    or interlaminar spaces. It appears, however, to have been at variance with what
                    had been anciently taught by Vesalius, Ingrassias, and Malpighi, and positively
                    stated regarding these vessels by Hunter; and modern researches have shown it to
                    be completely erroneous. Cuvier and Ribes in France, Mascagni, Paul Farnesc,
                    Moreschi in Italy, and Tiedemann in Germany, have shown that there are no cells
                    or spongiform structure in the erectile tissue of the cavernous body.</p>
                <p>The first correct view of the structure of parts of this description in the human
                    subject was given by Mascagni in his account of the arterial and venous
                    communications in the spongy body of the urethra. In 1787 he announced in his
                    work on the Lymphatics, that the parts called cavernous bodies, both in the <hi
                    rend="italic">penis</hi> and in the <hi rend="italic">clitoris,</hi> are simply
                    <hi rend="italic">fasciculi,</hi> or accumulations of arterial and venous
                    vessels without interruption of canal; but that between the arteries and veins
                    of the spongy bodies a dilated cavity or minute cell is interposed. In 1795
                    repeated minute injections led him to doubt the existence of this sort of cell;
                    and about the close of 1805 he publicly demonstrated the fact, that many veins
                    of considerable calibre, collected in the manner of a plexus, with corresponding
                    arteries, but small and less numerous, really form the outer and inner membranes
                    of the urethra, the whole of the <hi rend="italic">glans penis,</hi> and the
                    whole substance of the spongy body. -In each of these parts, and also in the
                    spongy structure inclosing the orifice of the vagina, he ascertained by repeated
                    injections that there are no cells, as was imagined, and that the arteries,
                    reflected as it were, give origin to numerous veins,<note anchored="true"

                    urethra and the entrance of the vagina.</p>
                <p>In the cavernous bodies of the penis and clitoris he had not sufficient facts to
                    ascertain the existence of the same structure, as he had never succeeded in
                    injecting these parts so completely as the <hi rend="italic">glans ¶rcA</hi> the
                    spongy part of the urethra. Eventually, however, he succeeded, especially in
                    children, in injecting fully these cavernous bodies of the penis and clitoris.
                    He found in their interior nothing but <hi rend="italic">fasciculi</hi> of
                    veins, with corresponding arteries, but rather smaller. He inferred, therefore,
                    that these vessels, collected and ramified in various directions, constitute a
                    vascular texture capable of expanding and shrinking, according to the quantity
                    of blood conveyed to it.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>The general accuracy of this description has been since confirmed by the
                    researches of Paul Farnese and Mores-chi. The latter, especially, has shown,
                    Isř, that the glans consists of arteries and a very great number of minute
                    veins, which pour their blood into the cutaneous dorsal vein; <hi rend="italic"

                    bulbous portion of the urethra; and, 3√, that in the cavernous bodies, though
                    also receiving blood-vessels, these are much less numerous, and are chiefly

                <p>Upon the whole, the facts collected by different anatomists on this subject
                    furnish the following results.</p>
                <p>If the arteries, on the one hand, be injected, they are found to terminate in
                    very fine ramifications, the disposition of which is exactly the same as in
                    other parts. If, on the other, the veins be injected, it is easy to perceive the
                    two following circumstances: Ls√, That they are much dilated at their origin,
                    that is, that the venous <hi rend="italic">radiculoe</hi> are really more
                    dilated than might be anticipated from the other characters of these vessels;
                    <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> That the tubular dilatations to which they are
                    accessory form very numerous inosculations or anastomoses, precisely as the
                    capillary system of which they constitute a part. The effect of this arrangement
                    is to give these vessels the appearance of being penetrated with sieve-like
                    openings, resembling <hi rend="italic">areolae,</hi> or interlaminar spaces
                    mutually communicating. As the whole difference, therefore, between the
                    capillary vessels of this and other parts of the human frame consists iπ <hi

                    soe)</hi> being dilated or distended in a peculiar manner, Bedard concludes that
                    the erectile tissue of the cavernous body consists simply of minute arteries and
                    dilatable veins interwoven in the manner of capillary nets. These distended
                    venous cavities are indeed so remote from being cells, that they are truly
                    continuous with veins, the inner membrane of which may be easily recognised
                    among them.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>During erection the blood accumulates in this tissue; but the cause and mechanism
                    of this accumulation are completely unknown.</p>
                <p>The spleen, Μ. Bedard thinks, may be said to resemble the cavernous body both in
                    structure and phenomena; and he considers it as at once consisting of erectile
                    tissue, and to be the seat of a species of erection more or less similar to that
                    of the cavernous body. This organ, he argues, becomes the occasional seat of a
                    motion of expansion and contraction; and he adduces the three following
                    conditions in which it takes place. Isŕ, In experiments; when in a living animal
                    the course of the blood in the splenic vein is arrested, the spleen swells, but
                    returns to its former dimensions as soon as the circulation is restored. <hi
                    rend="italic">2d,</hi> In diseases; the paroxysms of intermittent fever are <pb

                    accompanied with obvious enlargement of this organ, which subsides at the
                    conclusion of the paroxysm. <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> It appears that the same
                    phenomenon takes place during digestion.</p>
                <p>Sir Everard Home, with the assistance of the microscopic inspection of Μ. Bauer,
                    has made many observations on the structure of this organ. But his purpose
                    appears to have been more particularly directed to ascertain the phenomena of
                    its function and uses; and I cannot discover that his ideas on its intimate
                    structure, and the arrangement of its capillary system, are precise or
                    distinct.</p>
                <p>The most distinct examples, in short, of erectile tissue are to be found,
                    according to Bedard, in the spongy texture which surrounds the <hi rend="italic"
                    >urethra,</hi> in the cavernous body of the <hi rend="italic">clitoris,</hi> the
                    vascular structure of the <hi rend="italic">nymphae,</hi> and in the nipple of
                    the female. The structure of the lips in both sexes is not unlike. The veins of
                    these parts may be shown to be well marked and largely dilated at their origin,
                    so as to give the appearance of cellular net-work. The same disposition is
                    observed in the pulp of the fingers. It has been attempted to explain the
                    motions of the iris by supposing it to be formed of this erectile tissue; but
                    the justice of this conjecture seems doubtful.</p>
                <p>In the tissue now described it is manifest that the physiologist ought to place

                    erectile vessels. After the explanation of the anatomical structure above given,
                    it is superfluous to seek for any other cause except the arrangement of the

                    disease, or after death, is converted into a watery fluid susceptible of
                    coagulation. The existence of these vessels, he conceives, is established by the
                    watery exudation which appears in these several parts after a good injection of
                    the arteries.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>“Aqueum

                <p>As these minute canals, however, through which this injected fluid is believed to
                    percolate, have never been seen, or rendered capable of actual inspection, their
                    existence was denied by Mascagni, who ascribed the phenomena of exhalation to
                    the presence of inorganic pores in the arterial parietes, through which, he
                    imagined, the fluids transuded to the membranes or organs in which they were
                    found. This mechanism, which was equally invisible with the Hallerian, was, for
                    obvious reasons, denied by Bichat, who resolved to reject every opinion not
                    founded on anatomical observation, and to determine the existence of the
                    exhalants by this evidence alone. Obliged, however, to avow the difficulty of
                    forming a distinct idea of a system of vessels, the extreme tenuity of which
                    prevents them from being seen, he undertook to attain his object by what he
                    terms a rigorous train of reasoning.</p>
                <p>This consists in the effects observed to result from successful injections of
                    watery fluids, or of spirit of turpentine containing some finely levigated
                    colouring matter; from the phenomena of active hemorrhage, which Bichat
                    considers merely as exhalation of blood instead of serous fluid; and from
                    numerous considerations unfolded in the further prosecution of the subject. In
                    this manner he concludes, that the only points ascertained are, Isř, the
                    existence of exhalants; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> their origin in the capillary
                    system of the part in which they are distributed; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >3d,</hi> their termination on the surfaces of serous and mucous membranes, and
                    the outer surface of the corion or true skin.</p>
                <p>The exhalant vessels, the existence, origin, and termination of which he thus
                    proved, he distinguished into three classes. The first contains those exhalants
                    which are concerned in the production of the fluids which are immediately
                    removed from the body,—the cutaneous and the mucous exhalants; the second
                    contains those exhalants which are employed in the formation of fluids which,
                    continuing a given time on various membranous surfaces, are believed to be
                    finally taken again into the circulation by means of absorption; and the third
                    class consists of the exhalants concerned in the process of depositing
                    nutritious matter in the different tissues and organs of the human frame. This
                    arrangement is more distinctly seen in the following table.</p>

                    however, that the regularity of arrangement is the only advantage which it
                    possesses over the views of those authors whose method and opinions Bichat
                    professed not to follow. The existence of exhalants is as little proved <pb

                    the rigorous reasoning of Bichat as in the fanciful theories of Boerhaave, the
                    generalizing conclusions of Haller, or the bold supposition of lateral
                    porosities by Mascagni. This defect in his system has therefore been recognised
                    recently both by Magendie and Bedard, the first of whom, though he admits the
                    existence of exhalation as a process of the living body, allows that no
                    explanation of its mechanism or material cause has been given, and asserts that
                    Bichat has created the system of vessels termed exhalants; while the second
                    thinks that anatomical observation furnishes no evidence of their existence.</p>
                <p>The colourless capillaries, he observes, which are admitted by all, and the
                    existence of which is satisfactorily established by the well-known experiment of
                    Bleuland, proves nothing whatever concerning the existence of exhalant vessels;
                    for these colourless arteries are observed to terminate in colourless veins, and
                    there is no proof hitherto adduced of their proceeding further, or terminating
                    by open mouths. He admits that the fact of exhalations in the living body, of
                    nutrition, of transudation by arterial extremities, shows that these extremities
                    possess openings through which the fluids of exhalation, the materials of
                    nutrition, and the matter of injection, escape. But whether these openings are
                    found at the point at which the capillary arteries are continuous with veins, or
                    belong to a distinct order of vessels continued beyond these arteries, is a
                    question which observation has not yet determined, and which it perhaps is
                    unable to determine. Such is the present state of knowledge in relation to the
                    existence of exhalant arteries. While the process of exhalation is admitted, we
                    must avow, as Cruikshank did long ago, that we are unable to prove
                    satisfactorily the existence of any set of vessels, or any mechanism by which it
                    might be accomplished.</p>

                <p>In most situations of the human body, and especially in the vicinity of arterial
                    and venous trunks, there are found long, slender, hollow tubes, pellucid or
                    reddish, which present numerous knots, joints, or swellings in their course, and
                    to which the name of lymphatics or absorbents has been given. It is most
                    expedient to employ the former appellation only, as the latter implies the
                    performance of a function, the reality of which has been much questioned of late
                    years.</p>
                <p>Though Eustachius had seen the thoracic duct in the horse, and some slight traces
                    of a knowledge of vascular tubes, different either from arteries or veins, are
                    found in the writings of Nicolaus Massa, Fallopius, and Veslin-gius, the merit
                    of establishing their existence is generally ascribed to Caspar Asellius, a
                    physician of Pavia. This anatomist, who had in 1622 seen the white-coloured
                    tubes, then first named <hi rend="italic">lacteals,</hi> issuing from the
                    intestines of the dog, observed also a cluster of vessels less opaque near the
                    portal eminences of the liver,—an observation which he afterwards repeated in
                    the horse and other quadrupeds. The same vessels were also described and
                    delineated by Highmore.</p>
                <p>Passing over the uncertain and obscure hints given by Walaeus and Van Horne, the
                    first exact information after Asellius is that which relates to Olaus Rudbeck,
                    who, in 1650, is said to have seen them in a calf, and to have demonstrated the
                    thoracic duct, and the dilated sac, afterwards termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >receptaculum chyli.</hi></p>
                <p>Glisson informs us that Jolyffe had in 1652 imparted to him the knowledge of a
                    set of vessels different from arteries and veins; and it appears, from the
                    testimony of Wharton, that Jolyffe had demonstrated these vessels in 1650.<note

                <p>The lymphatic vessels consist, in the members, of two layers, a superficial and a
                    deep-seated one. The first is situate in the subcutaneous cellular tissue,
                    between the skin and the aponeurotic sheaths, and accompanies the subcutaneous
                    veins, or creeps in the intervals between them. A successful injection of these
                    superficial lymphatics will show an extensive net-work of mercurial tubes
                    surrounding the whole limb.</p>
                <p>The deep-seated layer of lymphatics is found chiefly in the intervals between the
                    muscles, and along the course of the arterial and venous trunks. In tracing both
                    layers of lymphatics to the upper, fixed, or attached end of the members, we
                    find they increase in volume and diminish in number. At the connection of the
                    members with the trunk, they are observed to pass through certain spheroidal or
                    spherical bodies, termed lymphatic glands or ganglions. The lymphatics of the
                    upper extremity, after passing through the glands of the armpit, terminate in
                    trunks, which open into the subclavio-jugular veins, one on each side of the
                    neck. Those of the lower extremity, after passing through the glands of the
                    groin, proceed with the common iliac vein into the abdomen, where they unite
                    with other lymphatics.</p>
                <p>The lymphatics of the trunk consist in like manner of two layers, a subcutaneous
                    and deeper seated one, distributed in the chest between the muscles and pleura,
                    and in the abdomen between the muscles and peritoneum. In the chest and belly,
                    each organ possesses a superficial layer of lymphatics distributed over its
                    surface, and pertaining to its membranous envelope; the other ramifying through
                    its surface, and pertaining to the peculiar tissue of the organ. This twofold
                    arrangement is most easily seen in the lungs, the heart, the liver, spleen, and
                    kidneys.</p>
                <p>In a similar manner are arranged the lymphatics in the external parts of the
                    scull; on the face, where they are very numerous; in the spaces between the
                    muscles; and on the neck, in which they pass through numerous glands. No
                    lymphatics, however, have been found in the brain, the spinal chord, their
                    membranous envelopes, the eye, or the ear.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039286?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9286-0729"/>
                <p>All the lymphatics hitherto known terminate in two principal trunks. One of
                    these, termed from its site <hi rend="italic">thoracic duct</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(ductus thoracicus,</hi> die Milchbruströhre, Ze <hi rend="italic"
                    >canal</hi><hi rend="italic">thoracique),</hi> is situate on the left side of
                    the dorsal vertebrae. It receives the lymphatics of the lower extremities, of
                    the belly, and the parts contained in it; those of great part of the chest, and
                    those of the left side of the head, neck, and trunk, and left upper extremity.
                    The other lymphatic trunk, which is situate on the right side of the upper
                    dorsal vertebrae, is formed by the union of the lymphatics of the right side of
                    the head, neck, right upper extremity, and some of those of the chest. Both of
                    these trunks open into the subclavio-jugular vein of each side.,</p>
                <p>That lymphatics terminate in branches of the venous system, has been asserted on
                    the authority of various observers. Steno, for instance, states that he traced
                    the lymphatics from the right side of the head, the chest, and pectoral
                    extremity, in animals, into the right axillary vein; and he gives delineations
                    of anastomotic connections of several lymphatics with the axillary and jugular
                    veins. Similar facts have been reported by Nuck, Richard Hale, Bartholin, and
                    Hartmann. Ruysch traced the lymphatics of the lung into the subclavian and
                    axillary veins; Dre-lincourt those of the thymus gland in animals into the
                    subclavians; and Hebenstreit saw those of the loins pass into the <hi
                    rend="italic">vena azygos.</hi></p>
                <p>Haller, though unwilling to deny the testimony of these observers, considers it
                    liable to various sources of fallacy, and doubts the direct communication of the
                    lymphatic and venous systems. By John F. Meckel the grandfather, nevertheless,
                    this communication was maintained, from the circumstance that he found mercury
                    injected into the lymphatics pass into the veins without any traces of
                    extravasation. From injecting the lymphatics also he found the <hi rend="italic"
                    >inferior</hi> cava full of mercury, not a particle of which had passed by the
                    thoracic duct into the <hi rend="italic">superior</hi> cava. Injecting
                    afterwards an indurated lumbar gland from a pelvic lymphatic, when he found its
                    lower half only was filled, he increased the pressure, with the view of filling
                    the minute vessels of the gland. When this was continued a little, he observed
                    the fluid metal pass into the <hi rend="italic">inferior</hi> cava, and thus
                    traced the minute lymphatics into the venous system.<note anchored="true"

                <p>These facts have received too little attention, from the circumstance that
                    Hewson, though not doubting them as stated by the author, regarded them as
                    liable to considerable fallacy, and, along with William Hunter, imputed the
                    effect in question entirely to extravasation. Both Hunterand Hewson, indeed,
                    appear to have injected veins from lymphatics in the same manner in which Meckel
                    did; but both saw reason to infer that extravasation had taken place.
                    Cruikshank, again, states that he never saw a lymphatic vessel inserted into any
                    other red veins than the subclavians and jugulars. The termination remarked by
                    Steno and his successors constitutes in truth the common trunk or lymphatic vein
                    admitted by Cruikshank,—a <hi rend="italic">thoracic duct</hi> of the right
                    side.</p>
                <p>Recently this mode of termination has been revived by Tiedemann and Fohmann,<note

                    through the thoracic duct. Μ. Lau th junior, of Strasburg, again, conceives that
                    he has demonstrated that lymphatics communicate with veins within the substance

                <p>The connections of the ends of lymphatics with the organs and tissues from which
                    they arise, termed their <hi rend="italic">origins,</hi> are completely unknown.
                    In some favourable instances the lymphatics of the intestinal canal are so
                    filled with a reddish or whitish fluid after the process of digestion has
                    continued for some time, that not only are their larger branches easily seen,
                    but by the aid of the microscope some of the smaller may be traced to their
                    commencement. This, which was ascertained by Crûikshank (p. 55 and 58), and
                    confirmed by Hewson, Bleuland, and Hedwig, has been contradicted by the
                    observations of Rudolphi and Albert Meckel. In all other parts, however, though
                    a successful injection may show the course and distribution of many of the
                    smallest lymphatics, yet no orifices are perceptible at the point at which they
                    seem to stop, and we are uncertain whether these points are their origins.
                    (Cruikshank.) Mere observation is here as unavailing as in regard to the
                    termination of exhalants. The continuation of lymphatics with arteries, unless
                    in the case of those which arise from the interior of arterial tubes (Lauth), is
                    not satisfactorily established. It has been conjectured, however, that their
                    ends or imperceptible origins are connected to the tissues to which they are
                    traced, and that the lymphatics arise in this manner from these tissues.</p>
                <p>The lymphatics are distinguished by being in general cylindrical in figure, and
                    by varying in calibre at short spaces. In this respect they differ from the
                    arteries and veins. It has been further justly remarked by Gordon, that the
                    middle-sized lymphatics are remarkably distinguished from the corresponding
                    parts of the arterial and venous system by three peculiarities: Hi, When two
                    lymphatics unite to form a third, the trunk thus formed is seldom or never
                    larger than either of them separately; <hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> their
                    anastomoses with each other are continual; and, 3rfZy, they seldom go a great
                    space without first dividing into branches, and then reuniting into trunks.</p>
                <p>The outer surface of a lymphatic is filamentous and rough, the inner smooth and
                    polished, like that of small veins. It is impossible to observe the structure of
                    these tubes in the middle-sized, or even in the large lymphatics; and anatomists
                    have generalΓy been satisfied with supposing that the structure of all of them
                    is similar to that of the thoracic duct, or some other large vessels equally
                    susceptible of examination. According to the observations of Cruikshank (chap,
                    xii.), which have been verified by Bichat, the thoracic duct presents, Isí, a
                    layer of dense, firm, filamentous or cellular tissue, exactly similar to that
                    found inclosing arterial and venous tubes, which the latter regards as foreign
                    to the vessel, but giving it a great degree of support and protection; <hi
                    rend="italic">2dly,</hi> a proper membrane, delicate, transparent, and moistened
                    inside by an unctuous fluid, which he seems inclined to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039299?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9299-0730"/> ascribe to
                    transudation. Muscular fibres, of which Sheldon speaks positively, Cruikshank
                    represents, though seen in some instances (chap, xii.), yet to be more generally
                    not demonstrable. Their existence, though admitted by Schreger and Soemmering,
                    is denied by Mascagni, Rudolphi, and J. F. Meckel, and, I may add, by Bichat and
                    Bedard. This account differs not much from that of Dr Gordon, who could not
                    recognise distinctly more than one coat, similar to the inner coat of veins. The
                    filamentous layer noticed by Biehat, and considered by Mascagni as an external
                    coat, is of course excluded.</p>
                <p>The knotted or jointed appearance of lymphatics is occasioned chiefly by short
                    membranous folds in their cavity, called <hi rend="italic">valves.</hi> These
                    folds are thinner than the venous valves; but they are equally strong, and have
                    the same shape and mode of attachment to the inside of the vessel. They are
                    generally found in pairs, but never three at the same point. A single valve is
                    sometimes found at the junction of a large branch with a trunk, or of a trunk
                    with a vein. According to Cruikshank, there is considerable variety in the
                    distribution of valves; but in general a pair of valves will be found at every
                    one-twentieth of an inch in lymphatics of middling size. In the larger
                    Jymphatics they are less numerous than in the small. The structure of these
                    valvular folds is as little known as that of the inner membrane, of which they
                    appear to be prolongations. According to Mascagni, they sometimes contain a
                    small portion of fine adipose substance.</p>
                <p>The tissue which forms the lymphatic tubes is strong, dense, and resisting; and
                    from the weight of mercury which they bear without rupture, it has been
                    generally concluded that they are stronger in proportion to their size than
                    veins. This tissue also possesses considerable elasticity.</p>
                <p>The opposite states of lymphatics during digestion and after long fasting, and
                    the phenomena of mercurial injections, prove that the tissue of which they
                    consist is distensible and contractile. Though it does not exhibit appearances
                    of muscular structure, it has been long supposed to be endowed with a property
                    analogous to irritability. Such is the inference which Hunter, Hewson,
                    Cruikshank, and others, have derived from various phenomena in the living and
                    recently dead tissue.</p>
                <p>Though Bichat doubts what he terms organic sensible contractility, yet he admits
                    insensible contractility as necessary to the functions ascribed to lymphatics.
                    Previous to his time Schreger, in different experiments, observed the first of
                    these qualities, in consequence of the application not only of acids, butter of
                    antimony, and alcohol, but even of hot water and cold air. Similar contractions
                    and relaxations have been induced by mechanical irritation. Such phenomena are
                    observed not only during life, but even after death; and if to this we add, that
                    the thoracic duct is often after death large and flaccid, though empty, but in
                    the living body is almost always contracted and scarcely visible, and that a
                    portion of it included between two ligatures, and punctured, quickly expels its
                    contents, it may be inferred that the lymphatic tissue possesses a considerable
                    degree of this organic property.</p>

                <p>This is the proper place to consider the structure of those bodies which are in
                    common language termed <hi rend="italic">hernels,</hi> to which anatomists have
                    applied the name of <hi rend="italic">lymphatic glands,</hi> and the French
                    anatomists have more recently given that of <hi rend="italic">lymphatic
                    ganglions.</hi> The usual appearance, figure, and situation of these bodies are
                    well known. In general they are spheroidal, seldom quite globular, and most
                    commonly their shape is that of a flattened spheroid. In different subjects, and
                    in subjects at different ages, they vary from two or three lines to an inch in
                    diameter. The medium rate is about half an inch. Their surface is smooth; their
                    colour grayish-pink, sometimes pale red, bluish, or of a peach-blossom
                    tinge,—varieties which seem to depend on degrees of bloody transudation; for,
                    when washed and slightly macerated, they assume the gray or whitish-blue colour.
                    In a few instances they are jet black,—a peculiarity which seems to depend on a
                    degree of black infiltration, or on the incipient stage of that change which has
                    been termed <hi rend="italic">melanosis,</hi> or melanotic deposition. The idea
                    that it may be derived from the carbonaceous matter suspended in the atmosphere
                    of great cities, has been shown by Cruikshank to be absurd. Its anatomical
                    possibility may be justly questioned.</p>
                <p>They are always situate in the celluloso-adipose tissue found in the flexures of
                    the joints. They are found in small number at the bend of the ham, and that of
                    the elbow; in the armpit and groin they are more numerous; in considerable
                    number in the cellular tissue of the lumbar region, before the <hi rend="italic"
                    >psoas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iliacus</hi> muscles; and they are most
                    abundant round the neck. The posterior mediastinum, and the cellular tissue
                    between the mesentery and vertebral column, abound with lymphatic glands
                    mutually connected in clusters.</p>
                <p>Each gland may be said to consist of a peculiar substance, inclosed in a thin
                    membrane like a capsule. The capsule is a thin, pellucid, colourless substance,
                    which is resolved by maceration into fine whitish fibres. It is very vascular;
                    and Mascagni appears to have detected absorbents in it. It is connected to the
                    proper substance by fine filamentous or cellular tissue. The capsule is
                    considered by Bedard as a fibro-cellular membrane. The proper substance of
                    lymphatic glands consists of a homogeneous pulp, in which injections have shown
                    numerous ramifications of minute vessels. As these vessels are injected from the
                    lymphatics which are seen to enter the body of the gland, they are believed to
                    be continuous with them, and to be lymphatics arranged in a peculiar manner.
                    These vessels are of two kinds, one entering the gland, called <hi rend="italic"
                    >vasa afferentia</hi> or <hi rend="italic">inferentia,</hi> entrant lymphatics;
                    the other quitting, are called <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia,</hi> egredient
                    lymphatics. This distinction is founded on the direction of the valves. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">vasa inferentia</hi> the free margins of the valves are turned
                    towards the gland; in the <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi> they are turned
                    from it.</p>
                <p>The number of entrant lymphatics varies from one to thirty, and, what is more
                    remarkable, very rarely corresponds with that of the cgredient lymphatics, which
                    are in general much fewer. Cruikshank states that he has injected fourteen
                    entrant lymphatics to one gland, to which only one egredient vessel
                    corresponded. W hen the entrant lymphatic reaches the gland, it splits into many
                    radiated branches, which immediately sink into its substance. The egredient
                    lymphatics are generally larger than the entrants.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of these vessels in the interior of the glands is best described
                    by Mascagni, whose observations are confirmed by Gordon. To see this well, it is
                    requisite to inject the entrant lymphatics of two glands in two different modes;
                    one with mercury, the other with wax, glue, or gypsum. After a successful
                    mercurial injection, the entrants are seen, before sinking in the gland, to
                    divide into two orders of branches. One of them, which belongs chiefly to the
                    surface or circumference of the gland, consists of large vessels, bent,
                    convoluted, and in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039312?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9312-0731"/> terwoven in every direction, communicating with
                    each other, and swelling out into dilated cells at certain parts; and of smaller
                    vessels, which form a minute net-work on the surface, and which seem to
                    terminate in the cells or distended parts of the larger vessels.</p>
                <p>From these distended parts or cells, again, arise many minute vessels, which,
                    after winding about on the surface of the gland, unite gradually, and form the
                    egredient vessels of the gland.</p>
                <p>The wax, glue, or gypsum injection is employed to show the deep-seated or central
                    vessels of the gland. The distribution of these is found to be quite the same as
                    that of the superficial vessels.</p>
                <p>The cells delineated by Cruikshank I am disposed to regard as mere dilated parts
                    of the lymphatic vessels which constitute the intimate structure of the
                    gland.</p>
                <p>These minute tubes are connected by delicate filamentous tissue, which is more
                    abundant in early life than afterwards.</p>
                <p>Injections show the existence of blood-vessels which accompany the convolutions
                    of the lymphatics in the glands; but no nerves have been found either in the
                    glands or their capsules.</p>
                <p>The white matter described by Haller and Bichat is not contained in the cellular
                    substance, but in the cells of the lymphatic vessels themselves.</p>
                <p>The three orders of tubes or canals, the anatomical characters of which have now
                    been completed, constitute what has been termed the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    distribution, and the part which it performs in all the processes of the living
                    body, both in health and during disease, must be easily understood. In every
                    texture and organ arteries and veins are found; and in all, except a few, the
                    art of the anatomist has demonstrated those colourless valvular tubes
                    denominated lymphatics. The arrangement of the former, especially in the
                    substance of the several textures, essentially constitutes what is termed the
                    <hi rend="italic">organization</hi> of these textures. Many anatomists have
                    imagined that eaeh texture has a proper matter, or <hi rend="italic"

                    which was conceived to consist of minute, inorganic, solid atoms. Whether this
                    opinion be well founded or not, it is perhaps of little moment to inquire. At
                    present it is certain that it is not susceptible of demonstration.</p>
                <p>The phenomena of injections, in which he . was eminently successful, led Ruysch
                    to entertain the opinion, that every substance of the animal frame consists of
                    nothing but vessels. This idea, though opposed by Albinus,<note anchored="true"

                    Academicarum</hi> lib. iii.</p></note> on the same grounds on which it was
                    advanced, was nevertheless revived by William Hunter, who believed that the
                    inorganic parts of animal bodies are too minute for sensible, or even
                    microscopical examination. In every part, however minute, älways excepting
                    nails, hair, tooth enamel, &amp;c. vessels may be traced; and even a cicatrix,
                    he demonstrated, is vascular to its centre.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                <p>By the aid of the microscope the researches of Lieberkuhn tended still more
                    powerfully to favour this opinion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    injection in every part and texture almost of the body, by Barth and Prochaska,
                    has led the latter to conclude that this opinion, understood in the ordinary
                    mode, is not tenable. Pro-chaska, who has investigated this subject with much
                    attention, thinks he is justified in dividing all the substances of the animal
                    frame into two,—those which may be injected, and those which cannot. In this
                    manner he regards skin, especially its outer surface, muscle, various parts of
                    the mucous membranes, the <hi rend="italic">ρia mater,</hi> the lungs, the
                    muscular part of the heart, the spleen, the liver, kidneys, and other glands, as
                    very injectible; but tendon, ligament, cartilage, &amp;c. as not
                    injectible.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Georgii

                    Without entering minutely into the merits of this distinction, or the inferences
                    which Prochaska deduces from it, it is sufficient, so far as all useful
                    knowledge is concerned, to infer that blood-vessels are an essential constituent
                    of every organic texture, however different; and if there be any other matter
                    inherent in such textures, it must be derived from these as a secretion. Nerve,
                    brain, muscle, osseous matter, and cartilage, are depositions or the product of
                    nutritious secretion from the respective arteries of these organized
                    substances.</p>

                    arrangement or these chords in the animal body is inconsistent with this, and
                    will be best understood when described separately.</p>
                <p>The nervous system of the animal body includes two general divisions. The first
                    of these, named brain and spinal chord, is collected in a single and indivisible
                    mass, and contained in a peculiar cavity, formed by part of the osseous system
                    of the animal,—the vertebral column, and cranium, in the vertebrated animals
                    generally. The second division of the nervous system, with which alone we are at
                    present concerned, is found in the form of long chords or threads mutually
                    connected, and running in various directions through the body in the mode of
                    ramification. To these the name of nervous trunks or chords, or simply nerves,
                    has been long applied.</p>
                <p>The structure of the nerves has been examined with different degrees of accuracy
                    and minuteness by a great number of anatomists. The more ancient authors, who
                    wrote at a period when observation was much corrupted by fancy, and most of
                    those who give descriptions in general systems, may be without much injustice
                    passed over in silence. It is sufficient to say that some good facts are given
                    in the works of Willis, Vieussens, Morgagni, and Mayer; that Prochaska,
                    Pfeffinger, the second Monro, and Fontana, are the first who professedly wrote
                    on the structure of the nerves; that the works of Reil,<note anchored="true"

                    and plexuses.</p>
                <p>Each nerve forms connections in three different ways. Isŕ, A nerve must be
                    connected to some part of the central mass by one of its extremities,—the
                    cerebral or spinal end; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> it must be connected to some
                    texture or organ, or part of an organ, by the other extremity,—the organic end;
                    and, 3&lt;Z, it may be connected to other nerves by a species of junction called
                    anastomosis <hi rend="italic">(ansa),</hi> anastomosing or uniting point. By
                    means of the first two connections, it is supposed to maintain a communication
                    between the central mass and the several organs; and by the latter it is
                    understood to be subservient to a more general and extensive intercourse, which
                    is believed to be necessary in various functions and actions of the animal
                    system.</p>
                <p>Every nerve consists essentially of two parts; one exterior, protecting, and
                    containing; the other interior, contained, and dynamic,<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>The term <hi rend="italic">dynamic</hi> is

                    structure.</p>
                <p>The first of these, which has been known since the time at least of Reil by the
                    name <hi rend="italic">neurilema (vευgov e∕λεω, e∕λt}μα,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nervi involucrum),</hi> or nerve-coat <hi rend="italic">(Nervenhaut,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Re'ú; Nervenhiille,</hi> Meckel), has the form and nature of a
                    dense membrane, not quite transparent, which is found on the outside of the
                    nervous chord or filament, and invests the proper nervous substance. It must
                    not, however, be imagined that the <hi rend="italic">neurilema</hi> forms a
                    cylindrical tube, in the interior of which the nervous matter is contained. This
                    latter disposition, if it actually exists, applies to the smaller nerves only,
                    and to some of those which go to tlιe organs of sensation,—a peculiarity which
                    we shall notice subsequently.</p>
                <p>Any large nervous trunk, for example the spiral or median of the arm, or the
                    sciatic nerve of the thigh, is found to be composed of several small nervous
                    chords placed in juxtaposition, and each of which, consisting of appropriate <hi
                    rend="italic">neurilema</hi> and nervous substance, is connected to the other by
                    delicate filamentous tissue. These, however, do not through their entire course
                    maintain the parallel disposition in respect to each other, but are observed to
                    cross and penetrate each other, so as to form an intimate interlacement of
                    nervous chords and filaments, each of which, however minute, is accompanied with
                    its investing neurilema. The neurilema, in short, may be represented as a
                    cylindrical membranous tube, giving from its inner surface many productions
                    forming smaller tubes <hi rend="italic">(canaliculi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>

                    matter is contained.</p>
                <p>Of this arrangement the consequence is, that each nerve or nervous trunk,
                    enveloped in its general neurilema, is composed, nevertheless, of a number, more
                    or less considerable, of smaller chord-like nervous threads <hi rend="italic"
                    >(funiculi ηervei,</hi> Prochaska; <hi rend="italic">chordae,</hi><hi

                    the nerve, by maceration and suitable preparation, may be resolved. Each chord,
                    again, or <hi rend="italic">nervestring,</hi> as Reil terms it, though invested
                    with a proper neurilem, may be further resolved into an infinite number of
                    minute filiform or capillary filaments <hi rend="italic">(fila,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">fibrilloe,</hi><hi rend="italic">Nervenfasern,</hi> Reil), which,
                    invested in a delicate covering, are understood to constitute the ultimate
                    texture of the nerve.</p>
                <p>This threefold division may be easily observed in the brachial and spiral nerves
                    of the arm, and still more distinctly in the sciatic in the thigh. The utility
                    of understanding the internal arrangement from which it results will appear
                    forthwith, when the structure of those parts termed ganglions and plexuses comes
                    under examination.</p>
                <p>Of this arrangement in different nerves, and in different regions, this membrane
                    undergoes great modification; and all opinions on its nature derived from
                    thickness or transparency are liable to considerable fallacy. Scarpa seems to
                    view it as connected, in anatomical origin and character, with the hard membrane

                    and time to the examination of its nature and structure than any other inquirer,
                    represents it as consisting of cellular substance, many bloodvessels, and some
                    lymphatics.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Reil, <hi

                    origin, but in all other situations as a species of cellular membrane.</p>
                <p>By Mayer the neurilema is accounted a fibrous tissue, for the following reasons.
                    Isŕ, It consists almost entirely of tendinous fibres, and is cellular only where
                    it is very thin. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> The transverse folds presented by

                    the neurilema, are of fibrous character, and are similar to those observed in
                    tendinous sheaths. <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> Several nervous productions are
                    actually converted into tendinous or fibrous filaments; for example, the brain
                    of the snail tribe, and the spinal chord both in these and other animals at the
                    <hi rend="italic">cauda</hi><hi rend="italic">equina. 4th,</hi> The neurilema is
                    either a continuation of the proper cerebral membrane <hi rend="italic">(piα
                    mater),</hi> or very similar to it; and this membrane is fibrous and aponeurotic
                    at the spinal chord, and even at its upper end, and, according to Mayer, forms
                    the denticulated ligament, which is a fibrous tissue.</p>
                <p>These views, which are the result, not of observation, but of hypothesis, it is
                    impossible to adopt. Its connection with the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi>
                    was disproved by Reil; and though its analogy with the denticulated ligament
                    were established, it would prove nothing regarding the neurilema. Upon the
                    whole, the idea of Reil is the most probable. According to the observations of
                    this anatomist, who examined the neurilema after fine and successful injection,
                    it is liberally supplied with blood-vessels. These proceeding from the
                    neighbouring arteries penetrate the filamentous sheath of the nerve; and,
                    immediately on reaching the neurilema, divaricating at right angles, generally
                    run along the nervous threads <hi rend="italic">(funes),</hi> parallel to them,
                    forming numerous anastomotic communications, and divide into innumerable minute
                    vessels, which penetrate between them into the minute neurilematic canals. So
                    manifold is the ramification, and so minute the distribution, that in these
                    canals not a particle of nervous substance is found which is not supplied with a
                    vessel.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>It appears, therefore, that the neurilema is a tissue of membranous form, with a
                    multiplied mechanical surface, liberally supplied with blood-vessels, from which
                    the nervous matter is secreted and nourished. It is impossible, indeed, to doubt
                    that, of the two parts which compose the nervous chord, it is the most perfectly

                    use to which it is subservient. Like that membrane, it sustains the vessels of
                    the nerve; it presents a multiplied surface, over which the vessels are
                    distributed; and, by penetrating deep into the body of the nerve, it conveys the
                    nutritious vessels in the most capillary form to the inmost recesses of the

                    as soon as it reaches the <hi rend="italic">canaliculi</hi> or grooves of the

                    still more peculiar in this respect. The instant it quits the optic commissure

                    general neurilema, which sends into the interior substance of the nerve various
                    membranous <hi rend="italic">septa</hi> or partitions, forming separate canals,
                    in which the nervous matter is contained. These partitions, however, are so
                    thin, that at first sight the optic nerve seems to consist merely of one.

                    rend="italic">3d,</hi> Lastly, wc may remark, that the auditory nerve, or the
                    soft portion of the seventh pair of most anatomical writers, is the only nerve
                    in which this covering cannot be traced.</p>
                <p>The neurilema is much thinner and more delicate in the nerves which are
                    distributed to the internal organs, as the lungs, heart, stomach, &amp;c.
                    (nerves of the organic life, great sympathetic and pneumogastric nerves, <hi

                    the muscular system.</p>
                <p>The second component part of the nervous chord or filament is the proper nervous
                    matter which occupies the cavity of the neurilematic canals. Little is known
                    concerning the nature or organization of this substance. It is whitish, somewhat
                    soft, and pulpy; but whether it consists of aggregated globules, as was
                    attempted to be established by Della Torre and Sir Everard Home, or of linear
                    tracts disposed in a situation parallel to each other, as appears to be the
                    result of the inquiries of Monro, Reil, and others, or of capillary cylinders
                    containing a transparent gelatinous fluid, as Fontana represents, seems quite
                    uncertain. It has been presumed, rather than demonstrated, that it resembles
                    cerebral substance. But this analogy, though admitted, would throw little
                    light.on the subject; for at present it is almost impossible to find two
                    anatomical observers who have the same views of the intimate nature of cerebral
                    substance itself. Whatever be its intimate arrangement, it appears to be a
                    secretion from the ncurilematĩc vessels. (Reil.)</p>
                <p>The structure of the nervous chord may be demonstrated in the following manner. .
                    When a portion of nerve is placed in an alkaline solution, the whole, or nearly
                    the whole, of the nervous matter is softened and dissolved, or may be washed out
                    of the neurilcmatic canals, which are not affected by this agent, and the
                    disposition of which may be then examined and demonstrated.<note anchored="true"

                    rend="italic">Nervorum,</hi> cap. i. p. 3 and 5.</p></note> Aqueous maceration
                    may likewise be advantageously employed to unfold this structure; for it
                    separates and decomposes the cellular tissue by which the neurilematic canals
                    are united, and subsequently occasions decomposir tion of the nervous substance,
                    while it leaves, at least for some time, the neurilema not much affected. When,
                    however, the maceration is too long continued, it is separated and detached like
                    other macerated textures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lastly,</hi> If a large nerve be placed in diluted acid for the
                    space of one or two weeks, the neurilema is gradually dissolved, and the nervous
                    matter becomes so much indurated and consolidated that it may be separated from
                    the contiguous chords in filaments with great facility.<note anchored="true"
                    place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to the experiments of Reil, nitrous
                    acid diluted with water answers best. Muriatic acid, though equal or even
                    superior in effecting solution of the neurilema, softens the nervous matter too
                    much, and separates the component filaments too completely. (öe <hi

                    16.)</p></note> In undergoing this change, the portion of nerve becomes much
                    shorter and considerably contracted,—is subjected, in short, to the process of
                    crispation; so that unless a large nerve like the sciatic be employed for the
                    experiment, it may be impossible to obtain the result in the most satisfactory
                    form. These experiments, with many others of the same nature, were first
                    performed by Professor Reil, and afterwards repeated and varied by Bichat and
                    Gordon. Personal repetition of them enables me to assert, that, when correctly
                    conducted, they never failed to give the results as described by these
                    authors.</p>
                <p>Nervous tissue, like all others, receives a proportion of what may be denominated
                    the systems of distribution,— cellular tissue and blood-vessels. In the
                    substance of the former, the disposition of which we have already remarked, we
                    find the more conspicuous branches of the latter distributed. In a more minute
                    and divided form they penetrate the neurilema and nervous substance. Reil, who
                    derived his conclusions from the result of delicate and successful injections,
                    perhaps over-rated the quantity of blood which in the sound state they convey;
                    for it is quite certain that, in the healthy state, hardly any red blood enters
                    the nervous tissue, as may be easily shown by exposing the sciatic nerve of a
                    dog or rabbit.</p>
                <p>No good chemical analysis of nervous matter has yet been published. Every
                    chemical examination of it has been conducted on the assumption that it is
                    analogous to cerebral matter. Of this, however, there is no direct proof. In the
                    analysis by Vauquelin, the neurilematic covering appears not to have been
                    detached,—a proceeding always necessary to obtain correct results in this
                    inquiry. The effects of acids and alcohol show that it contains albuminous
                    matter; but beyond this it is impossible at preτ sent to make any precise
                    statements.</p>
                <p>This description may communicate an idea of the structure of the nervous chord in
                    general. In particular situations this structure is considerably modified. The
                    modifications to which we allude occur under two forms—ganglions (die Knoten),
                    and plexuses (die Nervengeflechte). ∙</p>
                <p>Every ganglion consists essentially of three parts,—l∙s∕, an exterior covering;
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">2ċ7,</hi> a collection of minute nervous filament; and, 3√,
                    a quantity of peculiar cellular or filamentous texture, by which these filaments
                    are connected, and which constitutes the great mass of the ganglion.</p>
                <p>The ganglions are of two kinds, the spinal or simple, and the non-spinal or
                    compound. These two kinds of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039351?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9351-0734"/> bodies differ from each other,—Is/, in the
                    situation which they respectively occupy; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> in the kind
                    of envelope with which they are invested; <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> in the mode
                    in which the nervous filaments pass through them and from them. By Wutzer, who
                    considers the ganglion of Gasserius, the ciliary and the maxillary of Meckel, as
                    cerebral ganglions, they are divided into three sets, those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cerebral</hi> system, the <hi rend="italic">spinal</hi> system,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">vegetative,</hi> or those connected with the organs of
                    involuntary motion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>Void of the dense strong coat with which the others are invested, the cerebral
                    ganglions consist of soft secondary matter, connected to the filaments of one,
                    or at most two branches, and are arranged with less complexity. (Wutzer.)</p>
                <p>The spinal ganglions are said to possess two coverings, one of which resembles
                    the hard "cerebral membrane <hi rend="italic">(meninx dura),</hi> the other the
                    soft cerebral membrane <hi rend="italic">(meninx tenuis, pia mater).</hi> The
                    non-spinal or compound ganglions have also two coverings, which are merely
                    different modifications of filamentous tissue, less dense and compact than in
                    the former. Both these sets of ganglions being by maceration stripped of their
                    tunics, and deprived of the soft, pulpy, cellular matter, are resolved into an
                    innumerable series of nervous threads, most of which are minute and scarcely
                    perceptible: all are continuous with the nerve or nerves above and below the
                    ganglion. It appears that the nervous chord, when it enters the one apex of the
                    ganglion, begins to be separated into its component threads, which diverge and
                    form intervals, between which the delicate cellular tissue is interposed; and
                    that these filaments are subsequently collected at the opposite extremity of the
                    ganglion, where they are connected with the other nerve or nerves. Scarpa, to
                    whom we are indebted for most of the knowledge we possess on this subject,<note

                    which are untwisted and teased out at a certain part. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lastly,</hi> In the simple ganglions, the filaments of which they consist
                    invariably follow the axis of the ganglion; but in the compound ones they are
                    found to rise towards the sides and emerge from them; and upon this variety in
                    the direction and course of these filaments depends the variety of figure for
                    which these two orders of ganglions are remarkable. These nervous threads <hi
                    rend="italic">(stamina</hi><hi rend="italic">s. fila</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nervea),</hi> described by Scarpa, correspond to the medullary filaments <hi
                    rend="italic">(fila medullaria)</hi> of Wutzer. According to this anatomist,
                    these filaments, when about to enter the ganglion, lay aside their neurilem; yet
                    they are sufficiently tough to resist a certain degree of tension.</p>
                <p>Wutzer mentions a cluster of vesicles or cells <hi rend="italic">(cancelli)</hi>
                    in the filamentous tissue of the ganglion; but he was not enabled by any means,
                    mechanical or chemical, to ascertain their exact nature.</p>
                <p>The ganglions are well supplied with blood-vessels, derived in general from the
                    neighbouring arteries. The intimate distribution is represented by Wutzer to be
                    the following. The artery proceeding to a ganglion gives vessels to the
                    filamentous tissue, and, perforating the proper coat, is immediately ramified
                    into innumerable minute canals, the first order of which forms vascular nets on
                    the inner surface of the tunic, while the residual twigs penetrate the
                    flocculent texture, and the individual vesicles of the secondary or filamentous
                    matter of the ganglion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                <p>This short exposition of the structure of the ganglions shows the mistaken
                    notions of Johnstone, Unzer, Bichat, and others, on the structure and uses of
                    these bodies. Ls∕, The idea, first advanced by Johnstone and Unzer, adopted by
                    Metzger, Hufeland, Prochaska, Sue, and Harless, and afterwards applied with so
                    much ingenuity by Bichat, that the ganglions are so many nervous centres or
                    minute brains, is disproved by strict anatomical observation. <hi rend="italic"
                    >2d,</hi> That they are connected with the order of involuntary actions, and
                    influence these actions, is a gratuitous hypothesis, and may be true or false
                    without being necessarily the case. <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> Lastly, we
                    remark, as a circumstance of some importance, that the only difference between a
                    ganglion and any other part of a nervous chord is, that in tĥe former the minute
                    nervous filaments appear to be uncovered with neurilema, and lodged in a mass of
                    cellular tissue, which is inclosed in the neurilematic capsule; while in the
                    latter each nervous filament has its appropriate neurilema, and the cellular
                    tissue, instead of being within, is on its exterior, and connects it to the
                    contiguous filaments.</p>
                <p>In various situations two, three, or more nervous trunks or chords mutually unite
                    by means of some of their component threads, and after proceeding in this manner
                    for a short space, again separate, but not in the same number of original
                    trunks, or preserving the same appearance. In general, the number of chords into
                    which they finally separate is greater than that of which they consisted before
                    union. Three or four nervous trunks, for example, after uniting in this manner,
                    will form on their final separation five or six nerves or nervous chords; and it
                    is quite impossible to determine which of the latter order was derived from any
                    one or two of the former, or what number of individual chords it has received
                    from each. Between the two points, also, the first point of union and the last
                    of separation, many of the more component threads are detached from two or more
                    of their trunks, and, after first uniting with each other in an indistinct
                    net-work, are again united to two or more of the nervous chords near the point
                    at which they finally separate from the further end of union. This arrangement
                    has been termed a <hi rend="italic">plexus, plait,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >τveaving,</hi> in consequence of the manner in which the nervous chords are
                    interlaced or plaited together. The arrangement which we have noticed as
                    consisting of the more minute nervous threads has been called a <hi
                    rend="italic">smaller plexus (plexus minor).</hi> It is a subordinate plexus
                    within a larger one.</p>
                <p>The best and most distinct example of a plexus is that commonly named the
                    brachial or axillary. This, as is well known, is situate in the space contained
                    between the broad dorsal muscle <hi rend="italic">(latissimus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dorsi)</hi> behind, and the great pectoral muscle before, and is
                    formed in the following manner. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cervical
                    nerves, and the first dorsal, after forming the usual connections <hi
                    rend="italic">(ansae),</hi> pass downwards from the vicinity of the vertebrae
                    between the middle and anterior <hi rend="italic">scaleni</hi> muscles, and,
                    nearly opposite the lower margin of the seventh cervical <hi rend="italic"
                    >vertebra,</hi> or about the level of the first rib, begin to be united by the
                    component threads of each nerve. Threads of the fifth and sixth cervical unite,
                    sometimes to form a single chord, in other instances to be connected a short
                    space onward with threads of the seventh cervical in a similar manner. The
                    seventh and eighth form two kinds of union. When the seventh is large, it
                    divides almost equally into two chords orbranches, one of which is connected
                    first with the fifth and sixth, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039364?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9364-0735"/> afterwards
                    with the eighth, and with the first dorsal by interlacement of minute nervous
                    threads. The other either passes downward to form one of the separate brachial
                    nerves, or is also connected with the eighth cervical and first dorsal in a
                    plexiform manner.</p>
                <p>From this arrangement immediately arise the individual nervous branches which
                    form the nerves of the arm, and which are named brachial nerves. The
                    interlacement of minute nervous threads between the seventh and eighth cervical
                    and the first dorsal, is what Scarpa has termed the <hi rend="italic">plexus
                    minor.</hi> He says it is peculiar, in being quite uniform, and in connecting
                    those nervous branches which, from their subsequent destination, are called <hi

                <p>This description, though not generally applicable, will communicate some faint

                    arrangement, and configuration of this part of the nervous system, we refer to
                    the work of Scarpa already quoted.<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Annotation. Anatom,</hi> cap. iii. sect.

                <p>Plexiform arrangements are not confined to the exterior regions of the body. They
                    are more numerous internally; and almost all the organs of the chest and belly
                    have each a plexus, sometimes two, from which they derive their nervous
                    chords.</p>
                <p>Plexiform arrangements are generally situate in the neighbourhood of
                    blood-vessels, and in some instances inclosing considerable arterial trunks more
                    or less accurately. Thus the axillary plexus surrounds the axillary artery. The
                    coeliac artery is surrounded with the solar plexus; and the coronary, hepatic,
                    splenic, superior mesenteric, and renal, are also surrounded with plexiform
                    nervous filaments. In some instances these nervous filaments are so intimately
                    connected with the arterial tubes as to lead some anatomists to consider them as
                    forming a peculiar net-work surrounding the vessel, and to exercise great
                    influence on the circulation. (Wrisberg, Ludwig, and Haase.)</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that the structure of the nervous chords which form a plexus has
                    cither appeared so simple as not to demand particular attention, or is so
                    obscure as to be never noticed. Have the nervous chords and threads in such
                    situations their usual envelope? Is the nervous matter in the chords quite the
                    same as in other situations? Are there any other means of union, save the
                    nervous substance itself? We believe there is no doubt that every chord in a
                    plexus is provided with its ncurilema, as in other places; but this neurilema is
                    generally thinner and more delicate, and the general neurilema seems to be
                    wanting. Its mechanical properties of cohesion and resistance have not been
                    examined.</p>
                <p>The view now given of the structure and arrangement of the nervous plexus leads
                    Scarpa to consider them as nearly allied to ganglions. The same separation of
                    the component threads or filaments of the nerve or nerves, the same
                    interlacement, and the same or similar formation of new chords, appear to take
                    place in both orders of structure. A ganglion, indeed, he conceives, is a
                    condensed or contracted plexus; and a plexus is an expanded or unfolded
                    ganglion. The anatomical purpose of both appears to be simply a new arrangement
                    or disposition of nervous branches, previous to their ultimate distribution in
                    the tissues or organs to which they are destined. This is nothing but the
                    expression of a fact,—the interpretation in intelligible terms of an arrangement
                    of organized parts, without reference to any supposed uses.</p>
                <p>I have already shown what is meant by the organic end or termination of a nerve.
                    Although the nervous trunks are distributed in every direction through the
                    animal body, they do not terminate in all the tissues or organs
                    indiscriminately, and have been observed to be lost in the following only: Isí,
                    The proper organs of sensation, the eye, ear, nose, palate, and tongue; <hi
                    rend="italic">2dly,</hi> the muscles, whether subservient to voluntary or to
                    involuntary motion, as the heart, stomach, intestines, &amp;c.; <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">lòthly,</hi> bones.</p>
                <p>Nerves, therefore, are not organs of general distribution. According to Bichat,
                    they have never been traced to the following tissues :—the cartilages, both
                    articular and of the cavities; fibrous textures, viz. <hi rend="italic"
                    >periosteum, dura meninx,</hi> capsular ligaments, aponeurotic sheaths,
                    aponeurosis in general, tendon, and ligament; fibro-cartilaginous textures—those
                    of the external ear, nose, trachea, and eyelids (cartilages of other authors);
                    the semilunar cartilages of the knee-joint; those of the temporo-maxillary
                    articulation; those of the intervertebral spaces; marrow; the lymphatic
                    glands.</p>
                <p>To this wc may add the testimony of Walter of Berlin, who, after several
                    laborious researches, came to the conclusion that the pleura, the pericardium,
                    the thoracic duct, and the peritoneum, receive no nerves, and that, contrary to
                    the opinions of the most eminent recent anatomists, no nerves terminate in the
                    lymphatic or conglobate glands. Sometimes, indeed, these organs are perforated
                    by one or two twigs, as he often had occasion to observe; but they instantly
                    proceed to the next place assigned to them, and in which they are finally
                    lost.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"

                    1783.</p></note> If, after this conclusion of Walter, personal testimony can be
                    of any use, I may add, that I have examined the dura mater, the periosteum, and
                    most of the synovial membranes repeatedly, to discover nervous filaments in
                    them, and always without success; and I may say the same regarding the absence
                    or non-appearance of nerves in the peritoneum and pleura.</p>
                <p>The nerves have different uses in the different organs and tissues to which they
                    are distributed. 1. In the organs of sensation they receive the material
                    impressions made on the mechanical part of the organ. In the mucous membrane of
                    the nasal passages, the filaments of the olfactory nerve are affected by
                    aromatic particles, dissolved or suspended in the air. In the eye the retina
                    receives the last image formed by the transmitting powers of the transparent
                    parts. In the ear the terminations of the auditory nerve are affected by the
                    oscillations or minute changes in the fluid of the labyrinth, occasioned by the
                    motions of the tympanal bones. In the palate, tongue, and throat, the gustatory
                    nerves are affected by sapid bodies dissolved in the mouth, or applied in a
                    fluid state to the mucous membrane of that cavity. 2. In the system of voluntary
                    muscles, the nerves retain the action of the muscular fibres in a state of
                    uniformity and equality; and keep them obedient to the will. In the involuntary
                    muscles they appear merely to keep their action equable, regular, and uniform;
                    and in both they maintain a communication, consent, or harmony of action between
                    different parts of the same system of organs, or even between organs concurring
                    to the same function. 3. In the glandular organs the nerves certainly exercise
                    some influence over the process of secretion; but what is the exact nature of
                    this influence, or in what degree it takes place, is quite uncertain. This may
                    be said to comprehend all that <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039377?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9377-0736"/> is accurately kriown regarding the uses of the
                    nerves. Every other doctrine relating to sensibility, sympathy, irritability,
                    &amp;c. is either unfounded, not proved, or altogether imaginary and
                    hypothetical.</p>
                <p>In the foetus the nerves are developed with remarkable perfection. I cannot speak
                    from personal observation much earlier than the sixth month, when I have found
                    the nerves of the extremities and voluntary muscles large and distinct. At the
                    eighth month they are still more conspicuous. The anterior crural nerves are in
                    the form of flat white cords, one and a half line broad, and their branches like
                    good-sized threads. The sciatic is still more distinct. In the form of a thick
                    cylindrical cord, fully a line in diameter, and not unlike a piece of whipcord,
                    it is tough, stringy, and resists tension; and its constituent threads are well
                    marked. I immersed a portion of this nerve three and a half inches long in <hi
                    rend="italic">aquapotasses,</hi> when it first became much firmer and denser
                    than before, assumed in two days the satin fibrous appearance first described by
                    Fontana, and at length by solution of the nervous matter was separated into
                    chords and neurilematic canals. In this state, preserved in spirit of
                    turpentine, it conveys a tolerably correct idea of the arrangement of the
                    neurilematic canals.</p>
                <p>The nerves of the involuntary muscles are equally distinct in proportion. Those
                    of the lung, heart, and splanchnic system are distinct and manifest at the
                    eighth month.</p>
                <p>The neurilem is much more vascular in the foetus than in the adult. In the same
                    foetus of about eight months I found the neurilem of the sciatic nerve, from the
                    ischiatic notch to its divarication in the ham, covered with a thick net-work of
                    minute vessels, all injected with dark blood.</p>

                <p>The brain or central part of the nervous system may be regarded as a continuous
                    organ, consisting of three divisions,—the <hi rend="italic">convoluted,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">laminated,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">smooth</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">funicular</hi> portions. Of these divisions, which are
                    distinguished according to the peculiar external configuration of each, the
                    first part corresponds to what is named the brain proper <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cerebrum)</hi>; the second to the small brain <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cerebellum)</hi>; and the third to the oblong production contained in the
                    vertebral column, and known under the name of the <hi rend="italic">spinal
                    chord.</hi></p>
                <p>The convoluted portion presents two surfaces, an outer or convoluted, and an
                    inner or figurate. The laminated portion in like manner presents two surfaces,
                    an outer or laminated, and an inner or central. The third has only one surface,
                    which is exterior. These different surfaces, and their mutual relations, will be
                    more minutely explained afterwards. At present we shall examine its physical and
                    anatomical characters as an organic substance.</p>
                <p>’ The three divisions of the central part of the nervous system are composed of a
                    peculiar substance, which may be denominated <hi rend="italic">cerebral
                    matter,</hi> inclosed in delicate vascular membranes. To exhibit the external
                    characters of this substance, these membranes must be removed by careful
                    dissection. When this is done, and the brain is inspected on its surface, and
                    after sections, the cerebral matter is observed to vary in colour, consistence,
                    and intimate structure in different parts of the organ. These varieties of
                    cerebral matter are most easily distinguished, according to their colour, into
                    <hi rend="italic">white</hi> and <hi rend="italic">gray</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cinereous.</hi></p>
                <p>The white cerebral matter is of different shades in different parts of the brain.
                    Its most usual hue is orangewhite, or orange-white inclining to reddish white,
                    or purplish white. This is most distinctly recognised in the mcsolobe <hi
                    rend="italic">(corpus callosum),</hi> and in the body named <hi rend="italic"
                    >hippocampus major.</hi> The consistence of the white cerebral matter is
                    considerable. It is in general more tenacious and cohesive than the gray matter,
                    and when indurated is less brittle.</p>
                <p>A section made by a sharp scalpel appears smooth and of a uniform colour,
                    traversed by reddish points and streaks. It presents nevertheless different
                    appearances in different directions. In certain parts, for example the mesolobe,
                    it presents the appearance of minute capillary lines, arranged in parallel
                    juxtaposition, and giving what is named a fibrous appearance. In other regions,
                    however, as in the white matter of the optic chambers, this cannot be
                    recognised.</p>
                <p>White cerebral matter has been examined microscopically by Della Torre,
                    Prochaska, the Wenzels, Sir Everard Home, and Μ. Bauer.</p>
                <p>If we trust the observations of Father Della Torre, the white and gray substance
                    of the brain, <hi rend="italic">cerebellum, medulla oblongata,</hi> and spinal
                    chord, consist of an aggregation of infinite transparent globules, floating in a
                    pellucid, crystalline and somewhat viscid fluid. The only difference which he
                    admits among the matter of these several parts is, that he represents the
                    globules to be largest in the brain, smaller in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cerebellum,</hi> and still more minute in the <hi rend="italic">medulla
                    oblongata</hi> and spinal chord. The arrangement of these globules in the
                    central portion of the nervous system he further represents to be
                    promiscuous.</p>
                <p>Prochaska placed on a thin plate of glass minute slices of cerebral matter, so
                    thin that they were translucent; and in this state he found it consist of
                    innumerable globular particles, united by delicate, pellucid, flocculent matter,
                    like filamentous tissue. These globules varied in size even in the same part of
                    the brain. In general, however, he found them both in the brain and cerebellum
                    to be rather more than eight times smaller than the globules of the blood. He
                    was unable to ascertain any thing regarding their intimate structure.</p>
                <p>The Wenzels found the white cerebral matter to consist of very minute globules,
                    or roundish atoms, resembling spherical cells containing proper medullary or
                    white cerebral substance. The dimensions of these globules they did not attempt
                    to estimate; but represent them in general as exceedingly minute, and all of the
                    same size. They could not recognise any connecting medium. The globular
                    appearance was retained in portions of brain exposed to the action of alcohol
                    and muriatic acid, and in those even which had been dried after induration in
                    alcohol.</p>
                <p>Μ. Bauer placed a thin slice of white cerebral matter on a plate of glass
                    previously moistened, and allowing a drop of water to fall on it, held
                    obliquely, and thereby to diminish its cohesion, brought into distinct view
                    innumerable loose globules, many fragments of fibres of single rows of globules,
                    and bundles of fibres, some of considerable length.</p>
                <p>The use of the water in this mode of examination is to dĩssolveand
                    removeaviscid,gelatinous,semifluid substance, on which the adhesive properties
                    of the white matter seem to depend. If the water is not used, the brain adheres
                    to the glass, and the globular appearance cannot be recognised.</p>
                <p>These globules vary in size from to <hi rend="italic">-ŗfyj</hi> of an inch in
                    diameter; the general or average size being Those of the white matter are
                    largest, that is 2⅛0∙ are translucent, whitish, and arranged in lines or rows of
                    singleglobules, which are attached to each otherby the viscid semifluid mucus.
                    The strings or rows of globules are connected into bundles <hi rend="italic"

                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039390?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9390-0737"/>
                <p>There is reason to believe that the translucency of the globules depends on an
                    albuminous fluid, which on immersion in alcohol or acids is coagulated, and
                    thereby rendered opaque.</p>
                <p>When a portion of white cerebral matter is immersed in boiling oil, or is steeped
                    for a few days in alcohol, dilute nitric or muriatic acid, or in a solution of
                    corrosive sublimate, it acquires great firmness and solidity, and may be torn or
                    broken like a piece of cheese, which it could not be before, in consequence of
                    its tenacity. Certain parts, for example the mesolobe, appear then to be
                    distinctly fibrous, or to consist of long capillary lines placed in close
                    juxtaposition. On the length of these filaments or fibrils, however, nothing is
                    ascertained. It is also undetermined whether the white cerebral matter is in all
                    parts arranged in the fibrous manner.</p>
                <p>White cerebral matter is well supplied with bloodvessels. These, indeed, are
                    minute; but they consist both of vessels containing red and colourless blood.
                    The division of these vessels gives rise to the appearance of red points <hi
                    rend="italic">(punctula)</hi> and streaks, which are exhibited on the surface of
                    sections. It is believed to be less vascular than the gray cerebral matter.</p>
                <p>On the chemical constitution of white cerebral matter we possess no accurate
                    information; all the chemical analyses hitherto made having been directed to
                    brain, without distinction of its different varieties. From the circumstance,
                    however, of its becoming indurated on immersion in alcohol, acids, and solutions
                    of corrosive sublimate, it is manifest that it contains much albumen. It is
                    rendered yellow by nitric acid. If a portion of indurated brain be placed in the
                    sun, or in a warm atmosphere, an oily or unctuous fluid exudes from its surface,
                    which shows that it contains fatty matter; and if brain be immersed in ether,
                    this fatty matter is partially removed. From the analysis of Vauquelin, it may
                    be inferred that the white cerebral matter contains the 4∙43 per cent, of white
                    adipose substance found by that chemist in his analysis. It is also believed to
                    contain phosphorus.</p>
                <p>The gray or cinereous cerebral matter, though variable in colour like the white,
                    is in general a mixture of ash-gray and wood-brown, darker than the former, but
                    lighter than the latter. The colour varies at different ages. It is light in
                    early life, and deeper as life advances.</p>
                <p>The gray cerebral matter is softer and less viscid and tenacious than white
                    cerebral matter. It is distinctly granular, both in the external surface and
                    when torn or broken. This appearance, however, is most distinctly recognised
                    after induration in alcohol or acidulous liquors. In the convoluted part of the
                    brain, where it is most abundant, it does not present the fibrous or parallel
                    linear arrangement, and is merely an aggregated mass of numerous minute
                    granules. It is uncertain whether it presents the fibrous arrangement in other
                    parts of the brain. An appearance of this kind is recognised in the unciform
                    bundle at the inner end of the fissure of Sylvius, and also in the streaked
                    bodies and the annular protuberance. But the appearance alluded to seems to
                    depend not on the genuine fibrous arrangement of the granules of the gray
                    matter, but merely on the gray matter being deposited in streaks and lines
                    between the white. Meckel nevertheless maintains that the gray matter is also
                    fibrous.</p>
                <p>According to the observations of Sir Everard Home and Μ. Bauer, the gray cerebral
                    matter consists of minute globular atoms, smaller than those of the white
                    matter, or varying from - <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi> √0θ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> to</hi> M⅛o <hi rend="superscript"> an ιnc</hi> ^ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1 ln</hi> diameter. These globules appear to be united,
                    though more loosely, by a sero-albuminous fluid of a yellower tint than that of
                    the white matter. Home supposes this albuminous fluid to be less abundant in the
                    gray matter.</p>
                <p>Gray cerebral matter is well supplied with blood-vessels, which are large and
                    numerous. It must not be imagined, however, that all the vessels which are
                    observed to enter this substance are therefore distributed to it. These large
                    vessels necessarily penetrate the gray matter of the convoluted surface before
                    they reach the white matter in the centre; and though they send branches to the
                    former, they are ultimately distributed to the latter. The gray cerebral matter
                    has been supposed to be more vascular than the white; but the circumstance now
                    stated renders this doubtful. The statement of Sir Everard Home, that “the
                    finest and most delicate branches of the arteries and veins are only found in
                    the eortical, í. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> the gray substance,” is contradicted
                    by observation; for the vessels are certainly in general larger and more
                    distinct in this than in the white matter. But if they are larger in the former,
                    they are more numerous in the latter. On the whole, perhaps, there is little
                    difference between the vascularity of the white and gray substance of the
                    brain.</p>
                <p>The chemical constitution of gray cerebral substance has not been accurately
                    examined. The results of analysis show, nevertheless, that it contains
                    albuminous matter to the amount of about 7 per cent., with 0∙70 of a peculiar
                    red adipose matter, which is probably the cause of the peculiar colour.</p>
                <p>These two varieties of cerebral matter are combined in various modes and
                    proportions in the brain. In general the gray matter is found on the exterior,
                    for instance on the convoluted surface of the brain, and on the laminated
                    surface of the cerebellum; while the white matter is arranged in the central
                    parts. Gray matter, nevertheless, is found in the interior, in the streaked
                    bodies and optic <hi rend="italic">thalamus,</hi> and in the moriform bodies <hi
                    rend="italic">(corpora</hi><hi rend="italic">dentata)</hi> of the cerebellum and
                    olivary eminences.</p>
                <p>Besides the two varieties of substances now mentioned, a third, of a deeper
                    shade, is found in the brain. Thus, in the centre of the cerebral limbs is a
                    quantity of cerebral matter of a dark or ink-spotted tint, which Vicq d’Azyr
                    therefore named the black spot <hi rend="italic">(locus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >niger)</hi> of the limbs of the brain. The nature of this black spot, which is
                    quite uniform, is entirely unknown. It appears merely to be a modification of
                    the gray matter.</p>
                <p>A yellow-coloured substance has also been supposed to exist in the <hi
                    rend="italic">centrum</hi><hi rend="italic">semicirculare geminum,</hi> a narrow
                    band between the striated body and optic thalamus. This substance is certainly
                    firmer than the adjoining white and gray matter, and it is further peculiar in
                    possessing a sort of tint between wax-yellow and wine-yellow. It is highly
                    vascular. Of its other peculiarities, however, we know nothing; and we must be
                    satisfied with regarding it as an anomalous species of aninχal substance,
                    approaching to gray cerebral matter in colour, but infinitely firmer and more
                    tenacious.</p>
                <p>The parts named pituitary and pineal glands present several peculiarities
                    deserving attention; but these more properly come under the head of Special than
                    of General Anatomy.</p>

                    it is unnecessary to enumerate those obvious characters which are easily
                    recognised by the most careless observer. A portion of muscle, when carefully
                    examined, is found to consist of several animal<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039403?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9403-0738"/> substances. It
                    is traversed by arteries and veins of various size; nervous twigs are observed
                    to pass into it; it is often covered by dense whitish membranous folds <hi
                    rend="italic">(fasciae),</hi> or by serous or mucous membranes, all which shall
                    be examined afterwards; and it is found to contain a large proportion of
                    filamentous tissue. But it is distinguished by consisting of numerous fibres
                    disposed parallel to each other, and which may be separated in the same manner
                    by proper means. The appearance, arrangement, and characters of these fibres
                    demand particular fiotice.</p>
                <p>According to Prochaska, muscle in all parts of the body may be resolved, by
                    careful dissection, into fibres of great delicacy, as minute as silk filaments,
                    but pretty uniform in shape, general appearance, and dimensions. Their diameter
                    appears not to exceed the <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> 4</hi><hi

                    whatever be their length. They seem all more or less flattened or angular, and
                    appear to be solid diaphanous filaments. Prochaska, not doubting that these
                    muscular threads <hi rend="italic">(fila carnea)</hi> are incapable of further
                    division, terms them <hi rend="italic">primary muscular fibres.</hi></p>
                <p>The microscopical examination of the atomic constitution of the muscular
                    filament, which was first attempted by Leeuwenhoeck, and afterwards prosecuted
                    by Della Torre, Fontana, Monro, and Prochaska, has been recently revived by Μ.
                    Bauer, the indefatigable assistant of Sir E. Home. From the observations of this
                    accurate inquirer, each muscular filament appears to consist of a series of
                    globular or oblong spheroidal atoms, disposed in a linear direction, and
                    connected by a transparent, elastic, jelly-like matter. <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Trans.</hi> 1818, 1826.)</p>
                <p>The primary muscular fibres are placed close and parallel to each other, and are
                    united in every species of muscle into bundles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fasciculi,</hi><hi rend="italic">lacerti)</hi> of different but determinate
                    size; and according as these bundles are large or small, the appearance of the
                    muscle is coarse or delicate. In the deltoid the bundles are the largest. In the
                    <hi rend="italic">vasti,</hi><hi rend="italic">glutoei,</hi> and large pectoral
                    muscles the bundles are greatly larger than in the <hi rend="italic">psoae.</hi>
                    In the muscles of the face, of the ball of the eye, of the hyoid bone, and
                    especially in those of the perineum, these bundles are very minute, and almost
                    incapable of being distinguished. The number of ultimate filaments which compose
                    a bundle varies in different muscles, and probably in different animals. In a
                    muscular fibre of moderate size in the human subject, Prochaska estimates them
                    to vary from 100 to 200; and, in animals with larger fibres, at double, triple,
                    or even four times that number. There is reason to conclude, from correct
                    microscopic observation, that the largest do not exceed the ⅛ of an inch, and
                    that the smallest are not less than ⅛</p>
                <p>By cutting a muscle across, these bundles are observed to differ, not only in
                    size, but in shape. Some are oblong and rhomboidal, others present a triangular
                    or quadrangular section, and in some even the irregular pentagon or polygon may
                    be recognised.</p>
                <p>These bundles are united by filamentous tissue of various degrees of delicacy, as
                    may be shown by the effects of boiling; and the muscle thus formed is penetrated
                    by arteries, veins, and nervous twigs, and is inclosed by filamentous tissue,
                    which often contains fat.</p>
                <p>This fascicular arrangement appears to be confined to the muscles of voluntary
                    motion. It is not very distinct in the heart or diaphragm; and in the urinary
                    bladder and intestinal canal it is not recognised. Nor is the parallel
                    arrangement of the ultimate filaments always strictly observed in the
                    involuntary muscles. The component fibres of this order of muscles are often
                    observed to change direction, and unite at angles with each other. This fact,
                    which was observed by Leeuwenhoeck,has been verified by Prochaska.</p>
                <p>The colour of muscle varies. In man and the mammiferous animals, at least adult,
                    it is more or less red; in many birds and fishes it is known to be whitish; in
                    young animals it is grayish or cream-coloured; and the slender fibres which form
                    the middle coat of the intestines in all animals are almost colourless. The
                    colour of the muscles of voluntary motion in man is red or fawn; but repeated
                    washing or maceration in alcohol or alkaline fluids renders them much paler.</p>
                <p>The examination of the physical properties of muscle has occupied the industry of
                    Muschenbroek, Croone, Browne Langrish, Wintringham, and others of the
                    iatro-mathematical school. I cannot perceive that minute knowledge of these
                    properties is of much moment to the elucidation either of its sound or its
                    morbid states. Amidst the variable results obtained in such an inquiry, the only
                    certain point is, that muscular fibre has less tenacity and mutual aggregation
                    than most other tissues. It sustains much less weight and force of tension
                    without giving way.</p>
                <p>Chemical analysis has not yet furnished any satisfactory results on the nature of
                    muscular tissue; but the general results of the numerous experiments already
                    instituted show that muscle contains fibrin, albumen, gelatine, extractive
                    matter (osmazome), and saline substances. It is difficult to say how far the
                    gelatine is to be regarded as proper to muscle, or derived from the filamentous
                    tissue in which it certainly exists. The saline matters are common to muscle
                    with most other organic substances. There is reason to believe that fibrin in
                    considerable quantity, and albumen and osmazome in smaller proportion, are the
                    proper proximate principles of muscle. Though the various proportions of these
                    principles have been stated in numbers by chemists, it is impossible in the
                    present condition of animal chemistry to place any reliance on them. It is also
                    to be remembered that the relative proportion of the proximate principles varies
                    at different periods of life. In early life the muscular fibre contains a large
                    proportion of gelatine, and very little albumen, fibrin, or osmazome. In adult
                    age, however, the gelatine is very scanty, and the fibrin is abundant. The
                    albumen and gelatine found in muscle seem to be derived chiefly from the
                    filamentous tissue and the aponeurotic intersections.</p>
                <p>During life the muscular fibre possesses the property of shortening itself or
                    contracting under certain conditions. These may be referred to the following
                    heads: 1∙⅛ The will in the voluntary muscles; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> proper

                <p>The inquiry into the properties peculiar to muscles, and the influence of the
                    brain and nerves over muscular contraction, form an interesting subject of
                    investigation, on which many facts have been communicated since the time of
                    Haller and Whytt, and especially within the last ten years by Nysten, Le

                <p>The muscles have also been distinguished, according to their mechanical shapes,
                    into long muscles <hi rend="italic">(musculi longi, vel teretes),</hi> broad
                    muscles <hi rend="italic">(musculi lati),</hi> and irregular muscles, or those
                    of mixed form. The long muscles are found chiefly in the extremities; the broad
                    muscles in the trunk; and those of irregular shape either in the trunk, or
                    passing from this to the extremities. From the direction of their fibres,
                    several of them are distinguished into penniform and semipenniform.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Sinew, Tendon. (</hi><hi rend="italic">Tendo.)</hi> ’ Sinew or
                    tendon was united by Bichat with ligament, fascia, aponeurosis, and periosteum,
                    under the general name of <hi rend="italic">fibrous system</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the substance of this arrangement has been adopted by Gordon,
                    Meckel, and Bedard. From personal observation, however, I am inclined to regard
                    tendon as essentially distinct, at least in the present state of knowledge, from
                    these substances. Examined anatomically, it does not bear a very close
                    resemblance to any of them; and in its known chemical properties it is
                    considerably different.</p>
                <p>The appearance of this substance must be familiar. Almost cylindrical in shape,
                    but flattened at the muscular end, and tapering where inserted, a tendon
                    consists of numerous white .lines as minute as hairs, of satin-like glistening
                    appearance, placed parallel and close to each other. A tendon is easily divided,
                    and torn into longitudinal or parallel portions; and by the forceps very minute
                    fibres may be detached and removed with ease, its whole length. These facts show
                    the great tenacity of this tissue, and the regular parallelism with which the
                    component fibres are united. The last circumstance distinguishes them completely
                    from ligaments and periosteum, in which the fibres cross in all directions, and
                    in consequence of which these tissues cannot be so easily split or separated.
                    These fibres are united by filamentous tissue.</p>
                <p>Tendon is softened and more easily separable by maceration in water or alkaline
                    fluids; it is crisped by acid fluids, and rendered translucent by immersion in
                    oil of turpentine. It has not been injected, but it is presumed to have
                    blood-vessels and absorbents. No nerves have been traced into it.</p>
                <p>Tendon when boiled becomes soft and large, assumes the appearance of a
                    transparent gelatinous substance, and finally, if the boiling be continued, is
                    dissolved and converted into gelatine. This fact, which is well known to cooks,
                    who prepare jellies from tendinous parts of young animals, shows that tendon
                    consists principally of gelatine, disposed in an organized form.</p>
                <p>A species of flattened tendons, to which the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >aponeurosis</hi> has been given, may justly be united with this tissue. The
                    best examples are in the aponeurotic or tendinous expansion of the external
                    oblique muscle of the abdomen, the aponeurotic part of the occipito-frontal
                    muscle of the head, and the upper or broad end of the <hi rend="italic">tendo
                    Achillis.</hi> The anatomical structure and the chemical properties of each of
                    these varieties of animal substance are quite similar, and somewhat different
                    from that which has been termed <hi rend="italic">fascia.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >White Fibrous System. Ligament.</hi><hi rend="italic">(Δεσμός,</hi><hi

                    >Fascia.</hi></p>
                <p>Against the formation of this order of tissues fewer objections can be urged,
                    though ligament and periosteum undoubtedly furnish its most perfect examples;
                    and it may be doubted whether <hi rend="italic">fascia</hi> ought to be referred
                    to it, or arranged with tendon and aponeurosis. The <hi rend="italic">dura
                    mater,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">tunica albuginea,</hi> and the fibro-synovial
                    sheaths, are to be regarded as compound membranes.</p>
                <p>Ligament and periosteum are easily shown to consist of strong whitish or gray
                    fibres, as minute as threads or hairs, interwoven together in various
                    directions, and thus forming an animal substance which is not to be split or
                    torn asunder as tendon; but when ruptured by extreme force presents an irregular
                    ragged surface or margin. Maceration in water or alkaline fluids separates the
                    component fibres, and shows their irregular disposition more distinctly. They
                    are crisped by affusion of boiling water, or immersion in acids; and they become
                    translucent by immersion in oil of turpentine.</p>
                <p>The properties of this tissue are chiefly physical. Those which are vital are
                    referable to its organization and nutrition. That it is powerfully resisting,
                    and is one of the toughest and strongest tissues in the animal body, is evinced
                    not only by the numerous experiments recorded in the writings of the
                    iatro-mathematical physiologists, but by the barbarous mode of punishment by
                    rending the limbs asunder by horses. It is supposed to possess the exhaling ends
                    of arteries and colourless veins. No nerves have been recognised; and Bichat
                    expresses his ignorance of absorbents being traced into it.</p>
                <p>Ligament when boiled yields a small portion of gelatine, but obstinately resists
                    the action of boiling water, and retains both its shape and tenacity or
                    cohesion. The crispation which it undergoes in boiling water, alcohol, and
                    diluted acids, seems to indicate that albuminous matter forms its chief chemical
                    principle.</p>
                <p>As to their mechanical shape, the ligaments are divided by Bichat into two sorts;
                    those in regular and those in irregular bundles. The former comprehends all the
                    distinct clusters of ligamentous structure, which, sometimes in a cylindrical,
                    sometimes in a flattened shape, connect the articulating ends of bones, and form
                    the lateral ligaments of the various articulations. The latter consists of those
                    loose parcels of ligamentous fibres which are found in various regions of the
                    skeleton, not in regular cylindrical or longitudinal bands, but irregularly
                    connecting bones not admitting of articular motion; for instance, at the <hi
                    rend="italic">symphysis pubis</hi> and the sacro-iliac junction. The division of
                    Bedard into articular, non-articular, and mixed, is more comprehensive and more
                    natural. The first are those which connect the articular extremities of
                    different bones. The second are those which, attached to different parts of the
                    same bone, convert notches into foramina, as in the orbitar arch and the
                    supra-scapular hollow, or close openings, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039429?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9429-0740"/> give
                    attachment to muscles, as the obturator ligament. The last are those which, like
                    the sacro-ischiatic or the interosseous ligaments of the fore-arm and leg,
                    connect bones susceptible of little or no motion, and especially give attachment
                    to muscles. The two latter species of ligaments approach closely in their
                    characters, physical and anatomical, to periosteum, and are probably to be
                    regarded as modifications of this membrane.</p>
                <p>The articular or perfect ligaments are naturally divisible into two
                    subgenera,—the capsular and the funicular.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">capsular</hi> ligaments, or the fibrous capsules (Bichat),
                    consist of cylindrical ligamentous sheaths attached all round to the ends of the
                    articulating bones, and intimately interwoven with the periosteal tissue.
                    Consisting essentially of fibro-albuminous matter strongly compacted, they are
                    surrounded by cellular tissue, or rather celluloso-adipose tissue, and are lined
                    internally by synovial membrane. Though the most perfect examples of the
                    capsular form of ligament are presented in the scapulo-humeral and coxo-femoral
                    articulations, less complete ones, nevertheless, are seen in the other joints.
                    In those of the knee and elbow, an arrangement of this kind may be demonstrated;
                    and minute capsules may be shown to connect the oblique articular surfaces of
                    the vertebrae with each other.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Yho funicular</hi> ligaments, which consist of round chords or
                    flat bands, are employed in connecting the articular ends of bones either
                    without or within the cavity of the joint. Of those of the former description,
                    the best examples are seen in the elbow and knee joints, and in the wrist and
                    ankle, where they are termed <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi> ligaments <hi
                    rend="italic">(l. lateralia,</hi><hi rend="italic">accessoria).</hi> Of the
                    latter instances are the round ligaments <hi rend="italic">(ligamenta
                    teretia)</hi> of the shoulder and hip joints, and the crucial ligaments of the
                    knee-joint. These receive an investment of synovial membrane.</p>
                <p>Of the white fibrous tissues, one of the most important is that denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">fascia.</hi> Consisting in intimate structure of long fibrous
                    threads placed in parallel juxtaposition, sometimes obliquely interwoven and
                    closely connected by filamentous tissue, it forms a whitish membranous web,
                    variable in breadth, of some thickness and great strength. Fascia is perhaps,
                    not excepting the skin, the most extensively distributed texture of membranous
                    form in the animal body. It not only covers, if not the whole, at least by far
                    the greatest part of the muscles of the trunk and each limb, but it sends round
                    each muscle productions by which it is invested and supported, and even
                    penetrates by minute slips into the substance of individual muscles. Of several
                    of the large muscles it connects the component f∕arts, as is seen in the <hi
                    rend="italic">recti abdominis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> to many it affords
                    points of origin or insertion; and to all it furnishes more or less investment
                    and support. Most of the tendons, especially the flexor arid extensor tendons,
                    are inclosed by it; and their synovial sheaths derive from it their exterior
                    covering. At the extremities of the bones it is connected with the ligaments and
                    periosteum, with which it is closely interwoven; and it forms a general
                    investment to the articular apparatus.</p>
                <p>Though fascia may thus be viewed as one membranous web consisting of many parts
                    all directly connected with each other, it is the practice of anatomists to
                    distinguish its divisions according to the region which they occupy. Thus, in
                    the fore-part of the neck and chest is found a fascia, the relations and uses of
                    which have been well described by Mr Allan Burns. In the cervical region we find
                    a firm fascia descending from the occipital bone along the vertebrae, covering
                    and connecting the muscles of each side till it reaches the loins, where, in the
                    form of a thick strong membrane, it forms the <hi rend="italic">lumbar fascia
                    (fascia</hi><hi rend="italic">lum</hi><hi rend="italic">borum).</hi> It may
                    further be traced over and between the <hi rend="italic">glutaei</hi> muscles,
                    connected afterwards with the broad femoral fascia <hi rend="italic">(fascia
                    lata),</hi> and thence over the knee and leg to the foot. Much in the same
                    manner a membranous web, thinner and more delicate, but of the same structure,
                    may be traced from the chest along the upper extremity, till at the wrist it is
                    identified with the annular ligament, and in the hand with the palmar fascia. In
                    all these situations the general fascial envelope sends slips or productions <hi
                    rend="italic">(fasciae</hi><hi rend="italic">intermusculares)</hi> between the
                    muscles, and into their substance.</p>

                    differ considerably from the articular ligaments and the periosteum, and
                    suggested to Bedard the necessity of establishing a particular order of fibrous
                    tissues, to which he applies the denomination of <hi rend="italic">yellow or
                    tawny fibrous system.</hi> Under this he includes also the proper membrane of
                    the arteries; that of the veins and of the lymphatic vessels; the membranes
                    which form excretory ducts; that of the air-passages; the fibrous covering of
                    the cavernous body of the urethra, and perhaps that of the spleen. The actions
                    and occasional distensions of which these parts are the seat require, it is
                    said, a tissue, the resistance and elasticity of which may at once counteract
                    any extraordinary effort, and cause them to resume their original state, when
                    the distending cause ceases to operate. In the lower animals this purpose is
                    more conspicuous than in the human subject. The posterior cervical ligament <hi
                    rend="italic">(ligamentum</hi><hi rend="italic">nuchae,</hi> Arab.; <hi
                    rend="italic">cervicis,</hi> Lat.) in the camel, giraffe, deer, and ox,
                    counteracts the tendency to inclination of the head; and a similar membrane
                    strengthens the abdominal parietes, and resists the weight and distending power
                    of the <hi rend="italic">viscera.</hi> In the feline tribe an elastic ligament
                    inserted into the unguinal phalanges retains them extended so long as the
                    muscles do not alter their direction. The shells of the bivalve molluscous
                    animals, as oysters, mussels, &amp;c., are opened by a similar fibrous tissue as
                    soon as the muscles which close them are relaxed.</p>
                <p>The disposition of the component fibres is the same in the elastic as in the
                    common white fibrous system. Their colour, which is yellow or tawny, is
                    generally more distinct in the dead subject. They are said to be less tenacious,
                    but more elastic, than those of any other tissue. In respect to chemical
                    composition, they appear to contain a considerable quantity of fibrin in a
                    peculiar condition, combined with some albumen and a little gelatine. Their
                    other properties are not very conspicuous.</p>

                <p>Bone, which is the hardest and most durable of the animal solids, may be defined
                    to be an organized substance, consisting of a combination of animal and
                    calcareous matter, and constituting by its solidity the chief support of the
                    soft parts generally.</p>
                <p>In the vertebrated animals it is moulded into pieces of definite shape and size,
                    which are connected either by ligaments, cartilage, or fibro-cartilage, and
                    which constitute the skeleton of the animal. In the mammalia and birds these
                    pieces appear in their most perfect characters, as to solidity, mechanical
                    shape, and numerical extent. In the human subject, though in these respects they
                    partake of the characters common to the bones of the mammalia⅛ in several senses
                    these characters are more conspicuous than in the lower animals.</p>

                <p>1. The bones of the human skeleton are distinguished, according to the varieties
                    of mechanical figure, into long and cylindrical bones <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ossa</hi><hi rend="italic">longa</hi> sive <hi rend="italic">cylindrica),</hi>

                    >brevia</hi> sive <hi rend="italic">mixta).</hi></p>
                <p>The long bones are confined to the extremities, where they are subservient to the
                    locomotive apparatus, by acting alternately as points of support and as levers
                    movable by the muscles in different directions. Placed in the centre, they are
                    surrounded almost entirely by muscles; and are observed to diminish in length,
                    but increase in number, the farther they recede from their attachment to the
                    trunk. From this inverse arrangement it results that near the trunk the members
                    are distinguished for extent, and remote from it for variety and multiplicity of
                    motion.</p>
                <p>The long bones agree in presenting cylindrical or prismatic shafts <hi
                    rend="italic">(diaphyses)</hi> terminated by large, bulky, and extensive
                    extremities <hi rend="italic">(epiphyses).</hi> The former arc generally small
                    and slendeι∙ compared with the latter and with the size of the limb, and thus
                    afford room for the bellies of muscles attached to them. The large size of the
                    latter is well suited for the extent of the articular surfaces; and being
                    covered by slender tendons and the taper extremities of muscles, they do not in
                    general add to the bulk of the member.</p>
                <p>The shafts of the long bones are in general marked by longitudinal rough lines,
                    to which muscles or fasciae are attached, and between which are found plane or
                    hollow surfaces for lodging the bellies of the muscles. These lines are rarely
                    straight; and the slight obliquity which they observe gives the bone the
                    appearance of being twisted. This is well seen in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >humerus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi></p>
                <p>The extremities of the long bones are marked in general by eminences and hollows,
                    or processes <hi rend="italic">(apophyses)</hi> and depressions <hi
                    rend="italic">(foveoe</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae).</hi> These inequalities, if tipped with cartilage and synovial
                    membrane, are for the purpose of articulation with other bones. When they are
                    simply formed of bone, they are for the attachment either of ligaments or
                    tendons.</p>
                <p>The shafts of the long bones consist chiefly of dense compact bone, containing in
                    the adult a longitudinal cavity, which is easily exposed by a longitudinal
                    section of the bone. This cavity is not cylindrical, but tapers considerably at
                    each end; nor is it in all instances equally complete. Largest and most
                    capacious about the middle, where it is bounded by the solid, compact, bony
                    walls of the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis,</hi> as the latter diminish in density
                    they increase in bulk by the formation of numerous minute intersecting columns
                    of bone, which progressively increasing in number towards the end of the shaft,
                    contract the cavity, until at length it is obliterated in the lattice-work and
                    cells <hi rend="italic">(cancelli)</hi> formed by their mutual intersection.
                    This cavity is the medullary canal. It is seen in its most perfect form in the
                    <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">femur,</hi> in the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi> and in the <hi
                    rend="italic">radius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulna.</hi> In the phalanges it
                    can scarcely be said to exist. The two forms of bony structure demonstrated in
                    such a section are distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">dense</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">compact,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">loose, reticular,</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">cancellated.</hi></p>
                <p>The medullary cavity is lined by a vascular filamentous membrane, with numerous
                    cells, containing the variety of animal fat denominated marrow. The effect of
                    this arrangement is to render the bone lighter than if perfectly solid, without
                    any diminution of strength. This cavity is wanting in the original formation of
                    the bone; and it begins to be formed when the matter of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diaphyses</hi> becomes dense and compact. It is again obliterated in
                    consequence of fracture or other injuries, succeeded by adhesive or depository
                    inflammation, when it is filled by gelatinous animal matter; and it is once more
                    excavated as the walls of the diaphysis acquire solidity.</p>
                <p>The flat bones are in general less connected with the locomotive apparatus than
                    with the protecting part of the skeleton. By mechanical configuration they serve
                    to contain various organs essential to the economy; and when they admit of
                    motion, this is rarely locomotive, but connected with the purposes of the
                    contained organs. The bones of the cranium and pelvis furnish the best examples
                    of bones destined solely to protect, and as locomotive agents affording only
                    points of support. The ribs, again, which are to be viewed as flat bones, not
                    only form the protecting walls of the chcst, and furnish support to the muscles
                    of the upper extremities, but further undergo a slight motion, by means of which
                    the dimensions of the chest are alternately enlarged and diminished. The
                    vertebrae combine the characters of flat bones and irregular bones, approaching
                    by their spinal plates to the former class, and by their bodies to the
                    latter.</p>
                <p>In number the flat bones vary according to the purpose to which they are applied,
                    and the nature of the cavities which they form. In the cranium and pelvis their
                    numerical extent appears to bear relation chiefly to the facility of
                    ossification,—a process which advances with equal rapidity in each individual
                    piece. In the chest, again, this property is regulated by the kind of motion
                    which the ribs are destined to undergo. The vital organs of circulation and
                    respiration would no doubt have been more securely protected had they been
                    inclosed, like the brain, in a continuous and complete osseous case; but by this
                    arrangement the motions of inspiration and expiration must have been very
                    limited.</p>
                <p>The flat bones agree in being convex and concave in opposite directions; in
                    possessing two surfaces, an external and an internal, and a circumference; and
                    in consisting of an external and internal table or thin plate of bone, with
                    loose cancellated structure interposed. This arrangement is most conspicuous in
                    those of the cranium, in which the cancellated structure is distinguished by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">diploe.</hi> It is nevertheless equally distinct in
                    the ribs, the scapula, and the pelvic bones. In some instances in the latter,
                    the diploe is obliterated, and the two tables approach each other so closely,
                    that they form one bone; and occasionally this is destroyed, and the bone
                    appears perforated. These effects are the result of longcontinued muscular
                    action.</p>
                <p>The cancellated structure of the flat bones is lined by a vascular filamentous
                    membrane, containing a small proportion of marrow, less oleaginous than that of
                    the long bones, and entirely resembling those of the cancellated structure of
                    their epiphyses.</p>
                <p>The short bones are situate in parts requiring the combination of mobility and
                    solidity; for example, the vertebral column, the <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">metacarpus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">tarsus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">metatarsus.</hi> Considerable extent of surface, numerous
                    articular and ligamentous connections, with few muscular or tendinous
                    insertions, are their leading external characters.</p>
                <p>They consist of a single thin external plate of bone, inclosing a large
                    proportion of cancellated structure, lined by vascular filamentous tissue,
                    containing semifluid marrow, without much oil. While this arrangement combines
                    very small specific gravity with sufficient firmness and solidity, it renders
                    them more liable to derangements of organization than other parts of the osseous
                    system.</p>
                <p>Though the bones are thus distinguished according to general characters, it is
                    often impossible to apply them accurately. The same bone may unite the
                    characters of long and short bone, or flat and short bone, or long and <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039455?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9455-0742"/>
                    flat bone. All the long bones indeed are in their epiphyses similar to the short
                    bones.</p>
                <p>In external figure the bones present certain eminences or processes <hi
                    rend="italic">(apophyses),</hi> and pits or cavities <hi rend="italic">(foveoe;
                    fossae).</hi> The eminences are either articular or non-articular. The former,
                    which are covered with cartilage or fibro-cartilage <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    belong to the subject of the connections of bones. The latter may be referred to
                    three heads: Isí, eminences of insertion for ligaments, tendons, or aponeuroses;
                    2√, eminences of reflection for the transit of tendons round a pulley; and, <hi
                    rend="italic">3d,</hi> eminences of impression, or those which correspond to
                    various soft parts in contact with the bones.</p>
                <p>The eminences of insertion appear in various shapes, and are distinguished into
                    tuberosities and tubercles <hi rend="italic">(tubera),</hi> spines <hi
                    rend="italic">(spinoe)</hi> or spinous processes, styloid processes <hi
                    rend="italic">(styli),</hi> crests <hi rend="italic">(cristae),</hi> and lines
                    <hi rend="italic">(lineoe),</hi> which are generally rough and elevated. These
                    impressions are always more conspicuous in the male than in the female, in the
                    old than in the young, in the robust and muscular than in the delicate and
                    feeble, and in carnivorous than in herbivorous animals. In some instances, as in
                    the case of the ischial tuberosity, the great trochanter and anterior tuberosity
                    of the humerus, the eminences present individual facettes for the attachment of
                    each tendon or muscle.</p>
                <p>Of the eminences of reflection, the best examples are in the unciform process of
                    the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, and the lower extremity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">fibula.</hi></p>
                <p>The depressions are either articular or non-articular. The latter consist of
                    cavities of insertion, reception, transmission and motion, impression and
                    nutrition.</p>
                <p>The first, which give attachment to ligaments, tendons, or aponeuroses, are
                    useful in augmenting the extent without increasing the size of bones. The
                    pterygoid cavities, the digastric <hi rend="italic">fossa,</hi> and that at the
                    base of the great trochanter, afford examples of these cavities.</p>
                <p>Of the cavities of reception, examples are seen in the cerebral and cerebellic
                    <hi rend="italic">fossae,</hi> and in the grooves for arteries or nerves; for
                    instance, that at the lower margin of the ribs, and the various openings in the
                    cranium for the transit of vessels and nerves.</p>
                <p>Cavities of motion are those over which tendons play in the contraction of
                    muscles; the bicipital groove, the hollow between the ischial spine and
                    tuberosity, and that in the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> for the <hi
                    rend="italic">peronaei,</hi> are examples.</p>
                <p>The cavities of impression alternate with the eminences, and are to be regarded
                    as in general the cause of these eminences.</p>
                <p>The cavities of nutrition are those minute orifices through which vessels convey
                    to the substance of the bone, or the medullary membrane, the materials of its
                    nutrition. Each long bone has one considerable hole of this kind in its. shaft,
                    and numerous minute ones in its extremities. The former is the orifice of a
                    canal to the medullary cavity. The latter are supposed to belong chiefly to the
                    cancellated structure.</p>
                <p>2. Several attempts have at different times been made to ascertain the atomic
                    constitution of bone, but without much success. Malpighi, though he corrected
                    the extravagant fiction of Gagliardi regarding the osseous plates and nails,
                    fancied bones to be composed of filaments, which Leeuwenhoeck represented as
                    minute tubes <hi rend="italic">(iu-bulï).</hi> By Clopton Havers, again, the
                    ultimate particles of bones were imagined to be fibres aggregated into plates
                    <hi rend="italic">(laminoe)</hi> placed on each other, and traversed by
                    longitudinal and transverse pores <hi rend="italic">(pori).</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> l</hi> This view was adopted by Courtial, Winslow, Palfyn, Monro,
                    and Reichel, who was at some pains to demonstrate this arrangement of plates and
                    minute tubes by microscopical observation. These notions were first, questioned
                    by Scarpa, who, in 1799, undertook to show by examinations of bone deprived of
                    its earth by acid, and long macerated in pure water, that it consists, both
                    externally and internally, of reticular or cellular structure. So far as I
                    understand what idea this eminent anatomist attaches to tlιe terms <hi
                    rend="italic">reticular</hi> and <hi rend="italic">cellular,</hi> I doubt
                    whether this opinion is better founded than any of the previous ones. After
                    repeating his experiment of immersing in oil of turpentine bone macerated in
                    acid, I cannot perceive the reticular arrangement which Scarpa describes.
                    Recently bone has been submitted to microscopic examination by Mr Howship, who
                    revives the opinion of the existence of minute longitudinal canals, as taught by
                    Leeuwenhoeck, Havers, and Reichel, but with Scarpa maintains the ultimate
                    texture not to be laminated, but reticulated. Lastly, the existence of fibres
                    and plates, which is admitted by Blumenbach, Bichat, and Meckel, apparently on
                    insufficient grounds, is to be viewed as an appearance produced by the physical,
                    and perhaps the chemical qualities of the proper animal-organic matter of which
                    bone consists. Though it does not demonstrate, it depends on, the intimate
                    structure of this body.</p>
                <p>The minute structure or atomic constitution of bone is probably the same in all
                    the pieces of the skeleton, and is varied only in mechanical arrangement. When a
                    cylindrical bone is broken, and its surfaces are examined with a good magnifying
                    glass, or when minute splinters are inspected in a powerful microscope, it
                    appears to be a uniform substance without fibres, plates, or cells, penetrated
                    everywhere by minute blood-vessels. Its fracture is uneven, passing to
                    splintery. In the recent state its colour is bluish-white; but in advanced age
                    the blue tinge disappears. Delicate injection, or feeding an animal with madder,
                    shows the vascularity of this substance.</p>
                <p>To have a clearer and more accurate idea of the minute structure of bone, it is
                    requisite to break transversely a long bone, and examine its fractured surface
                    by a good glass, or to examine in the same manner the transverse fracture of a
                    long bone which has been burnt white in a charcoal fire. The broken surface
                    presents a multitude of minute holes, generally round or oval, which are larger
                    towards the medullary cavity, but become exceedingly minute towards the outer
                    surface of the bone. Of these minute holes no part of the bone, however compact
                    in appearance, is destitute; and the only difference is, that they are more
                    minute, and more regularly circular towards the outer than towards the medullary
                    surface. These circular holes are transverse sections of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tubuli</hi> of Leeuwcnhoeck, the longitudinal pores of Havers (<hi
                    rend="italic">Osteolo∙ giα,</hi> p. 43 and 46), the pores and <hi rend="italic"
                    >tubuli</hi> of Reichel, and the longitudinal canals of Howship. They
                    communicate with each other by means of their great multiplicity and slight
                    obliquity and tortuosity. They contain not blood-vessels exclusively, but
                    divisions of the vascular filamentous tissue, which secretes the marrow. They
                    are seen very distinctly in bones which have been burnt. After manycare-</p>

                <p>ful examinations, I have never been able to observe holes in longitudinal
                    fractures of bones; and I therefore infer that there are no transverse
                    pores.</p>
                <p>These capillary pores are seen in the flat bones of the scull. I find them in the
                    compact matter of the outer and inner tables of the occipital bone when well
                    burnt, in which they seem to pass gradually from the lattice-work of the <hi
                    rend="italic">diploe</hi> to the distinct pores of the tables. I doubt, however,
                    whether these pores can be said, as in the long bones, to indicate canals. They
                    seem rather to belong to a very delicate cancellated structure. The pores are
                    most numerous and distinct in the bones of young subjects.</p>
                <p>Though these circular pores are most distinct in calcined bones, and might
                    therefore be thought to be the result of the burning, yet that they are not, I
                    infer from the circumstance that they are seen by a good glass in the transverse
                    fracture of splinters of the femur and other large bones.</p>
                <p>If a portion of bone be immersed in sulphuric, nitric, muriatic, or acetic acid
                    properly diluted, it becomes soft and pliable, and when dried, is found to be
                    lighter than before; yet it is impossible to discover that any particle of its
                    substance has been removed, or that its mechanical shape and appearance are
                    changed.</p>
                <p>If a portion of bone be placed in a charcoal fire, and the heat be gradually
                    raised to whiteness, it burns first with flame, and at length becomes quite red.
                    If then it be removed carefully and slowly cooled, it appears as white as chalk,
                    is found to be very brittle, and to have lost something of its weight. Yet
                    neither in this case does any part of its substance appear to be removed, nor is
                    its mechanical figure or appearance altered.</p>
                <p>Chemical examination, however, informs us that in the first case a portion of
                    earthy matter (phosphate of lime) is removed by the agency of the acid, and held
                    suspended in the fluid, while the pliant but otherwise identical piece of bone
                    consists chiefly, if not entirely, of animal matter; and that, in the second
                    case, this animal matter is removed by destructive decomposition, while the
                    earthy matter is left little changed by the action of fire. Every particle of
                    bone, therefore, however minute, consists of animal or organic, and earthy or
                    inorganic matter, intimately united; and it is impossible to touch, with the
                    point of the smallest needle, any part of bone which is not thus constituted. A
                    piece of bone consists not of cartilaginous fibres varnished over, as Hérissant
                    imagined, with earthy matter, but of a substance in which every atom consists of
                    animal and earthy matter intimately combined.</p>
                <p>There is therefore no ground for dividing osseous tissue into compact and spongy,
                    as the old anatomists did; for though the middle parts of long bones are denser
                    and heavier than their ends, or the bodies of the vertebrae, the difference
                    consists not in chemical composition, but in mechanical arrangement. On dividing
                    the head of a long bone, the lattice-work, or <hi rend="italic">cancelli,</hi>
                    as they are named, are formed by many minute threads of bone, crossing and
                    interlacing with each other. But each thread is equally dense, and consists of
                    the same quantity of animal and earthy matter, as the most solid part of the
                    centre of the same bone. These threads, however, instead of being disposed
                    compactly so as to take a small space, are so arranged that they occupy a large
                    one, and present considerable bulk.</p>
                <p>Though bone has been submitted to analysis by many eminent chemists, the results
                    hitherto obtained cannot be said to be quite satisfactory. The most recent is
                    that of Berzelius, who, in 100 parts of bone from the thigh of an adult, gives
                    the following proportions: of gelatine 32∙17, blood-vessels 1T3, phosphate of
                    lime 51∙04, carbonate of lime 11 <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi> 30, fluate of
                    lime 2∙00, phosphate of magnesia 1∙16, hydrochlorate of soda and water 1∙20.</p>
                <p>These results by no means agree with those obtained by Fourcroy and Vauquelin,
                    who found neither fluoric acid nor phosphate of magnesia, but discovered oxides
                    of iron and manganese, silica, and alumina, in bone. Sulphate of lime, which was
                    found in the experiments of Hatchett, was shown by Berzelius to be formed during
                    calcination. It is, however, obvious that a little more than a third part of
                    bone consists of animal matter, which appears to be either gelatine, or a
                    modification of that principle; and that the remainder, nearly equal to two
                    thirds, consists of earthy matter, which is chiefly phosphoric acid combined
                    with lime. The carbonic acid said tobe united with lime may result from the
                    decomposition of the animal matter. The other saline substances are not peculiar
                    to bone, but, being common to it and the other animal tissues, and even the
                    fluids, may be supposed to be derived from the blood left in the bone at the
                    momęnt of death.</p>
                <p>The animal matter of bones was at one time presumed to be cartilage; but this
                    appears to be an assumption, derived from the superficial resemblance which it
                    bears to this substance. It does not appear to be mere gelatine; for though this
                    principle is obtained from bone, and bones are economically used in
                    manufacturing glue, they do not furnish the same proportion of jelly as tendon,
                    nor are they so useful in making soups, as was once paradoxically maintained by
                    some chemists. It is probable that the gelatine is under a peculiar
                    modification, or combined with some principle which is not well understood. The
                    sulphur formed during calcination seems to show that this animal matter contains
                    albumen. There is no fat in bones; and in the experiments in which this
                    substance was found, it is evident that marrow had been mingled with the bones
                    employed.</p>
                <p>Though bones were arranged by the ancients among the bloodless organic
                    substances, they receive a considerable proportion of this fluid, and injection
                    shows them to be highly vascular. In early life especially these vessels are
                    numerous; and even in the grown adult, when death takes place by strangulation
                    or by drowning, the bones are found to be naturally well injected. In old age
                    the vessels are less numerous, but they are larger. From the capillary vessels
                    distributed through their substance, bones derive the pale blue or light pink
                    colour by which the healthy bone is characterized. When this tint becomes
                    intense, it indicates inflammation or some morbid state of the vessels of the
                    bone. When it is lost, and the bone assumes a white or yellow colour, the part
                    so changed is dead.</p>
                <p>Anatomists distinguish three orders of vessels which enter the substance of
                    bones; the first, those which penetrate the bodies of long bones to the
                    medullary cavity <hi rend="italic">(arteriae nutritiae, arterioe</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">medullares)</hi>; the second, those which go to the cellular
                    structure of the bone; and the third, those which go to the compact or dense
                    matter of the bone. The view is only partially correct. The large vessels termed
                    nutritious certainly proceed chiefly to the cavity of the bone, and are
                    distributed in the medullary membrane. These, however, are not the only vessels
                    which proceed to this part of the bone. <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> I have
                    often traced several large vessels, entering not by the middle, but the ends of
                    the long bones, into the loose cancellated texture, and actually distributed on
                    the <hi rend="italic">medulla</hi> in this part of the bone. In dried bones also
                    the canals of these vessels may be demonstrated, extending from the surface to
                    the body of the bone. <hi rend="italic">Secondly,</hi> the nutritious vessels
                    are not constant; and when they are wanting, those of the ends of the bone, or
                    of the <hi rend="italic">cancelli,</hi> are much larger and more numerous than
                    in ordinary circumstances.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039481?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9481-0744"/>
                <p>The communication between these and the branches of the nutritious vessels, which
                    is admitted by Bichat, may be easily demonstrated. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >third</hi> order of vessels are those which may be termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >periosteal,</hi> in so far as they consist of an infinite number of minute
                    capillaries, some red, some colourless, proceeding from the periosteum to the
                    bone, and contributing to maintain the connection between the two. The short
                    bones and the flat bones, which are destitute of nutritious arteries, receive
                    blood from the two latter orders, but principally from the periosteal vessels.
                    In the scull these vessels are often highly injected in apoplectic subjects, and
                    in persons killed by drowning or strangulation.</p>
                <p>The veins of bones are peculiar in their arrangement. The nutritious artery is
                    accompanied by a social vein; the articular and periosteal vessels are said to
                    be destitute of corresponding venous vessels. According to Dupuytren, however,
                    minute venous capillaries arise from the substance of the osseous tissue,
                    precisely as in other tissues, and, uniting in the same manner, form twigs,
                    branches, and trunks, which finally terminate in the neighbouring veins.
                    Lymphatics are not found in bones, nor have nerves been traced into their
                    substance.</p>
                <p>To complete the anatomical history of bone, it is requisite to examine shortly
                    the marrow. The interior of the long bones contains a quantity of fat,
                    oleaginous matter, which has been long known under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >marrow (μυskος οgrιrης, medulla)</hi>; and a similar substance, though in
                    smaller quantity, is found in the loose cancellated tissue of the flat and short
                    bones. It is in the first situation only that it is possible to examine the
                    anatomical characters of this substance. It is sufficiently similar to fat or
                    animal oil in other parts of the body, to lead us to refer it to that head. In
                    other respects its chemical qualities have not been much examined; but an
                    analysis by Berzelius shows that it consists chiefly of an oily matter, not
                    unlike butter in general properties. The filaments, blood-vessels, albumen,
                    gelatine, and osmazome found by this chemist in marrow, and which did not exceed
                    4 parts in the 100, are derived from the filamentous tissue, in which the
                    medullary particles are deposited.</p>
                <p>The medullary membrane, which has been considered as an internal periosteum, is
                    imperfectly known. There can be no doubt, however, of its existence, which is
                    demonstrated by opening transversely or longitudinally the medullary canal of a
                    long bone, and boiling it for about two hours. The marrow then drops out; and it
                    will be found to be deposited in the interstices of a filamentous net-work of
                    animal matter, like fine cellular tissue, which may be traced not only into the
                    lattice-work of the extremities, but into the longitudinal canals of the
                    cylindrical bones. It is traversed by blood-vessels, which are observed to bleed
                    during amputation. No nerves have been found in it. The medullary membrane, in
                    short, may be regarded as an extensive net-work of very minute capillaries
                    united by delicate filamentous tissue. From these capillaries the marrow is
                    deposited as a secretion. (Mascagni, Howship.)</p>
                <p>3. The progressive formation of the osseous system has given rise to many
                    researches by Kerckringius, Vater, Baster, Duhamel, Nesbitt, Haller, Dcthlecf,
                    Reichel, Albinus, John Hunter, Scarpa, Senff, Troja, Meckel, Howship, Medici,
                    Serres, Lebel, Schultze, Bedard, and Dutrochet; and it is a proof of the
                    complicated nature of the subject, that it continues to give rise to fresh
                    investigation. The inquiry resolves itself into two parts,—the history of the
                    process of ossification as it takes place originally in the foetus and infant,
                    and the history of its progress as a process of repairwhen bones are
                    divided,broken, or otherwise destroyed or removed.</p>
                <p>From the first formation of the embryo to the termination of foetal existence,
                    and thenceforth to the completion of growth, the bones undergo changes in which
                    various stages may be distinguished. In the first weeks of foetal existence it
                    is impossible to recognise any thing like bone; and the points in which the
                    bones are afterwards to be developed consist of a soft homogeneous mass of
                    animal matter, which has been designated under the general name of mucus. Some
                    time between the fifth and the seventh week, in the situation of the
                    extremities, may be recognised dark opaque spots, which are firmer and more
                    solid than the surrounding animal matter. About the eighth week, the extremities
                    maybe seen to consist of their component parts, in the centre of each of which
                    is a cylindrical piece of bony matter. Dark solid specks are also seen in the
                    spine, corresponding to the bodies of the vertebrae; and even the rudiments of
                    spinous processes are observed in the shape of minute dark points. In the hands
                    and feet rings of bone are seen in the site of the metacarpal and metatarsal
                    bones. All the joints consist of a semi-consistent jelly-like matter, liberally
                    supplied by blood-vessels. At ten weeks the cylinders and rings are increased in
                    length, and arc observed to approach the jelly-like extremities, which are
                    acquiring the consistence of cartilage, and when divided present irregular
                    cavities. At the same time the parts forming the bead are highly vascular; and
                    between the membranes are deposited minute points of bony matter, proceeding in
                    rays from a centre, which, however, is thinner and more transparent than the
                    margin. (Howship.)</p>
                <p>Between thirteen weeks and four months the cavities in the jelly-like
                    cartilaginous matter receive injection. The membranes of the head are highly
                    vascular, transmitting their vessels through the intervals of the osseous rays,
                    which are occupied abundantly by stiff, glairy, colourless, mucilaginous
                    fluid.</p>
                <p>In the seventh month the bony cylinder of the thighbone and its epiphyses contain
                    canals perceptible to the microscope. In the head the bones are proceeding to
                    completion; the pericranium and dura mater are highly vascular; and a quantity
                    of reddish semitransparent jelly between the scalp and the scull, which contain
                    numerous minute vessels, Mr Howship regards as the loose cellular state of the
                    foetal pericranium. This is, however, doubtful. The cylindrical bones have at
                    this period no medullary cavity, but present in their interior a loose bony
                    texture.</p>
                <p>Between the seventh and eighth months, in a foetus ten inches long, the humerus
                    consists of a cylinder of bone placed between two brownish, firm, jelly-like
                    masses, which correspond to the epiphyses, inclosed by periosteum, which adheres
                    loosely by means of filamentous and vascular productions. The radius is a thin
                    bony rod, alsobetween two jelly-like epiphyses. The ulna is still thinner, more
                    slender and flexible, and even compressible. The interosseous ligament is a
                    continuous duplicature of the periosteum. The metacarpal bones are much as
                    before, only larger. The hands and fingers are complete; but the phalanges
                    consist of minute semi-hard grains, inclosed in periosteum, which forms a
                    general sac to them, and to the intermediate connecting parts. The middle and
                    unguinal phalanges can scarcely be called osseous. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >femur,</hi> like the <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> is an osseous cylinder
                    between two jelly-like epiphyses, enveloped in loosely adhering periosteum. The
                    <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> are like the <hi
                    rend="italic">radius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulna.</hi> The metatarsal bones
                    are cylindrical pieces, firm, but not very hard. The first phalanx of the toes

                    are in the state of the epiphyses, but of a gray colour.</p>
                <p>In this state of the osseous system, the periosteum, which is continuous, and
                    appears to make one membrane with the eapsular ligaments and the deep-seated
                    portions of the fascia, adheres to the bone chiefly by arteries and filamentous
                    productions; and so loose is this connection, that a probe may be inserted
                    beneath it, and carried round or inwards, unless where these connections are
                    situate. Another point where the periosteum adheres firmly is at muscular
                    insertions, to the <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> at the insertion of the
                    deltoid, and to the <hi rend="italic">femur</hi> at that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">glutoeus.</hi></p>
                <p>In the vertebral column the bodies of the vertebrae and the spinous plates are
                    formed; and minute specks are beginning in the site of the transverse
                    processes.</p>
                <p>In the scull the parietal bones are well-formed shells of bone, though very
                    deficient at the mesial plane, the anterior margin, and the upper anterior
                    angle. The pericranium is distinctly membranous and vascular; and the red
                    jelly-like fluid noticed by Mr Howship is exterior to this membrane.</p>
                <p>At the period of birth the cylindrical bones contain tubular canals filled with a
                    colourless glairy fluid, and terminating in the surface of ossification. As the
                    bones previous to this period are homogeneous, and contain no distinct medullary
                    cavity, but present in their interior a soft or loose bony texture, it is
                    reasonable to suppose that the developement of the longitudinal canals is
                    connected with the formation of the medullary cavity. At birth in <hi
                    rend="italic">doe femur</hi> may be distinguished a medullary cavity beginning
                    to be formed, about half a line broad, but still very imperfect.</p>
                <p>After birth the two processes of the formation of tubular canals and medullary
                    cavity go on simultaneously; and at the same rate nearly the outer part of the
                    cylindrical bones acquires a more dense and compact appearance. The epiphyses,
                    also, whieh are in the shape of grayish jelly-like masses, begin to present
                    grains and points of bone. Previously to this, Mr Howship represents them, while
                    still cartilaginous, as penetrated by canals or tubes, whieh gradually disappear
                    as ossification proceeds. The carpal and tarsal bones appear to observe the same
                    course in the process of ossification.</p>
                <p>In the bones of the scull, however, a different law is observed. The osseous
                    matter is originally deposited in linear tracts or fibres, radiating or
                    diverging from certain points termed centres of ossification. Each bone is
                    completed in one shell without <hi rend="italic">diploe</hi> or distinguishable
                    table. Afterwards, when they are completed laterally, or in the radiating
                    direction, the cancellated arrangement of the <hi rend="italic">diploe</hi>
                    begins to take place apparently in the same manner in which the medullary cavity
                    and compact parts of the long bones are formed.</p>
                <p>In the process now described, it is important to observe tlιat the bony matter is
                    deposited round the soft parts, and that the cavities, holes, and canals of
                    bones are merely parts in which the previous existence of vessels, nerves,
                    ligaments or tendons, prevents the subsequent formation of bone.</p>
                <p>It has been generally supposed that the formation of cartilage is a preliminary
                    step to that of bone. This, however, seems to be a mistake, arising from the
                    circumstance that cartilage is often observed to be converted in the living body
                    into bone. Neither in the long nor in the flat bones is any thing like cartilage
                    at any time observed. The epiphyses, indeed, present something of the
                    consistence of cartilage, but it has neither the firmness nor the elasticity of
                    that substance. It is a concrete jelly, afterwards to be penetrated by
                    calcareous matter. The flat bones are from the first osseous; and though their
                    margins are soft and flexible, in consequence of their recent formation and
                    moist state, they have still a distinct osseous appearance and arrangement, and
                    bear no resemblance to cartilage. In short, true bone seems never at any period
                    of its growth to be cartilaginous.</p>
                <p>The progressive growth of bones is effected by accretion of new matter to their
                    extremities. The cylindrical bones elongate by the addition of new matter to the
                    extremities of their <hi rend="italic">diaphyses,</hi> and the flat bones by the
                    enlargement of their margins. The latter fact is established by simple
                    inspection during the process of ossification of the cranial bones. In proof of
                    the former, the experiment of John Hunter is decisive. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia</hi> of a pig he bored two holes, one near the upper, the other near the
                    lower end, with an interval of two inches exactly, and inserted into each hole a
                    small leaden shot. After some time, when the animal had grown, and the length of
                    the bone was increased, on killing it, the space between the leaden shots was
                    found, as at first, to be exactly two inches,—thereby showing that no elongation
                    had taken place between the perforations. The experiment was often repeated with
                    the same result.</p>
                <p>The period at whieh ossification is completed varies in different individuals. It
                    may be said to be indicated by the completion of the medullary canal, by the
                    ossification of the <hi rend="italic">epiphyses,</hi> and their perfect union
                    with the osseous cylinder <hi rend="italic">(diaphysis).</hi> The first
                    circumstance is indefinite. The two latter, though more fixed, are still liable
                    to great variation. The epiphyses are rarely united before the age of 14 or 15;
                    and they may continue detached to the 20th or 21st year. In general, however,
                    they begin to unite or to be <hi rend="italic">knit,</hi> as is said, between
                    the 15th and 20th years.</p>
                <p>That the main agents of original ossification are the periosteum and its
                    arteries, the proofs are manifest. The formation of bone can be ascribed to the
                    vessels of two agents only,—the periosteum and the medullary membrane. That the
                    latter is not concerned in the production of bone in the foetus, must be
                    inferred from the fact that at that period it cannot be said to exist. To the
                    periosteum, therefore, and its vessels must be ascribed the process of foetal
                    ossification. Of this a cumulative proof is found in the circumstance, that the
                    periosteum adheres more firmly at the ends than the middle of the bones; and
                    that the pericranium and <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> which perform the
                    part of periosteum to the bones of the scull, are visibly concerned in the
                    formation and successive enlargement of these bones. But though the periosteal
                    vessels are the main agents of ossification originally, there is reason to
                    behove that the medullary vessels contribute to its growth and nutrition after
                    it is formed. This may be inferred from the phenomena of fractures, of diseases
                    of the bones, and of those experiments, in which the medullary membrane is
                    injured. The periosteum, however, does not act by ossification of its inner
                    layers, as Duhamel, misled by a false analogy between the growth of trees and
                    bones, laboured to establish.</p>
                <p>A peculiar form of the osseous system requiring notice are the sesamoid bones.
                    These, which derive their name from their minuteness, (tfη0∙α∕χj3, a <hi
                    rend="italic">grain),</hi> most of them, excepting the knee-pan, being of the
                    size of a grain or pea, are confined to the extremities, and are situate chiefly
                    in positions in whieh they give points of support to the tendons of the flexor
                    muscles. (Tendons of the <hi rend="italic">gemelli,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tibialis posticus, peronoeus</hi><hi rend="italic">longus,</hi> &amp;e.) The
                    peculiarity of these bones is, that they are formed invariably in the substance
                    of fibrous organs, as tendons in thę case of the knee-pan and the sesamoid bones
                    of the <hi rend="italic">gemelli,</hi><hi rend="italic">tibialis posticus,</hi>

                <p>in the case of those situate between the chiro-phalangeal and podo-phalangeal
                    articulations. With this peculiarity their mode of ossification corresponds. At
                    first albuminous or fibro-albuminous, in process of time they are penetrated by
                    calcareous matter, and present an osseous texture, which, however, is much less
                    firm than that of genuine bone. The period at which this deposition commences
                    and is completed varies in different individuals; and hence scarcely in any two
                    persons of the Same age is the number of sesamoid bones the same. „Though the
                    patella may be ossified at the 20th year, the minute sesamoid bones are
                    sometimes not formed before the 30th or even the 40th. In the patella, when
                    ossified, we find a medullary organ; but it is uncertain whether the others
                    acquire this mark of osseous character. These bones resemble the epiphyses in
                    uniting, when divided, by fibro-albuminous matter.</p>
                <p>4. The bones of which the skeleton consists are united in two modes; Isŕ, by
                    movable junction <hi rend="italic">(diarthrosis)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">jidly,</hi> by immovable
                    junction <hi rend="italic">(synarthrosis).</hi> Both modes of union bear the
                    general name of <hi rend="italic">articulation,</hi> though this term would with
                    greater propriety be confined to the first or movable union. By. this are
                    connected all the bones concerned in locomotion, and some of those devoted to
                    the organic functions, as the ribs and the lower jaw. The second is employed in
                    the union of bones forming the walls of cavities.</p>
                <p>In the movable union, the articular surfaces are united in two modes. In the
                    first, in which one bone moves on the other with different degrees of freedom,
                    the articular surfaces are covered by cartilage and synovial membrane, and the
                    bones are united by ligaments and tendons. In the second <hi rend="italic"
                    >(amphiarthrosis),</hi> in which the motion is confined to a species of torsion
                    or imperfect rotation, the bones are united without articular surface by
                    fibro-cartilage. The first is exemplified in the articulations of the
                    extremities; the second is seen in the union of the bodies of the <hi
                    rend="italic">vertebrae</hi> and the bones of the pelvis.</p>
                <p>The several forms of movable union with free motion, or articulations proper, may
                    be referred to four heads, according to the nature of the motions performed. The
                    first is the motion of radio-central opposition, or pivot-motion in every
                    direction, in which the bone moves in its articular cavity, not only backwards
                    and forwards, or by flexion and extension, but by abduction and adduction, and,
                    by the succession of these motions, may describe a cone with the apex at the
                    joint, or what is termed circumduction. This most extensive form of motion is
                    found in the scapulohumeral and coxo-femoral articulations only. The second form
                    of articular motion is antero-posterior opposition, or cardinal motion <hi
                    rend="italic">(cardo,</hi> a hinge), in which the bones move on each other by
                    flexion and extension, as a gate on its hinges. This, which is sometimes named
                    limited opposition, is found in the fémoro-tibial and humero-cubital joints, and
                    all those which undergo flexion and extension. The third form of motion is that
                    of rotation, in which the bone revolves on its axis,—an infrequent variety,
                    confined chiefly to the humerus and femur. The fourth, which is the gliding
                    motion, though common to all articular surfaces, is nevertheless the peculiar
                    motion of the carpal and tarsal bones.</p>
                <p>In the immovable union the surfaces are united in three modes. The first is by
                    mutual indentation, or what is named suture <hi rend="italic">(sutura</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vera),</hi> in which the margin of one bone is dovetailed by
                    alternate serrated teeth and notches, into that of another. The second is by
                    juxtaposition <hi rend="italic">(harmonia),</hi> in which the margin of one bone
                    is simply fitted to that of another. A peculiar variety of this is, when the
                    acute margin of one bone is received between the bifid margin of another, as the
                    azygos process of the sphenoid bone is received by the plates of the <hi
                    rend="italic">vomer</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(schindylesis.)</hi> The third mode of immovable union is by implantation or
                    insertion <hi rend="italic">(gomphosis),</hi> as the teeth are inserted into the
                    alveolar cavities of the superior and inferior maxillary bones.</p>

                <p>Every tooth consists of two hard parts; one external, white, uniform, somewhat
                    like ivory; the other internal, similar to the compact structure of bone.</p>
                <p>The first, which is named enamel, is seen only at the crown of the tooth,· the
                    upper and outer part of which consists of this substance. It is white, very
                    close in texture, perfectly uniform and homogeneous, yet presenting a fibrous
                    arrangement. Extending across the summit of the tooth in the manner of an
                    incrustation, it is thick above, and diminishes gradually to the root, where it
                    disappears. This fact is demonstrated by macerating a tooth in dilute nitric
                    acid, when the bony root becomes yellow, while the crown remains white.</p>
                <p>The enamel is not injectible, and is therefore believed to be inorganic. It is
                    also filed and broken without being reproduced; nor does it present any of the
                    usual properties which distinguish organized bodies. The piercing sensation
                    which is communicated through the tooth from the impression of acids seems to
                    depend on the mere chemical operation, and not on the physiological effect. On
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039520?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9520-0747"/>
                    the whole, the enamel is to be viewed as the inorganic <hi rend="subscript">
                    i</hi> result of a process of secretion or deposition.</p>
                <p>The bony part of the tooth is the root and that internal part which is covered on
                    the sides and above by the enamel. It consists of close-grained bony matter, as
                    dense as the compact walls of the long bones, or the petrous portion of the
                    temporal bone. The fibres which are said to be seen in it are exactly of the
                    same nature as those in bone.</p>
                <p>In the interior of the bony part of each tooth is a cavity which descends into
                    the root, and communicates at its extremity with the outer surface by openings
                    corresponding with the number of branches into which the root is divided. This
                    cavity, which is large in young or newly formed teeth, and small in those which
                    are old, contains a delicate vascular membrane, which has been named the pulp of
                    the tooth. It is best seen by breaking a reeent tooth by a smart blow with a
                    hammer, when the soft pulpy membrane may be picked out of the fragments by the
                    forceps. It then appears to be a membranous web with two surfaces, an exterior
                    adhering to the bony surface of the dental cavity by minute vessels; the other
                    interior, free, and, so far as ean be determined of a body so minute, resembling
                    a closed sac.</p>
                <p>The developement and growth of the teeth is a process of much interest.</p>
                <p>At what time the first rudiments of teeth appear seems not to be determined with
                    accuracy. In the foetus, between the seventh and eighth month, I can merely
                    distinguish in the centre of the vascular membrane of the alveolar cavity a
                    minute firm body like a seed. I have, however, seen the crowns of teeth formed
                    in foetuses which, I have reason to believe, had not attained the seventh month.
                    But whatever may be the exact period, the process is nearly as follows.</p>
                <p>While the bones of the upper and lower jaw are in the process of formation
                    between the third and fourth months, (fourth and fifth, Bichat, tom. iiĩ. p.
                    93,) a series of soft, membranous, vascular sacs inclosed within the general
                    cavity of the periosteum, may be recognised at their lower and upper margins,
                    which are still without those osseous plates which afterwards constitute the <hi
                    rend="italic">al-veoH.</hi> Each of the sacs now mentioned consists, like a
                    serous membrane, of two divisions,—one external, attached to the periosteum, the
                    other folded within it, and forming a closed cavity. The outer or periosteal
                    deposits in the intervals between each sae, bone, which eventually constitutes
                    the transverse <hi rend="italic">septa</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >alveoli.</hi> From the inside of the inflected portion the process of dentition
                    commences some time between the fifth and seventh month, by the deposition of
                    matter from the vessels at the lowest point of the alveolar division of the sac.
                    This matter is to constitute the erown of the tooth, which is invariably formed
                    first. After the deposition of the first portions, these are pushed upwards by
                    the addition of successive layers below them, and necessarily carry the
                    inflected part of the sac before them. As this process of deposition advances,
                    the tooth gradually fills the sac, and rises till it reaches the level of the
                    alveolar margins. If a tooth be examined <hi rend="italic">in situ,</hi> near
                    the period of birth, it is found to consist of the CTθwn, with portions of
                    enamel descending on every side, and forming a cavity in which a cluster of
                    blood-vessels proceeding from the sac is lodged. In the mean time, bone is
                    deposited from the periosteal division all round each sac, so as to form the <hi
                    rend="italic">alveoli.</hi></p>
                <p>After the enamel has been deposited the bone begins to be formed; and as this
                    process advances, the tooth is still forcibly thrust upwards by the addition of
                    matter to its root. When the latter is well completed, the vessels become
                    smaller and less abundant, until, when the tooth is perfect, they shrink to a
                    mere membrane, which lines the cavity of the tooth, and still maintains its
                    original connection with the alveolar membrane, by the minute vascular
                    production which enters the orifice or orifices of the root.</p>
                <p>Physiological authors have thought it important to mark the period at which the
                    teeth appear at the gums; and in general this takes place about the sixth or
                    seventh month after birth. This mode of viewing the process of dentition,
                    however, gives rise to numberless mistakes on the period of teething. The
                    process, as we see, commences in the early period of foetal existence; and the
                    time at which they appear above the gums varies according to the progress made
                    in the womb. In some the process is rapid, in others it is tardy; and even the
                    stories of Richard III. and Louis XIV. receive confirmation from the fact of 19
                    examples cited by Haller, of infants born with one or more teeth above the gum.
                    Generally speaking, the crown is completed at the period of birth; and,
                    according as the formation of the root advances with rapidity or slowly,
                    dentition is early or late.</p>
                <p>What is here described is the process of the formation of the first or temporary
                    set of teeth, which consist, it is well known, of twenty. In that of the second
                    set the same course is observed. In the same manner is observed a row of
                    follicular sacs, though not exactly in the original <hi rend="italic"
                    >alveoli,</hi> yet attached to the saes of the temporary teeth by vascular
                    membranes; in the same manner deposition begins at the bottom of the free
                    surface of the sae by the formation of the erown; and in the same manner the
                    erown is forcibly raised by the successive accretion of new matter to its base.
                    The moment this process commences, a new train of phenomena takes place with the
                    primary teeth. The follicular sacs of the new or permanent teeth are liberally
                    supplied with vessels for the purpose of nutrition; and as. these blood-vessels
                    increase in size, those of the temporary teeth diminish; and the supply of blood
                    being thus cut off, the latter undergo a sort of natural death. The roots which,
                    as being last formed, are not unfrequently incomplete, now undergo a process of
                    absorption; and the tooth drops out in consequence of the destruction of its
                    nutritious vessels. Some authors have ascribed this expulsion to pressure,
                    exercised by the new tooth. They forget, however, that before the new tooth ean
                    exert any pressure, it must be in some degree formed; and to this a vascular
                    system is indispensable.</p>
                <p>The increased number of the teeth when permanent, the enlargement of the jaws,
                    and the consequent expansion of the face, though interesting, are foreign to the
                    present inquiry.</p>

                <p>The cartilaginous system or tissue is found at least in three different
                    situations of the human body; Is/, on the articular extremities of the movable
                    bones; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> on the connecting surfaces or margins of
                    immovable bones; áaf. in the parietes of certain cavities, the motions and uses
                    of which require bodies of this elastic substance.</p>
                <p>The organization of gristle is obscure and indistinct. On examination by the
                    microscope, its surface is pearl-white, uniform and homogeneous, firm and
                    glistening, with numerous minute pores. William Hunter represents the articular
                    cartilages as consisting of longitudinal and transverse fibres. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. xlii.) Hérissant represents those of the
                    ribs as composed of minute fibres mutually aggregated into bundles connected by
                    short slips, and twisted in a spiral or serpentine direction. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mém. de ľAcad.</hi> 1748.) By Delasone, the articular cartilages <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039533?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9533-0748"/> are
                    Said to consist of a multitude of minute threads, mutually connected and placed
                    at right angles to the plane of the bone, but so as to radiate from the centre
                    to the circumference. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> 1752.) The general fact of
                    fibrous structure is confirmed by Bichat, who states that it is possible to
                    recognise longitudinal fibres, which are intersected by others, oblique or
                    transverse, but without determinate order. In its purest form no bloodvessels
                    are seen in it, nor can they be demonstrated by the finest injections. In the
                    margins of those pieces of gristle, however, which are attached to the
                    extremities of growing bones, blood-vessels of considerable size may often be
                    seen, even without the aid of injection. In young subjects a net-work of
                    arteries and veins, which is described by Hunter under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">circulus articuli vasculosus,</hi> may be demonstrated all round
                    the margin of the cartilage at the line between the epiphysis and it. They
                    terminate so abruptly, however, that they cannot be traced into the substance of
                    the latter. The most certain proofs, however, of the organic structure of this
                    substance are the serous exudation which appears in a few seconds on the surface
                    of a piece of cartilage after division by the knife; and the fact that it
                    becomes yellow during jaundice, and derives colour from substances found in the
                    blood. Neither absorbents nor nerves have been found in it. The cellular texture
                    said by Bichat to form the mould for the proper cartilaginous matter appears to
                    be imaginary. <hi rend="subscript"> ¼</hi></p>
                <p>The articular cartilages adhere to the epiphyses by one surface, which consists
                    of short perpendicular fibres placed parallel to each other, and forming a
                    structure like the pile of velvet. This is easily demonstrated by maceration,
                    first in nitrie acid, and then in water. The free or smooth surface is covered
                    by a thin fold of synovial membrane, which comes off in pieees during
                    maceration. The existence of this, though recently denied by Gordon, was
                    admitted by William Hunter, and may be demonstrated either by boiling,
                    maceration, or the phenomena of inflammation, under which it is sensibly
                    thickened. All other cartilages are enveloped, unless where they are attached to
                    bones, by a fibrous membrane, which has been therefore named <hi rend="italic"
                    >perichondrium.</hi> The existence of this may be demonstrated by dissection,
                    and also by boiling, which makes it peel off in crisped flakes.</p>
                <p>The chemical properties of cartilage have not been accurately examined. Boiling
                    shows that it contains gelatine; but as much of the matter is undissolved, it
                    may be inferred that it is under some modification, or united with some other
                    principle, perhaps albumen. Immersion in nitric acid or boiling fluids induces
                    crispation, and it dries hard and semitransparent like horn.</p>

                    fibro-cartilages.</p>
                <p>Bedard follows Meckel in rejecting the first subdivision, the individuals of
                    which are quite similar to ordinary cartilage, in wanting the distinct fibrous
                    structure, and being covered by perichondrium, the fibres of which have caused
                    them to be regarded as fibro-cartilages. On this principle Bedard gives the
                    following view of the fibro-cartilages.</p>
                <p>Is/, Fibro-cartilages free at both surfaces; those in the form of <hi
                    rend="italic">menisci,</hi> which are placed between the articular surfaces of
                    two bones <hi rend="italic">(fibro-cartilagines inter-artwulαres).</hi> These
                    are seen in the temporo-maxillary, sterno-clavicdar, and fémoro-tibial
                    articulations, and occasionally in the acromio-clavicular and the ulno-carpal
                    joints. These ligaments are attached either by their margins or their
                    extremities, and are enveloped in a thin fold of synovial membrane. <hi
                    rend="italic">2d,</hi> Fibro-cartilages attached by one surface. Of this
                    description are those employed as pulleys or grooves for the easy motion of
                    tendons; for instance, the chondro-desmoid eminences attached to the margin of
                    the glenoid cavity for the long head of the <hi rend="italic">biceps,</hi> and
                    at the sinuosity of the ischium for the tendons of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >obturatores. 3d,</hi> Fibro-cartilages, which establish a connection between
                    bones susceptible of little individual motion, as the intervertebral bodies; or
                    which unite bones intended to remain fixed, unless under very peculiar
                    circumstances, as those which form the junction of the pelvic bones. <hi

                <p>The peculiarities of these substances consist in their partaking in different
                    proportions of the nature of cartilage and white fibrous tissue, and,
                    consequently, in possessing the toughness and resistance of the latter with the
                    elasticity and flexibility of -the former. The structure of the
                    fibro-cartilaginous tissue is easily seen in the intervertebral bodies, and in
                    the cartilages uniting the pelvic bones. In the former, white concentric layers,
                    consisting of circular fibres placed in juxtaposition, constitute the outer
                    part, while the interior contains a semifluid jelly. The concentric fibrous
                    layers are cartilage in a fibrous shape. In the latter situation the fibrous
                    structure is equally distinct, while the cartilaginous consistence shows the
                    connection with that organic substance. A similar arrangement is remarked in the
                    inter-articular cartilage of the temporo-maxillary articulation, and in the
                    semilunar cartilages of the knee-joint. In all, the fibrous is said to
                    predominate over the cartilaginous structure. Their physical properties are
                    distensibility and elasticity. Though they are at all times subjected to
                    considerable pressure, they speedily recover their former size. Though their
                    chemical composition is not exactly known, they evidently contain much
                    gelatine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Gland. Glandular System. (Glandidaej</hi></p>
                <p>The name <hi rend="italic">gland,</hi> though rather vaguely used, may be
                    properly restricted to designate organs of a definite structure, consisting of
                    arteries, veins, and excretory tubes, arranged in a peculiar manner, and
                    destined to separate from the blood a fluid of peculiar chemical and
                    physiological properties. The organs of this description may be arranged in two
                    general divisions,—the follicular glands, or those which occur in an isolated
                    form; and the conglomerate glands, or those which, being of larger volume, are
                    understood to consist of numerous small glands combined in one general organ.
                    The former embraces the sebaceous glands of the skin and the muciparous glands
                    of mucous membranes; in the latter are comprehended the lacrymal and salivary
                    glands, with the tonsils, the pancreas, the liver, the kidneys, the testicles of
                    the male, and <hi rend="italic">mammae</hi> of the female, and perhaps the
                    prostate gland. To a third head, denominated that of <hi rend="italic">imperfect

                    the thyroid, and the spleen. But since the term <hi rend="italic">imperfect</hi>
                    implies here a contradiction, and since it is by no means ascer-taĩned<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039546?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9546-0749"/>,
                    either that these organs secrete, or that their secretions are removed by the
                    lymphatics, it is manifest that they cannot be justly associated with the organs
                    above defined as examples of glands.</p>
                <p>The follicular glands, though most minute, are nevertheless distinguished by the
                    most simple and intelligible structure. They consist of small hollow spherical
                    sacs, or minute membranes moulded into the saccular form, in the attached
                    surface of which are distributed numerous minute arteries and veins, and the
                    free surface of which is smooth and covered with the fluid secreted. The
                    quantity of vascular substance with filamentous tissue surrounding the attached
                    surface of these glands, makes them occasionally project from the surface of the
                    membrane to which they arc attached. In ordinary circumstances, however, they
                    cause no elevation, and appear in the form of simple sacs with a narrow orifice.
                    These glands belong to two textures only of the animal body,— the skin and the
                    mucous membrane. In the former they are named <hi rend="italic">sebaceous
                    glands,</hi> from the fluid which they secrete containing a small portion of
                    fatty matter. In the latter they are named <hi rend="italic">follicles,
                    crypts,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mιιciparοus glands.</hi></p>
                <p>In certain regions of the mucous membranes, for instance in the male <hi
                    rend="italic">urethra,</hi> the crypts are arranged in such a manner that they
                    constitute large sinuous cavities, the free surface of which secretes serous
                    mucus copiously. These cavities, which have the further effect of increasing
                    much the superficial extent of the membrane, are denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacunoe.</hi> The peculiarity of this form of mucous gland appears to consist
                    in its membranous sac having unusual extent, and consequently in the glandular
                    vessels being more expanded than in the ordinary glands.</p>
                <p>The structure of the conglomerate glands is more complicated. Each gland consists
                    of numerous minute portions of definite figure, named lobules; and each lobule
                    may be resolved into granules, also of definite shape, intimately connected by
                    filamentous tissue. These granules, which have since the time of Malpighi been
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">acini,</hi> are found to consist of clusters of
                    minute arteries and veins aggregated together, with minute tubes for conveying
                    away the secreted fluid. On these points anatomists are agreed. They arc seen
                    most distinctly in the liver and kidney, and may be demonstrated in the
                    pancreas, testicles, and female breast, by injection. Every <hi rend="italic"
                    >acinus,</hi> in short, may be said to consist of two parts, a vascular or
                    supplying, and a tubular or excreting.</p>
                <p>On the manner in which these two parts of the <hi rend="italic">acinus</hi>
                    communicate, however, there is less certainty and precision. In this difficulty,
                    as the point is scarcely a matter of observation, conjecture has been resorted
                    to; and the opinions of anatomists have been divided between two parties.
                    According to one, at the head of which may be placed Iluysch, Haller, William
                    Hunter, and Hewson, the minute arteries terminate directly in the excretory
                    ducts, without intermediate substance. According to the other opinion, which is
                    that of Malpighi, between the arteries and the excretory tubes there are placed
                    minute membranous <hi rend="italic">vesiculae</hi> or pouches, in the substance
                    of which the arteries, still more minutely divided, are distributed, and from
                    the free surface of which the process of secretion goes on. In short, each <hi
                    rend="italic">acinus,</hi> according to Malpighi, is a separate follicle, and
                    the conglomerate glands consist merely of numerous follicles, combined so as to
                    form a large general secreting organ.</p>
                <p>Between these two views of the intimate nature of the glandular tissue there is
                    less difference than at first sight might be imagined. The chief difference is
                    in the ultimate arrangement of the glandular capillaries. According to the view
                    of Malpighi, these capillaries are arranged in clusters, as it were, round the
                    beginning of the excretory pore, so that even in this condition the termination
                    of the former class of vessels is the commencement of the latter. Conversely, it
                    may be said, that since the delicate membrane in which the secreted fluid first
                    appears necessarily receives the capillary terminations, the latter cannot be
                    said to communicate directly with the excretory tubes. The correct view of the
                    matter is, that by the term <hi rend="italic">vesicles</hi> are not to be
                    understood large sacs, but merely the rounded recess of the membrane which forms
                    the excretory tubes. Further, since the researches of Hewson and Monro show that
                    in the kidney and the testicle the arteries are convoluted, it may be inferred
                    that this is the character of the capillary arrangement of the glands; and that
                    it is requisite to the performance of the process of secretion that the vessels
                    be disposed in such a tortuous manner as to prevent too rapid motion of the
                    blood.</p>
                <p>The conglomerate glands, we have seen, consist chiefly of minute vascular
                    ramifications infinitely subdivided. In all the glands, excepting the liver,
                    these vessels consist of arteries to convey blood to the organ, and veins to
                    return it to the system; and in all the glands, excepting the liver, it is a
                    peculiar circumstance that the same arterial trunk conveys blood for nourishing
                    the gland, and for supplying the materials of the secretion. All the secretions,
                    therefore, excepting that of the liver, are derived from arterial blood. The
                    liver alone, besides receiving a considerable artery, derived from the coeliac
                    trunk, is remarkable for being chiefly supplied with blood from a large venous
                    trunk, formed by the union of the veins of the stomach and spleen, and the
                    mesenteric and mesocolic branches, and which after this union is again
                    subdivided into ramifications in the substance of the gland. Injection shows
                    that the branches and twigs of this vein anastomose freely with those of the
                    hepatic artery; and though it might be imagined that the latter is intended
                    chiefly to nourish the gland, and the former to supply the materials for
                    secretion, this circumstance, with the fact that in some rare instances the <hi
                    rend="italic">vena portae</hi> is not distributed in the liver, shows that at
                    present this opinion must be adopted with caution.</p>
                <p>Besides arteries, veins, and excretory tubes, glands are supplied with lymphatic
                    vessels, which are arranged in two sets, superficial and deep. The former are
                    confined to the surface of the organ, over which they may be seen creeping in
                    every direction, and belong chiefly to the membranous coverings of the glands.
                    The deep-seated lymphatics are those which penetrate the substance of the
                    glands, and in general accompany the large bloodvessels.</p>
                <p>Every gland receives a proportion of nervous branches, genera!ly from the nerves
                    of the sympathetic system. These branches accompany the blood-vessels in
                    penetrating the substance of the glands, and are distributed much in the same
                    manner as the arteries before their ultimate division. They exercise some
                    influence over the process of secretion; but the nature and extent of this
                    influence are still undetermined.</p>
                <p>Each gland contains a quantity of filamentous tissue, which envelopes the
                    blood-vessels, tubes, lymphatics, and nerves, and constitutes a large proportion
                    of the mass of the gland. The simple tissues, thus united, are inclosed in a
                    general membranous covering, which also partly contributes with these tissues to
                    retain it in its situation. These membranous coverings vary in different glands.
                    In the liver and pancreas it is the peritoneum; the kidneys are inclosed in a
                    peculiar tunic; the testes are contained in a fibrpus membrane; and the <hi

                    glands appear to be covered by a form of condensed filamentous tissue.</p>

                <p>Skin has been said to consist of three parts, true skin <hi rend="italic">(cutis
                    vera),</hi> mucous net <hi rend="italic">(rete mucosum),</hi> and scarf-skin or
                    cuticle. Haller, Camper, and Blumenbach, are inclined to deny the existence of
                    the mucous net in the skin of the white, and to admit it in that of the negro
                    only; and in point of fact, indeed, its existence has been demonstrated in the
                    negro race only, and inferred by analogy to exist in the white, “When a blister
                    has been applied to the skin of a negro,” says Cruikshank, “if it has not been
                    very stimulating, in twelve hours after a thin transparent grayish membrane is
                    raised, under which we find a fluid. This membrane is the cuticle or scarf-skin.
                    When this with the fluid is removed, the surface under these appears black; but
                    if the blister had been very stimulating, another membrane, in which this black
                    colour resides, would also have been raised with the cuticle. This is <hi
                    rend="italic">rete mucosum,</hi> which is itself double, consisting of another
                    gray transparent membrane, and of a black web very much resembling the <hi

                    membrane is removed, the surface of the true skin, as has been hitherto
                    believed, comes in view, and is white like that of a European. The <hi
                    rend="italic">rete mucosum</hi> gives the colour to the skin; is black in the
                    negro; white, brown, or yellowish in the European.” <hi rend="italic"

                    vascular surface of the corion as the only mucous net.</p>
                <p>According to Chaussier the skin consists of two parts only, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >derma (δiξμα, cutis vera)</hi> or corion, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >epidermis,</hi> cuticle, or scarf-skin; the first embracing the organic
                    elements of this tissue; the second being an inorganic substance prepared by the
                    organic, and deposited on its surface. This opinion is adopted by Gordon,
                    according to whom the skin consists of two substances placed above each other,
                    like layers or plates <hi rend="italic">(laminoe),</hi> the inner of which is
                    the true skin, the outer the cuticle or scarf-skin. Bedard, on the contrary,
                    thinks that a peculiar matter, which occasions the colour by which the several
                    races are distinguished, is found between the outer surface of the corion and
                    the cuticle; and that no fair race is destitute of it except the <hi

                    corium,</hi><hi rend="italic">derma, cutis vera)</hi> seems to consist chiefly
                    of very small dense fibres, not unlike those of the proper arterial coat,
                    closely interwoven with each other, and more firmly compacted the nearer they
                    are to its outer or cuticular surface. The inner surface of the corion is of a
                    gray colour; and in almost all parts of the body presents a number of
                    depressions varying in size from ∙⅛th to <hi rend="subscript"> τ</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> θth of an inch, and consequently forming spaces or
                    intervals between them. These depressions, which correspond to eminences in the
                    subjacent adipose tissue, have been termed <hi rend="italic">areolae.</hi> They
                    are wanting in the corion of the back of the hand and foot only.</p>
                <p>The outer or cuticular surface of the corion is smooth, of a pale or flesh-red
                    tinge, and is much more vascular than its inner surface. It presents further a
                    number of minute conical eminences <hi rend="italic">(papillae),</hi> which,
                    according to the recent observations of Gaultier and Dutrochet, are liberally
                    supplied with blood-vessels, and are the most vascular part of this membrane. In
                    the ordinary state of circulation and temperature during life these eminences
                    are on a level with the surrounding <hi rend="italic">corion</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but when the surface is chilled, this membrane shrinks,
                    while the papillae either continue unchanged or shrink less proportionally, and
                    give rise to the appearance described under the name of <hi rend="italic">goose
                    shin (cutis</hi><hi rend="italic">anserina).</hi> This surface was said by the
                    older anatomists to present numerous orifices or pores; but according to Gordon,
                    if we trust to observation, no openings of this kind can be recognised, either
                    by the eye or the microscope, except those of the sebaceous follicles. The
                    hairs, indeed, are found to issue from holes in thę corion, but they fill them
                    completely.</p>
                <p>In certain situations, for instance at the entrance of the external auditory
                    hole, at the tip of the nose, on the margins of the eyelids, in the armpits, at
                    the nipple, at the skin of the pubes, round the anus and the female pudendum,
                    are placed minute orifices, from which exudes an oleaginous fluid, which is
                    quickly indurated. These openings lead into the cavities of small sacs called
                    follicles <hi rend="italic">(folliculi)</hi> or sebaceous glands (<hi
                    rend="italic">glandulae sebaceae).</hi> These sacs, the structure of which is
                    noticed above, consist of hollow surfaces secreting an oleaginous fluid, which
                    is progressively propelled to the orifice, where it soon undergoes that partial
                    inspissation which gives it the sebaceous or suet-like aspect and
                    consistence.</p>
                <p>The corion is liberally supplied with blood-vessels, nerves, and absorbents.
                    After a successful injection, its outer surface appears to consist of a uniform
                    net-work of minute vessels, subdivided to an infinite degree of delicacy, and
                    containing during life blood coloured and colourless. It can scarcely be doubted
                    that this vascular net-work <hi rend="italic">(rete vasculosum)</hi> is the only
                    texture corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">reticular body</hi> of the older
                    anatomists.</p>
                <p>It is well known that this membrane, when boiled sufficiently long, is converted
                    into a viscid glutinous liquor, which consists chiefly of gelatine (Chaptal,
                    Seguin, Hatchett, Vauquelin, &amp;c.), and that glue is obtained from it for the
                    purposes of art. As, however, in these operations a portion of matter is left
                    undissolved, and as glue is completely soluble in water, while skin resists it
                    for an indefinite time, it may be concluded, that though the chief constituent
                    of the corion is gelatine, it is under some peculiar modification not perfectly
                    understood. The union of this organized gelatine with the vegetable principle
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">tannin</hi> forms leather, which is insoluble in
                    water.</p>
                <p>Cuticle or scarf-skin <hi rend="italic">(epidermis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cuticula)</hi> is a semitransparent, or rather translucent layer of thin
                    lightcoloured matter, extended continuously over the outer surface of the
                    corion. Its thickness varies, being thinnest in those parts least exposed to
                    pressure and friction, but thickest in the palms and soles. It is destitute of
                    bloodvessels, nerves, and absorbents; and there is reason to believe, from
                    observing the phenomena of its reproduction, that it is originally secreted in
                    the form of a semifluid viscid matter by the outer surface of the corion; and
                    that, as it is successively worn or removed by attrition, it is in like manner
                    replaced by a constant process of secretory deposition. This semifluid viscid
                    matter, which in truth is found between the outer surface of the corion and the
                    firm cuticle, is the substance mentioned by Malpighi, and so often spoken of as
                    the mucous net <hi rend="italic">(corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">mucosum).</hi> It
                    is inorganic; and it is impossible to explain its production otherwise than by
                    ascribing it to the outer vascular surface of the corion.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039572?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9572-0751"/>
                <p>Cuticle is rendered yellow and finally dissolved by immersion in nitric acid. It
                    is also dissolved by sulphuric acid in the form of a deep brown pulp. These, and
                    some other experiments performed by Hatchett, show that it consists chiefly of
                    modified albuminous matter.</p>
                <p>This description shows, that if strict observation be trusted, the mucous net has
                    no existence, at least in the European. In the Negro, Caffre, and Malay,
                    however, a black membrane is said to be interposed between the corion and
                    cuticle, and to be the cause of the dark complexion of these races. On this
                    subject I refer to the description given by Cruikshank, which is the best <hi
                    rend="italic">(Experiments,</hi> &amp;c. p. 31, 41, and 43); the Essay of Μ.
                    Gaultier, already quoted; and the observations of Bedard. What is found in the
                    skin of the mixed or half-caste races, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> the
                    offspring of an African and a European, or of a mulatto and European? and how is
                    the transition between this colouring layer and its insensible diminution
                    effected?</p>
                <p>Nail is a substance familiarly known. On its nature and structure we find many
                    conjectures, but few or no facts, in the writings of anatomists; and almost all
                    that has been written is the result of analogical inference rather than of
                    direct observation. It is known that the nails drop off with the scarf-skin in
                    the dead body; that they are diseased or destroyed by causes which act on the
                    outer surface of the corion, -and produce disease of the cuticle; and that, if
                    forcibly torn out, the surface of the corion to which they were attached bleeds
                    profusely and inflames. In other respects they are inorganic; but these facts
                    warrant the conclusion that the root of the nail is connected with the organic
                    substance of the corion, and that the whole substance is the result of a process
                    of secretion similar to that by which the cuticle is formed.</p>
                <p>According to the experiments of Hatchett, they consist of a substance which
                    possesses the properties of coagulated albumen, with a small trace of phosphate
                    of lime.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">root</hi> of a hair is not only that part which is
                    contained in the bulb, but the portion which is lodged in the skin. The <hi
                    rend="italic">middle part</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">point</hi> are those
                    which project beyond the surface of the skin. The <hi rend="italic">bulb</hi> is
                    a small sac fixed in the inner surface of the corion, in the contiguous
                    filamentous tissue, and in which the root is implanted.</p>
                <p>Every hair is cylindrical, tapering regularly from the root to the point, and
                    solid, but containing its proper colouring matter in its substance. The colour
                    varies, but the root is always whitish and transparent, and softer than the
                    rest; the fixed or adhering part of the root is almost fluid. When hair is
                    decolorized, it becomes transparent and brittle, and presents a peculiar
                    silvery-white colour; and as hairs of this kind are few or abundant, it gives
                    the aspect of gray, hoary, or white hair.</p>
                <p>The bulb, though visible in a hair plucked out by the root, is too small in human
                    hair to be minutely examined; and Chirac, Gaultier, and Gordon, have therefore
                    described its structure and appearances from the bulbs of the whiskers of large
                    animals, the seal for example, in which it is much more distinct. According to
                    researches of this kind, every bulb forms a sort of sac or follicle, which
                    consists of two tunics, an inner one, tender, vascular, and embracing closely
                    the root of the hair; and an outer, which is firmer and less vascular, and
                    surrounds the inner one, while it adheres to the filamentous tissue and the
                    inner surface of the coriσn. When the hair issues from the bulb, it passes
                    through an appropriate canal of the corion, which is always more or less
                    oblique, but which, as has been already said, it fills completely; and it
                    afterwards passes in a similar manner through the scarf-skin. Nervous filaments
                    have been traced into the bulbs of the whiskers of the seal by Rudolphi and the
                    younger Andral. The bulb or follicle, in short, is organic, and forms by
                    secretion the inorganic hair.</p>
                <p>The structure of hair appears to be either so simple, or so incapable of being
                    further elucidated, that anatomists have not given any facts of consequence
                    regarding it. Its outer surface is believed to be covered with imbricated
                    scales, because in moving a single hair between the finger and thumb it follows
                    one direction only.</p>
                <p>Hair is believed to be utterly inorganic, though the phcuomena of its growth,
                    decoloration, and especially of the disease termed Polish plait <hi
                    rend="italic">(plica Polonica),</hi> have led various authors to regard it as
                    possessed of some degree of vitality. These phenomena, however, may be explained
                    by the occurrence of disease in the bulbs or generating follicles. Hair is
                    insoluble in boiling water; but Vau-quelin succeeded in dissolving it by the aid
                    of Papin’s digester. From the experiments of this chemist, and those of
                    Hatchett, it may be inferred that hair consists of an animal matter, which
                    appears to be a modification of albumen, a colouring oil, and some saline
                    substances.</p>

                <p>The organic tissue or membrane to which the name of <hi rend="italic">mucous</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">villous</hi> has been applied, consists of two great
                    divisions, the gastro-pulmonary and gcnito-urinary.</p>
                <p>The first or gastro-pulmonary division comprehends that membranous surface which
                    commences at the various orifices of the face at which it is contiguous with the
                    skin, and is continued through the lacrymal and nasal passages, and even the
                    Eustachian tube, by the larynx on the one hand to the windpipe and bronchial
                    membrane, and by the oesophagus on the other through the entire tract of the
                    alimentary canal, at the opposite extremity of which it is again identified with
                    the skin.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the second division, or the genitourinary mucous membrane, is
                    slightly varied according to the differences of sex. In the male it is connected
                    with the skin at the orifice of the urethra, from which it proceeds inwards
                    toward the bladder, sending previously small prolongations through ducts on each
                    side of the <hi rend="italic">veru montanum,</hi> from which it is believed to
                    be continued through the <hi rend="italic">vasa deferentia,</hi> to the <hi
                    rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi> of the testicle. Continued over the inner
                    surface of the urinary-bladder, it is prolonged through the ureters to the
                    pelvis and infundibula of the kidney. In the female, besides passing in this
                    direction, it ascends into the womb, and passes through the Fallopian or uterine
                    tubes, at the upper extremity of which it terminates in an abrupt opening into
                    the sac of the peritoneum—the only instance in the whole body in which a mucous
                    and serous surface communicate freely and directly.</p>
                <p>These two orders of membranous tissue have each two surfaces, an attached or
                    adherent, and a free one. The adherent surface is attached, ls∕, to muscles, as
                    in the tongue, most of the mouth and fauces, oesophagus, and whole alimentary
                    canal, and the bladder; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> to fibrous membranes, as m

                    intestines; the surface of the tongue and mouth is different from that of the
                    trachea; and the free surface of the urethra is unlike that of the bladder.
                    These variations depend on difference of structure, and are connected with a
                    difference in properties; yet anatomists have improperly applied to the whole
                    what was peculiar to certain parts only, and have thus created a system in which
                    some truth is blended with much misrepresentation.</p>
                <p>Mucous membrane consists, like skin, of a <hi rend="italic">corion</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">derma,</hi> and an <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">cuticle.</hi></p>
                <p>The mucous corion is a firm, dense, gray substance, which forms the ground-work
                    of the membrane in most regions of the body, but which is evidently represented
                    by the fibrous system, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the periostemn or
                    perichondrium, in some other situations. It is most distinctly seen in the mouth
                    and throat, and in various parts of the alimentary canal. In the first situation
                    it is more vascular, less gray and dense, than in the intestinal mucous
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>It possesses two surfaces, an inner, adherent to the submucous filamentous
                    tissue, and an outer or proper mucous surface. In the stomach, the mucous corion
                    is in the form of a soft but firm membranous substance, about ⅜th or ⅛th of a
                    line thick, tough, of a dun-gray or fawn colour (intermediate between
                    Sienna-yellow and ochre-yellow, Syme), slightly translucent, and sinking in
                    water. The attached or inner surface is flocculent and tomentose, and a shade
                    lighter than the outer, which presents a sort of shag or velvet, consisting of
                    very minute piles. This, when examined by a good lens at oblique light, appears
                    to consist of an infinite number of very minute roundish bodies closely set, but
                    separated by equally minute linear pits, and occasionally circular depressions.
                    In the ileum it presents much the same characters; but the minute bodies of its
                    shaggy surface are still larger and more distinct, and may be seen by the naked
                    eye. In the windpipe, again, it is rather thinner and lighter coloured; and
                    while its outer surface presents numerous minute pores, it&gt; is much smoother
                    than in the alimentary canal, and entirely destitute of those minute bodies seen
                    in the latter. It nowhere presents any appearance of fibres.</p>
                <p>The mucous corion rests on a layer of filamentous tissue, firm and dense, and of
                    a bluish-white colour,— <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> character by which it is
                    distinguished from the soft fawn-coloured mucous membrane. This submucous
                    filamentous tissue is what is erroneously termed the <hi rend="italic">nervous
                    coat</hi> by Ruysch, Albinus, and some of the older anatomists.</p>
                <p>In certain -parts the mucous corion is covered by a thin transparent membrane,
                    named the <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> or cuticle, which is most easily
                    shown by boiling or scalding a portion of mucous membrane, and then peeling off
                    with care the outer pellicle. This experiment succeeds best in the mucous
                    membrane of the mouth and palate, in which, therefore, the existence of mucous
                    epidermis cannot be doubted. The observations of Wepfer, Haller, and Nicholls,
                    and especially of Bleuland (<hi rend="italic">Observationes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Anato-mico-Medicae de Sana</hi><hi rend="italic">et
                    Morbosa</hi><hi rend="italic">(Esophagi</hi><hi rend="italic">Structura,</hi>
                    Lug. Bat. 1785), are sufficient to prove its existence in the oesophagus. Bichat
                    admits that, though it may be demonstrated at the cutaneous junctions of the
                    mucous surfaces, it cannot be recognised in the stomach, intestines, bladder,
                    &amp;c. From the numerous dissections of Home <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Trans.</hi> 1807, 1810, 1813), it results that the mucous epidermis, both in the
                    human subject and in most <hi rend="italic">mammalia</hi> and birds, terminates
                    abruptly at the cardiac orifice of the stomach. In ruminant animals the mucous
                    <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> is continued over the first two stomachs, but
                    cannot be traced in the third and fourth. In the whale tribe, in which the
                    stomach is also quadruple, the <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> is confined to
                    the first cavity. In birds of the graz- <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> ing
                    tribe, the mucous <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> is continued over the giz-^
                    zard, but terminates at the opening into the stomach.ŋ This conclusion as to the
                    human subject is confirmed by Bedard, who further adds, that in the
                    genito-urinary system it cannot be traced beyond the neck of the womb and that
                    of the bladder.</p>
                <p>In most mucous membranes are found minute oval or spheroidal bodies, slightly
                    elevated, and presenting an orifice leading to a blind or shut cavity. As they
                    are believed to secrete a fluid analogous to or identical with mucus, they are
                    named mucous glands; and from their shape and situation they are also
                    denominated follicles <hi rend="italic">(folliculi)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >cryptae.</hi> Though more or less abundant in all the mucous membranes, they
                    have been most frequently examined in those of the alimentary canal, where they
                    were first accurately described by Brunner and Peyer. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Glanduloe Peyerianoe^)</hi> In this situation they are situate in the
                    substance of the mucous corion. Their structure is simple. The orifice leads
                    into a saccular cavity, with a smooth, uniform surface, which secretes the fluid
                    which oozes from them. This membranous sac is lodged in a reddish-coloured,
                    dense, anormal matter, which is probably filamentous tissue enveloping minute
                    blood-vessels; but of the minute structure of which nothing is accurately known.
                    In the state of health these bodies are so minute that it is very difficult to
                    recognise them. I have seen them, nevertheless, in the tracheo-bronchial
                    membrane by the eye and by a lens. When the membranes are inflamed they become
                    larger and more distinct. In the bladder, the womb, the gallbladder, and the
                    seminal vesicles, they are not distinctly seen, and cannot be satisfactorily
                    demonstrated. It is unnecessary, however, to follow the example of Bichat in
                    trusting to analogy to prove their existence; for they are not necessary to the
                    secretion of mucous fluid, as he seems to imagine. Those in the urethra, first
                    well described by William Cowper, are distinct examples of follicles in the
                    genito-urinary surface. The sinuosities <hi rend="italic">(lacunoe),</hi> first
                    accurately described, if not discovered, by Morgagni <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Adversaria</hi><hi rend="italic">Anatomica,</hi> iv. 8, 9, &amp;c.), though
                    not exactly the same in conformation and structure, seem to be very slightly
                    different.</p>
                <p>In certain regions of the mucous membranes, especially at their connections with
                    the skin, are found minute conical eminences denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilloe.</hi> They are distinctly seen in the mucous membrane of the tongue,
                    where they vary in size and shape, and in the body named <hi rend="italic"
                    >clitoris.</hi> They are elevations belonging to the mucous corion, covered by
                    epidermis, and they are liberally supplied by blood-vessels, the veins of which
                    present an erectile arrangement, and with minute nervous filaments.</p>
                <p>In the stomach, duodemun, and ileum, this membrane is collected into folds or
                    plaits, which have received in the former situation the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">rugoe,</hi> or wrinkles; and in the latter the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">plicoe,</hi> or folds, and <hi rend="italic">valvulae
                    cοnni-νentes,</hi> or winking valves. In the vagina also are transverse <hi
                    rend="italic">rugoe,</hi> which in like manner are folds or duplicatures of its
                    mucous membrane. Those of the oesophagus, which have been described by Bleuland,
                    are longitudinal. In the tracheo-bronchĩal membrane, and in the membranous and
                    spongy portions of the urethra, we find them in the shape of minute plaits or
                    wrinkles in the long direction or their respective tubes, but rarely of much
                    length. The object of these folds, which are peculiar to the mucous membranes,
                    appears to be to increase the extent of surface, and to allow the membrane to
                    undergo considerable occasional distension.</p>

                <p>In certain points, where a communication is observed between the general mucous
                    surface and the cavities or recesses of particular regions, anatomists, unable
                    to demonstrate a mucous membrane, have inferred its existence as a continuation
                    of the general surface. In the tympanal cavity, to which the Eustachian tube
                    leads, the existence of a mucous or fibro-mucous membrane is rather presumed
                    from analogy than proved by observation. We know that, where the biliary and
                    pancreatic ducts enter the duodenum, and for a considerable space towards the
                    liver, the interior appearance is that of a fine mucous surface provided with
                    <hi rend="italic">lacunoe</hi> and villosities; but it is impossible to say at
                    what point of the hepatic duct, or of the smaller canals of which it is formed,
                    the mucous membrane terminates. The tracheal membrane, when traced to the
                    bronchial divisions, presents no arrangement, either of <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilloe,</hi> piles, or villosities; and nothing is perceived except a smooth
                    uniform surface, of a colour between gray, dun, and red or purple, which is
                    moistened with a viscid semi-transparent fluid, and which is as like the
                    peritoneum as the intestinal mucous membrane. Lastly, the situation where the
                    existence of the mucous system, though believed, is most uncertain, is in the
                    interior of the <hi rend="italic">vasa deferentia,</hi> where they take their
                    origin from the <hi rend="italic">vasa efferentia</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >testis.</hi> Regarding the organization of these tubes, no sensible evidence
                    can be obtained, and whatever is stated concerning it is the result of
                    analogical inference.</p>
                <p>Though these membranes have been designated by the general name of <hi
                    rend="italic">mucous,</hi> the action of their surface is not in every situation
                    the same. It is not easy to limit the signification of the term <hi
                    rend="italic">mucus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for this fluid varies in the
                    nasal passages, in the trachea and bronchial membrane, in the oesophagus,
                    stomach, and intestines, and in the urinary bladder and ureters. But it may be
                    stated that many parts of the two mucous surfaces never in the healthy state
                    secrete any modification of this animal matter; and in others the membrane is
                    almost always moistened by a different fluid. The mucous or villous membrane of
                    the eyelids is never in the healthy state occupied by mucus, but is uniformly
                    moistened with the tears; the membrane of the mouth and throat is moistened with
                    saliva only; the urethra presents a peculiar viscid fluid, which seems to exude
                    from many minute vessels opening along its surface, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >lacunoe,</hi> but which is widely different from mucus. All those parts, in
                    short, which are not in perpetual, but only occasional, contact with foreign or
                    secreted substances, seem to present no mucus in the healthy state; whereas the
                    surfaces of the stomach, intestines, gall-bladder, and urinary bladder, are
                    constantly covered with a quantity, more or less considerable, of this animal
                    secretion.</p>
                <p>The chemical properties of mucous membranes are completely unknown. The analysis
                    of the fluid secreted by them has been executed by Fourcroy, Berzelius, and
                    others, but is foreign to the subject of this article.</p>
                <p>That the mucous membranes are liberally supplied with blood by vessels both large
                    and numerous, is proved not only by the phenomena of injections, but by the red
                    colour of which many of their divisions are the seat. This coloration, as well
                    as the injectibility, is not indeed uniform; for in certain regions mucous
                    surfaces are pale or light blue, in others their redness is considerable.</p>
                <p>Thus, in those regions in which the mucous membranes coalesce with the
                    periosteum, forming fibro-mucous membranes, e. <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> in the
                    facial sinuses, the tympanal cavity and the mastoid cells, the colour is pale
                    blue, or approaching to light lilac. In the bladder, in the large intestines, in
                    the excretory ducts in general, though pale, this colouring becomes more vivid.
                    In the pulmonic mucous membrane it is slate-blue, verging to pale pink. In the
                    stomach, duodenum, small intestines, and the vagina, it becomes still more
                    marked. In the uterus it varies according to the period or the intervals of
                    menstruation.</p>
                <p>Examined in the gastro-enteric mucous membrane, in which they are most numerous,
                    these vessels are found to consist of an extensive net-work of capillaries
                    divided to an infinite degree of minuteness, mutually intersecting and spreading
                    over the upper or outer surface of the mucous corion. This vascular net-work,
                    though demonstrated by Ruysch, Albinus, Haller, and Bichat, has been beautifully
                    represented in the delineations of Bleuland, who thinks he has traced their
                    minute ramifications into the <hi rend="italic">villi.</hi> These minute vessels
                    are derived from larger ones, which creep through the submucous cellular tissue,
                    and penetrate the mucous corion, the substance of which receives few or no
                    vessels, to be finally distributed at its exterior surface.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of the vessels which supply the mucous surfaces is peculiar.
                    Penetrating, in the form of considerable trunks, between the folds of the serous
                    membranes, they divide in the subserous cellular tissue into branches of
                    considerable size; and here they form those numerous anastomotic communications
                    which constitute the arches so distinctly seen in the ileum. From the convexity
                    of these arches are sent off most of the small vessels, which are then fitted,
                    after passing through the muscular layer and the submucous tissue, to enter the
                    mucous corion.</p>
                <p>The capillary terminations, then, of these arteries, and their corresponding
                    veins, constitute the physical cause of the coloration of the mucous membranes.
                    This coloration, however, is not at all times of the same intensity in the same
                    membrane, and varies chiefly according to the state of the organ which the
                    membrane covers. The coloration of the gastro-enteric mucous membrane undergoes,
                    even within the limits of health, many variations. Thus, according to the
                    absence or presence of such foreign substances as are taken at meals, the mucous
                    membrane is pale, or presents various shades of redness. At the period of
                    menstruation the uterine mucous membrane becomes red and injected. Pressure on
                    any of the venous vessels renders the mucous membranes blue, purple, or livid,
                    as is seen in <hi rend="italic">prolapsus,</hi> and more distinctly in <hi
                    rend="italic">asphyxia,</hi> in which all the mucous membranes assume a livid
                    tint. (Bichat.) The varieties of red colour observed in the gastric mucous
                    membrane by Dr Yellowly are to be ascribed partly to the latter cause, partly to
                    the vascular redness which the presence of foreign bodies occasions. <hi

                    ash-gray or dun colour, inclining to pale blue or light red. These colours vary,
                    nevertheless, according to the facility or the difficulty with which the blood
                    moves through the pulmonary capillary system. It is also freely supplied with
                    blood-vessels derived chiefly from the bronchial arteries. These vessels, after
                    accompanying the bronchial tubes and their successive subdivisions, divide into
                    minute branches which penetrate the mucous corion, which here is white, dense,
                    and fibrous, and after anastomosing with the capillaries of the pulmonary artery
                    and veins, form a minute delicate net-work on the outer surface of the pulmonary
                    mucous membrane. According to Reisseissen, to whom wc are indebted for a careful
                    examination of these vessels, a successful injection of them from the bronchial
                    arteries renders the whole mucous membrane of the <hi rend="italic">bronchi</hi>
                    entirely red to the unassisted eye. <hi rend="italic">( Ueber</hi><hi

                    termination of arteries at the mucous surfaces has at all times occupied the
                    attention of anatomists and physiologists; but it is not a matter of sensible
                    demonstration. The thin serous or sero-mucous fluid with which they are
                    moistened has led every author almost, and among the rest Haller and Bichat, to
                    infer the existence of arteries with orifices, or what are termed exhalant
                    vessels. It has been admitted, nevertheless, more on analogical than direct
                    proofs. The injections of Bleuland, the only experiments, after those of Kawe
                    Boerhaave, which tend to confirm the conclusion, require nevertheless to be
                    repeated and varied.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi

                <p>That lymphatics are distributed to mucous membranes, is a point well established.
                    Cruikshank saw the lymphatics proceeding from the pulmonic mucous membrane
                    loaded with blood in persons and animals dying of hae-moptoe. Their existence in
                    the gastro-enteric mucous membrane has been long established.</p>
                <p>The mucous surfaces arc also freely supplied by nervous twigs and filaments,
                    derived in general from the nerves of automatic life. It is a mistake,
                    nevertheless, to ascribe to these filaments the sensibility and other properties
                    of the mucous membranes, which possess intrinsically certain vital properties
                    independently of the nervous filaments with which they are supplied; and the
                    principal use of these filaments appears to be to regulate these properties,
                    especially that of secretion.</p>
                <p>The connection between the mucous membranes and the skin was first demonstrated
                    by Bonn, who traces their mutual approximation and reciprocal transition into
                    each other, and represents the former as an interior production of the latter,
                    enveloping the internal as the skin incloses the external organs. This view has
                    been adopted by Meckel and Beclard, to whom I refer for the proofs of its
                    accuracy. I cannot conclude the subject, however, without observing that one of
                    the most conclusive arguments in its favour is derived from the circumstances of
                    the developement of the intestinal canal during the first months of uterine
                    life. The history of this curious process, which has been investigated by Wolff,
                    Oken, and Meckel, shows that at this period the gastro-enteric mucous membrane,
                    which is previously formed by the vitellar membrane of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ovum,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">allantois</hi> or vesical membrane, which
                    afterwards forms the genito-urinary mucous surface, are in direct communication
                    on the median line, and afterwards at the navel, with the skin or exterior
                    integument.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi> are the
                    best examples of the tissue which has been named <hi rend="italic">serous,</hi>
                    from the fluid with which it is moistened, and which may be termed <hi
                    rend="italic">transparent</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diaphanous</hi> as its
                    distinctive character.</p>
                <p>The distribution or mechanical arrangement of these membranes is peculiar, and
                    though not well understood by anatomists, till Douglas, by his description of
                    the peritoneum, rendered it clearer, may now be said, by the labours of Hunter,
                    Carmichael Smyth, and Bichat, to be quite intelligible. In this, nevertheless,
                    there are certain peculiarities which may perplex the beginner, and prevent him
                    from obtaining at first a clear idea of the distribution and configuration of
                    the pellucid membranes. Thus they have neither beginning nor termination; they
                    have neither orifice nor egredient canal; and they are not continuous with any
                    other membrane or texture.</p>
                <p>Every serous membrane consists of a hollow sac everywhere closed, and to the
                    cavity or interior surface of which there is no natural entrance; a circumstance
                    from which they have been denominated <hi rend="italic">shut sacs</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(sacci occlusi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sacs</hi><hi rend="italic">sans ouverture).</hi> In every serous membrane one
                    part is inverted or inflected, or reflected, as is commonly said, within the
                    other, so that the inner surface of the former part is applied with more or less
                    accuracy to the inner or like surface of the latter. This mode of disposition
                    has suggested the homely and trite, but not inappropriate comparison of a serous
                    membrane to a night-cap, one half of which is folded or doubled within the
                    other, so that while one half of the inner surface is applied to the remaining
                    half, no communication exists between the inner and the outer surface. Every
                    serous membrane, in short, is a single sac, one half of which is doubled within
                    the other.</p>
                <p>In every serous membrane the outer surface of the unreflected portion is applied
                    over the walls of the region which the serous membrane lines, while the outer
                    surface of the inflected portion is applied over the organ or organs contained
                    in that region. From this arrangement it results that each organ covered by
                    serous membrane is not contained in that membrane, but is on its exterior
                    surface, and that of every organ so situate, one part at least, viz. that at
                    which its vessels and nerves enter, is always uncovered. Thus the lungs are on
                    the outer surface of the <hi rend="italic">pleura;</hi> the heart is on the
                    outside of the <hi rend="italic">pericardium;</hi> the stomach, intestines,
                    liver, spleen, and pancreas, arc on the outside of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >peritoneum;</hi> and the testicles are on the outside of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >perididymis.</hi> In the same manner the lungs, though invested by pleura
                    before and behind, at their apex and their base, are uncovered at their roots,
                    or the points where the bronchial tubes and great bloodvessels enter their
                    substance; the heart is uncovered by pericardium at the upper part of the
                    auricular cavities; and the intestinal canal is uncovered along the whole of
                    that longitudinal but tortuous line by which the mesentery is attached, and at
                    which its proper vessels and nerves are transmitted.</p>
                <p>To comprehend more distinctly the arrangement of the pellucid membranes, it is
                    expedient, by an effort of abstraction, to trace the course of any one of them,
                    having previously thrown out of the question the means by which their interior
                    free surface is exposed. In this mental process it is requisite to remember that
                    there is no initial point save what is arbitrarily made. If, for example, the
                    course of the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> bc traced, the membrane presents no
                    natural boundary from which the anatomist is to commence his demonstration; and
                    he must fix artificially on any point which he finds most convenient for the
                    purpose. Commencing with this understanding, from the circumference of the spot
                    termed <hi rend="italic">root of</hi> the lungs, the membrane may be traced
                    first along the internal surface of the chest formed by the ribs and intercostal
                    muscles, forwards to the sternum, upwards to the first rib and <hi rend="italic"
                    >apex</hi> of the thoracic cavity, downwards to the diaphragmatic insertions,
                    and over the surface of that muscle, and the outer surface of the pericardium
                    again to the circumference of the root or connection of the lungs. From this
                    point again it may be traced over the surface and between the lobes of these
                    organs, both of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039624?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9624-0755"/> which, as already stated, are thus situate on the
                    outside of the pleura. The course first described is that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">unreflected</hi> or <hi rend="italic">exterior</hi> division of
                    the pleura. The second, or that over the organ covered, is the course of the <hi
                    rend="italic">inflected</hi> or <hi rend="italic">doubled</hi> portion of the
                    membrane, which is thus necessarily smaller, and less extensive, than the
                    former.</p>
                <p>The arrangement thus sketched, which may be easily shown to be applicable to all
                    the serous membranes, demonstrates their twofold character of lining the walls
                    of a cavity and covering the organs contained. From an idea of this property,
                    the old anatomists applied to them the epithet of <hi rend="italic">membranae
                    succingentes.</hi></p>
                <p>In tracing the course of the serous membranes, the anatomist observes that they
                    present productions which float with more or less freedom in the cavity formed
                    by the free surface, and which may be generally shown to consist of two folds of
                    the single membrane produced beyond the inclosed organ, but still maintaining
                    the unity of the membrane. Of these prolongations, the most distinct examples
                    are the <hi rend="italic">epiploon</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">appendices
                    epiploicae</hi> of the peritoneum. Less manifest instances are the adipose folds
                    of the <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> near the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mediastinum,</hi> and the bladder-like appearance at the base of the heart,
                    within the <hi rend="italic">pericardium.</hi> The synovial fringes in the
                    interior of the synovial membranes, which belong to a subsequent head, are
                    nevertheless of the same general character. Between the folds of these
                    productions there is invariably more or less adipose substance, which indeed is
                    observed in some quantity in various parts of the filamentous tissue on the
                    outer surface of the serous membranes in general.</p>
                <p>Every serous membrane I have above represented as a hollow sac everywhere
                    continuous, and the outer surface of which has no communication with the inner.
                    To this character the only exception is the peritoneum in the female, which is
                    perforated at two points, corresponding to the upper extremity or orifice of the
                    Fallopian or ovi-ferous tubes. This has been already mentioned as the only spot
                    at which the mucous and serous surfaces communicate directly with each
                    other.</p>
                <p>Every serous membrane consists of a thin, colourless, transparent web or
                    pellicle, through which the tissue of the subjacent organ or parts may be easily
                    <hi rend="subscript"> t</hi> ∙recognised; and every serous membrane presents two
                    surfaces, an attached or adherent, and a free or unadherent.</p>
                <p>The attached surface, which is also termed its <hi rend="italic">outer</hi> one,
                    is that by which it is connected to the tissue or organ which it covers; it is
                    somewhat irregular, flocculent or tomentose, and is evidently connected by fine
                    filamentous tissue. The degree of attachment is very variable in different
                    membranes, and in different points of the same membrane. In general, serous
                    membranes adhere much less firmly to the walls of cavities than to the surface
                    of the contained organs. Thus, the abdominal <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi>
                    and the costal <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> are more easily removed than the
                    intestinal <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi> and the pulmonic <hi rend="italic"
                    >pleura.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">peritoneum</hi> adheres feebly to the
                    bladder, to the liver, and to the pancreas—more intimately to the different
                    regions of the intestinal tube, and seems to be almost identified with the
                    substance of the female organs of generation. From the interior of the capsular
                    <hi rend="italic">pericardium,</hi> and from the vaginal coat, it is almost
                    impossible to detach the serous pellicle. The former, however, is peculiar in
                    having between the serous surface and the fibrous membrane no filamentous
                    tissue, upon the abundance or deficiency of which the degree of adhesion
                    depends.</p>
                <p>The free or unadherent or <hi rend="italic">inner</hi> surface is very smooth,
                    polished, and uniform; moistened with a watery fluid, from which it derives its
                    shining appearance; and destitute of fibres or any other trace of organic
                    structure. From this smooth, polished aspect, which is a peculiar attribute of
                    the free surface of serous membrane, all the organs covered by it derive their
                    glistening appearance. Thus the exterior surface of the lungs derives its
                    appearance from the pleura, the heart from the pericardium, and the liver and
                    intestinal canal from the peritoneum. A successful injection of size or
                    turpentine, coloured with vermilion, brings into view so many capillary
                    blood-vessels in this membrane, that it might be supposed at first sight to
                    consist entirely of minute arteries and veins. Further, by proper management,
                    lymphatics may be injected in it with quicksilver to a degree equally minute and
                    delicate. From these experiments, therefore, it may be concluded that serous
                    membrane is chiefly composed of minute arteries and veins conveying colourless
                    fluids, and of vessels connected with the general trunks of the lymphatic
                    system. Whether it contains any thing else but vessels of this kind, or has a
                    proper, substance or tissue, remains to be ascertained. Though nerves are often
                    seen passing along their outer or attached surface to the neighbouring tissues,
                    none have hitherto been traced either into the pleura or peritoneum.</p>
                <p>By most of the older anatomists, and among others by Haller, serous membrane is
                    considered as of the nature of filamentous tissue or cellular membrane, more or
                    less closely condensed <hi rend="italic">(tela</hi><hi rend="italic">cellulosa
                    stipata)</hi>; and this view is adopted and maintained by Bordeu, Bichat,
                    Meckel, and Beclard, the last of whom, however, thinks they partake of
                    ligamentous characters. Macerated, they become soft, thick, and pulpy; and are
                    finally resolved into flocculent filamentous matter. In the course of
                    decomposition in the dead subject they first lose their glistening aspect, then
                    become covered by a foul, dirty coating of viscid matter, which appears to exude
                    from their surface; and eventually they are dissolved into shreds. Immersion in
                    boiling water renders them thick, firm, and somewhat crisp. When dried they
                    become thin, clear, and transparent, and, if preserved from humidity or the
                    attacks of animals, may remain long unchanged. The experiments of Hatchett,
                    Fourcroy, and Vauquelin, show that they contain gelatine and a little albumen;
                    but no precise information on their chemical composition has yet been given.</p>
                <p>The principal character of the serous membranes is that of isolating the organs
                    which they cover, and to the structure of which they are adventitious, and
                    forming shut cavities, in which there is incessant exhalation and absorption. In
                    some instances they evidently contribute to facilitate the mutual motions of
                    contiguous and corresponding surfaces. From their free surfaces is secreted a
                    fluid containing a small portion of albumen (Hewson, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Experimental Inquiries,</hi> vol. ii. chap. vii.; Bostock, Nicholson’s <hi

                    >Transactions,</hi> vol. iv.), which is greatly augmented during the state of
                    disease.</p>
                <p>The mode of developement of the pellucid membranes is not well ascertained. The
                    investigations regarding organogenesy by Oken, Meckel, and Tiedemann, disclose
                    facts which induce Meckel to hazard the opinion that some of them are not at all
                    times shut sacs. I doubt, however, whether the fact which he adduces for this
                    purpose implies the open condition of the pericardium and the peritoneum. In the
                    case of the former the developement of the heart proceeds from the basis
                    generally, without affecting the integrity of the investing membrane. In the
                    case of the latter there is more reason to believe that, at the navel, at least,
                    the peritoneum is either open, or is continuous with the vitellar membrane.</p>
                <p>In the foetus the serous membranes are so thin, that <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039637?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9637-0756"/> they are much
                    more transparent than in the adult. In small animals also, they are more
                    transparent than in large, and in cold-blooded animals than in the mammiferous.
                    Of some also the disposition varies at different periods. Thus the descent of
                    the testicle,—a process which has been well explained by Albinus, Haller,
                    Wrisberg, and Langenbeck,—is attended with a remarkable change in the
                    arrangement of that portion of peritoneum which the gland impels before it.</p>

                <p>Bichat enumerates several circumstances in which he conceives that serous and
                    synovial membranes differ from each other. Gordon, who doubts how far the
                    distinctions are well founded as the basis of anatomical arrangement, admits,
                    however, the following peculiarities.</p>
                <p>Synovial membrane resembles serous membrane in being a thin, transparent
                    substance, having one smooth free surface turned towards certain cavities of the
                    body, and another connected by delicate cellular tissue to the sides of these
                    cavities, or to the parts contained in them. But it differs from serous membrane
                    in the following circumstances. Is?, It possesses little vascularity in the
                    healthy state; no blood-vessels are almost ever seen in it after death, nor can
                    they be made to receive the finest injection. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> Its
                    lymphatics are quite incapable of demonstration. 3&lt;Z, Very delicate fibres,
                    like those of cellular substance, or like the finest filaments of tendon, are
                    distinctly seen in it after slight maceration. 4tΛ, It is considerably less
                    strong than serous membrane. On these grounds, therefore, synovial membrane is
                    to be anatomically distinguished from serous membrane.</p>
                <p>The synovial membrane, as described above, is found not only in each of the
                    movable articulations, but in those sheaths in which tendons are lodged, and in
                    which they undergo considerable extent of motion, and in certain situations in
                    the subcutaneous filamentous tissue.</p>
                <p>The distribution of the synovial membranes is much the same in all these
                    situations. They are known to line the ligamentous apparatus of each joint,
                    capsular and funicular; and they are also continued over the cartilaginous
                    extremities of the bones of which the articulation consists. This continuation,
                    which was originally maintained by Nesbitt, Bonn, and William Hunter, and was
                    demonstrated by various facts by Bichat, has been lately questioned by Gordon
                    and Magendie, the former of whom especially thinks it unsusceptible of
                    anatomical proof. The cartilaginous synovial membrane is certainly not so easily
                    demonstrable as the capsular, for the same reason which I have already assigned
                    regarding the difficulty of isolating the capsular pericardium, the ovarian
                    peritoneum, and the serous covering of the <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    albuginea,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> the want of filamentous tissue.</p>
                <p>The presence of synovial membrane in the articular cartilages is nevertheless
                    established by sundry facts. 1$?, If a portion of articular cartilage be divided
                    obliquely, and examined by a good glass, it is not difficult to recognise at one
                    extremity of the section a thin pellicle, differing widely in aspect, colour,
                    anchstructure, from the bluish-white appearance of the cartilage. <hi
                    rend="italic">2đ,</hi> If the free surface of the cartilage be scraped gently,
                    it is possible to detach thin shavings, which are also distinct from cartilage
                    in their appearance. <hi rend="italic">3d,</hi> The free surface of the
                    cartilage is totally different from the attached surface, or from a section of
                    its substance, and derives its peculiar smooth polished appearance from a very
                    thin transparent pellicle uniformly spread over it. 4?Λ, If articular cartilage
                    be immersed in boiling water, this thin pellicle becomes opaque, while the
                    cartilage is little changed. <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> Immersion in nitric or
                    muriatic acid, which detaches the cartilage from the bone, gives this surface a
                    cracked appearance, which is not seen in the attached surface, and which is
                    probably to be ascribed to irregular contraction of two different animal
                    substances. 6?Λ, The existence of this cartilaginous synovial membrane is
                    demonstrated by the morbid process with which the tissue is liable to be
                    affected. On the whole, therefore, little doubt can be entertained that the
                    representation of their course, as given originally by Nesbitt, Bonn, and
                    Hunter, is well founded.</p>
                <p>The same views may be applied to the synovial linings of the tendinous sheaths,
                    which are equally to be regarded as shut sacs.</p>
                <p>Attached to the free surface of each synovial membrane is a peculiar fringe-like
                    substance, which was long supposed to be an apparatus of glands (glands of
                    Havers) for secreting synovial fluid. It is now known that these fringes are
                    merely puckered folds of synovial membrane, and that, although synovia is
                    abundantly secreted by them, this depends merely on the great extent of surface
                    which is the necessary consequence of their puckered arrangement This
                    arrangement is easily demonstrated by immersing an articulation containing the
                    fringed processes in clear water, when they are unfolded and made to float, and
                    show their connections, figure, and terminations. They are analogous to the free
                    processes of serous membranes, and like them are double, and contain adipose
                    matter.</p>
                <p>The synovial sheaths <hi rend="italic">(bursae mucosoe)</hi> are very numerous,
                    and are generally found in every tendon which is exposed to frequent or
                    extensive motion.</p>
                <p>Though the fluid prepared by these membranes has been examined by Margueron,
                    Fourcroy, John Davy, Orfila, and other chemists, it cannot be said that its
                    chemical composition is accurately determined. It is said to contain water,
                    albumen, incoagulable matter regarded as mucilaginous gelatine, a ropy matter,
                    and salts of soda, lime, and some uric acid. On the presence of the incoagulable
                    gelatine depends its utility in diminishing friction in the finer kinds of
                    metallic machinery employed in watches and chronometers.</p>

                    rend="smallcaps">Special Anatomy</hi> may be defined to be that science, the
                    province of which is to determine the shape, situation, and component parts of
                    the several textures and organs of which the human body consists. In the course
                    of this, however, it is requisite to premise some observations on the external
                    shape of the. body, and the different regions into which it has, for the sake of
                    greater precision, been divided.</p>
                <p>The external shape of the human body is so well known, that it is superfluous to
                    describe it. Besides its division into right and left halves, anterior and
                    posterior surfaces, it.is divided into head, trunk, and extremities. The trunk
                    is subdivided into neck <hi rend="italic">(collum),</hi> chest <hi rend="italic"
                    >(thorax, pectus),</hi> and belly <hi rend="italic">(abdomen).</hi> The
                    extremities are subdivided .into <hi rend="italic">thoracic</hi> or upper, and
                    <hi rend="italic">pelvic, abdominal,</hi> or lower.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039650?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9650-0757"/>
                <p>The shape of the head is ellipsoidal, or oblong spheroidal; the greater diameter
                    being antero-posterior, and the transverse smallest. The neck is cylindrical,
                    spreading out above and below. The shape of the trunk is that of an irregular
                    cylinder, flattened before and behind, broad above, and tapering below the
                    chest, but expanding again at the pelvis. The extremities affect the cylindrical
                    form, inclining to the conical.</p>
                <p>These several parts may be still further subdivided. The head is distinguished
                    into two great divisions, the head proper, and the face. The former corresponds
                    to the scalp, and may be divided into coronal, temporal, parietal, and occipital
                    regions. The coronal or syncipital may be reckoned from the anterior margin of
                    the scalp to the site of the anterior fontanelle, or the line named the coronal
                    suture. Behind this to the crown <hi rend="italic">(vertex),</hi> and downwards
                    on each side, are the parietal or lateral regions; from the parietal and frontal
                    is the temporal; from the crown to the flexure of the neck is the hind-head or
                    occipital <hi rend="italic">(occiput);</hi> from the last point to the level of
                    the shoulders is the <hi rend="italic">cervix</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> on
                    each side are the lateral regions of the neck; and before is the laryngeal,
                    jugular, or anterior <hi rend="italic">(jugulum).</hi> The face consists of the
                    brow, front or forehead <hi rend="italic">(frons),</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">glabella</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mesophryon</hi> at its base, in
                    the middle, and the eyebrows <hi rend="italic">(supercilia)</hi> on each side;
                    the nose <hi rend="italic">(ηαsus),</hi> the upper lip <hi rend="italic"

                    the chops <hi rend="italic">(buccoe),</hi> and the upper jaw <hi rend="italic"
                    >(malae),</hi> and lower jaw <hi rend="italic">(maxilla).</hi></p>
                <p>The chest, besides its distinction into right and left halves, anterior and
                    posterior surfaces, and upper and lower boundaries, may be distinguished into a
                    sternal region in the middle <hi rend="italic">(sternum),</hi> a mammary region
                    on each side, an axillary region, a costal region, a hypochondriac region, a
                    scapular region, and a vertebral region.</p>
                <p>The abdomen may be distinguished into regions in the following manner. The
                    triangular space between the false ribs and navel, commonly named the pit of the
                    stomach, is the epigastric region <hi rend="italic">(scrobiculus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cordis, epigastrium).</hi> Below this, in the centre, is the
                    umbilical <hi rend="italic">(umbilicus),</hi> with the iliac region or flanks
                    <hi rend="italic">(ilia)</hi> on each side, and the hypogastric <hi
                    rend="italic">(hypogastrium)</hi> below. Behind, on each side of the vertebral
                    column, are the loins <hi rend="italic">(lumbi).</hi></p>
                <p>Next to the abdomen is the pelvis, the posterior lateral parts of which are the
                    buttocks <hi rend="italic">(nates),</hi> the anterior the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pubes,</hi> and the inferior the hips or ischiatic regions <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ischia),</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">perinaeum</hi> in the middle between
                    them.</p>
                <p>In each pectoral extremity are recognised the following divisions; the shoulder
                    <hi rend="italic">(humerus),</hi> the armpit <hi rend="italic">(axilla),</hi>
                    the arm <hi rend="italic">(brachium),</hi> the elbow <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cubitus),</hi> the fore-arm <hi rend="italic">(antebrachium),</hi> the wrist
                    <hi rend="italic">(carpus),</hi> and the hand <hi rend="italic">(manus).</hi>
                    The latter is subdivided into the fore-wrist <hi rend="italic"
                    >(metacarpus),</hi> the fingers <hi rend="italic">(digiti),</hi> the palm <hi
                    rend="italic">(vola),</hi> and the back-hand <hi rend="italic"
                    >(thenar).</hi></p>
                <p>Each abdominal extremity presents the following separate regions; the haunch <hi
                    rend="italic">(coxa),</hi> the thigh <hi rend="italic">(femur),</hi> the knee
                    <hi rend="italic">(genu),</hi> the ham <hi rend="italic">(poples),</hi> the leg
                    <hi rend="italic">(tibia),</hi> of which there is the muscular part or calf <hi
                    rend="italic">(sura),</hi> the ankle external and internal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(malleolus</hi><hi rend="italic">externus et internus),</hi> the foot <hi
                    rend="italic">(pes),</hi> subdivided into the ankle-joint <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tarsus),</hi> the foot-joint <hi rend="italic">(metatarsus),</hi> the toes <hi
                    rend="italic">(digiti</hi><hi rend="italic">pedis),</hi> with dorsal or upper
                    surface, and palmar surface or sole <hi rend="italic">(solea).</hi></p>
                <p>These divisions, though not so numerous as they have been made by some, are
                    sufficiently so for the purpose of general anatomical description. Where more
                    minute distinction is requisite, it shall be introduced as we proceed.</p>
                <p>The stature of the body varies in the two sexes, in individuals, in families, in
                    tribes, and in nations. The Romans, when they first visited Gaul, remarked the
                    gigantic stature of the ancient inhabitants of that country compared with
                    themselves; and, generally speaking, the modern Italians, though by no means a
                    pure or unmixed breed from the ancient stock, are a diminutive race. The
                    Germans, and most of the English and Irish, are rather tall. The inhabitants of
                    Finland are distinguished for their great stature, amidst the dwarfish tribes by
                    which they are surrounded. In general, the Europeans are taller than the
                    Asiatics.</p>
                <p>The average height of the adult male varies from 5 feet 8 inches to 5 feet 10 or
                    11 inches, or even to 6 feet. The dimensions of different parts vary according
                    to those of the whole body; but the following measurements of a male of 5 feet 8
                    inches, and one of 5 feet 11 inches, may communicate some idea of the length of
                    different regions of the body.</p>

                <p>The average height of the female varies from 5 feet 3 inches to 5 feet 5 inches
                    and 5 feet 7 or 8 inches. A woman of 5 feet 10 inches is unusually tall. The
                    length of the different regions is proportionally less than in the male.</p>
                <p>The length of the body previous to adult age varies with the period of life. The
                    length of an embryo of three weeks, represented by Soemmering, is about ⅛ of an
                    inch; one of eight weeks is about 1 inch; and one at the end of the fifth month
                    is about 10 inches. According to Burns, however, the length of the foetus in the
                    fifth month does not exceed 6 or 7 inches; in the sixth it is about 8 or 9, in
                    the seventh about 12, and in the eighth about 15 inches. At the period of birth,
                    the average length, according to Roederer, is about 201/2 inches.</p>
                <p>The only part of the foetus of which it is important to determine the average
                    dimensions at the period of birth is the head. Its largest diameter, which is
                    that from the crown to the chin, is in general about 5 inches. The transverse
                    diameter between the parietal protuberances is at the same time about 3 inches.
                    Of 60 male and 60 female infants born at the full time, whose heads were
                    measured by Dr Clarke, the circumference passing through the occipital process
                    and the middle of the brow was at an average 13∙8 inches, while the arch from
                    ear to ear over the crown was 7∙32 inches. One measured 15 inches in
                    circumference, and one 8 <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript">
                    2</hi> inches from ear to car; but.</p>

                <p>none were under 12 inches in the one direction, or 6į inches in the other.</p>
                <p>It is well established that there is a difference in the average dimensions of
                    the male and female, even in the foetal state. Roederer found the mean length of
                    16 male children born at the full time to be 20Ļ§- inches, and of 8 females only
                    20 <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> ÷-; and of the 60 male and 60 female infants
                    measured by Dr Clarke, the average circumference was 14 inches in the former,
                    and only 13⅛ in the latter; and the parietal arch was 71- inches in the former,
                    and <hi rend="italic">7j-</hi> in the latter. Of 120 infants, in 6 only, which
                    were males, did the circumference of the head exceed 14⅛ inches.</p>
                <p>The weight of the adult male varies from 9 stone to 11 or 12. Ten stones, or 140
                    lbs., may be stated as the average. The female weighs about 8 stone, and rarely
                    more than 10. After the age of 35 or 40, when fat begins to be deposited, the
                    weight rises considerably; and the average weight at this age is from 13 to 14
                    stones. In some extraordinary examples of corpulence, combined with large
                    stature, the weight of the body amounts to 20 and 25 stones.</p>
                <p>The average weight of the foetus in the early months is uncertain. According to
                    Mr Burns, it weighs about 2 oz. in the 12th week; about 1 lb. in the 6th month;
                    and about 4 or 5 lbs. troy in the 8th month. At the period of birth the mean
                    weight is about 7 lbs. avoirdupois. Dr William Hunter states, that of .several
                    thousand new-born perfect infants weighed at the British Hospital in London by
                    Dr Macaulay, the smallest was about 4 lbs., the largest about 11 lbs. 2 <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">qz.,</hi> and the greater number varied from 5 to 8 lbs.
                    avoirdupois. He knew no instance of a newborn infant weighing 12 lbs. Of 60 male
                    and 60 female infants weighed by Clarke, the lightest was 4 lbs., the heaviest
                    10 lbs., and the average 7 lbs. 13 dr. avoirdupois. The average weight of 26
                    children at the natural period, weighed by Roederer, was about 6∣ lbs.; the
                    lightest about 5⅜ lbs., and the heaviest about 8 lbs.</p>
                <p>The difference between the weight of the male and female infant at birth is
                    estimated by Dr Clarke at about 9 oz. avoirdupois, which agrees with the results
                    obtained by Roe derer.</p>
                <p>In the case of <hi rend="italic">twins,</hi> the average weight of each twin is
                    in general less than that of children born at single births; but the combined
                    weight of both is greater. Dr Clarke found the average weight of 12 twins to be
                    11 lbs. avoirdupois each pair; the heaviest being 13 lbs., and the lightest 8ļ
                    lbs. Mr Burns, however, states that he has known instances in which each twin
                    was rather above than below the usual weight of a single-birth child.</p>
                <p>Special Anatomy has been divided, according to the classes of textures of which
                    the human body is composed, into different parts, with appropriate
                    denominations. Thus the anatomy of the bones has been named <hi rend="italic"
                    >osteology, osteography,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">skeletology</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> while that of the soft parts in general has been
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">sarcology.</hi> Where more minuteness is
                    attempted, the anatomy of the soft parts has been still further subdivided into
                    that of the ligaments, <hi rend="italic">syndesmology</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> the muscles, <hi rend="italic">myology</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the

                    the membranes, <hi rend="italic">hyrnenology</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the

                    rend="italic">splanchnology.</hi></p>
                <p>Though these are convenient terms to designate the several divisions of Special
                    Anatomy, they afford little assistance in the general arrangement of the
                    subject. It is justly observed by Bichat, that this arrangement, if such it can
                    be named, is objectionable, by separating different organs which ought to be
                    united. It is indeed remarkable only for connecting organs by arbitrary, and
                    often unnatural principles; and though it may answer in a subordinate manner, it
                    is unfit to furnish the principles of a general and natural mode of
                    arrangement.</p>
                <p>The most eligible method is that which arranges the organs according to their
                    physiological purposes,—a method adopted by Haller and Soemmering, but which
                    required the hand of Bichat to give it its full and perfect developement, and
                    which has since been adopted from this author by Cloquet.</p>
                <p>According to this method, the organs of the human body may be arranged in three
                    great classes: <hi rend="italic">first,</hi> those pertaining to the animal
                    functions, or which establish the connection between the individual and the
                    objects of the external world—the organs of <hi rend="italic">relation</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> those pertaining to the
                    organic functions, or which tend to the continuance of the individual—the organs
                    of <hi rend="italic">nutrition;</hi> and, <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> the
                    organs relating to the continuance of the species—the organs of <hi
                    rend="italic">reproduction.</hi> The first class contains the organs of
                    locomotion, speech, and sensation; the second those of digestion, circulation
                    and absorption, respiration, and secretion; and to the third are referred the
                    organs of generation.</p>
                <p>This method may not be altogether free from objections; several of which are
                    anticipated by Bichat. It is sufficient, however, to observe that it is less
                    objectionable than any other; and one of its advantages is, that it furnishes a
                    clearer and more precise idea of the connection of the different classes of
                    organs of the animal body than any other yet proposed.</p>
                <p>This method of arrangement may be conveniently exhibited in the following

                <p>PART I.</p>
                <p>ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF THE ANIMAL, VOLUNTARY, OR RELATIVE FUNCTIONS.</p>
                <p>The organs belonging to the functions of animal life are those of locomotion,
                    sensation, voice, and innervation. These organs are distinguished by two general
                    characters, symmetry of form and harmony of action. By the first is meant that
                    each organ possesses similar parts on each side of the mesial plane. By the
                    second is meant that the action of that part which is on the right side of the
                    mesial plane corresponds with that on the left.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I. THE ORGANS OF LOCOMOTION.</p>
                <p>The organs of locomotion maybe arranged in two orders, active and passive. The
                    first are the agents of motion, or the organic substances which produce motion:
                    the second are the bodies moved, or the instruments of motion. The muscles,
                    strictly speaking, are the former, though to these are added certain appendages.
                    The bones and their appendages constitute the second.</p>
                <p>With the latter order of parts it is usual to begin the business of special
                    anatomy, for obvious reasons. The bones are at once the most durable and regular
                    in shape of all the organic solids; and as an intimate relation subsists between
                    their mechanical figure and the soft parts connected with them, the knowledge of
                    the former constitutes the best introduction to that of the latter species of
                    organs.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. OSTEOLOGY, SKELETOLOGY.</p>
                <p>The assemblage of bones composing the human body constitutes the skeleton, which,
                    like the body, is divided into head, trunk, and extremities. The length of the
                    skeleton is about an inch less than that of the body; that is, the skeleton of
                    an individual 5 feet 8 inches in height is about 5 feet 7 inches long, and of
                    one 6 feet, about 5 feet 11 inches long. The weight of the skeleton varies at
                    different periods of life. That of a middle-sized adult ranges between 160 and
                    200 ounces. A male skeleton, measuring 5 feet 6 inches long, I found to weigh
                    168 ounces, or 101 lbs., avoirdupois.</p>
                <p>The number of separate pieces amounts to 254, of which 56 belong to the trunk, 60
                    to the head, 72 to the pectoral extremities, and 66 to the pelvic. Of these
                    several parts, the trunk is the most important, because, Isŕ, it is developed
                    before the head or extremities; and, <hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> because if we
                    look to its place in the animal kingdom generally, it is the most essential and

                    according to which the osseous pieces composing the head are constructed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Trunk.</hi></p>
                <p>The trunk of the skeleton consists of three parts, the spine or vertebral column,
                    the chest or thorax, and the pelvis.</p>
                <p>§. 1. <hi rend="italic">The Spinal or Vertebral Column. (Spina Dorsi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">Vertebrae.)</hi></p>
                <p>Tlιe vertebral column, situate in the posterior part of the trunk, the length of
                    which it determines, unites the head to the pelvis, supports the former, and is
                    supported by the latter. When completely developed, it consists of 29, and
                    rarely of 30 pieces, named <hi rend="italic">vertebrae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(spondyli,</hi><hi rend="italic">βπονόυλοι),</hi> from the circumstance that
                    each admits of a slight*degree of rotatory motion. Twenty-four of these bones,
                    which are in the healthy adult separate, are denominated true vertebrae <hi
                    rend="italic">(vertebrae veree).</hi> The 25th, named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacrum,</hi> though in adult life forming a single bone, consists in early life
                    of four separate pieces, which become consolidated, and are therefore named
                    false <hi rend="italic">vertebrae, (vertebrae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spuriae).</hi> The four last constitute what is named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coccyx.</hi> The column thus formed, though straight at birth, assumes
                    afterwards several curvatures in the antero-posterior direction, giving it the
                    aspect of the Italian <hi rend="italic">f.</hi> It may be divided into four
                    regions, the cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and sacral. In the first it is almost
                    straight, but begins to bend backward in the second, so as to form a
                    considerable curvature with the convex surface posteriorly. A little below the
                    middle of the dorsal portion it bends forward, and continues to do so to the
                    lower part of the lumbar region, where it once more bends backward, and forms
                    the sacrum into a concave hollow. At the lower end of the sacrum it again
                    inclines forward, and the coccyx is in general considerably incurvated
                    anteriorly. (Plate XXVI. fig. 1.)</p>
                <p>Besides the antero-posterior curvatures, there is in general a lateral one near
                    the lower part of the dorsal region, on the left side, to which its concavity is
                    directed. This has been observed by anatomists, from Cheselden, who first
                    represented it, to Soemmering, Bichat, and Meckel.</p>
                <p>In length the vertebral column does not vary much; and differences in stature
                    depend more on the dimensions of the members than of it. In thickness it
                    augments progressively from the cervical to the sacral portions, after which it
                    once more tapers to a point. It may be compared to two cones united by their
                    base, the superior of which is truncated.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae, true and false, possess certain common characters. Of these the
                    most general is the annular shape, or a ring of bone, the opening of which, in
                    continuity with those of the whole column, constitutes a longitudinal
                    cylindrical cavity for lodging the spinal chord and its envelopes. It is
                    therefore denominated the hole of the spinal marrow <hi rend="italic"
                    >(foramen</hi><hi rend="italic">medullae</hi><hi rend="italic">spinalis,</hi>
                    Soem.), or simply the vertebral hole (Bichat). Anterior to this is a mass of
                    bone, generally the largest of the vertebra, and therefore named its body <hi
                    rend="italic">(corpus vertebrae).</hi> The anterior surface is flat, sometimes
                    slightly convex; the posterior is always concave; the upper and lower surfaces
                    are slightly concave, and correspond with the intervertebral
                    fibro-cartilages.</p>
                <p>Behind the hole the vertebra is moulded into an arch or annular segment, the
                    outer surface of which forms seven processes. The first at the back of the
                    vertebra on the median line is the <hi rend="italic">spinous process,</hi> which
                    may be said to be formed by the union of the spinal plates in the middle. On
                    each sidesare two, which, from their situation with respect to the column, are
                    named <hi rend="italic">transverse</hi> processes. Other four, two on the upper
                    and two on the lower surface of each vertebra, near the base of each transverse
                    process, are named <hi rend="italic">oblique,</hi> from their direction, and <hi
                    rend="italic">articular (processus</hi><hi rend="italic">articulares),</hi>
                    because the inferior ones of the superior vertebra are articulated with the
                    superior ones of the lower vertebra. These processes are easily distinguished by
                    being covered with cartilage and synovial membrane. They constitute true
                    capsular joints.</p>
                <p>Each vertebra presents four notches or depressions, two at the upper and two at
                    the lower surface, between the body and the oblique processes. Each of these,
                    with corresponding notches on the vertebra above and below, forms a hole <hi
                    rend="italic">(foramen</hi><hi rend="italic">conjunctionis,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vcl</hi><hi rend="italic">intervertebrale),</hi> for the exit of
                    the spinal nerves and the entrance of blood-vessels.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039689?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9689-0760"/>
                <p>All the vertebrae, excepting the <hi rend="italic">atlas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">vertebra</hi><hi rend="italic">dentata,</hi> are united in the
                    same manner, and at the same points. The bodies are united by the intervertebral
                    fibro-cartilages, which consist of white concentric annular layers of fibrous
                    matter, placed in juxtaposition, and containing internally semifluid jelly. In
                    adults this substance becomes firm and consolidated; but in the young subject it
                    is so soft and compressible, that young persons are found to be one or two
                    inches taller in the morning, or after they have been some time in the recumbent
                    position, than in the evening, or after the spinal column has sustained for some
                    hours the weight of the person. In advanced life these fibro-cartilages become
                    still more solid and shrivelled; and in some instances they are converted into
                    bone, so as to unite two or more vertebrae in a single mass. This change is one
                    reason of the greater stiffness and incurvation of the spine in the old and
                    decrepid, than in those in early life.</p>
                <p>Besides the connection by the intervertebral cartilages, the vertebrae are united
                    at their articular processes by means of capsular ligaments, so as to allow
                    slight flexion and extension on each other; and at the basis of the spinous
                    processes, by means of short, firm, and inelastic yellow chords <hi
                    rend="italic">(ligamenta flava),</hi> named yellow ligaments. These, with a
                    thick fibrous fascia extending along the anterior surface of the bodies <hi
                    rend="italic">(ligamentum anterius,</hi><hi rend="italic">fascia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">longitudinalis</hi><hi rend="italic">anterior),</hi> a similar
                    fibrous fascia behind, lining the vertebral canal, a ligament connecting
                    mutually the apices of the spinous processes, and the incumbent muscles, retain
                    the vertebrae firmly in their places, and prevent them from being dislodged,
                    unless by a force adequate to break the bones and rend the ligaments.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae vary in structure. The bodies consist chiefly of loose cancellated
                    tissue, without solid bone. The spinal rings and the processes are much more
                    firm and dense.</p>
                <p>In the foetus and infant each vertebra consists of three portions, a thick, loose
                    mass, corresponding to the body, and two lateral arches corresponding to the
                    spinal rings, without spinous process, and scarcely meeting. In the foetus,
                    indeed, the posterior wall of the vertebral canal may be said to be incomplete.
                    Soon after birth, however, the spinal plates enlarging, mutually coalesce on the
                    median line; and from this point of union, by successive accretion, the spinous
                    processes arc gradually formed. These facts may serve in some degree to explain
                    the facility with which tumblers and rope-dancers may be habituated in infancy
                    to the most extraordinary inflexions of the trunk.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae, agreeing in the characters now enumerated, differ from each other
                    according to the regions which they occupy, and the parts with which they are
                    connected. On this principle the twenty-four true vertebrae are arranged in
                    three classes; the cervical <hi rend="italic">(v.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cervicis),</hi> the dorsal <hi rend="italic">(v.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >dorsi),</hi> and the lumbar <hi rend="italic">(v.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lumborum).</hi></p>
                <p>The cervical vertebrae are in number generally seven, rarely six or eight; the
                    dorsal are twelve; and the lumbar are five. (Plate XXIV. and XXV. fig. 1.)</p>
                <p>The cervical vertebrae arc distinguished by their bodies being small, with flat
                    anterior surfaces; by the articular processes being short and flat, as well as
                    less oblique than those of the others; by their transverse processes being
                    short, of a triangular shape, hollowed above, and perforated at the base by a
                    hole for the transit of the vertebral artery; by the spinous processes being
                    short, nearly horizontal, and generally bifid; and by the vertebral hole being
                    large and of an oval shape.</p>
                <p>The first and second of these vertebrae are still further distinguished by
                    peculiarities of configuration. The first, which is named <hi rend="italic"
                    >atlas,</hi> consists of a large bony ring, inclosing an irregular hole,
                    approaching to the shape of the ancient lyre. Instead of the body, which is
                    wanting, is a mere arch of dense bone, with an obtuse tubercle before for the
                    <hi rend="italic">longus</hi><hi rend="italic">colli</hi> muscle, and behind an
                    articular facette which applies to a corresponding one of the tooth-like process
                    of the second vertebra. From the extremities of this arch the vertebral hoop
                    acquires considerable thickness, for the formation of the oblique and transverse
                    processes. The superior oblique process is seen above on each side in the form
                    of an elliptical cartilaginous surface, slightly concave, consisting of two
                    parts, the anterior large, the posterior small, and terminating in a point which
                    overhangs the sinuosity of the vertebral artery. The cavity of this superior
                    oblique process receives the condyloid process of the occipital bone, with which
                    it is connected by a capsular ligament, lined by synovial membrane. Below is
                    seen the articular facette of the inferior oblique process, rounder, shorter,
                    less concave, but covered also by cartilage and synovial membrane, and
                    articulated with the superior processes of the second vertebra. Between these
                    two, on the lateral regions of the vertebral ring, is the transverse process, in
                    the shape of a triangle, the base of which is formed by the bone of the oblique
                    processes, and the sides by the production of the anterior and posterior arch.
                    The latter, being the segment of a smaller circle, is more distinctly circular
                    than the former, and may be described as a strong, dense, semiannular piece of
                    bone, with a tubercle on its posterior margin at the median line, to which the
                    <hi rend="italic">rectus</hi><hi rend="italic">capitis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >posticus minor</hi> is attached. On the inside of the atlas, at the lower
                    margin of the superior oblique process, is a rough surface with a depressed
                    cavity, which marks the insertion of the transverse ligament. The space anterior
                    to this is occupied by the tooth-like process of the second vertebra; that pos«
                    terior to it, which is the proper vertebral hole, by the beginning of the spinal
                    chord.</p>
                <p>The atlas is connected above to the occipital bone hy the capsular ligament,
                    which surrounds the margins of the superior oblique processes; below, to the <hi
                    rend="italic">vertebra dentatα</hi> in the same manner; and behind its anterior
                    arch to the tooth-like process. To its anterior tubercle are attached the <hi

                    >rectus capitis</hi><hi rend="italic">internus</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">rectus posticus</hi> is attached.</p>
                <p>By the condyloid processes of the occipital bone moving on the superior oblique
                    processes, the head is bent and extended, or moved backwards and forwards on the
                    atlas.</p>
                <p>The atlas ossifies by two points.</p>
                <p>The second vertebra, named <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >epistropheus,</hi> from its motions, is distinguished by a large prominent body
                    like a tooth <hi rend="italic">(processus odontoides)</hi> issuing vertically
                    from its body, a circumstance from which it is also named <hi rend="italic"
                    >vertebra</hi><hi rend="italic">dentata.</hi> This process, which is a
                    four-sided prism, with the top obliquely acuminated,' presents on its anterior
                    surface an articular facette, corresponding to that of the atlas. The posterior
                    surface is rough, and corresponds to the transverse ligament. From the odontoid
                    process the body descends somewhat below the level of the vertebral hoop, and
                    presents at its lower margin, on the median line, a tubercle, with excavations
                    on each side. Above, on each side of the odontoid process, are the superior
                    oblique processes, in the shape of oval facettes, covered by cartilage and
                    synovial membrane, and articulated with the inferior oblique processes of the
                    atlas. Below, and a little behind, is the inferior articular process, more
                    oblique in direction, and articulating with that of the third vertebra. Between
                    the two is the transverse pro <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039702?mode=fullsize"

                    from the same point the spinal plates converge backwards so as to form the
                    spinous process, which is distinct and bifid in this vertebra. Between the
                    superior oblique process is the upper notch, which is rather a rounding of the
                    spinal plates thana distinct depression; and between the inferior oblique
                    process and the transverse process is the lower notch, which, with the upper one
                    of the third vertebra, forms a complete hole for the exit of the fifth pair of
                    spinal nerves.</p>
                <p>The vertebral hole in this vertebra is heart-shaped, the basis before and the
                    apex behind.</p>
                <p>By the odontoid process it is articulated with the occipital bone and the atlas;
                    by the upper oblique process with the atlas; and by the lower oblique process
                    with the third cervical vertebra.</p>

                <p>The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth cervical vertebrae are very similar. The

                    largest. The articular processes are also more oblique in the lower ones than in
                    those above. The spinous processes also increase in size in the lower cervical
                    vertebrae, and in the sixth and seventh are particularly large and prominent;
                    and in the last are not bifid, but merely tubercular. The vertebral holes in the
                    second and third are heart-shaped, and the lower ones triangular, with the apex
                    towards the spinous processes. The body of the seventh also presents at its
                    lower margin a depression, which, with a corresponding one in the first dorsal,
                    receives the head of the first rib. The seventh, in short, may be regarded as
                    indicating the transition from the cervical to the dorsal vertebrae.</p>
                <p>Besides the muscles already mentioned as attached to the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The dorsal or thoracic vertebrae (v. <hi rend="italic">dorsi vel</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">thoracis),</hi> which are twelve in number, are distinguished by
                    articular notches on their superior and inferior margins, which, with die
                    intervertebral cartilage and the contiguous vertebrae, form depressions for
                    lodging the heads of the ribs, and cartilaginous facettes on their transverse
                    processes for articulating with similar facettes on the tubercles of the ribs.
                    Tlιe tenth dorsal vertebra has often only one facette above, and the eleventh
                    and twelfth have only a single facette for each of the two last ribs.</p>
                <p>The bodies of the dorsal vertebrae are more convex and somewhat rounder before
                    than those of the cervical and lumbar. The hole, which is smaller, is also
                    rounder, approaching to the oval shape.</p>
                <p>The spinal plates are broad and strong, and meet behind in long prismatic spinous
                    processes, which are directed obliquely downwards, so that they are imbricated
                    over each other, especially in the middle of the back. The three last are less
                    pblique. The oblique direction and imbricated arrangement of the spinous
                    processes are connected with the peculiar flexuous bend which the column
                    undergoes from the lower part of the cervical to the upper end of the lumbar
                    region.</p>
                <p>The twelfth dorsal vertebra approaches the first lumbar in the large size of its
                    body, in the shortness of its transverse processes, in the straight direction
                    and smaller extent of the spinous process, and in the articular processes
                    becoming almost vertical.</p>

                <p>The five lumbar vertebrae are distinguished by the size of their bodies and their
                    processes, and by the direction of the spinous and articular processes. Each
                    body is both broader and thicker, but less convex, than those of the dorsal
                    vertebrae. The vertebral hole also is larger, and it resumes the triangular
                    shape as in the neck. The transverse processes are broad, flat, and large,
                    without articular facette like the dorsal, or arterial hole like the cervical,
                    and are rough by the attachment of the <hi rend="italic">sacro-lumbalis.</hi> Of
                    the articular processes, which are large and have a vertical direction, the
                    upper is concave, oval, and turned towards the median plane; the lower is
                    convex, oval, and directed towards the lateral regions. The spinous processes
                    are large, flattened, almost square, with thick obtuse margins, and directed
                    straight backwards. The vertebral notches are large, and form holes much larger
                    than at any other part of the spine.</p>

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sacrum,</hi> composed in early life of five pieces, which
                    are afterwards consolidated into one, may be regarded as a series of imperfect
                    vertebrae conjoined into a single mass. It is a symmetrical bone, of a
                    triangular shape, with the base attached to the last lumbar vertebra, the apex,
                    which is obtuse, adhering to the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >coccygis,</hi> and the sides wedged between the bones of the pelvis.</p>
                <p>The anterior or pelvic surface is concave, with the base, sometimes named
                    theyww«o«ton/, prominent andoverhang-ing, the apex and the lateral margins
                    incurvated forwards, and corresponds to the rectum. It presents in general four,
                    sometimes five pairs of oval holes, which communicate with the spinal cavity,
                    and between each of which may be seen a transverse ridge marking the lines of
                    junction of the several bones; and in some instances the inner is so imperfect
                    that a deep line is left. These holes, therefore, through which the nerves pass
                    from the spinal chord, are quite analogous to those formed by the union of the
                    vertebral notches. The posterior surface of the sacrum is much more irregular.
                    At the top are two articular processes, concave and cartilaginous, for receiving
                    the convex surface of the inferior articular processes of the last lumbar
                    vertebra. Outside of these is a deep notch, which, with that of the same
                    vertebra, forms the posterior vertebral hole; and outside of this is a tubercle,
                    which corresponds to the transverse processes of the true vertebrae. Below the
                    notch on each side is a series of four holes, which, like those of the anterior
                    surface, communicate with the cavity of the bone, and allow the posterior nerves
                    to issue from the chord. On the median line, between, there is an irregular bony
                    ridge, or rather a series of three spinous processes, short, obtuse, and
                    separated, by shallow depressions. The third of these diminishes gradually in
                    the longitudinal direction till it is entirely lost <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039715?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9715-0762"/> opposite the
                    fourth pair of sacral holes, leaving between two ridges a triangular opening,
                    which often communicates with the interior of the spinal cavity, and, when it
                    does not, marks the lotver termination of that cavity. In the former case it is
                    closed by the posterior sacro-coccygeal ligament.</p>
                <p>The sides of the sacrum, which are rough, and of an irregular cuneiform shape,
                    present two surfaces,—one anterior, something cartilaginous, for articulating
                    with the ilia'c bones,—the other posterior, marked by two deep sinuosities, in
                    which are lodged the sacro-iliac ligaments. The inferior termination of the
                    sides tapers towards the apex or coccygeal end. The surface is rough for the
                    insertion of the sacro-ischiadic ligament, and it is terminated by a notch for
                    the exit of the fifth pair of posterior sacral nerves.</p>
                <p>The structure of the sacrum, like that of the vertebrae, is cancellated, and most
                    loose in the site of the spinal plates and processes. Its mode of ossification
                    is analogous to that of the vertebrae generally. On the middle plane appear five
                    points, which correspond to the bodies of the false vertebrae, or the individual
                    bodies of the sacrum; and on each side of these are formed two others, which
                    become eventually the ridges of bone between the anterior and posterior sacral
                    holes and the spinal plates. As these enlarge, they coalesce; and consolidating,
                    leave only on the pelvic and dorsal surfaces the rows of holes through which
                    issue the sacral nerves. It hence results that the sacrum is ossified from
                    fifteen separate portions of bone.</p>
                <p>Besides the muscles connected with the lumbar vertebra?, the sacrum gives
                    attachment to part of the <hi rend="italic">glutaeus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >maximus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">pyriforrnis.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> is attached above to the last lumbar vertebra
                    by the intervertebral fibro-cartilage, the capsule of the two articular
                    processes, and the yellow ligament of the spinous processes; to the iliac bones
                    by the sacroiliac <hi rend="italic">synchondrosis,</hi> and to the coccyx by a
                    similar fibro-cartilage. (Plate XXIV. fig. 1, S.)</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">coccyx</hi> is a symmetrical bone, triangular, occupying
                    the posterior and inferior parts of the pelvis, attached by its base to the
                    sacrum, and with the apex free and slightly incurvated forwards, so as to
                    terminate in a hooked point, which has been supposed to resemble the bill of the
                    cuckoo, (κoκκuξ, <hi rend="italic">cuculus.)</hi></p>
                <p>The anterior or pelvic surface is concave, marked with transverse grooves covered
                    by periosteum, and supporting the lower extremity of the rectum. The posterior
                    or outer surface is convex, gibbous, and unequal, for the insertion of the
                    sacro-coccygeal ligament and some fibres of the large <hi rend="italic"
                    >glutaeus,</hi> and, like the anterior, is also marked by transverse
                    grooves.</p>
                <p>The base or upper end of the coccyx is concave before for articulation with the
                    sacrum, and presents behind two tubercles continuous with those of the spinal
                    region, and on the sides two notches, which, with those of the sacrum, form
                    holes for the fifth pair of sacral nerves. The margins of the bone are rough,
                    for the attachment of the small sciatic ligament, and meet below at an angle,
                    which is sometimes bifid, sometimes obtuse, and to which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator am</hi> is attached.</p>
                <p>The coccyx is generally cellular, with little density. The transverse grooves by
                    which it is marked indicate its original separation into five portions, two of
                    which becoming united, leave four and occasionally three portions, an upper, a
                    middle, and a lower. These portions, indeed, are so long in consolidating, that
                    they are often separate in the adult. The first is the largest, and resembles a
                    diminutive vertebra without hole, and with truncated or undeveloped processes. A
                    lateral portion on each side projects like a wing, the rudiments of the
                    transverse processes; and the two tubercles above noticed, rising like horns,
                    are imperfect articular processes, meeting those of the <hi rend="italic">os
                    sacrum.</hi> The bony ridge which descends from these are imperfect spinal
                    plates; and as these do not meet, they leave between them a groove corresponding
                    to the anterior half of the vertebral hole; and the spinous processes are
                    wanting. In the second coccygeal bone, which is rounder than the first, the
                    aliform portions corresponding to the transverse processes are also smaller than
                    in the first; and in the third and fourth they are diminished so much that they
                    are scarcely cognizable.</p>
                <p>The series of bones now described form by their union what is called the
                    backbone, chine, spine <hi rend="italic">(spina dοrsi),</hi> or vertebral
                    column. Viewed in connection, it may be distinguished into an anterior and a
                    posterior region, two lateral surfaces, a base, and an apex.</p>
                <p>The anterior region is large in the neck, narrow in the back, and broad in the
                    loins and pelvis. A series of transverse grooves of variable depth marks the
                    bodies of the vertebrae; and a series of transverse elevated ridges
                    distinguishes in like manner their upper and lower margins. These grooves, which
                    in the cervical vertebrae are confined to the front, extend in the dorsal and
                    lumbar to the sides. This anterior region is covered by the anterior vertebral
                    ligament. On the sides it answers in the neck to the anterior or great <hi
                    rend="italic">recti,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">longi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >colli</hi> muscles; in the chest to the latter, to the <hi rend="italic">vena
                    azygos</hi> on the right, and the thoracic aorta on the left; in the abdomen to
                    the abdominal aorta and the inferior cava; and in the pelvis to the rectum.</p>
                <p>In the posterior region are seen, on the mesial plane, the row of spinous
                    processes, horizontal above and below, and imbricated in the middle. The
                    intervals, which are considerable in the neck and loins, are much contracted in
                    the back, in which extension brings the processes in contact. The apices of all
                    are in general in the same straight line; but this may be disturbed, either from
                    the wrong direction of a process, or an unnatural position of a vertebra.</p>
                <p>On each side are seen the intervertebral grooves <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fissura</hi><hi rend="italic">interspinales),</hi> which commence at the
                    occipital bone, and are continued with those of the sacrum. Broad and horizontal
                    above, smaller and more oblique in the middle, very narrow below, these grooves
                    are formed by the series of spinal plates, between which are left spaces varying
                    in size according to the obliquity of the plates. These spaces are occupied
                    within by the yellow ligaments, which being inserted at their inner surface, are
                    something broader than the spaces, and without by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >transversus</hi><hi rend="italic">spinoe</hi> muscle.</p>
                <p>On each side also is recognised a longitudinal hollow, extending from the atlas
                    to the lower end of the sacrum. This hollow, which is formed by the spinous
                    processes and the transverse processes with the spinal plates below, is
                    superficial at the neck, narrow and deep in the back, and narrow and superficial
                    at the loins and sacrum. In this longitudinal groove is lodged the muscle named
                    <hi rend="italic">multifidus</hi><hi rend="italic">spinae.</hi> (Plate XXV. fig.
                    1.)</p>
                <p>The lateral regions present first the row of transverse processes, which vary in
                    direction in different regions, chiefly in consequence of the spinal curvatures.
                    Thus, if a vertical plane pass down along the sides of the column, the
                    transverse processes of the neck and loins will be anterior to it, while those
                    of the back will be behind it. In the first region these processes are
                    distinguished for forming, by the series of holes in the base of each, a bony
                    canal traversed by the vertebral artery, and which is com <pb break="no"

                    To these transverse processes numerous muscles are attached. Between them in the
                    neck, and anterior to them in the back and loins, is a series of holes formed by
                    the union of the vertebral notches. Through these, which arc the intervertebral

                    and which increase in size from the neck to the loins, where they are
                    considerable, the anterior branches of the spinal nerves pass. Their shape is
                    elliptical and thcir transit short. Anterior to these processes in the dorsal
                    vertebrae are the depressed facettes, in which, with those of the
                    fibro-cartilages, the heads of the ribs are lodged.</p>
                <p>The base of this column, which is supposed to be the last lumbar vertebra, is
                    articulated with the sacrum in such a manner as to form an anterior convexity
                    and a cavity behind. The base, however, may with greater justice be placed in
                    the upper half of the sacrum, which, being firmly wedged between the thick
                    posterior margins of the iliac boncs, transmits to them, and thereby to the
                    bones of the pelvic extremities, the weight of the trunk. The mechanism of this
                    is similar to that of the keystone of an arch, which the sacrum truly
                    represents. The perpendicular pressure on this bone is counteracted and balanced
                    by the lateral pressure of the iliac bones; and this lateral pressure is
                    sustained, partly by their mutual pressure on each other before at the pubis,
                    but chiefly by the oblique pressure of the ncck of the thigh-bone, and the
                    perpendicular pressure of the cylinder of the latter and those of the
                    leg-bones.</p>
                <p>The upper extremity of the column, which is formed by flic atlas and axis,
                    receives the weight of the scull and its contents, which are exactly balanced on
                    the articular cavities of the former bone. On this also the head is bent or
                    extended by its proper muscles. Rotation is performed by the motion of the atlas
                    with the head on the articular cavities of the second vertebra, and round its
                    odontoid process.</p>
                <p>The holes of each vertebra form, by union, the vertebral canal, in which are
                    lodged the spinal chord, the origins of its nerves, and its membranous
                    coverings. This canal, which is continuous with the cavity of the scull by means
                    of the occipital hole above, and is completed by the sacral canal below, is not
                    in the centre of the spine, nor is everywhere of the same dimensions. Situate
                    behind the vertebral bodies, and before the spinal plates, it is nearer the
                    posterior than the anterior region of the column. Large at the neck and upper
                    part of the back, it diminishes below, and again enlarges in the loins. Its area
                    is triangular in the cervical region, oval in the dorsal, and triangular again
                    in the lumbar and sacral regions. It follows the different curvatures of the
                    spinal column. In the rece⅜t state, it is formed not by the bones only, but
                    before by the intervertebral cartilages, and behind by the yellow ligaments and
                    the <hi rend="italic">interspinales</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >intertransver-sαles</hi> muscles. Lined by periosteum, by the posterior
                    vertebral ligament, and by a quantity of loose cellular tissue, it is further
                    covered by a cylindrical fibrous membrane, similar to the <hi rend="italic">dura
                    mater,</hi> the outer investment of the spinal chord; and within this are
                    contained the <hi rend="italic">ligamentum denticulatum,</hi> the spinal
                    arachnoid, and the spinal chord itself, with its anterior and posterior nervous
                    roots on each side, and its appropriate blood-vcssels. In early life the soft
                    parts predominate; and the canal and its component bones are then susceptible of
                    much freer and more extensive motion than afterwards, when ossification is
                    complete, and the fibro-cartilages acquire firmness.</p>
                <p>In the human subject it may be viewed as a firm but flexible bony cylinder, which
                    performs several functions at once. Resting on the sacrum, which is wedged
                    immovably between the iliac bones, it supports the trunk in the erect position,
                    and transfers to the sacrum, on which it rests, the weight of the head, the
                    chest, and great part of the abdomen. In the vertebrated animals in general it
                    incloses the spinal chord, one of the most essential and constant parts of the
                    nervous system. In the several regions it forms a sort of posterior protecting
                    wall to several important vital organs.- Thus, in the neck it forms a posterior
                    barrier to the oesophagus, the windpipe, and the great sympathetic. In the back
                    it constitutes the posterior wall of the chest; and in the loins and pelvis it
                    is the posterior wall of the abdominal viscera and the large vessels.</p>
                <p>In answering these ends, it is important to remark, that the firmness and
                    mechanical arrangement of the spinous processes are of essential service. Their
                    imbricated arrangement renders it impossible for any foreign body to enter the
                    vertebral cavity and injure the spinal chord, unless between the occipital bone
                    and atlas, or between the atlas and axis; and even at these points much
                    precision is requisite to enter the cavity. Between the axis and the third
                    vertebra it is more difficult, and below this next to impossible, without
                    breaking the spinous processes.</p>
                <p>With this character of security and support, the vertebral column unites a high
                    degree of flexibility. Though the degree of motion between each vertebra is
                    trifling, yet between several it is considerable, and between the whole
                    twenty-four it is multiplied to a great amount. The motions of which the
                    vertebral articulations admit are those of flexion and extension, rotation, and
                    lateral flexion. Of these, flexion is that which is most extensive; for in the
                    anterior direction there is less impediment to the motion of the vertebrae than
                    behind, where the spinous processes allow no great extent of motion, unless
                    where the habit has been acquired in early life, before ossification is
                    completed. The rotatory motion of one vertebra on another is small; but by
                    combining the motion of several or of the whole column, it becomes so extensive
                    that some individuals can turn the head and neck more than half round. That
                    these motions arc the passive result chiefly of the intervertebral cartilages
                    and the articulations of the oblique processes, may be inferred from the fact,
                    that when the former are ossified, or the latter ankylosed, the motions are much
                    impaired generally, and wholly destroyed in the vertebrae affected.</p>
                <p>The motions of the head on the atlas have been already shortly noticed. Those of
                    the atlas and occipital bone on the axis arc, though simple in effect, complex
                    in mechanism. The motion, indeed, is limited to that of rotation; but this
                    rotation is extensive. This is favoured by the horizontal position, and the
                    large extent of the inferior articular processes of the atlas, and the superior
                    ones of the axis, the looseness of the articular capsule, and the absence of
                    spinous process in the atlas. , The axis and its odontoid process becoming the
                    fixed point, the atlas, and with it the occipital bone and scull, turn on the
                    elliptical flat articular surfaces, and on the odontoid process. On the first
                    they glide extensively, and in opposite directions, while the capsular ligaments
                    are stretched. On the odontoid process the motion is more limited, and from,
                    right to left, and conversely; and in the latter variety of motion, the arch of
                    the atlas before, and the transverse ligament behind, move on the anterior and
                    posterior facettes of the odontoid process.</p>
                <p>The anatomical construction of this articulation, however, which is so favourable
                    to extensive motion, is attended with the disadvantage of facilitating the
                    luxation of the atlas on the axis. Luxation, indeed, may be re-garđetl<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039741?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9741-0764"/> as
                    produced by too extensive motion of these bones, in which the articular
                    processes of the former vertebra abandon those of the latter, and instead of
                    resting on them, are placed on the same plane, while the spinous processes are
                    separated at least half an inch. It may be further observed, that the want of
                    fibro-cartilages between these bones before, and of yellow ligaments behind, is
                    favourable to displacement. The effect of this change of position on the spinal
                    chord is-obvious. While the one side of the atlas is thrust off the axis, the
                    other is forced so near its body and articular process, that it compresses the
                    spinal chord, and may occasion palsy or immediate death, by injuring the chord
                    above the origins of the phrenic and intercostal nerves. The vertebral arteries
                    at the same time undergo so much stretching, that the blood cannot move through
                    them with the natural facility.</p>
                <p>It is nevertheless probable that displacement rarely occurs without such injury
                    to the ligaments as to allow more extensive luxation than that now noticed. The
                    odontoid ligaments, or the transverse, may be ruptured; and in either case the
                    odontoid process is allowed to slip backwards, and plunges into the chord, and
                    destroys its texture almost instantly. These ligaments may be ruptured either
                    immediately by sudden violence, or in consequence of previous disease. In such
                    circumstances, the injury done to the spinal chord is followed by almost
                    immediate death, in consequence of the influence of the phrenic and intercostal
                    nerves being suddenly suspended. In the same manner, the insertion of a cutting

                <p>The chest may be defined as an osteo-cartilaginous inclosure, of an irregular
                    conoidal shape, flattened before, concave behind, and convex on the sides. Its
                    upper extremity is truncated. Its basis is irregularly oblique. It consists of
                    the <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi> before, the twelve dorsal <hi rend="italic"
                    >vertebra.</hi> behind, twelve ribs on each side, and twelve cartilages
                    connecting the ribs and sternum.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sternum (sternum, &lt;rrεgνον, os pectoris)</hi> is a
                    symmetrical, oblong, flattened bone, broad above, narrow in the middle, broad
                    below, and terminating in a point placed perpendicularly on the anterior of the
                    chest. It presents two surfaces, an anterior and posterior, two extremities, an
                    upper and lower, and two margins. (Plate XXIV. fig. 1.)</p>
                <p>The anterior or cutaneous surface, covered by skin, the aponeurosis of the
                    sterno-mastoid and large pectoral muscles, and periosteum, is marked by four
                    transverse ridges at intervals of an inch, indicating the lines at which the
                    separate portions of the bone were united. The posterior, internal, or
                    mediastinal surface, is a little concave, occasionally marked by a longitudinal
                    depression in its middle; also presents transverse lines, but rather indistinct;
                    is covered in the middle by the mediastinal cellular tissue, above by the
                    sterno-hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles, and on the sides by the <hi
                    rend="italic">triangulares</hi><hi rend="italic">sterni.</hi></p>
                <p>The superior or clavicular extremity of the sternum presents three crescentic
                    sinuosities; one on the middle, bounded on each side by an elevated peak,
                    hollowed before and behind, and one on each side, incrusted with cartilage and
                    synovial membrane. The first of these corresponds with the trachea on the
                    inside, and has the sterno-mastoid muscle inserted on each outside. With the two
                    lateral cartilaginous surfaces the sternal extremities of the clavicles are
                    articulated. Between the two is the inter clavicular ligament, and all round are
                    the ligamentous fibres of the sterno-clavicular articulation. This upper
                    extremity is about double the breadth of the bone at its middle. Below, the bone
                    becomes narrow, and below the fourth ridge it seldom exceeds half an inch in
                    breadth. Here it terminates in an appendage, which is generally named the
                    pointed or ensiform cartilage <hi rend="italic">(cartilago mucronata,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">c. ensιformis).</hi> The shape of this is by no means always the
                    same. In some subjects it is a flat, thin, and pointed process, not always very
                    firm, but more solid than cartilage; in others it is a flat thin bone,
                    terminating in two thin hooked, points. In some it is obtuse and perforated. In
                    some it is thrust forwards, in others it is bent inwards, or towards the one
                    side. * To this process the aponeuroses of the <hi rend="italic">recti
                    abdominis</hi> are attached.</p>
                <p>The margins of the sternum, which are generally about half an inch
                    thick,presentseven articular depressions crusted by cartilage. The first of
                    these, in which the sternal extremity of the first rib is lodged, is,
                    immediately below the clavicular depression, superficial and rounded. The
                    others, which are situate at the ends of the transverse ridges, and receive the
                    cartilages of the next six ribs, are deeper, angular, and surrounded by elevated
                    margins, to which, in the recent state, the circumference of a capsular ligament
                    is attached. In general, the seventh depression is formed partly on the sternum,
                    partly on the ensiform cartilage; and the intervals between the depressions are
                    smaller below than above.</p>
                <p>The sternum is chiefly cancellated, light, and loose, with little density, and a
                    thin crust of compact bone. In the foetus and infant it consists of eight or
                    nine square pieces, separated by transverse furrows, which, by the union of two,
                    are easily reduced to seven, and afterwards to five. By the further union of two
                    of these portions they are afterwards reduced to three; and in this state they
                    remain so long in some subjects that Soemmering describes the sternum not as one
                    bone, but as three. The first of these portions, which is uppermost, is
                    irregularly heart-shaped, or rather octagonal, with the tracheal depression and
                    the clavicular articulations above, the depression for the cartilage of the
                    first rib on the side, and half of that for the second at its lower margin,
                    where it unites with the second. The latteris merely the middle andlongest
                    portion of the bone, and is occasionally in three portions, separated at the
                    costal depressions. The third or lower portion is the ensiform cartilage, the
                    ossification of which renders the bone complete.</p>
                <p>The ribs may be defined to be long, flat, irregular bones, with an irregular
                    semicircular curvature, placed on each side of the chest, at intervals of an
                    inch or less, between the dorsal vertebrae and the sternum. In general their
                    number is twelve on each side, rarely eleven or thirteen. Of these, seven are
                    connected with the sternum before by individual cartilages, and five are
                    connected indirectly to the cartilage of the seventh, without attachment to the
                    sternum. The former are denominated true or sterno-vertebral ribs <hi
                    rend="italic">(costce verce)</hi>; the latter are styled false or vertebral <hi
                    rend="italic">(costae spurioe, vel nothoe).</hi></p>
                <p>Each rib varies in length, breadth, and the direction of its curvature. The upper
                    ribs are' the shortest, and most incurvated in proportion to their length. The
                    middle ribs, or the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh, are the longest, and form
                    curves of the largest circle. The false ribs, which diminish in length from the
                    eighth to the twelfth, are the least incurvated, or form curves of the largest
                    circle. It is chiefly from the middle set that the common characters of these
                    bones should be derived.</p>
                <p>Proceeding on this principle, we find that each rib may be defined as a broad,
                    flat, longitudinal bone, not only incurvated<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039754?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9754-0765"/>, but twisted
                    from the direction of its original curvature. Each rib has a vertebral
                    extremity, a cartilaginous extremity, and a body. The vertebral extremity
                    consists of a tuberculated angular head <hi rend="italic">(caput),</hi> with two
                    cartilaginous facettes united at an angular line for insertion in the
                    intervertebral depressions with which they are articulated. In the first and
                    twelfth, and sometimes in the eleventh, there is one facette only corresponding
                    to the single vertebra with which these bones are connected. Immediately before
                    the head the rib is contracted and rounded, so as to form a neck <hi
                    rend="italic">(collum),</hi> which varies from five to six or seven lines in
                    length; and before the neck is a tubercle or process <hi rend="italic"
                    >(tuberculum)</hi> divided into two portions, one internal, smooth,
                    cartilaginous, and uneven, articulated with the transverse processes of the
                    dorsal vertebrae; the other external, rough, giving attachment to the middle
                    costo-transverse ligament. Anterior to the tubercle the rib is straight for
                    about one inch, and rough by the insertion of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacrolumbalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">longissimus dorsi</hi> muscles. Beyond
                    this point, which is therefore named the angle <hi rend="italic">(angulus),</hi>
                    the rib begins to be incurvated circularly, and bent downwards, so that the
                    surfaces, which were external and internal, become obliquely superior and
                    inferior. To prevent confusion, however, they must still be .distinguished in
                    the same manner.</p>
                <p>The outer surface of the rib, therefore, is convex, and forms the outer bend of
                    the circle. Behind, it is covered by the <hi rend="italic">latissimus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dorsi</hi> muscle. The internal, which forms the inner bend of the
                    circle, is convex above, and forms a concave hollow below, bounded by two sharp
                    margins; one proceeding straight from the head forwards, till it is lost about
                    three inches from the cartilaginous extremity; the other, more acute, from the
                    tubercle, and following the curvature of the rib to about two inches from the
                    same point. In this groove are lodged the intercostal artery, vein, and nerve.
                    The internal intercostale are attached to the inner lip of the margin; the
                    external to the outer. The upper margin of the rib is obtuse behind, where the
                    external intercostals are inserted; but becomes acute and rough before, where
                    the internal intercostals are inserted. The anterior or sternal extremity of the
                    rib is broad and large, and terminates in an oval hollow, in which the cartilage
                    is inserted. In advanced life, when the union between the rib and cartilage is
                    intimate, this hollow becomes less distinct.</p>
                <p>Besides these common characters of the ribs, several present peculiarities
                    deserving notice.</p>
                <p>The first rib is short, almost semicircular, and its direction is such that its
                    broad surfaces are superior and inferior, not external and internal, as in the
                    others. The head of this rib possesses only one large articular facette,
                    corresponding with the first dorsal vertebra, sometimes one large one, and a
                    minute one corresponding with a small space of the last cervical vertebra. Its
                    neck is short and round, and its tubercle is identified with the angle which is
                    wanting. Tlιe superior surface of this rib is highly important. From the head
                    and tubercle extends a rough surface, in which are inserted part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">scalenus posticus,</hi> part of the <hi rend="italic">serratus
                    magnus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">scalenus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >medius.</hi> Next to this is a smooth, deep depression, over which the
                    subclavian artery passes; then is an eminence, to which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scalenus</hi><hi rend="italic">anticus</hi> is attached; afterwards a
                    superficial hollow, in which the subclavian vein is lodged; and, lastly, a rough
                    surface at the sternal or anterior end, for the subclavian muscle. The lower
                    surface of the first rib is uneven and slightly rough, but without groove at its
                    outer margin.</p>
                <p>The seeond rib resembles the first in direction, having rather an upper and
                    lower, than an external and internal surface. The head is angular and
                    acuminated, and the neck contracted; and the upper surface is rough by the <hi
                    rend="italic">serratus magnus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but the lower
                    surface, from the tubercle, begins to present an angle in the shape of an
                    oblique surface, bounded below by a rough ridge, within which is the groove for
                    the intercostal vessels and nerves. Anterior to this flat oblique surface the
                    rib is twisted, and undergoes a change in direction. In the third the angle is
                    not more distinct, and it is only in the fourth that this part is well marked.
                    This character continues to the eleventh, when it becomes indistinct, and in
                    which the tuberosity disappears, or at least is identified with the head, which
                    has only one facette. The groove also is so short as scarcely to be observed.
                    Lastly, the twelfth rib, which is often unconnected with the others by
                    cartilage, is without tuberosity, groove, or angle, and has, like the first,
                    only one facette at the head.</p>
                <p>The true ribs are connected to the sternum by means of broad rounded pieces of
                    cartilage, variable in length and direction in different ribs. That of the first
                    rib is very short, rather broad, and its direction, though oblique from above
                    downwards, is more horizontal than that of the inferior ones. The angle at which
                    it unites with the sternum is acute above, and obtuse below. It is often
                    ossified in the adult. The second is nearly horizontal, and follows the
                    direction of the rib to which it is attached. The next five are more oblique
                    from above downwards, as the lower end of the sternum inclines forwards, and the
                    corresponding ribs bulge towards the base of the chest.</p>
                <p>Each of these cartilages, invested by perichondrium, is attached by a rough
                    surface to the anterior end of the rib; while the other extremity, which is
                    rounded and covered by synovial membrane, is lodged in one of the articular
                    depressions of the lateral margin of the sternum, and secured in this situation
                    by a capsular ligament, strengthened by anterior and posterior fibrous
                    bands.</p>
                <p>The anterior or outer surface of the thoracic cartilages is slightly convex, the
                    internal or posterior surface flat, inclining to concave, lined by pleura and
                    covered by the <hi rend="italic">triangularis</hi><hi rend="italic">sterni</hi>
                    muscle. The upper margin is concave, the lower convex, giving attachment to the
                    internal intercostal muscles, which in this region fill the intercartilagi-ņous
                    spaces.</p>
                <p>The cartilages of the five false ribs differ from those of the true, in not being
                    articulated directly with the sternum. The cartilage of the eighth rib, after
                    bending forwards and upwards, is attached to the seventh by a tapering point
                    with a minute articular surface. The ninth cartilage is attached in a similar
                    manner to the eighth, the tenth to the ninth, the eleventh to the tenth, and the
                    twelfth is either attached in the same manner to the eleventh, or hangs free,
                    though attached to muscles connected with the others. Hence the twelfth, and not
                    unfrequently the eleventh, are denominated floating ribs. The whole of them are
                    mutually connected by ligamentous fibres inserted into their perichondrial
                    covering. The outer surface of these cartilages is covered by the <hi
                    rend="italic">recti</hi> and external oblique, the inner surface by the
                    diaphragm and <hi rend="italic">transversus.</hi></p>
                <p>Connected with the ribs in the same manner in which those of the true ribs are,
                    these cartilages differ, however, in taking a direction, first of descent, then
                    of ascent or of curvature. The spaces which they leave between them, instead of
                    being rhomboidal, as those of the true ribs, are irregularly triangular.</p>
                <p>In structure the costal cartilages belong to those of the cavities. Analogous to
                    those of the larynx, they are dense, firm, elastic, whitish substances, without
                    distinct traces of organization, and seem to consist chiefly of modified
                    gelatine, to which they are with difficulty reduced by <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039767?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9767-0766"/> long boiling.
                    Their tendency to ossification is considerable. In few persons above 45 or 50
                    are they quite free from bony points; and in many they are at this period
                    converted into firm bone. The cartilage of the first rib, especially, is often
                    firmly ossified before 35. When they undergo this change, certain points in
                    their substance are observed to assume an orange or tawny colour, and to exhibit
                    a porous arrangement, with great hardness, turning the edge of the knife.</p>
                <p>By long maceration the costal cartilages become soft and gelatinous, and are
                    finally resolved into oval patches, separated by circular or spiral lines, with
                    numerous perforations. It was perhaps on this account that Hérissant described
                    them as consisting of spiral fibres.</p>
                <p>The bones and cartilages now described, with the twelve dorsal vertebrae behind,
                    constitute the bony skeleton of the chest, bearing a remote resemblance to a
                    cone, with truncated apex and oblique base, or, more accurately, to the frustum
                    of a cone. To form a just idea of this assemblage of parts, it is necessary to
                    consider its surface external and internal, its circumference above and below,
                    its transverse diameter, and its longitudinal extent.</p>
                <p>The anterior region of the external surface, consisting of the sternum in the
                    middle, and the cartilages on each side, is flattened, contracted above, wider
                    and more prominent below. The intercostal spaces arc filled between the sternum
                    and the ribs by the internal intercostale, behind this by the external and
                    internal, and covered by the anterior part of the large pectoral muscle. Behind,
                    the chest presents the vertebrae with their processes, the transverse processes
                    articulated with the tubercles, the angles forming a line obliquely receding
                    from the spine, the transverse grooves, the longitudinal groove on each side
                    filled by the <hi rend="italic">multifidus</hi><hi rend="italic">spinoe,</hi>
                    and the space between the processes and the angles of the ribs occupied by the
                    <hi rend="italic">spinalis</hi><hi rend="italic">dorsi,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">longissimus dorsi,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacrolumbalis.</hi> The intercostal spaces, from the spine to the angles, are
                    filled by the external intercostals; and anterior to this are the two layers of
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>The lateral regions of the chest are convex, making a larger sweep below than
                    above. They present on each side eleven intercostal spaces, the superior of
                    which are shorter and broader than the inferior. These spaces, which follow the
                    curved direction of the ribs, cannot be accurately defined in shape. Between the
                    angles and the cartilages, where the curvature is greatest, they are occupied by
                    the double layer of the external and internal intercostal muscles, which, lying
                    inclined in opposite directions, mutually decussate in this tract. The lateral
                    region of the chest is covered above by the <hi rend="italic">serratus
                    magnus</hi> behind, and the two pectorals before; below by the external oblique
                    on the side, and the <hi rend="italic">recti</hi> before. The inferior lateral
                    region, which is formed by the cartilages of the ribs, is therefore named the
                    hypochondres <hi rend="italic">(hypochondria).</hi></p>
                <p>The inner surface of the chest is, before, correspondent to the outer surface,
                    unless below, where the anterior inclination of the sternum makes the
                    antero-posterior diameter greater. The posterior region is marked by the row of
                    vertebral bodies, the prominence of which forms an imperfect partition, which
                    separates the right and left halves of the thorax; and which, notwithstanding
                    the posterior bend which the spine undergoes between the second and eighth
                    vertebrae, diminishes the antero-posterior diameter of the chest. On each side
                    is a large concave hollow, narrow above, wide below, and swelling most
                    capaciously in the middle, the walls of which, formed by the ribs and
                    intercostal muscles, are lined by the pleura, and the cavity of which contains
                    the lungs.</p>
                <p>The upper circumference of the chest, or its apex, is small, oval, transversely
                    oblique from above downwards, and from behind forwards. Bounded before by the
                    sternum, behind by the first dorsal vertebra, and on the side by the first rib,
                    it is diminished by the clavicles; and while its antero-posterior diameter is
                    occupied by the windpipe, oesophagus, and the large vessels connected with the
                    heart, its lateral portions are so much contracted, that each thoracic half <hi
                    rend="italic">(demithorax)</hi> has here almost a conical termination. Its
                    dimensions in the male skeleton of average size are about 16 inches. As the
                    first rib has little or no motion, the upper circumference remains
                    unchanged.</p>
                <p>The lower circumference of the chest, which is much more extensive, is said to be
                    nearly four times larger than the upper. This, However, is exaggerated; and I
                    find its greatest dimensions in the male to be 32 inches, exactly double the
                    small circumference. It is susceptible of enlargement from the revolving motion
                    of the ribs. The first rib remains fixed, while the lower ones are capable of
                    being rolled outwards on their heads, tubercles and cartilages, so that the
                    transverse diameter of the chest is enlarged. The lower circumference of the
                    chest presents anteriorly a large triangular notch <hi rend="italic">(incisura
                    trigona),</hi> with the apex at the ensiform cartilage, the sides at the margins
                    of the cartilage, and the base represented by a transverse line uniting the tips
                    of the twelfth rib on each side. This notch, which, in the recent state, is
                    occupied by the heads of the <hi rend="italic">recti</hi> muscles, with their
                    fasciae in the middle, and the anterior margins of the external oblique at the
                    sides, constitutes what is called the pit of the stomach <hi rend="italic"
                    >(scrobiculus</hi><hi rend="italic">cordis),</hi> or the epigastric region <hi
                    rend="italic">(epigastrium).</hi></p>
                <p>The transverse diameter of the chest is small above, but gradually enlarges to
                    the ninth or tenth rib. The average diameter measured between the inner margins
                    of the first ribs on each side in the male skeleton is four and a half inches;
                    the average diameter measured between the tips of the eleventh rib on each side
                    is nine inches, which is also nearly the diameter between the inner margins of
                    the fifth ribs; and the average diameter measured across the upper margin of the
                    niňth rib, which is about the widest part, amounts to eleven inches. These
                    diameters, it has been already said, are susceptible of slight enlargement, by
                    reason of the lateral revolution of the ribs; and this motion is most extensive
                    between the sixth and tenth ribs. Above the sixth and below the tenth it is
                    trifling.</p>
                <p>The longitudinal extent or altitude of the chest varies; but in the same male
                    skeleton it amounts to twelve inches measured between the lower margin of the
                    first rib and the upper margin of the eleventh, which may be regarded as the
                    inferior limit of the osseous part of the chest. From the top of the sternum to
                    the plane of the ensiform cartilage the distance is five inches and a half. If
                    from the lower margin of a mesial plane representing the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mediastinum,</hi> another plane be drawn on each side to the margins of the
                    false ribs, the space inclosed on each side above this oblique plane will give
                    some idea of the capacity of the thoracic cavities.</p>
                <p>The dimensions above stated apply chiefly to the adult male, from about thirty to
                    thirty-five years, and of average size. In the female the chest is generally
                    smaller in every direction, rounder, and more taper towards its inferior region.
                    Above, as far as to the fourth rib, it is said to be larger and more uneven
                    before, so that it has less of the conoidal shape than the male chest. <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> It is also shorter.</p>
                <p>The pectoral cavity is in general symmetrical, that is, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039780?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9780-0767"/> of similar
                    shape and dimensions on each side of the mesial plane. Sometimes, however,
                    without the interven- ' tion of disease, the greater convexity of two or three
                    ribs on one side gives it a more ample appearance than on the other.</p>
                <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">The Pelvis.</hi></p>
                <p>This is the name given to the irregular-shaped bony cincture which terminates the

                    the mesial plane, the <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >os</hi><hi rend="italic">coccygis.</hi> The latter two have been already
                    described. The lateral and anterior divisions now come under examination.</p>
                <p>These consist of two bones, <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> bne on each side,
                    united with each other before by means of fibro-cartilage, and receiving between
                    them behind, the sacrum, to which they are in like manner united by
                    fibro-cartilagc. These bones, which are denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >ossa</hi><hi rend="italic">innominata,</hi> coxal or haunch-bones <hi
                    rend="italic">(ossa coxarum),</hi> are of a very irregular shape, and may be
                    divided into three regions, the superior or iliac, the anterior or_pubal, and
                    the inferior or ischial. These regions it is not easy to define accurately; but
                    they will appear in the course of description, and they correspond to the
                    original divisions of the bone in the foetal state.</p>
                <p>The coxal bone presents two surfaces, an external or femoral, and an internal or
                    pelvic; and a circumference, divided into superior margin, anterior margin,
                    inferior margin, and posterior margin.</p>
                <p>The external or femoral surface <hi rend="italic">(dorsum),</hi> which is
                    alternately concave and convex, presents behind a rough surface, to which the
                    <hi rend="italic">glutceus</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus</hi> is attached;
                    between this and a semicircular rough linea lunated hollow, in which the origin
                    of the <hi rend="italic">glutceus</hi><hi rend="italic">medius</hi> is lodged;
                    and between the upper semicircular line and the lower a convex and concave area,
                    for the attachment of the <hi rend="italic">ghttoeus minimus,</hi> and one or
                    two inequalities, to which one of the tendons of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >reetusfemoris</hi> is attached. About an inch below is a large hemi-spherical
                    cavity, with elevated circular margins, interrupted at the anterior and inferior
                    comer, named the <hi rend="italic">acetabulum,</hi> or cotyloid cavity,
                    forreceiving theheadof the thighbone. Its inner surface is covered by cartilage,
                    unless at the centre, where is a depression for the attachment of the triangular
                    ligament of the thigh-bone. The lower part of the margin is marked by a deep
                    notch, over which, in the recent state, is stretched a ligament, thus forming a
                    hole for the transit of the vessels and nerves of the articular cavity. The
                    surface behind the acetabulum is slightly convex, indicating its union with the
                    upper edge of apart of the coxal bone, distinguished by the name of hipbone <hi
                    rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic">ischii),</hi> and may be denominated the
                    <hi rend="italic">post-acetabular</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ilio-ischial
                    eminence</hi>; below, it is concave and sinuous, for the tendon of the <hi

                    rend="italic">(spina</hi><hi rend="italic">ischii),</hi> to which the small
                    sacro-sciatic ligamentis attached. Anterior to the acetabulum is a large
                    opening, named the <hi rend="italic">thyroid</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >obturator</hi> hole, oval in the male, and triangular in the female, closed by
                    a ligament attached to its circumference, unless at the upper part, where there
                    is an obliquegroove for the <hi rend="italic">obturator</hi> vessels and nerve.
                    The outer surface of the thyroid ligament supports the o∕√⅛ <hi

                    a convex ridge of bone, which is named the pubal or the horizontal branch of the

                    its inner or mesial margin in a spine or tubercle, to which the outer portion of
                    the tendon of the external oblique muscle is attached. The inner or anterior
                    margin of the thyroid hole is bounded by a broad flat bone, irregularly rough on
                    the surface, broad above, where it is connected with the <hi rend="italic">os

                <p>The inner or pelvic surface <hi rend="italic">(venter)</hi> of the coxal bone may
                    be divided into three parts. The first is posterior, rough, and irregular, for
                    articulation by fibro-cartilage with the lateral margin of the sacrum. The
                    second, which is abdominal, concave, and is named the iliac pit <hi
                    rend="italic">(fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">iliaca),</hi> contains the belly of
                    the <hi rend="italic">iliacus internus,</hi> bounded above by the circumference
                    or crest of the bone; behind by a rough line which separates it from the sacral

                    the pubal bone; and below by a sharp line <hi rend="italic">(linea
                    iliopectinea),</hi> which is insensibly lost on the spine of the pubis, and to
                    the inner end of which is attached a reflected portion of Poupart’s ligament,
                    named the <hi rend="italic">ligament of Gim-bernαt.</hi> The third or pelvic
                    surface, which is below, presents behind a flat, irregular-shaped, concave
                    space, occupied by the <hi rend="italic">levator ani</hi> and part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">obturator iηtemus,</hi> the inner opening of the thyroid hole, the

                    with inequalities for the origin of the <hi rend="italic">obturator</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">internus,</hi> and a sinuosity below the ischial spine for the
                    motion of its tendon.</p>
                <p>The circumference of the coxal bone is very irregular. The upper or iliac
                    portion, which is semicircular, and is named the erest <hi rend="italic">(crista

                    attachments, varying in breadth from half an inch to a whole one, and is
                    distinguished into an external aŋd internal lip, and an intermediate space. To
                    the former are attached the external oblique, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >latissimus</hi><hi rend="italic">dorsi,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">tensor

                    the two is the internal oblique. The posterior end of the crest terminates in

                    >glutceus</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus</hi> and the ilio-lumbar ligament are
                    attached, and below the posterior inferior spinous process forming the upper
                    extremity of the ischiatic notch. The crest terminates before in the anterior
                    superior spinous process, to which are attached the <hi rend="italic">fascia
                    lata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">sartorius,</hi> and the upper end of the tendon
                    of the external oblique, or ligament of Poupart, or what is named the crural
                    arch. The anterior portion presents, first a small sinuosity, which separates
                    the superior from the inferior spinous process, to which is attached the upper
                    tendon of the <hi rend="italic">rectus cruris.</hi> Between this and an eminence
                    in the upper or horizontal portion of the <hi rend="italic">os pubis,</hi>
                    marking its junction with the iliac bone, and which may be denominated the <hi

                    terminated by the spine of the pubal bone, to which the first insertion of
                    Poupart’s ligament, or the outer pillar of the inguinal ring, is fixed, On the
                    mesial side of this is a rough tubercular surface, which by means of
                    fibro*cartilage is united with a similar surface on the opposite side. To this,
                    which is named the <hi rend="italic">symphysis pubis,</hi> the second insertion
                    of the ligament of Poupart, the <hi rend="italic">pyramidales</hi> and the <hi

                <p>The posterior-inferior margin is most irregular. Commencing with the posterior
                    spinous processes, which are parted by a small notch, the margin is, immediately
                    anterior to the lower process, formed into a large hollow, named the ischiadic
                    notch <hi rend="italic">(incisura ischii),</hi> bounded before by the spine of
                    the ischium, to which is attached the anterior sacro-ischiadic ligament, with

                <p>The iliac or coxal bones consist of cancellated matter, covered by a thin layer
                    of compact bòne. In early life, and in delicate subjects, this cellular matter
                    is loose, abundant, and rather thick. At a more advanced period, when
                    ossification is completed, and in strong muscular subjects, the proportion of
                    this cancellated matter diminishes and sometimes disappears, so that the bone
                    consists of two layers of dense, compact bone; and in some, even this, in the
                    iliac fossa, is destroyed entirely, so that the bone appears perforated.</p>
                <p>The coxal bone is formed originally of three pieces, one for the large upper
                    portion <hi rend="italic">(os ilium),</hi> a second for the anterior or pubal
                    <hi rend="italic">(os pubis),</hi> and a third for the inferior or ischial <hi
                    rend="italic">(os ischium).</hi> In the foetus, infant, and young subject, these
                    three bones are seen quite distinctly separate, but adhering, by means of
                    fibrous or fibro-cartilaginous tissue, along a line drawn by the ilio-pubal
                    eminence through the acetabulum, and over its posterior convexity into the
                    ischial notch. At the same time the crest and margins of the ilium are covered
                    by a cartilaginous epi- <hi rend="italic">physis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    the pubal bones are mutually attached by the same substance; the branches <hi
                    rend="italic">(rami)</hi> of the pubal and ischial bones are soft and
                    membranous; the thyroid hole is merely a ligamentous notch; and the acetabulum
                    is a broad, irregular, superficial depression, with fibro-cartilaginous margin.
                    The connections of these three bones continue soft and cartilaginous for several
                    years after birth, generally to the tenth, twelfth, or fourteenth, sometimes
                    later; and this is the reason why the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >innominatum</hi> has been described as consisting of three bones, the <hi
                    rend="italic">os ilium, os pubis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ischium.</hi> After
                    the last-mentioned period, however, these bones are firmly consolidated into one
                    piece, in which, nevertheless, the original marks of separation may be
                    recognised in the ilio-pubal and post-acetabular eminences above, and the
                    meeting of the pubal and ischial <hi rend="italic">rami</hi> below. The coxal
                    bone, therefore, which thus becomes a single solid piece in the adult, ought tc
                    be always described as such; and the distinction into three component parts,
                    which is confined to the foetal and early period of life, belongs to the history
                    of its ossification.</p>
                <p>The coxal bone is united to its fellow of the opposite side by the <hi
                    rend="italic">symphysis pubis,</hi> and behind to the sacrum by the sacro-iliac
                    fibro-cartilage <hi rend="italic">(synchondrosis).</hi> Both of these junctions
                    are occasionally ossified in advanced life. By the cotyloid cavity it is
                    articulated with the head of the thigh-bone.</p>
                <p>The coxal bones on each side, with the sacrum wedged between them behind, and the
                    os coccygis attached to its extremity, constitute an irregular-shaped osseous
                    cincture, something conical, with the base above, and the truncated apex below.
                    This shape, with the manner in which it supports the abdominal viscera and
                    several of the urinary and genital organs, has given it the name of basin <hi
                    rend="italic">(le bassin,</hi><hi rend="italic">das bcckeη, pelvis)</hi> or
                    pelvis. In this it is requisite to consider the external and internal surface,
                    the upper and lower circumference, the transverse diameters, the direction, the
                    outlets and their dimensions.</p>
                <p>The external surface comprehends four regions, the anterior or pubal, the
                    posterior or sacral, and two lateral.</p>
                <p>The anterior region presents the pubal articulation <hi rend="italic"
                    >(symphysis)</hi> on the median line, and on each side the pubo-ischial <hi
                    rend="italic">rami,</hi> the thyroid hole and its margins, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">acetabulum</hi> or articular cavity. The posterior region presents
                    on the median line the sacral spinous processes or spinous ridge, the triangular

                    the coccyx and the posterior convex surface of the latter; and on each side are
                    the sacral grooves and posterior holes; the processes by which they are bounded
                    without; a deep depression corresponding to the sacro-iliac <hi rend="italic"
                    >synchondrosis,</hi> and which is filled by a thick bundle of ligamentous
                    fibres; and lastly, the posterior tuberosity of the ilium, which projects much
                    behind. The lateral regions are formed by the <hi rend="italic">dorsa</hi> or
                    external <hi rend="italic">fossoe</hi> of the iliac bones, bounded below by the
                    ischiadic notches.</p>
                <p>The internal surface of the pelvis consists of two portions,—the one above, wide,
                    capacious, and tapering downwards, forming the large pelvis; the other narrower,
                    with walls nearly cylindrical, and forming a canal named the small pelvis.</p>
                <p>The large pelvis presents, behind, the sacro-vertebral articulation and the
                    sacral promontory, and on the sides the internal iliac <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae.</hi> Before, where osseous parietes are wanting, the space is occupied
                    by the abdominal muscles. This constitutes the abdominal division of the pelvis,
                    and supports in the erect position part of the ileum and colon. Its transverse
                    diameter, measured between the crests of each iliac bone, amounts to nine inches
                    in the male, and eleven in the female.</p>
                <p>The large or abdominal division of the pelvis is bounded below by the ilio-pubal
                    line on the sides and front, and behind by a line drawn between the posterior
                    extremities of each side, but following the surface of the sacrum. The outline
                    of this, which is elliptical, with the transverse diameter longest, and its
                    plane inclined obliquely forwards, is named the superior outlet or aperture <hi
                    rend="italic">(ambitus superior)</hi> of the pelvis, and it constitutes at once
                    the lower termination of the great and the upper boundary of the small pelvis.
                    Its importance in the practice of midwifery renders it necessary to distinguish
                    its calibre, which is larger in the female than in the male, into four
                    diameters. The first, antero-posterior, from the pubal symphysis to the sacral
                    promontory, is from four to five inches in the male, and four inches nine lines
                    in the female. The second, transverse, measured between the iliac bones, is four
                    inches six lines, sometimes five inches, in the male, and five inches six lines
                    in the female. Two others, drawn obliquely from the sacro-iliac synchondrosis to
                    the ileo-pubal eminence, are about four and a half inches in the male, and five
                    inches in the female.</p>
                <p>The small or proper pelvis, which is below this aperture, forms a sort of
                    cylindrical osseous canal, more capacious, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039806?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9806-0769"/> however, at
                    its middle than at the extremities, the lower outlet of which is diminished by
                    the anterior incurvation of the sacrum and coccyx, while the sides are bounded
                    by ’ the ischio-pubal branches. Before are the inner surfaces of the pubal
                    symphysis and branches, corresponding to the urinary bladder; behind, the pelvic
                    surface of the sacrum, corresponding to the rectum; laterally, the thyroid
                    holes, the inner surface of the ischial-bone and ilio-ischial junction, and the
                    isehiatic notch, completed by the anterior and posterior sacro-isehiatic
                    ligaments.</p>
                <p>The upper circumference is very irregular, with its plane slightly inclined
                    forwards; larger in the female than in the male. It presents, behind, the
                    sacro-vertebral articulation, bounded by a depression indicating the upper edge
                    of the sacro-iliac synchondrosis; laterally, the two iliac crests terminating
                    before in the anterior superior spinous processes; before, the hollow of the <hi
                    rend="italic">iliacus internus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">psoas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">magnus,</hi> the ilio-pubal eminence, the horizontal branch of the
                    pubal bone, its spine, and lastly its symphysis.</p>
                <p>The lower eĩrcumferenee, which corresponds with the inferior aperture or
                    ano-perineal outlet of the pelvis <hi rend="italic">(ambitus inferior),</hi> is
                    directed downwards and backwards. Bounded behind by the coccygeal bone, and on
                    the sides by the ischial tuberosities, this outlet is thus distinguished for
                    three eminences, separated by an equal number of notches. The situation of these
                    eminences indicates the limits of the lower pelvic aperture. The size and
                    disposition of the notches is inversely to that of the eminences; and their
                    arrangement is such that an eminence is opposite to a notch, and conversely.
                    Thus the anterior notch, which is formed by the pubal arch, is opposite to the
                    sacro-eoceygeal eminence behind; and though the ischial tuberosities appear
                    opposite to each other in one sense, strictly speaking their plane is each
                    accurately opposed to the opposite sacro-ischial notch. The anterior notch is
                    terminated above by an aeute angle in the male, in consequence of the proximity
                    of the pubo-ischial branches which form its sides, but by a rounded arch in the
                    female, by reason of the separation of these branches on each side. In this
                    notch are situate the generative organs of both sexes. The lateral notches,
                    which are bounded behind by the sacrum and coccyx, before by the spine and
                    tuberosity of the ischium, arc irregular in shape, and are each subdivided into
                    three portions by the sacro-sciatic ligaments, which secure the articulation of
                    the sacrum and eoxal bones. The first of these ligaments, the posterior or
                    external, arising from the posterior extremity of the iliae crest, from the
                    sides and transverse processes of the sacrum and coccyx by a broad, firm web of
                    fibres, becoming small and thick at the middle, again expands, and is inserted
                    into the ischial tuberosity. This ligament corresponds behind to the <hi
                    rend="italic">glutceus</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> whieh is partly
                    attached to it, before and mesially to the small or anterior ligament to which
                    it is united. The small or anterior sacro-sciatic ligament rises, in eommon with
                    the large one, from the transverse processes of the sacrum and coccyx, and
                    adhering to it for half an inch, passes more horizontally outwards to the
                    isehial spine, in which it is implanted by a broad, thiek, fibrous web. Behind,
                    it corresponds at its sacral end, and for an inch from this to the posterior
                    ligament, and laterally to the pudic vessels and nerve; before, it serves with
                    the posterior to complete the lower circumference of the pelvis.</p>
                <p>By these two ligaments the ischiadic notch is in this manner converted into two
                    apertures and a notch. The first of these is superior, and is bounded above by
                    the ilio-ĩschial areh, and below by the small ligament and part of the posterior
                    or large ligament. Through this hole pass the <hi rend="italic">pyriformis,</hi>
                    the sciatie nerve and artery, the gluteal artery, and the internal pudic artery.
                    The second is an irregular triangular hole, smaller than the upper one, bounded
                    above by the anterior ligament, below by the posterior one, and laterally by the
                    sinuous hollow between the ischial spine and tuberosity. Through this aperture
                    the tendon of the <hi rend="italic">obturator internus</hi> passes out of the
                    pelvis; and the external pudic artery and nerve, after bending round the upper
                    ligament, re-enter the pelvis. The third spaee is a superficial notch, bounded
                    on the outer or lateral side by the posterior ligament, and on the mesial side
                    by the sacro-coecygeal bone. It is chiefly occupied by cellular tissue.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of this inferior aperture are nearly the following. The
                    antero-posterior diameter, from the coc-eygeal apex to the lower margin of the
                    pubal symphysis, is 3 inches in the male, and 4 inches 6 lines in the female.
                    The transverse diameter between the ischial tuberosities of each side is 3
                    inches 2 lines in the male, and 4 inches in the female. The oblique diameter,
                    measured from the middle of one of the great sacro-sciatic ligaments to the
                    opposite ischial tuberosity, is about 4 inches in the male, and from 4⅜ to 5 in
                    the female. Of these diameters the antero-posterior is most liable to vary, by
                    reason of the mobility of the os coccygis; but independent of this, it is always
                    larger in the female than in the male, in consequence of the sacrum being less
                    incurvated, and descending more in a straight line. It further appears, that in
                    females who have born children the incurvation of the sacrum is much less than
                    in those who have not.</p>
                <p>The direction of the pelvis is not horizontal, nor does it correspond with that
                    of the trunk. Articulated behind with the lumbar portion of the spinal column,
                    the axis of which is inclined considerably forward from the vertical plane, the
                    pelvis partakes of the same inclination. A horizontal line drawn from the pubis
                    towards the sacrum passes in general an inch below the tip of the coccyx; and
                    with this a line drawn from the pelvis to the upper margin of the sacrum,
                    representing the plane of the pelvis, makes an angle of between 80° and 85°. The
                    sacrum inclines from the vertical plane about 35°; but the inclination of the
                    superior and inferior pelvic apertures varies. An imaginary line drawn from the
                    tip of the coccyx to the centre of the small pelvis, to represent the axis, cuts
                    the line of inclination at an angle of 75°. The most accurate axis of the pelvis
                    is a line drawn at right angles to the plane of the pelvis as above found.</p>
                <p>The dimensions given above are sufficient to show that the female pelvis is much
                    more capacious and ample laterally than the male. In the female, indeed, it is
                    important to remark that the upper region of the coxal bones is more prominent
                    laterally, and hence renders the haunches prominent and rounded, and the outline
                    of the abdominal aperture more extensive; the sacro-vertebral angle is less
                    prominent, and the sacrum is broader and less incurvated; the arch of the pubis
                    is wider and less angular; the ischial tuberosities are more apart, and the
                    cotyloid cavities even are at more distance from each other,—a circumstance
                    which determines the peculiar gaţt of the female. The male pelvis, on the
                    contrary, is deeper than the female.</p>
                <p>In the infant the pelvis is small compared with the size of other bones, and of
                    the parts which it is to contain. The dimensions of this part, in early life,
                    are indeed so limited, that not even the urinary bladder can be said to be
                    contained within it. As puberty approaches, the distinctive characters of the
                    male and female pelvis begin to appear. While in both sexes the bones become
                    larger and the eavity more eapaeious, in the female the additional<pb break="no"

                    appears in the width of the haunches, and their remarkable projection beyond the
                    flanks.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Head.</hi></p>
                <p>The upper or atlantal extremity of the vertebral column supports the head, a
                    complicated assemblage of bones, the general shape of which is spheroidal above
                    and behind, and irregularly cubical before and below. It is naturally divided
                    into two parts, which are distinguished by their mechanism, their use, and the
                    mode of their developement. The first of these, the scull or cranium (κgαwov,
                    <hi rend="italic">calvaria),</hi> forms a spheroidal bony case, occupying the
                    superior and posterior region chiefly of the head. The second, which is the
                    face, is formed above by an irregular pile of bones, articulated immovably to
                    the anterior inferior part of the scull, and below by a single symmetrical bone,
                    articulated movably to the middle of the lower part of the scull.</p>
                <p>§ 4. <hi rend="italic">The Scull. ( Cranium, Calvaria.)</hi></p>
                <p>The scull consists of eight bones, four of which are symmetrical and arranged on
                    the mesial plane, and four arranged in pairs on each side. The four symmetrical
                    bones are the frontal, the ethmoid, the sphenoid, and the occipital; the four

                    part of the face distinguished as the brow <hi rend="italic">(frons).</hi> It
                    may be divided into three surfaces, the external or frontal, the inferior or
                    orbito-ethmoidal, and the internal or the cerebral, and a circumference. The
                    external surface is frontal and temporal.</p>
                <p>The frontal surface, which is convex and regularly arched, presents on the median
                    line a ridge, indicating the original separation of the bone in two halves, the
                    nasal protuberance, more convex in age than in youth, and corresponding to the
                    smooth interval between the eyebrows <hi rend="italic">(glabella),</hi> a
                    serrated margin articulated in the middle with the nasal bones, on the sides

                    nasal spine, which supports the nasal bones. (Plate XXV. fig. 2. n.)</p>
                <p>On each side of the median line are the large smooth surface of the upper part of
                    the frontal bone, the frontal protuberances <hi rend="italic">(tubera

                    arch, large and prominent at its temporal angle, smaller and more rounded at its
                    nasal, and presenting cither a hole, or a notch covered by a ligament (c. c.),
                    and through which pass the frontal artery and nerve. The nasal end of the
                    orbitar arch, sometimes named the <hi rend="italic">internal angular
                    process,</hi> is insensibly lost in the serrated surface, where it joins the
                    superior maxillary bone. The temporal process, which is prominent, terminates in
                    a serrated surface, which is articulated with the malar bone. Exterior to the
                    frontal protuberance is a curvilinear ridge (d.), which gives attachment to the
                    fascia of the temporal muscle, denotes the anterior boundary of the space in
                    which that muscle is lodged, and separates the proper frontal from the temporal
                    surface of the frontal bone. This ridge, descending in a circular direction,
                    terminates in the temporal process at the opposite side to that of the orbital
                    arch (a. á.) The triangular segment cut off by it is convex above and concave
                    below.</p>
                <p>The orbito-ethmoid surface is irregular. It presents first on the median line a
                    quadrilateral notch with serrated margins, in which the ethmoid bone is
                    articulated. These margins consist in adult subjects of two plates, between
                    which are seen segments of the frontal and ethmoidal sinuses. In the outer of
                    these tables are generally one or two holes, or notches, which, with the ethmoid

                    bones. (Plate XXV. fig. 3. c.)</p>
                <p>On each side the frontal bone presents the large cavities, in which are contained
                    the anterior extremities of the hemispheres of the brain; and above these the
                    bones rise in the manner of a vaulted arch. The whole inner surface is moulded
                    into alternate pits and eminences, called <hi rend="italic">digital</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">mammillary</hi> respectively, and which correspond to the
                    eminences and depressions of the cerebral convolutions. These are most
                    conspicuous at the lower part, where the surface is traversed by minute vascular
                    grooves.</p>
                <p>The circumference of the bone is serrated all round, for articulation with the
                    contiguous bones. The posterior margin is nearly of an elliptical outline,
                    straight, and interrupted below by the quadrilateral notch. Above, where the
                    frontal is articulated with the parietal bones, the serrated processes
                    proceeding from the outer table are largest and longest. Below, where the
                    frontal is articulated with the lower angle of the parietal and wing of the
                    sphenoid bone, the internal table is most prominent, so that the spheno-parietal
                    suture is imbricated. Between the temporal and orbitar fossae this separation of
                    the tables forms a triangular rough surface, which is articulated with a similar
                    one, the triarcual surface of the sphenoid bone; and between this and the
                    quadrilateral notch the margin is articulated in the same manner with the
                    anterior margin of the sphenoid bone. Lastly, the serrated and cellular margins
                    of the quadrilateral notch are connected with the ethmoid bone.</p>
                <p>Besides these cranial bones, the frontal is articulated with the following bones
                    of the face,—the nasal bones by the middle of the nasal suture, the superior
                    maxillary bones by its sides, the lacrymal bones by the anterior end of the
                    ethmoidal groove, and with the malar bones by the external angular
                    processes.</p>
                <p>The frontal bonë, which is thick at the nasal protuberance and the external
                    processes, and thin at the orbitar regions, is ossified by two points, which,
                    appearing at the frontal protuberances, proceed by radiation as from a centre
                    towards the circumference of the bone. In the foetus and early infancy the bone
                    thus consists of two lateral portions placed between the pericranium and <hi

                    e transverse one on the site of the coronal suture, and a triangular chasm at
                    the angle between the two. This chasm, with a similar one between the frontal
                    bones, forms a quadrilateral lozenge-shaped space, at which the motion of the
                    brain is distinctly felt both at birth and for months after, and which is
                    therefore named the <hi rend="italic">fontanelle,</hi> or the anterior <hi
                    rend="italic">fontanelle (fans pulsatilis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">bregma),</hi> or the open of the head. As the ossifie process
                    advances, the lateral margins of the bone extend, and the mesial margins
                    extending mutually, at length coalesce, first at the nasal protuberance and
                    along the forehead, afterwards above, until the fontanelle is progressively
                    diminished and at length obliterated. This junction is effected by the formation
                    of serrated processes, which are mutually dove-tailed into each other; and for
                    some years after birth the frontal bone consists of two similar halves
                    articulated by a middle suture. In some few instances, especially in the female,
                    this continues for many years; and the individual is found after death to have
                    the frontal bone in two halves, with a middle suture. More frequently, however,
                    the suture is obliterated by the consolidation of its serrated margins, and the
                    frontal bone consists of one piece. The points of ossification remain long
                    distinct in the form of the frontal protuberances. But eventually, from the
                    uniform elevation of the margins of the bone, they become less conspicuous; and
                    in old age they disappear more or less completely, leaving a surface uniformly
                    uneven.</p>
                <p>The ethmoid or sieve-like bone <hi rend="italic">(os cribriform^),</hi> which is
                    symmetrical, and occupies the quadrilateral notch of the frontal bone, consists
                    of several bony plates arranged at right angles, and parallel with each other,
                    so as to give the whole a cubical shape. It consists of four parts, a horizontal
                    plate, occupying both sides of the mesial plane; a vertical plate at right
                    angles to it, and corresponding with the mesial plane; and a lateral plate on
                    each side, also vertical and parallel to the middle plate. In the bone thus
                    formed the following circumstances deserve attention. (Fig. 5.)</p>
                <p>The superior surface, cerebral, covered by <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> is
                    formed by the horizontal plate, perforated by numerous holes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(lamina</hi><hi rend="italic">cribrosa),</hi> through which pass the fibrils of
                    the olfacient or first pair of nerves depressed longitudinally on each side, but
                    surmounted in the middle towards its anterior half by a strong process of a
                    triangular shape, named the cock’s comb <hi rend="italic">(crista</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">galli),</hi> and to which is attached the anterior inferior
                    extremity of the falx, or dichotomous membrane. The anterior margin of this
                    process is generally marked by a groove which, with that of the frontal bone,
                    forms a passage for the nasal vein into the longitudinal sinus. The posterior
                    margin of the perforated plate is marked by an angular notch between two horns,
                    for articulation with a salient angle of the sphenoid bone. The <hi
                    rend="italic">crista</hi><hi rend="italic">galli</hi> may be regarded as the
                    upper division of the vertical plate, which occupies the mesial plane, and which
                    is thick and sometimes bifid before, but thin and rough behind, where it acts as
                    a partition to the lateral halves of the ethmoidal cavities. The sides of this
                    middle vertical plate are furrowed by minute canals <hi rend="italic"
                    >(canaliculi),</hi> traced from the <hi rend="italic">foramina</hi> above, in
                    which the nervous fibres are lodged. This plate, and indeed the lower surface of
                    the perforated plate, are covered by a fibro-mucous membrane, which has been
                    named the pituitary or the Schneiderian. The vertical ethmoid plate is
                    articulated at its lower margin with the <hi rend="italic">vomer</hi> and the
                    triangular cartilage of the nose, before with the nasal spine of the frontal
                    bone, and behind with the median crest <hi rend="italic">(processus azygos)</hi>
                    of the sphenoid bone.^</p>
                <p>The lateral portions of the ethmoid bone consist externally of a smooth flat bone
                    <hi rend="italic">(os planum</hi> of the ancients), which forms the inner or
                    nasal wall of the orbit, internally of two bones convoluted on themselves, and
                    which are distinguished as the superior and middle turbinated bones <hi
                    rend="italic">(conchae, ossa</hi><hi rend="italic">turbinata superiora</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">media, ossa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >spongiosa).</hi> These bones are seen most distinctly behind; but to form a
                    correct notion of their figure, it is requisite to detach the lateral portions
                    and examine them separately, when the following peculiarities may be recognised.
                    The <hi rend="italic">ossa plana</hi> on each side terminate in concave oblong
                    quadrilateral plates, diverging outwards from the vertical plane. <hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> t the internal edge of these quadrilateral plates is seen
                    above a convex bone, with numerous minute perforations, the orifices of short
                    canals. This is the superior turbinated or spongy bone. Below, and a little to
                    the external side, is a small groove, separated by a thin plate from a larger
                    cavity, which is the superior <hi rend="italic">meatus,</hi> leading into the
                    posterior ethmoid cells. Below this, again, is the osseous plate, with
                    perforated edges turned on itself from within outwards, so that its convex side
                    is towards its fellow, and its concavity is below and laterally, and separated
                    by another thin plate from the lower margin of the <hi rend="italic">ossa
                    plana.</hi> This is the <hi rend="italic">middle turbinated bone,</hi> the
                    longitudinal cavity of which communicates with the lower or nasal surface of the
                    bone, and is bounded on its outer margin by the lower margins of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ossa plana,</hi> where they are articulated with the inner margin
                    of the orbitar plate of the maxillary bone. The anterior deficiency of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ossa plana</hi> is occupied by the lacrymal bones.</p>
                <p>The internal surface of these bones generally is covered by a thin fibro-mucous
                    membrane, partaking of the characters of periosteum at its attached, and of
                    mucous membrane at its free surface.</p>
                <p>The ethmoid is articulated with the frontal bone, the sphenoid, the superior
                    maxillary bones, the nasal, the lacrymal, the palate bones, the inferior
                    turbinated bones, and the vomer, at the parts already indicated.</p>
                <p>In structure the component plates are compact, unless at the <hi rend="italic"
                    >crista</hi><hi rend="italic">galli,</hi> which contains some cancellated
                    tissue, and the middle and superior turbinated bones, which seem less dense than
                    the horizontal plate.</p>
                <p>The ethmoid bone consists in the foetus of loose, soft, brown-coloured substance,
                    contained in a thick vascular membrane, and disposed in the cubical shape, but
                    without the complicated arrangement of convoluted plates by which it is
                    afterwards distinguished. Into this the nervous fibrils penetrate, and are
                    observed to be ramified. This continues at least four or five months after
                    birth, when these fibrils become surrounded with compact bone deposited in their
                    interstices, and in this manner the perforated plate is formed by deposition
                    round the nerves. About the same time, on the mesial plane is observed a
                    vertical plate, which gradually becomes condensed into solid bone, in the shape
                    of the <hi rend="italic">crista</hi><hi rend="italic">galli</hi> and middle
                    partition. Soon after, as the bone increases in size, excavations are formed,
                    and the soft uniform substance is removed, while plates of thin but solid bone
                    interposed between thick vascular membranes are observed to be formed. The
                    plates, which are slightly convoluted, become’thinner and more solid, and are at
                    length moulded into the superior and middle turbinated bones. The ethmoid is
                    generally complete about eighteen months after birth; and about the second year
                    its different component parts may be recognised. The holes of the perforated
                    plate are, however, larger and more numerous at this age than afterwards. The
                    minutegrooves <hi rend="italic">(canaliculi,)</hi> described by Scarpa, in the
                    lateral portions, are also more distinct and larger than subsequently. It

                    complicated shape, wedged as it were between the bones of the scull, may be
                    distinguished into cerebral or superior, and anterior-inferior or external
                    surfaces. By the ancient anatomists it was compared to a bat with the wings
                    expanded, and is by them distinguished into a body and wings, great and small.
                    (Fig. 4.)</p>
                <p>The cerebral surface, covered by the dura mater, is superior, and forms part of
                    the internal base of the scull. It may be distinguished into four parts; the
                    middle, the tipper anterior, and two lateral. The middle consists of a smooth
                    surface, on which lie the olfacient or first pair; a transverse groove for the
                    commissure of the optic nerves; a transverse eminence named the olivary <hi
                    rend="italic">(processus</hi><hi rend="italic">olivaris)</hi>; a deep
                    quadrilateral pit in which is contained the pituitary gland, named the Turkish
                    saddle <hi rend="italic">(sella Turcica,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ephippium,</hi><hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">pituitaria),</hi>
                    with a slight groove on each side for the transit of the sixth pair of nerves,
                    and. bounded behind by an elevated eminence, with two processes, named the
                    posterior clinoid or couch-like processes. The sides of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sella Turcica,</hi> especially before and behind, present generally a pit, in
                    which is lodged part of the carotid artery. The anterior serrated margin of this
                    surface is articulated with the ethmoid bone; the posterior with the cuneiform
                    process of the occipital bone.</p>
                <p>The upper anterior portions consist of two triangular spaces, united to the
                    middle by their base. This surface, which corresponds to the anterior lobes, is
                    bounded before by a serrated margin articulated with the frontal bone, behind by
                    a smooth curved margin, which corresponds to the Sylvian fissure, and marks the
                    separation of the anterior and posterior cerebral lobes. This arch, which may be
                    named the <hi rend="italic">sphenoidal,</hi> terminates before in a sharp
                    process, named the ensiform, articulated with the frontal bone, and behind in a
                    similar though smooth process named the anterior clinoid. Anterior to this, and
                    between it and the olivary process, is the optic hole <hi rend="italic"
                    >(foramen</hi><hi rend="italic">opticum),</hi> for the transmission of the optic
                    nerves on each side. Behind this hole, and on each side of the olivary process,
                    is the groove in which the internal carotid is lodged. The triangular surfaces
                    now described are commonly named the small wings <hi rend="italic">(alce minores

                    a smooth margin, which, with a similar one of the pyramidal portion of the
                    temporal bone, forms the anterior fissure of the base of the cranium <hi

                    rend="italic">in basi cranH.)</hi></p>
                <p>The anterior inferior surface presents several distinct regions. On the mesial
                    plane, at right angles to the serrated margin, is a vertical crest or spine,
                    which terminates below in a process denominated therefore the <hi rend="italic"
                    >azygos</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rostrum, (a.)</hi> The upper crest is
                    articulated with the vertical plate of the ethmoid bone, the lower with the
                    fissure of the <hi rend="italic">vomer.</hi> On each side the bone is convex,
                    from the swelling of the sphenoidal sinuses, into which may be seen a small
                    opening, which, however, is nearly closed by an osseous plate, variable in
                    shape, named by Bertin the sphenoidal turbinated bone. The interior of the
                    sinuses is parted into two halves by a middle plate, corresponding to the
                    external crest. On each side of this middle portion is the outer surface of the
                    small wings, forming part of the orbit penetrated by the optic hole, to the
                    circumference of which arc attached the <hi rend="italic">levator
                    palpebrae</hi><hi rend="italic">superioris</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    superior oblique <hi rend="italic">(trochlearis)</hi> between the two last.
                    Between the margins of the small and great wings is the outer orifice of the
                    sphenoidal fissure; and on the other side of this is the orbitar surface,
                    hollow, bounded above by the serrated margin of the triangular area, without by
                    that of the malar process, and below by a smooth ridge, which, with the
                    posterior one of the superior maxillary bone, forms the spheno-maxillary
                    fissure. Immediately between this is the external orifice of the superior
                    maxillary hole. External to the malar serrated edge is the zygomato-temporal
                    surface, hollow, inclosed within three curvilinear serrated margins and two
                    rounded ones, and parted into two portions, the temporal and zygomatic, by an
                    elevated ridge, to which are attached aponeurotic slips of the temporal muscle.
                    Below this transverse crest is a concave surface, lost in the external pterygoid
                    process, and forming part of the zygomatic fossa, terminating, like the similar
                    part of the large wing, in the spinous process, and presenting first the
                    elliptical, and then the spinous hole.</p>
                <p>The rest of the outer surface of the sphenoid bone terminates in two prominent
                    bony plates, the one external, thin, and flat, the other internal, thicker, and
                    more pointed, named the pterygoid Or wing-like. These processes rise almost at
                    right angles to the plane of the posterior part of the lateral wings by a thick
                    prismatic piece of bone, common at first to both. Soon, however, they become
                    distinct, especially behind. The external plate, which is thin, broad, and
                    sharp, rises from the lateral portion between the round and oval hole, and, with
                    its plane turned obliquely outwards, terminates in an end round below and
                    before, sharp behind, (b, b.) To the outside of this plate, which is irregularly
                    rough, with part of the zygomatic fossa, is attached the external pterygoid
                    muscle. The inside of the external plate is concave, and forms, with the
                    internal, part of the pterygoid <hi rend="italic">fossa,</hi> in which are
                    lodged the internal pterygoid muscle and the external <hi rend="italic"
                    >peristαphy-linus.</hi> The internal pterygoid process, rising on the inside,
                    narrower and more curved, terminates in a bent point named the unciform or
                    hook-like process (c, c), over which in a <pb break="no"

                    groove moves the tendon of the external <hi rend="italic">peristaphylinus.</hi>
                    The base of the external process generally presents 'a longitudinal superficial
                    depression named the navicular. Between the external and internal is left a
                    triangular space, which is completed by the pyramidal portion of the palate
                    bone. The base of the internal pterygoid process is penetrated by the Vidian
                    canal <hi rend="italic">(canalis</hi><hi rend="italic">Vidianus),</hi> larger
                    before than behind, through which is reflected the posterior twig of the
                    spheno-palatine ganglion, sometimes named the Vidian nerve (Plate X. fig. 2), to
                    join the sixth at its connection with the great sympathetic, with some
                    bloodvessels.</p>
                <p>The posterior part of the body of the sphenoid bone presents a quadrilateral
                    surface of some extent, rough, cartilaginous, and sometimes excavated into small
                    cells, for articulations with the cuneiform or basilar process of the occipital
                    bone. In the young subject this surface is soft and cartilaginous; but as age
                    advances it becomes more solid, and is at length inseparably ossified with the
                    occipital bone. From this circumstance Soemmering describes the sphenoid and
                    occipital as one bone, under the name of spheno-occipital; a method in which he
                    has been followed by Meckel. The bone, however, is so complicated in shape and
                    the arrangement of its parts, that it is perhaps more intelligible to describe
                    it separately.</p>
                <p>The sphenoid bone is articulated with all the bones of the scull at the points
                    already indicated, and with the following bones of the face—the malar, the
                    palate bones, and the vomer, sometimes with the superior maxillary.</p>
                <p>It consists, when fully formed, chiefly of compact bone; for the plates even of
                    its cells, though thin, are compact and firm bone, and its general density is
                    considerable.</p>
                <p>In the foetus the sphenoid bone, after remaining cartilaginous till the third
                    month, begins to ossify in the lateral portion, near the roots o <hi
                    rend="superscript"> f</hi> the pterygoid processes. Two other points of
                    ossification appear on the large wings, and, coalescing with those already
                    formed, constitute a single mass on each side for each lateral portion. About
                    the same time the body in the sella Turcica begins to be formed; and shortly
                    after the small wings are formed separately, and coalesce, first with each
                    other, and then with the body. In the fifth month the.bone has the same figure
                    which it retains through life, but the extremities of the wings are soft and
                    cartilaginous; the body of the bone is uniform, loose, bony matter; the holes
                    are large and imperfect; the optic hole is triangular; the inferior maxillary
                    hole and the spinous are incomplete behind—sometimes the latter is not formed;
                    and the Vidian canal is a mere fissure between the base of the external and
                    internal pterygoid processes. The bone at this time consists of five portions,
                    one for each small wing, one for each large wing, and one for the body of the
                    bone. At the period of birth, though these parts are still separable, in general
                    the small wings become united with the body, and the bone thus consists of three
                    pieces. Eventually, by the union of the two large wings with the sides of the
                    body, the bone is consolidated into one portion, the optic foramen is rounded,
                    the oval hole completed, and the Vidian fissure is at the same time converted
                    into a canal. In this state tlιe sphenoid continues for several years, growing
                    in every direction, and diminishing the size of its several apertures; till,
                    about the age of puberty, the body becomes excavated into two lateral cavities
                    with compact walls, separated by middle partitions. These are the sphenoidal
                    sinuses, the formation of which is generally simultaneous with the completion of
                    the bone in all its parts.</p>
                <p> The occipital bone <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >occipitis,</hi><hi rend="italic">os proroe),</hi> symmetrical, of a rhomboidal
                    or trapezoidal shape, placed on the median line, occupying the posterior
                    inferior region of the scull, may be distinguished into three parts, the
                    occipital bone proper, the condyloid processes, and its cuneiform or basilar
                    process. It presents two surfaces, an external or occipital, and an internal or
                    cerebral.</p>
                <p>The external surface is convex and smooth above the middle, where it is covered
                    by pericranium and the tendinous fascia of the occipito-frontal muscle. Nearly
                    in the middle the bone is elevated into an irregularly triangular eminence named
                    the occipital protuberance <hi rend="italic">(tuber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >occipitis),</hi> the size and shape of which vary according to the energy of

                    incurvated or unciform. From this prominence a line may be traced, obscurely at
                    first, distinctly below, descending to the great aperture <hi rend="italic"
                    >(foramen magnum),</hi> for the transmission of the spinal chord. To this ridge

                    is not always exactly in the middle, a fibrous fascia of great strength is
                    attached, from the protuberance to the aperture, giving support and attachment
                    to the muscles on each side, and named the posterior cervical ligament <hi

                    irregularities, the effect of muscular impressions.</p>
                <p>A semicircular ridge, extending from the protuberance on each side to the
                    margins, where it joins a similar ridge on the temporal bone, and named the <hi

                    its marginal end to that of the sterno-mastoid. When the crest begins to be
                    distinct, a similar ridge proceeds in a semicircular direction to the margins of
                    the bone, where it becomes more elevated, and occasionally changes its direction
                    by a slight bend downwards and forwards. To the space between these two lines,
                    which is rough and irregular, the <hi rend="italic">complexus,</hi> and part of
                    the <hi rend="italic">rectus capitis posticus major,</hi> are attached within,

                    rend="italic">capitis superior,</hi> are inserted by a strong fascia into the
                    superior semicircular line. (Plate XXIV. fig. 6.)</p>
                <p>The lower region of the bone presents the vertebral aperture, generally oval,
                    with the large diameter antero-posterior, sometimes circular, occasionally
                    rhomboidal or lozenge-shaped. At its anterior half are the condyloid processes,
                    tipped with cartilage and synovial membrane, elliptical in shape, converging
                    forwards, and parted by a sinuosity in the posterior part of the cuneiform
                    process. By this opening the spinal chord with its membranes, and the spinal
                    nerves, pass outwards, and the vertebral arteries enter the cranium. The
                    posterior extremity of the condyloid processes is bounded by a depression,
                    containing generally a small hole, sometimes two, for the transit of vessels not
                    constant; externally is a rough surface, for the attachment of the <hi
                    rend="italic">rectus capitis lateralis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and above is
                    the anterior condyloid hole, for the transmission of the twelfth cerebral or
                    hypoglossal nerve.</p>
                <p>The portion of bone anterior to the great aperture is the cuneiform process, the
                    outer surface of which is depressed behind for the insertion of the <hi

                    smooth before, where it is covered by the mucous membrane of the pharynx.</p>
                <p>The internal or cerebral surface, which is concave, is divided more or less
                    regularly into four compartments, in the following manner. From the apex
                    descends a groove nearly in the median line, though generally inclining a little
                    to the right, to near the middle between the apex <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039871?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9871-0774"/> and upper
                    margin of the great aperture, where it makes a rectangular turn to the right,
                    leaving in the middle an elevated eminence, on the other side of which a similar
                    groove, though always smaller, proceeds to the opposite margin of the bone,
                    while from the same point descends an elevated ridge, more or less acuminated,
                    to within half an inch of the great aperture. This arrangement produces in the
                    inner surface of the occipital bone a cruciform appearance, which is
                    occasionally named the <hi rend="italic">spina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cruciata,</hi> while the compartments are distinguished as superior and
                    inferior right and left occipital <hi rend="italic">fossae.</hi> The rectangular
                    groove, which is the continuation of the sagittal, formed in the inner surface
                    of the parietal bones, contains first the lower part of the superior
                    longitudinal sinus, then the lateral sinus, the plates of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >dura mater</hi> being fixed to the lateral ridges on each side. The groove on
                    the left side contains the left lateral sinus; and to the central tubercle and
                    ridge the <hi rend="italic">falx</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi>
                    is attached. In the two upper compartments, which are much marked by cerebral
                    eminences and depressions, the posterior cerebral lobes are lodged, while the
                    cerebellic lobes are contained in the inferior compartments. (Fig. 7.)</p>
                <p>On each side of the large aperture is seen a short segment of a broad circular
                    furrow, which terminates on the margin of the bone in a smooth sinuous
                    depression. The first part is the termination of the lateral groove, containing
                    the end of the lateral sinus; the second, the sigmoid notch, forms, with a
                    similar one on the temporal bone, the jugular hole <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The margins of the occipital bone posterior to the inferior lateral groove are
                    serrated for articulation by suture with the parietal and temporal bones. The

                    the re-entrant angle formed by the two parietal bones. The sides of this angle,

                    salient angle, but always obtuse, is formed opposite the superior lateral
                    grooves, for articulation with the re-entrant angle formed by the parietal and
                    temporal bones of each side. A third angle is formed by the jugular eminence, an
                    elevated process placed between the inferior lateral groove and the jugular
                    notch, and which is tipped with cartilage for articulation with a corresponding
                    surface of the pyramidal portion of the temporal bone. Anterior to the jugular
                    notch the margin of the bone is smooth, but articulates by fibro-cartilage with
                    the posterior surface of the temporal pyramid, leaving a small space
                    unarticulated between the anterior extremities of both bones, which form a
                    common aperture.</p>
                <p>The occipital bone is thick along the crucial spine, the tubercles, and at the
                    condyloid process; but thin in the centre of the four occipital fossae, at which
                    the external and internal tables are united with little or no <hi rend="italic"
                    >diploe,</hi> and are not unfrequently translucent. The cuneiform process is
                    cancellated.</p>
                <p>In the foetus it consists of four pieces, one for the occipital bone proper, one
                    for each condyloid portion, and one for the basilar process. The ossification of
                    the occipital portion commences near its middle, corresponding to a point above
                    the occipital protuberance, and extends by radiating fibres all round to the
                    margins of the bone. At this time the occipital portion has the shape of a <hi
                    rend="italic">cardium;</hi> and the apex not being formed, a space is left
                    through which the brain is felt pulsating, named the posterior fontanelle. About
                    the same time ossification appears in two quadrilateral portions on each side of
                    the large aperture, and in an oblong parallelogram anterior to it. Though these
                    enlarge and approach each other, at the period of birth the apex is still
                    incomplete, and the posterior fontanelle is open; and even at the inferior
                    angles of the occipital portion, where it joins the condyloid portions, a space
                    of the same kind is left on each side. After birth, as ossification advances
                    rapidly, the apex of the occipital portion is gradually enlarged, the Wormian
                    bones on each side are formed, and the condyloid and basilar portions uniting
                    with the occipital, the bone is consolidated about the third or fourth year. The
                    traces of the lines of union may sometimes be recognised so late as the seventh
                    year.</p>
                <p>The occipital bone is articulated immovably by its margins with the sphenoid
                    bone, the two parietal, and the two temporal bones; movably by its condyles with
                    the atlas.</p>
                <p>It is also connected with the second vertebra by means of a ligament, which
                    passes from the odontoid process to the inner margins of the condyloid
                    processes.</p>
                <p>The parietal bones <hi rend="italic">(ossa</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    each other on the mesial line, are quadrilateral, quadrangular, convex
                    externally, concave internally, occupying the upper, middle, and lateral parts
                    of the cranium. (Plate XXVI. fig. 4 and 5.)</p>
                <p>The external convex surface, which is covered by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >epicranius</hi> above and temporal muscle below, presents above and behind a
                    hole for an artery and vein, variable however in position and existence; in the
                    middle the parietal eminence, prominent in youth, indistinct in advanced age;
                    and somewhere between its middle and lower margin a curvilinear ridge, the
                    continuation of that on the frontal bone, and terminating near the lower augle
                    of the parietal for the attachment of the temporal fascia, below which the bone
                    is covered by the temporal muscle.</p>
                <p>The internal concave surface, lined by the <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> is
                    marked by digital eminences and depressions corresponding to those of the
                    cerebral convolutions. The superior edge is marked by a half-groove, which, with
                    that of the opposite bone, constitutes the sagittal for lodging the superior
                    longitudinal sinus; within this, depressions more or less deep, corresponding to
                    the granules of Pacchioni; towards the centre the parietal pit, corresponding to
                    the eminence of the external surface; and ascending from the inferior anterior
                    angle arborescent grooves, in which the large meningeal artery is lodged, (m,
                    m.) Parts <hi rend="italic">of</hi> these grooves are occasionally converted
                    into canals by the growth of bone over their margins.</p>
                <p>The parietal bone is bounded by four margins. By the superior, which is serrated,
                    it unites on the mesial plane with the opposite bone, forming the <hi
                    rend="italic">sagittal suture;</hi> by the anterior or coronal, also serrated,
                    it is articulated firmly with the frontal bone, forming the <hi rend="italic"
                    >coronal suture</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the posterior, also serrated,
                    forms with the posterior margin of the corresponding bone a re-entrant angle, in
                    which the occipital, occasionally with Wormian bones, is articulated. The lower
                    margin alone, which is a concave curvature, is obliquely acuminated before,
                    acuminated and serrated in the middle for imbrication with the temporal <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039884?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9884-0775"/>
                    bone, and serrated behind for articulation with the upper margin of the mastoid
                    proeess.</p>
                <p>These margins form by union four angles, an anterior and posterior superior, and
                    an anterior and posterior inferior, of whieh the most important is the anterior
                    inferior, by reason of its presenting the origin of the meningeal groove on its
                    internal surface. The parietal bone, consisting of an external and internal
                    table, with interposed <hi rend="italic">diploe,</hi> is thin, especially below
                    its middle; and the <hi rend="italic">diploe</hi> is small, and in some points
                    obliterated. It is ossified from one point, commencing at the protuberance, and
                    radiating all round to the margins. Previous, and some time subsequent to birth,
                    its mesial margin and anterior and superior angle are not formed; and the brain
                    is here eovered by <hi rend="italic">dura mater, pericranium,</hi> and
                    integuments only, forming, as already mentioned, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >bregma,</hi> or anterior fontanelle. By the completion of the bones, however,
                    the margins and angles meet, and the fontanelle is closed. This is generally
                    effected in the course of the second year.</p>
                <p>The temporal bones <hi rend="italic">(ossa</hi><hi rend="italic">temporum),</hi>
                    rather irregular •in shape, are placed on each side at the lateral and inferior
                    parts of the cranium.</p>
                <p>Each bone presents an external or auricular surface, an internal or cerebral, and
                    a circumference.</p>
                <p>The external or auricular surface presents, above and before, a large convex
                    surface, part of the temporal fossa lodging part of the temporal muscle; before,
                    the zygomatic process, long, pointed, and terminating in a serrated extremity,
                    where it is united with the malar bone to form the <hi rend="italic">zygoma</hi>
                    (fig. 2, z), to the upper surface of which the temporal fascia is attached, to
                    the lower the masseter muscle; behind, a flat surface of an irregularly rounded
                    shape, terminating before in the mastoid proeess <hi rend="italic"
                    >(processus</hi><hi rend="italic">mammillaris, mastoideus,</hi> m), and behind
                    in a serrated margin, which unites with the oceipital bone. Between the mastoid
                    process and the serrated margin behind is a rough surface for the <hi
                    rend="italic">splenius,</hi> small <hi rend="italic">complexus,</hi> and
                    sterno-mastoid; and below is a pit, in which the origin of the digastric muscle
                    <hi rend="italic">(biventer maxilloe)</hi> is lodged.</p>
                <p>The zygomatic process is connected to the temporal bone by two roots, one of
                    which, anterior, inferior, and transverse <hi rend="italic">(processus
                    transversus),</hi> forms the anterior brim of the glenoid or articular cavity,
                    in which the condyle of the inferior jaw is lodged; the other, superior and
                    posterior, forms first the external and then the posterior brim of the same
                    cavity. Behind this posterior brim is an irregular fissure termed the glenoid
                    <hi rend="italic">(fissura</hi><hi rend="italic">Glasseri),</hi> which indicates
                    the original line of separation between the superior or squamous and the
                    inferior or pyramidal portion of the bone, and through which pass the tendon of
                    the anterior muscle of the <hi rend="italic">malleus,</hi> some vessels, and a
                    nervous twig named <hi rend="italic">chorda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tympani.</hi></p>
                <p>In the angle between the mastoid and zygomatic process is an elliptical opening
                    from five to six lines in diameter, leading into a cylindrical eavity, the
                    direction of which is obliquely forwards. This orifice, which is the external
                    earhole <hi rend="italic">(meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">externus,</hi> o), leads
                    into the tympanal cavity, from whieh it is separated, in the recent subject, by
                    a thin membrane only <hi rend="italic">(membrana tympani).</hi> The three lower
                    thirds of this orifiee are formed by a distinct bony ring, which is rough, and
                    perforated by holes for the insertion of the cartilages óf the external ear. On
                    the outside of the lower part of this bony ring is a strong process, varying
                    from half an inch to 12 lines in length, nearly round, but terminating in a
                    sharp point, and therefore, from its resemblance to the style <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the ancients, named the <hi rend="italic">styloid process. (tf.)</hi>
                    Behind its base, and between it and the mastoid process, is a small hole, the
                    stylo-mastoid, for the exit of the facial nerve. (Plate XXVI. fig. 2.)</p>
                <p>The inner or cerebral surface, marked by cerebral impressions and arterial
                    furrows, is distinguished particularly by a pyramidal eminence of bone rising
                    obliquely from it, and a deep sinuous groove, making part of the lateral, in
                    which is lodged part of the lateral sinus.</p>
                <p>The pyramidal portion <hi rend="italic">(pyramis,</hi> fig. 3, p), named also the
                    petrous <hi rend="italic">(pars petrosa),</hi> from its hardness in several of
                    the lower animals, may be distinguished as a truneated pyramid, bounded by four
                    planes, one of which, the external, has been already described. Of the other
                    three, one superior, marked by cerebral impressions, presents a semilunar
                    depression for the Gasserian or trigeminal ganglion, the upper orifice of the
                    carotie eanal, a slight furrow, the extremity of the opening through whieh a
                    branch of the Vidian nerve passes, and an eminence whieh indieates the situation
                    of the superior semicircular eanal. Another posterior, separated from the last
                    by a sharp margin, traversed anteriorly by the groove of the superior petrous
                    sinus, presents, first, an eminence indicating the posterior semicircular canal;
                    and, secondly, an orifice, the internal auditory hole <hi rend="italic"
                    >(meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">internus),</hi> parted by a septum into an upper
                    orifiee communicating with the Fallopian aqueduct for the faeial nerve, and a
                    lower pit containing minute holes communicating with the labyrinth, and
                    transmitting the filaments of the eighth or auditory nerve.</p>
                <p>The lower or third plane surface of the pyramidal process, which is external and
                    eonnected with the oceipital bone, presents, first, at the lower end of the
                    external depression a cartilaginous, rough surface, where it adheres to that
                    bone; then a large sinuous cavity, the jugular noteh, forming, with that on the
                    occipital bone, the hole for the exit of the jugular vein, often separated by a
                    bony process into two, the first of whieh is for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nervus</hi><hi rend="italic">vagus,</hi> the second for the jugular vein; a
                    sharp ridge <hi rend="italic">(proeessus vaginalis)</hi> at the base of the
                    styloid process, separating the jugular noteh from the glenoid cavity; a
                    eireular hole, the external orifiee of the earotic eanal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(canalis caroticus),</hi> for the entrance of the internal carotid and the exit
                    of the sixth nerve; a small hole terminating the aqueduct of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cochlea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, lastly, a rough surface
                    for the attachment of the internal <hi rend="italic">peristaphylinus,</hi> and
                    the external musele of the <hi rend="italic">malleus.</hi> At the line of
                    junction between this plane and the posterior is generally seen part of the
                    groove for the inferior petrous sinus. (Plate XXVI. fig. 3.)</p>
                <p>The circumference is united behind by a serrated margin with the occipital bone;
                    above by a margin, partly serrated, partly imbricated, with the parietal bone
                    and posterior part of the large wing of the sphenoid; and before and below by a
                    serrated margin with the lower part of the same wing. This part, named generally
                    the squamous, forms with' the pyramid a re-entrant angle, in which is received
                    the spinous process of the sphenoid bone; and elosc beside whieh is the orifiee
                    of the Eustachian tube <hi rend="italic">(iter</hi><hi rend="italic">a

                    whieh leads from the throat to the tympanal eavity. The truncated extremity of
                    the pyramid, whieh is reeeived by the re-entrant angle formed by the sphenoid
                    and occipital bones, presents the upper opening of the earotie eanal, which is
                    imperfect above, and in the reeent body is completed by the <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The temporal bone is thin before and above, where it consists of two tables with
                    intermediate <hi rend="italic">diploe.</hi> The mastoid process in the adult
                    consists of numerous communieating eells, lined by very delieatc periosteal
                    mucous membrane, continued from the tympanal eavity, with which they
                    eommunieate. The pyramidal portion is compact <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and hard,
                    and contains with other parts the labyrinth or internal ear.</p>
                <p>Nothing is more interesting than the developement of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039897?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9897-0776"/> the temporal
                    bone. It is ossified in three portions,—the large, flat, or squamous; the
                    tympanal ring; the pyramidal, with the mastoid, and the styloid process.</p>
                <p>At an early period the pyramidal portion is perfectly formed round the several
                    soft parts, and though porous and spongy, dense bone is seen in the site of the
                    semicircular canals. The different orifices are large and distinct. The tympanal
                    cavity, however, is quite incomplete; and though the carotic canal is formed,
                    the Eustachian tube is in the shape of a mere groove. The size of the pyramid is
                    greater than subsequently in proportion; and the part behind the open tympanal
                    cavity, which is bulky, is to constitute the mastoid process, which however is
                    still a shapeless mass. The squamous portion is thin and almost scaly at birth,
                    with the zygomatic process well marked, and a ring of bone, incomplete at the
                    upper margin, attached to its inferior and posterior part. By this, which
                    afterwards constitutes the ring of the external .ear-hole, it is fixed to the
                    pyramidal portion in such manner that the part behind the ring is rather larger
                    and longer than the part before; and the pyramid, instead of projecting, as
                    afterwards, is short and thick. At this period also the flat portion uniting
                    with the occipital bone is not formed, and there is therefore an opening or
                    fontanelle at this point of the cranium. Soon, however, the squamous becomes
                    united with the pyramidal portion; the tympanal ring is fixed to both; the
                    Eustachian tube is completed; and, at the posterior end of the pyramid, bone is
                    deposited and extended in a tabular layer of some thickness. The mastoid
                    process, however, cannot be recognised; and it is only some years after birth
                    (about seven) that a small oblong elevation begins to be visible behind the
                    posterior limb of the auditory ring. If at this time the process is divided,
                    cells of the kind afterwards seen in this part are not distinct; but as its
                    enlargement proceeds, cells begin to be formed about the same time, and at the
                    same rate, as the frontal, ethmoidal, and sphenoidal cells are formed. The
                    figure of the bone also is altered, in consequence of the change which the
                    component parts undergo in relation to each other. The squamous portion expands,
                    the anterior part of the pyramidal portion is elongated and tapers, the
                    posterior and the mastoid parts enlarge, and at a later period the styloid
                    process begins to appear amidst the muscles attached to it.</p>
                <p>The temporal bone is united immovably with the sphenoid, parietal, occipital, and
                    malar bones; and the inferior maxillary is connected to it by articulation. In
                    the tympanal cavity, also, are contained the four tympanal bones, to be
                    considered afterwards.</p>
                <p>Besides these uniform bones of the cranium, there are occasionally found one or
                    more supernumerary bones, which vary much in number, size, and situation. Most
                    usually they are found in the line between the occipital and parietal bones,
                    causing the lambdoidal suture to vary much in regularity; and occasionally,
                    instead of the apex of the occipital bone, is found a single supernumerary bone.
                    They are observed less frequently at the inferior anterior angle of these bones,
                    and at the temporo-parietal sutures, and still more rarely at the base of the
                    cranium. These bones, to which attention was originally drawn by Wormius, by
                    whose name they are still distinguished <hi rend="italic">(ossa Wormiana),</hi>
                    may be regarded as effects of the aberration of the ossifie process. Though they
                    have been also named triangular <hi rend="italic">(ossa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >triquetra),</hi> their shape is extremely variable. They are similar in
                    structure and mode of union to the parietal and occipital bones; and though they
                    are not entitled to the epithet of cranial keys <hi rend="italic"
                    >(claves</hi><hi rend="italic">cranii),</hi> often given them, they may be
                    viewed as appendages to the cranial bones, which are then to be regarded as
                    incomplete. The most important fact in their history is, that they are most
                    frequent in young subjects, and in those in whom ossification is imperfect. As
                    they are rarely found in advanced age, it may be inferred that they eventually
                    become consolidated with one or other of the bones to which they adhere.</p>
                <p>§ 5. <hi rend="italic">The Face. (Ossa Faciei.)</hi></p>
                <p>The face, situate before and below the cranium, is bounded above by that cavity,
                    on the sides by the zygomatic arches, and behind by a space corresponding to the
                    upper region of the pharynx. Symmetrical in disposition, its anterior surface is
                    trapezoidal, the largest side being above, its vertical section triangular, and
                    each side irregular. The bones of which it consists are those of the upper jaw,
                    comprehending thirteen separate pieces, two superior maxillary bones, two malar
                    bones, two nasal bones, two lacrymal bones, two inferior turbinated bones, two
                    palate bones, and one vomer; and the single lower jaw. (Plate XXVI. fig. 8.)</p>
                <p>The superior maxillary bone <hi rend="italic">(os make, maxilla superior) '</hi>
                    is the basis of those of the upper jaw, and forms a centre,J with which the
                    others are connected. Though in shape irregular, it may be distinguished into
                    zygomato-facial, orbitar, and naso-palatine surfaces. (Fig. 6.)</p>
                <p>The zygomato-facial surface, irregularly convex and concave, consists of two
                    divisions, the facial and zygomatic. The first presents the nasal or ascending
                    process, terminating above in a serrated margin, articulated with the frontal
                    bone; behind in a groove concurring with a similar one in the lacrymal bone to
                    form the lacrymal canal; before by a similar margin joining with the nasal bone;
                    and below, a pit for the insertion of the levator of the upper lip and nose <hi
                    rend="italic">(levator</hi><hi rend="italic">labii superioris</hi><hi

                    mesial side by a sinuous hollow, the nasal, and a spine forming with that of the
                    opposite side the nasal spine, presents above, the superior maxillary hole for
                    the exit of the second branch of the trigeminal nerve, the canine <hi

                    <hi rend="italic">(depressor alee nasi).</hi> The facial region is separated
                    from the zygomatic by a rounded margin, the upper extremity of which is rough
                    and hollowed for articulation with the malar bone <hi rend="italic">(os genae,
                    os jugale)</hi>; while the posterior forms part of the temporal <hi
                    rend="italic">fossa</hi> before, and a distinct protuberance behind
                    corresponding to the posterior part of a large cavity denominated the maxillary
                    <hi rend="italic">(antrum</hi><hi rend="italic">maxillare,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sinus</hi><hi rend="italic">maxillaris).</hi> This cavity, indeed, corresponds
                    also to the canine fossa and the external protuberance.</p>
                <p>The orbitar surface, which is flat, and slightly oblique in direction, forming
                    the inner half of the lower wall of the orbit, is bounded within by a sharp line
                    for articulation with the ethmoid bone, without by the rough malar surface, and
                    traversed through its posterior half by a groove for the maxillary vessels and
                    nerve, terminating partly in the sinus, partly in the superior maxillary hole.
                    The posterior margin of this surface, which is obtusely rounded, forms with the
                    sphenoid bone the spheno-maxillary fissure; and its internal or mesial angle is
                    articulated with the ascending process of the palate bone.</p>
                <p>The naso-palatine or mesial surface of the bone is complicated. Before and above
                    is seen the inner surface of the nasal or ascending process, traversed by
                    vascular and nervous grooves, and covered by the pituitary membrane. Behind this
                    is the lacrymal groove, terminating in the nasal, which is converted into a
                    canal by the inferior turbinated bone, below which it opens; and the open <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193039910?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9910-0777"/> ing
                    into the maxillary sinus, large in the detached bone, but contracted below by
                    the inferior turbinated, and behind <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> by the
                    palate-bone. This sinus, which is of an irregular tetrahedral shape, corresponds
                    before to the canine <hi rend="italic">fossa,</hi> behind to the zygomatic
                    tuberosity, above to the orbitar plate, and below to the alveolar arch. Below
                    this is the palatine plate <hi rend="italic">(apophysis palatina),</hi>
                    quadrilateral and horizontal, concave and smooth above, where it forms the lower
                    wall of the nostrils, concave and marked by vascular orifices below, where it
                    forms the anterior part of the hard palate. (Fig. 7.) The anterior part of the
                    process is elevated into the nasal spine; its mesial margin, which is thick and
                    marked by numerous grooves, one unusually large for the naso-palatine nerves and
                    vessels <hi rend="italic">(canalis incisivus vel</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Stenonianus),</hi> is joined to that of the opposite side, forming a groove in
                    which the lower margin of the vomer is received; and the posterior, which is
                    thin, is attached to the square plate of the palate-bone, which thus completes
                    the palatine vault.</p>
                <p>The palatine is separated from the zygomato-facial region by a semiparabolic
                    arch, perforated in the adult by eight honeycomb-like pits <hi rend="italic"
                    >(alveoli'),</hi> in which the roots of the teeth are implanted, and therefore
                    named the <hi rend="italic">alveolar</hi> arch. Of these pits the first two are
                    the smallest, the next three larger, and the last three very large,—an
                    arrangement which renders the alveolar arch narrow before, and broad on the
                    sides and behind.</p>
                <p>The superior maxillary bone is united, at the points indicated, to that of the
                    opposite side, to the frontal bone, to the ethmoid, to the nasal, to the
                    lacrymal, to the palatine, to the malar, to the inferior turbinated bone, and to
                    the vomer.</p>
                <p>It is ossified in one piece. In the foetus its divisions are completely formed,
                    except the orbitar plate, the sinus, and the <hi rend="italic">alveoU.</hi> In
                    the former, the superior maxillary canal is a slit; and the latter is a mere
                    depression on the nasal surface of the bone. This, however, becomes larger and
                    more capacious, not by excavation, but by the extension of its walls by bony
                    deposition. The alveolar arch in general consists of two parabolic plates united
                    by transverse <hi rend="italic">septa,</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> so</hi>
                    imperfect, that the whole intermediate groove communicates freely. These osseous
                    plates are not uniform in number. In some maxillary bones there are four, and a
                    fifth like a mere line at the bottom of the groove; in others six <hi
                    rend="italic">alveoli,</hi> viz. four temporary, and two permanent <hi
                    rend="italic">alveoli.</hi> These plates are formed by deposition round the
                    dentiferous sacs.</p>
                <p>The malar bone <hi rend="italic">(os jugale, os genae)</hi> is a quadrilateral
                    bone, approaching the rhomboidal shape, but bounded by curved lines. It presents
                    three surfaces, a facial, an orbitar, and a zygomatic; and four angles, a
                    frontal, a temporal, a zygomatic, a superior maxillary, and an inferior
                    maxillary. (Fig. 7 and 8, g.)</p>
                <p>The facial surface is convex and smooth, marked by one or two holes <hi
                    rend="italic">(foramen jugale)</hi> for vessels and nerves, and, with the
                    zygomatic process gives attachment below to the zygomatic muscles.</p>
                <p>The orbitar surface, which is concave, directed obliquely upwards, projects
                    backwards from the facial plate, and forms the outer wall of the orbit between
                    the frontal and sphenoid bone above, and the superior maxillary below. It
                    presents the internal malar hole, or the inner orifice of that seen in the
                    facial surface. The posterior edge is rough and serrated for conjunction with
                    the sphenoid bone.</p>
                <p>The zygomatic surface is a sort of angular concave recess between the orbitar
                    plate above and the facial before, and is chiefly important in forming the
                    anterior part of the temporal fossa. In the angle between the orbitar and facial
                    plates is seen a small hole, which communicates with the internal malar above,
                    and the external malar before. The anterior part of this surface is rough, and
                    unites with the external or malar process of the superior maxillary bone.</p>
                <p>The superior or frontal angle is serrated for uni <hi rend="underline">tin</hi> g
                    with the external angular process of the frontal bone. The temporal is long and
                    pointed, and rough above, where it joins the temporal bone to form the <hi
                    rend="italic">zygoma,</hi> to which the temporal fascia above and the masseter
                    below are attached. The superior maxillary or orbitar is also pointed, and joins
                    the rounded ridge at the base of the ascending process of the superior maxillary
                    bone. The inferior maxillary is obtuse-angled, and joins the lower angle of the
                    malar process.</p>
                <p>Wedged between the bones of the scull and face, the malar bone is connected to
                    the frontal, the temporal, the sphenoid, and the superior maxillary. It is
                    ossified from a single point.</p>
                <p>Each nasal bone <hi rend="italic">(os nasi)</hi> is quadrilateral and
                    trapezoidal. Of its two surfaces, the external, smooth and slightly convex, is
                    covered by the periosteum and the pyramidal muscle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(compressor</hi><hi rend="italic">narium)</hi> and part of the frontal <hi
                    rend="italic">(epicranius).</hi> The inner, rather concave and somewhat
                    irregular, with grooves for vessels and nerves, is covered with the pituitary
                    membrane. (Fig. 8, n.)</p>
                <p>The upper margin of the nasal bone, which is somewhat thick, is serrated for
                    union with the frontal bone, on the nasal spine of which it is firmly supported.
                    By the mesial margin, which also is thick, plain, and prolonged backwards, it is
                    joined to that of the opposite side; while its thin external margin being
                    imbricated beneath the mesial one of the maxillary, the central pressure is thus
                    opposed on each side. In this manner the two nasal bones, supported above by the
                    frontal spine, are firmly wedged between the superior maxillary, much on the
                    same principle as the key-stone is wedged between the lateral parts of the arch.
                    (Plate XXIV. 2 and 3, n.) To the lower margin the nasal cartilages are attached.
                    Each nasal bone is formed from a single centre of ossification.</p>
                <p>Each lacrymal bone <hi rend="italic">(os lacrymale,</hi><hi rend="italic">os
                    unguis)</hi> is about the size of a nail, situate at the inner wall of the
                    orbit, occupying the space between the frontal bone above, the ethmoid behind,
                    and the superior maxillary before. Its shape is irregularly quadrilateral, and
                    it presents two surfaces, an orbitar and nasal, and four margins.</p>
                <p>The orbitar surface consists of two regions, one orbitar proper, flat, and
                    smooth, situate behind, and connected with the lateral smooth bone <hi
                    rend="italic">(os planum)</hi> of the ethmoid, with which it completes the inner
                    wall of the orbit; the other, which is anterior, is at right angles to this, and
                    is moulded into a cylindrical groove, which, with that of the superior maxillary
                    bone, constitutes the lacrymal canal, in which is lodged the membranous tube
                    which conveys the tears and mucus from the eye to the nose. These two surfaces
                    are parted by a sharp longitudinal crest, to which is attached the aponeurosis
                    of the orbicular muscle of the eyelids <hi rend="italic">(orbicularis
                    palpebrarum).</hi></p>
                <p>The nasal surface is irregular, covered by the fibro-mucous membrane of the
                    ethmoid cells, and of which it makes part. It presents distinctly the angle of
                    union between the orbitar and lacrymal portion of the bone.</p>
                <p>This bone, which is compact, is developed from a single point, and is early
                    formed in the foetus.</p>
                <p>The inferior turbinated bones, which are irregular in' shape, are attached to the
                    nasal surface of the superior ' maxillary by an oblique line near the lower
                    margin of the ’ <hi rend="italic">antrum,</hi> with the convex surfaces turned
                    to each other.</p>
                <p>Each turbinated bone presents a nasal surface, uneven and marked by rough lines,
                    with intermediate cellular <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039923?mode=fullsize"

                    constituting part of the inferior nasal passage. Both are invested by
                    fibro-mueous membrane continued from the pituitary.</p>
                <p>Each turbinated bone is bounded by two margins,—a superior, which is fixed,—an
                    inferior, free. Of the former, the anterior part is a thin border, joining with
                    the superior maxillary bone at the base of the ascending process, and with the
                    laerymal bone by an angular slip. The middle is a short spinous part, uniting
                    with the lateral mass of the ethmoid, and diminishing the opening of the
                    maxillary sinus; and the posterior part, which is rounded and inclining, is
                    attached to the crest of the palate-bone. The lower margin, whieh is free, is
                    slightly convoluted on itself, so as to separate the middle from the inferior
                    nasal passage.</p>
                <p>The inferior spongy bone, which is formed in one pieee, though perforated by
                    vascular and nervous holes, and moulded into eells at its lower convoluted
                    margin, consists, however, chiefly of compact bone. It is covered through its
                    whole extent by the fibro-mucous membrane of the nasal passages.</p>
                <p>Each palate-bone <hi rend="italic">(ossa</hi><hi rend="italic">palati),</hi>
                    attached to the posterior part of the superior maxillary bones, to which they
                    may be regarded as appendages, consists of three parts, a base or palatine
                    portion, a nasal ascending or vertical portion, and an orbitar part.</p>
                <p>The base consists of a quadrangular and quadrilateral plate of bone, placed
                    horizontally, and attached before to the posterior margin of the horizontal or
                    palatine plate of the superior maxillary bone, and on the inner or mesial side
                    to the corresponding margin of the opposite bone (Plate XXVI. fig. 7, p, p),
                    with whieh it forms a groove, in whieh is lodged the posterior part of the lower
                    margin of the vomer. The upper surface is concave, and, with that of the
                    superior maxillary bone, completes the lower wall of the nasal passages. The
                    lower is almost straight, but presents a slight concavity, bounded behind by a
                    transverse crest of bone, to which the <hi rend="italic">uvula</hi> or soft and
                    movable palate is attached. Behind this is a surface bounded by the posterior
                    margin, which is sinuous and lunated, and terminates within in a pointed
                    eminence, whieh, with that óf the opposite side, forms on the mesial plane the
                    palatine spine. The external margin, whieh rises into the nasal or ascending
                    portion, is rounded without into a sinuous depression, which forms, with the
                    pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone, the pterygo-palatine canal, and which
                    occasionally, at least at its lower extremity, is entirely formed in the
                    palate-bone.</p>
                <p>The nasal portion, whieh is irregular in shape, presents on the na∙sal surface a
                    hollow, rising from the square plate, and forming the posterior part of the
                    lower nasal passage; a transverse ridge <hi rend="italic">(linea aspera)</hi>
                    continuous with that of the superior maxillary bone, and to which the inferior
                    turbinated bone is attached; and then another hollow, forming the posterior end
                    of the middle nasal passage, and with the former contracting the orifice of the
                    maxillary sinus. Immediately above this the vertical portion is parted by a
                    notch into two unequal parts, a posterior articulated with the base of the
                    external pterygoid process, and an anterior articulated before with the superior
                    maxillary bone, and within presenting cells, which unite with those of the
                    ethmoid bone. The outer part of this cellular portion is bounded by three
                    surfaces, one external, forming part of the zygomatic <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> another anterior, resting on a corresponding
                    surface of the superior maxillary bone; a third superior, forming part of the
                    inner wall of the orbit. The notch between the anterior and posterior divisions
                    forms with the sphenoid bone the spheno-palatine, for transmitting the
                    spheno-palatine twig of the superior maxillary nerve, with some veins, and the
                    internal branch of the spheno-palatine ganglion.</p>
                <p>The posterior margin of this vertical portion is acute above, where it is simply
                    conjoined with the base of the pterygoid processes; but below it is moulded into
                    a thick, strong, triangular process, projecting backwards, and marked by three
                    grooves, one in the middle, and one on each side. In the two latter the external
                    and internal pterygoid processes are adapted; and the middle space, being
                    prominent, and firmly wedged between the pterygoid processes, completes the
                    pterygoid <hi rend="italic">fossa.</hi></p>
                <p>Eaeh palate-bone is connected with six bones, two of the cranium and four of the
                    face; the ethmoid and sphenoid, the superior maxillary, the inferior turbinated
                    bone, the palate-bone of the opposite side, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vomer.</hi></p>
                <p>The palate-bone, so far as is hitherto observed, is formed in one portion. In the
                    foetus, at the seventh month, it is completely formed; but the square or
                    horizontal part is larger in proportion than the vertical, and remains so till
                    the face begins to alter its shape.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vomer</hi> or plough-share bone is symmetrical, placed on
                    the mesial plane between the sphenoid and ethmoid bones above, and the palate
                    and superior maxillary bones below, and forming the posterior part of the nasal
                    partition.</p>
                <p>In shape it is irregular, though it affects the rhomboidal. It consists of two
                    thin plates of compact bone united at an angular line below, but separated above
                    so as to form a deep longitudinal groove, in whieh the cartilaginous partition
                    before, and the vertical plate of the ethmoid behind, are inserted. At the
                    posterior end these plates spread out into lateral wings with intermediate
                    grooves, in which the <hi rend="italic">azygos</hi> process of the sphenoid bone
                    is accurately fitted. These two parts form the upper and posterior margins. The
                    lower consists of a single thin plate, whieh is received into the linear groove
                    formed by the middle erest of the palate and superior maxillary bones. The
                    anterior part of this margin rises more directly, to fit the nasal spine of the
                    latter bones.</p>
                <p>The surfaces of the vomer are smooth, occasionally concave and convex in opposite
                    directions, and, being covered by the fibro-mucous pituitary membrane,
                    constitute the bony partition between the right and left nasal passages. The
                    bone is formed in a single piece, and is generally completed in the seventh and
                    eighth month.</p>
                <p>The lower jaw-bone <hi rend="italic">(mandibula,</hi><hi rend="italic">maxilla
                    inferior),</hi> symmetrical, placed at the base of the faee, is of a shape,
                    nearly parabolic, with an elevated branch at each extremity. It consists of two
                    parts, a maxillary arch, and a <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi> at each end, each of
                    whieh has two surfaces, an external or facial, and an internal or oral, an
                    alveolar or upper margin, and a mental or lower margin. (Fig. 8 and 9.)</p>
                <p>The external surface of the parabolic or arched portion of the lower jaw presents
                    first on the mesial plane the <hi rend="italic">symphysis</hi> or ehin <hi
                    rend="italic">(mentum),</hi> indicating the original separation of the bone into
                    two parts,—a vertical line diverging into two, so as to form a triangular
                    eminence <hi rend="italic">(tuber</hi><hi rend="italic">maxillare</hi> of
                    Soemmering). (Fig. 8 and 9, x.) On each side of this is a depression for the

                    presents a quadrilateral surface, corresponding to the masseter (r), bounded
                    before by a sharp line terminating in the coronoid process (b, b), behind by an
                    obtuse one, the posterior margin terminating in the condyloid or articular
                    process (e, c), and above by the sigmoid notch <hi rend="italic"
                    >(incisura</hi><hi rend="italic">semilunaris vel</hi><hi rend="italic"

                <p>The internal or oral surface of the lower jaw presents in the middle a spine or
                    crest <hi rend="italic">(spina</hi><hi rend="italic">menti</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >interna),</hi> consisting in general of three eminences, the two superior of
                    which give attachment to the <hi rend="italic">genio</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >∙glossi,</hi> and the lower to the <hi rend="italic">genio-hyoidei.</hi> On
                    each side of this is a superficial hollow for the sublingual gland, and a pit
                    for the digastric muscle; and extending outward on each side is the internal
                    oblique line, to which the mylo-hyoideus and the superior constrictor of the
                    pharynx are attached. Below this is a depression for the submaxillary gland;
                    behind, at the margin of the <hi rend="italic">ramus,</hi> the surface is rough
                    for the insertion of the external pterygoid; between this and the top of the
                    oblique line is the internal mental hole, or the inner orifice of the maxillary
                    canal; and above and round the orifice the surface is rough for the insertion of
                    the internal ligament of the lower jaw. By this orifice the inferior maxillary
                    nerve, or third branch of the fifth pair, with its concomitant vessels, enters
                    the canal; and after sending branches to the alveolar arch and membranes,
                    reappears at the external mental hole.</p>
                <p>The upper margin of the parabolic part of the bone is moulded into a series of
                    <hi rend="italic">alveolar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">honeycomb-like</hi>
                    cavities, bounded by external and internal plates, and separated by <hi
                    rend="italic">septa</hi> more or less complete. These cavities are in the adult
                    16 in number, but are sometimes imperfect, sometimes obliterated by the removal
                    of the teeth. This margin, which, like the corresponding one of the superior
                    jaw, is named the <hi rend="italic">alve'olar arch,</hi> is, like it, narrow
                    anteriorly, and wide on the sides and behind. At the posterior end of each
                    alveolar arch the external and internal oblique lines form between them a
                    superficial depression, in which part of the <hi rend="italic">buccinator</hi>
                    is lodged; and then converging as they ascend, terminate in the pointed coronoid
                    process, to which the tendon of the temporal muscle is fixed, unless at its
                    outer surface, which is covered by the masseter. The condyloid process,
                    separated from this by the sigmoid notch, is broad transversely, and is
                    contracted below so as to form a neck, which is concave within for the insertion
                    of the external pterygoid muscle.</p>
                <p>The inferior margin, which is obtusely rounded, and forms a more pointed curve
                    than the upper, gives attachment only to the cutaneous muscle <hi rend="italic"
                    >(platysma myoides).</hi> The posterior margin, also obtuse, is free, but
                    corresponds to the parotid gland, and is therefore occasionally named the
                    parotid margin. To this the stylo-maxillary ligament is attached.</p>
                <p>The posterior part of the bone, named the <hi rend="italic">ramus,</hi> forms
                    with its body an obtuse angle of about 100°, which diminishes as life advances.
                    (Fig. 8, a, r.)</p>
                <p>The inferior maxillary bone is connected movably with the temporal bone by its
                    condyloid process being lodged in the glenoid cavity of the latter. In this
                    situation it is retained by means of three ligaments, while its motions are
                    facilitated by an interarticular fibro-cartilage.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">external</hi> ligament, composed of parallel fibres
                    attached to the tubercle at the bifurcation of the zygomatic process, descends
                    obliquely backwards, and is fixed to the outside of the neck of the condyle of
                    the lower jaw. It is covered by skin and the parotid gland, and is lined by
                    synovial membrane, to part of which the interarticular cartilage is attached.
                    The <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> ligament, attached to the spinous process of
                    the sphenoid bone and its vicinity, proceeds obliquely downwards and forwards,
                    between the two pterygoid muscles, expanding, to the orifice of the internal
                    maxillary hole, round which it is attached.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stylo-maxillary</hi> ligament is an aponeurotic chord,
                    belonging rather to the <hi rend="italic">stylo-glossus</hi> muscle, stretching
                    between the styloid process and the tip of the angle of the lower jaw, where it
                    is inserted between the masseter muscle without, and the internal pterygoid
                    within.</p>
                <p>This articulation is so constructed that it possesses two synovial membranes, or
                    at least a double one, the parts of which are separated by the interarticular
                    cartilage. The latter body, which is of an oval shape, convex and concave above,
                    to fit at once the glenoid cavity and the transverse process, but concave below
                    for the maxillary condyle, adheres externally to the external ligament, while
                    its inner margin is free. The upper division of the synovial membrane,
                    therefore, adhering all round to the margins of the glenoid cavity and
                    transverse process, after covering these parts, is reflected from the external
                    lateral ligament over the upper surface of the interarticular fibro-cartilage. A
                    minute slip may be then traced over the free margin of this fibro-carti]age,
                    covering its lower surface, and thence continued over the inside of the external
                    lateral ligament, and from it over the condyle of the lower jaw. In this manner
                    the temporo∙maxillary synovial membrane is rather composed of two parts, a
                    superior and inferior, than absolutely double.</p>
                <p>The inferior maxillary bone is formed in two pieces; and perhaps no bone in the
                    human body undergoes from first to last greater changes in shape and extent than
                    it does. In the foetus, when first formed, it consists of two slightly
                    incurvated portions, united on the mesial plane by cartilage, with the coronoid
                    and condyloid process, and the intermediate sigmoid notch, rising from the
                    posterior extremity of each. The <hi rend="italic">ramus,</hi> however, cannot
                    be said to be formed; and it is only some time after birth that the
                    quadrilateral surface by which it is defined can be recognised. At birth, also,
                    the alveolar arch consists only of two thin plates of bone, with scarcely
                    perceptible traces of <hi rend="italic">septa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    the periosteal coverings of the dentiferoυs sacs are in immediate contact with
                    each other. After birth, bone is deposited between them, so as to form the
                    transverse partitions of the <hi rend="italic">alveoli,</hi> which afterwards
                    increase in size and thickness with the bone itself, which enlarges in all its
                    dimensions chiefly by extending backwards. Coalescing by the progress of
                    ossification on the mesial plane, it is a few weeks afterbirth consolidated into
                    one bone; and after the process of primary dentition commences, it loses the
                    angular and acquires the parabolic shape. About the age of seven, sometimes
                    previously, the body becomes more incurvated, and the posterior extremities
                    enlarge backwards still more rapidly. As the process of secondary dentition
                    advances, these extremities enlarge still more rapidly; and the angle of the jaw
                    acquires a more prominent situation by becoming more depressed. At the time at
                    which the facial and maxillary sinuses are formed, and the superior maxillary
                    bone extends backwards to form its tuberosity, the posterior extremity gradually
                    rises in the form of the <hi rend="italic">ramus,</hi> till this part a year or
                    two after puberty is fully an inch above the plane of the alveolar arch. During
                    adolescence and middle life this is the condition of the jaw-bone. Towards the
                    decline, however, the teeth drop out, and the alveolar processes are absorbed;
                    and in old age the lower jaw consists often of a single cylindrical arch of bone
                    placed between its two <hi rend="italic">rami,</hi> which, retaining their
                    original breadth and height, necessarily throw the body of the bone forwards
                    beyond the upper alveolar arch.</p>
                <p>The lower jaw-bone consists of two plates of compact bone, with cancellated
                    tissue interposed, and traversed by the inferior dental canal, the walls of
                    which, like the surface of the bone, are compact. This canal is subdivided into
                    two parts,—one inferior, which terminates in the anterior mental hole,
                    transmitting the mental branch of the inferior maxillary nerve; the other
                    superior, which is parted into numerous minute passages into the <hi

                    cancellated structure. Externally their bony walls are perforated by numerous
                    minute well-defined holes, into which, in the recent state, the vessels and
                    filaments of the alveolar periosteum penetrate. These orifices are so numerous
                    in both maxillary bones, that a portion of alveolar process held between the eye
                    and the light seems entirely perforated, and, if injected, becomes completely
                    red. This character applies chiefly to the period of youth and adolescence.
                    After this the alveolar processes become more solid, and eventually present much
                    fewer orifices. This structure is the result of the manner in which the bony
                    matter is deposited round the vessels and filaments of the periosteum, which may
                    in this and similar bones be said to communicate in this manner with those of
                    the medullary membrane.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The Teeth. (Dentes.)</hi></p>
                <p>The teeth, which are implanted in the alveolar cavities, though belonging
                    properly to the digestive apparatus as organs of mastication, are nevertheless
                    more conveniently considered in this place. (Plate XXVI. fig. 7, 8, and 9.)</p>
                <p>In every tooth are recognised three parts,—the crown <hi rend="italic"
                    >(corona),</hi> the neck or collar <hi rend="italic">(collum),</hi> and the root
                    <hi rend="italic">(radix).</hi> The first is the portion which appears above the
                    gum and alveolar process, and consists of a layer of enamel, thick above and
                    round the top, but gradually extenuated below, inclosing a small portion of
                    compact bone. The crown may be distinguished into the crown proper, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">summit</hi> or <hi rend="italic">apex</hi> of the tooth, and the
                    <hi rend="italic">fillet</hi> or annular portion of enamel <hi rend="italic"
                    >(annulus)</hi> by which the sides are surrounded. The root, which consists of
                    compact bone, is the part which is implanted in the alveolar cavity, and the
                    outer surface of which adheres to the inner or dental surface of the alveolar
                    periosteum, and above that to the soft part of the gum. The neck is the narrow
                    ring where the enamel ceases and the bone begins, and to which the gum adheres
                    all round. This part, in short, belongs neither to the crown nor to the root,
                    and perhaps is not justly entitled to any separate consideration, unless as the
                    portion to which the gum adheres. The crown and root, on the contrary, are
                    important, as furnishing the characters by which the teeth are distinguished
                    into classes.</p>
                <p>These are three,—the incisor or cutting teeth <hi rend="italic">(dentes</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tomici,</hi><hi rend="italic">incisores,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >primores, risorii, acuti, adversi)</hi>; the canine or tearing teeth <hi
                    rend="italic">(dentes</hi><hi rend="italic">canini, laniarii, cuspidati)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and the molar or grinding teeth <hi rend="italic"
                    >(dentes</hi><hi rend="italic">molares).</hi></p>
                <p>The incisors are in number eight, four in each jaw, and two on each side of the
                    mesial plane. All of them agree in having the crown or <hi rend="italic"
                    >apex</hi> wedge-shaped, or like a carpenter’s adze, convex before, and slightly
                    concave behind, with the cutting edge crenated or notched. From the edge, also,
                    which is broad, the fillet, which is quadrilateral, contracts much to the neck,
                    and the root is bevelled in the opposite direction to that of the crown, so as
                    to form a quadrilateral prism, and slightly acuminated. It is always simple and
                    elongated. Its extremity presents an orifice communicating with the interior of
                    the tooth, and admitting the vessels by which it is nourished. The crown is
                    separated from the root by a narrow line, varying in position in the different
                    kinds of incisors.</p>
                <p>The incisors of the upper jaw are broader, thicker, longer, and in general more
                    powerful, than those of the lower, and their axes are directed downwards and
                    forwards so as to overlap in the motions of the lower jaw those of the inferior
                    row, and leave a triangular interval with the base upwards. Their cutting edge
                    also is oblique, so that its mesial angle is longer than its external; and their
                    roots are larger and rounder. The central or middle incisors are larger,
                    broader, and stronger, than the lateral ones.</p>
                <p>The incisors of the lower jaw are smaller than those of the upper, and their axes
                    are directed upwards and backwards, so that they are within the superior
                    incisors. The central incisors also are larger than the lateral ones.</p>
                <p>The canine or pointed teeth <hi rend="italic">(dentes</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cuspidati)</hi> are four in number, one in each half of each alveolar arch,
                    immediately next to the lateral incisors. These teeth are distinguished by
                    prominent, thick crowns, with rounded convex fillets and pointed apices. The
                    root also, which, like that of the incisors, is simple, is larger and thicker
                    than in the latter. The upper canine teeth, which occasionally are named
                    eye-teeth <hi rend="italic">(ocularii</hi><hi rend="italic">dentes),</hi> are
                    the longest and most prominent of all. During the elevation of the lower jaw,
                    each inferior canine tooth is interior to the superior one, and is interposed
                    between it and the lateral incisor.</p>
                <p>Of die molar or grinders there are 20 altogether, being five in each half of each
                    alveolar arch. They are subdivided into two orders, small molar or bicuspid
                    teeth <hi rend="italic">(dentes bicuspidati),</hi> and large molar or
                    multicuspid teeth <hi rend="italic">(dentes multicuspidati).</hi></p>
                <p>The molar teeth agree in having large, broad crowns, with tubercular summits, and
                    roots, which, though occasionally single, are much more frequently two-fold,
                    threefold, or four-fold. The coronal tubercles are generally parted by a deep
                    furrow, which gradually becomes shallow as the summits wear in the progress of
                    years. When the roots are single, which is most frequent in the bicuspid order,
                    each lateral surface is marked by a longitudinal furrow. When two-fold or
                    manifold, they are parted by a fissure of variable width; and sometimes they
                    diverge considerably. The annular furrow between the crown and root is very
                    distinct.</p>
                <p>The axes of the upper molar teeth are directed outwards, while those of the lower
                    order, especially the most posterior, are directed inwards. More anteriorly they
                    are occasionally vertical.</p>
                <p>The two molar teeth next to the canine, which have smaller crowns and roots, and
                    are less in all their dimensions than the three posterior ones, are therefore
                    distinguished as small molars. From the circumstance of their crowns being
                    provided with two conical <hi rend="italic">apices,</hi> one anterior, large,
                    and the other posterior, parted by a transverse furrow, not dissimilar to the
                    summits of two canine teeth conjoined in one, they were denominated by John
                    Hunter bicuspid teeth <hi rend="italic">(bicuspidati).</hi> These teeth are
                    smaller than the canine, especially when their roots are single. The roots,
                    however, are often bifid, and sometimes trifid. In the first case they are
                    bevelled on the sides, and terminate in a point. In the second and third case
                    they are conical. The internal surface of the bicuspid teeth is very generally
                    narrower than the external, so that a transverse section would be trapezoidal,
                    with the narrow margin posterior.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> molar tooth, or the <hi rend="italic">first</hi>
                    large molar, is generally very large and strong, with the crown broad and
                    quadrilateral, surmounted by four, five, or more tubercles, and: the root trifid
                    or quadrifid and divergent in the upper tooth, more frequently bifid only and
                    divergent in the lower. The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> large molar tooth,
                    though rarely so large as the first, has the same general shape; the crown
                    rhomboidal in the upper jaw, with four apices, and the root bifid or trifid and
                    divergent.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">third</hi> large molar, named also wisdom-tooth <hi
                    rend="italic">(dens sapientice),</hi> from its late appearance, is smaller than
                    the second, generally has a narrower crown, rounded, oblong, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193039962?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-9962-0781"/> quadrilateral,
                    or rhomboidal, with two or three apices, and a narrow root generally single and
                    conical, often in- ' complete. Its axis is strongly directed inwards, especially
                    ‘in the upper jaw.</p>
                <p>The orders of teeth now enumerated constitute arches of a parabolic or
                    semielliptical shape, larger in general in the upper jaw than in the lower. In
                    the upper arch especially, the curvature is more rounded or elliptical; in the
                    lower it is more angular and parabolic,—a circumstance which, with the different
                    directions of the axes of the incisor and molar teeth respectively, causes the
                    upper incisors to overlap, and thereby cut upon the lower ones, while the molars
                    are fitted to each other so as to move on mutual surfaces in the lateral motion
                    of the jaw.</p>
                <p>The teeth vary ĩn number, shape, and position.</p>
                <p>Though the general number of the adult or permanent teeth is 16 in each jaw, or
                    32 in all, it may happen that, in consequence of all the wisdom-teeth not coming
                    through the gum, there are only 28 or 30. Occasionally also the lateral incisors
                    are wanting. In some rare instances there is a supernumerary incisor or molar
                    tooth; and Soemmering mentions an instance in which, by the addition of four
                    molar teeth, the total number was augmented to 36. The union of two or more
                    teeth into one is occasionally observed.</p>
                <p>The most usual variations in shape are observed in the incisors being excessively
                    large and broad, in the canine being very thick and long, ascending into the <hi
                    rend="italic">antrum,</hi> and in some rare instances extremely small. In
                    females the canine teeth are occasionally so small and rounded, that they have
                    the appearance rather of rudiments than of perfect teeth. The cleft roots of the
                    molar teeth are liable to very great varieties in shape.</p>
                <p>The most usual variety in position is when the incisors are placed obliquely,
                    with their margins not lateral but antero-posterior. This is in general the
                    result of the teeth being too much crowded in a small alveolar arch; and the
                    malposition is always greatest as the jaw is narrow, or imperfectly formed. One
                    or two incisors even in such circumstances may be entirely behind or before the
                    rest, so as to give the appearance of a double row. The canine teeth are liable
                    to the same change of position; but one greatly more frequent with them is, to
                    be placed so much before the line of the arch as to project considerably
                    forwards, like the tusks of some animals. Another form of this variety is, when
                    teeth appear in unusual situations, for instance the palate or pharynx, or even
                    in the orbit.</p>
                <p>The teeth are not at all periods of life the same in number. Generally speaking,
                    at birth, when the teeth have not appeared above the gum, the rudiments of five
                    teeth are found in each half alveolar arch. These, which are to constitute the
                    milk-teeth, the deciduous or temporary, appear above the gum nearly in the
                    following order: the central incisors of the lower jaw about the end of the
                    sixth or beginning of the seventh month; a few weeks after, the central incisors
                    of the upper jaw; after these, the lateral incisors above or below, without
                    determinate order; and between the 12th and 18th months the first pair of
                    molars, either above or below. These are followed by the lower canine teeth, and
                    about the second year by the upper Canine teeth. About the end of the second
                    year, or in the course of the third, the second pair of molar teeth cut the gum;
                    and about the fourth or fifth year in general, the third pair of molar teeth
                    appear. The following table of tlιe periods at which the different classes of
                    temporary-teeth appear, given by Mr Thomas Bell, may communicate a general idea
                    of the succession.</p>
                <p>From 5 to 8 months, the 4 central incisors.</p>
                <p>From 7 to 10 the 4 lateral incisors.</p>
                <p>From 12 to 16 the 4 anterior molars.</p>
                <p>From 14 to 20 the 4 canine.</p>
                <p>From 18 to 36 the 4 posterior molars.</p>
                <p>From these periods, however, there are extensive exceptions; and in no two
                    individuals even of the same family does the same tooth appear at the same
                    period.</p>
                <p>About the seventh month the milk-teeth begin to appear above the gum; and about
                    the seventh year they begin to be shed and succeeded by the permanent set. This
                    process begins also in the lower jaw, and advances nearly in the same order: the
                    lower central incisors; the upper, and the lateral above and below; the first
                    pair of molar upper and lower; the second pair of molar above and below; the
                    canine above and below; the third pair of molar; the fourth pair of molar in the
                    eighteenth year; and the fifth pair, or wisdom-teeth, in the eighteenth,
                    twentieth, or thirtieth years.</p>
                <p>The average periods of eruption in the lower jaw are given in the tabular form by
                    Mr Thomas Bell, in the following order.</p>
                <p>The anterior larger molars 6 į years.</p>
                <p>The central incisors 7</p>
                <p>The lateral incisors 8</p>
                <p>The anterior bicuspids 9</p>
                <p>The posterior bicuspids 10</p>
                <p>The canine or cuspidati 11—12</p>
                <p>The second large molars 12—13</p>
                <p>The third large molars, or wisdom-teeth 17—19</p>
                <p>Those of the upper jaw are understood to follow these at an interval of two or
                    three months.</p>
                <p>In structure the teeth of the human subject belong to the order of simple teeth,
                    that is, consist of bone, invested at the crown by enamel.</p>
                <p>The hyoid bone <hi rend="italic">(os hyoïdes,</hi><hi rend="italic">υ,
                    ossa</hi><hi rend="italic">lingualia),</hi> though entirely unconnected with the
                    skeleton, yet as a bone to which are attached various muscles of the throat,
                    must be noticed in this place. It is a bone, or rather a bony apparatus,
                    consisting of five separate pieces, arranged in the parabolic form, and
                    articulated movably with each other. These five pieces are, one middle, two
                    lateral, and two pisiform bones.</p>
                <p>The middle <hi rend="italic">(os medium linguce),</hi> named also the body, is
                    large, broad, and square, with the anterior surface in general convex and rough,
                    divided by a middle ridge into right and left halves, and by a horizontal line
                    into upper and lower parts, and giving attachment on each side of the middle
                    crest to the digastric, the stylo-hyoid, the mylo-hyoid, the genio-hyoid, and
                    the hyoglossal muscles. The posterior surface is concave and smooth, and covered
                    by cellular tissue, connecting it to the epiglottis. To its inferior margin,
                    which is more extensive and irregular than the superior, are attached externally
                    the sternohyoid, the omo-hyoid, and the thyro-hyoid muscles; and in the middle
                    the thyro-hyoid membrane. To its upper margin the fibres of the <hi
                    rend="italic">hyoglossus</hi> are attached. Each of the lateral margins is
                    moulded into a convex cartilaginous surface, articulated with the lateral
                    bones.</p>
                <p>The lateral bones <hi rend="italic">(ossa lateralia, cornua),</hi> though longer,
                    are less thick than the body. Broad and thick before, with the upper surface
                    concave and the lower convex, narrow behind, they terminate in a round head,
                    tipped with cartilage, to which the thyro-hyoid ligament is attached. At the
                    anterior junction nearly of these with the middle portion, there is attached to
                    the latter on each side a small elongated bone, somewhat hooked. These bones,
                    which seldom exceed the size of a grain of wheat, or rye rather, and which they
                    somewhat resemble in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193039975?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-9975-0782"/> shape, are articulated to the other two by a true
                    capsular ligament. To their outer surface are attached some fibres of the <hi
                    rend="italic">genio-glossus,</hi> and to their upper is fixed the stylo-hyoid
                    ligament.</p>
                <p>The hyoid bone consists externally of compact, and internally of cancellated
                    tissue, the latter being most abundant in the middle piece. Though composed in
                    the infant and young subject of five portions, the articulations are invariably
                    obliterated by ankylosis in adult life, and they are converted into a single
                    bone. The junction of the middle and lateral portions is effected first, and
                    that of the pisiform bones afterwards.</p>
                <p>The bones now described, excepting the lower jaw and hyoid, are united immovably,
                    or by <hi rend="italic">synarthrosis.</hi> The external shape of the cranium is
                    that of an oblong spheroid, or an ovoid, with the small diameter before. Convex
                    in general, it is flattened laterally in the temporal regions, and below in the
                    base. The external surface, smooth and regular above, is marked below by
                    muscular impressions, and penetrated by numerous holes.</p>
                <p>The first objects deserving attention are the serrated lines of junction, or what
                    are named the sutures <hi rend="italic">(suturoe),</hi> which are in general
                    more conspicuous externally than internally, where indeed they are effaced at an
                    earlier period of life than on the outer surface of the scull. The sutures may
                    be most easily understood by tracing them from the sphenoid bone, which may be
                    regarded as the central point of the cranium.</p>
                <p>The first line is that which passes transversely across at the junction of the
                    sphenoid with the ethmoid and superior turbinated bones in the middle, and the
                    frontal bone on each side. Concave in the middle, this line bends backward at
                    each extremity, where it follows the outline of the small wings of Ingrassias.
                    It constitutes the transverse or sphenoidal suture.</p>
                <p>The posterior margin of the body of the sphenoid bone is marked by another
                    transverse suture, extremely short, and uniting it with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cuneiform</hi> process of the occipital bone. This, which is early obliterated
                    by the indissoluble union of the sphenoid and occipital bones, is a
                    cartilaginous junçtion, afterwards ossified, and, though scarcely entitled to
                    the epithet, is named nevertheless the <hi rend="italic">basilar
                    suture.</hi></p>
                <p>A more distinct one is found in the line between the exterior concave margin of
                    the large wing of Ingrassias and the squamous portion of the temporal bone in
                    the <hi rend="italic">spheno-temporal suture.</hi> It terminates below at the
                    glenoid fissure, forming an acute angle with a short line between the pyramid
                    and the posterior margin of the spinous process of the sphenoid, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">petrosphenoidal.</hi> Above, where it terminates on the parietal
                    bone, a short line, between the outer margin of the large wing of Ingrassias and
                    short spaces of the parietal and frontal bones, is distinguished as the <hi
                    rend="italic">lateral sphenoidal</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">spheno-parietal
                    suture.</hi></p>
                <p>This line, produced backwards between the upper margin of the temporal and the
                    lower margin of the parietal bone, constitutes a peculiar form of junction,
                    named the squamous suture <hi rend="italic">(sutura</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >squamosa),</hi> the temporal, or the temporo-parietal, in which the edge of the
                    former bone is imbricated over that of the latter. In this mode of junction,
                    which is confined to the superior part of the temporal bone, and in which the
                    union of the bones is not secured by dove-tail ossification, but simple
                    imposition, the lateral pressure is effected chiefly by the force propagated
                    from the <hi rend="italic">zygoma</hi> and the malar bone.</p>
                <p>The posterior part, which is united to the posteriorinferior angle of the
                    parietal, and the anterior-inferior margin of the occipital, presents a serrated
                    line, with alternate indentations, which are well marked, but irregular in size.
                    This, which occasionally presents Wormian bones, may be named the <hi
                    rend="italic">posterior-temporal suture.</hi> The descending portion has been
                    distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic">mastoid suture.</hi> Anteriorly,
                    in the base of the cranium, where it passes the jugular notch, the line of
                    junction, which is cartilaginous, is termed the <hi rend="italic"
                    >petro-occipital suture.</hi></p>
                <p>The sutures now enumerated agree in being found chiefly at the lower region of
                    the cranium, and in securing the junctions of its base. The others to be yet
                    enumerated belong to its superior region, and agree in consolidating and
                    securing the several arches which constitute what may be named the <hi
                    rend="italic">vault</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">cranium.</hi></p>
                <p>From the point at which the posterior, temporal, and mastoid sutures unite, a
                    serrated line of junction ascends on each side to the common point at which the
                    occipital and parietal bones meet. From the angular junction formed by the two
                    limbs of this suture, it is known under the name of <hi rend="italic">lambdoidal
                    (∆,</hi><hi rend="italic">sutura</hi><hi rend="italic">lambdoidalis)</hi>; and
                    from its situation it is termed the occipital and occipito-parietal suture. By
                    mutual indentations, which are always distinct, it joins firmly the parietal and
                    occipital bones; and it is the most frequent seat of Wormian bones.</p>
                <p>From the angle of the lambdoidal suture a similar serrated line proceeds, uniting
                    the two parietal bones on the mesial plane, with equally distinct indentations.
                    The mode in which this stretches between the lambdoidal and coronal sutures,
                    bearing some remote resemblance to an arrow on the drawn bow-string, has
                    procured it the name of the sagittal <hi rend="italic">(sutura</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sagittalis).</hi> In youth and in early life these two sutures are
                    distinct; but in advanced age they are more or less, sometimes entirely,
                    obliterated.</p>
                <p>In some craniums the sagittal suture is continued along the frontal bone to the
                    nasal spine, thus parting the bone in two lateral halves. This, which
                    constitutes the proper <hi rend="italic">frontal</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >median</hi> suture, is the remains of the original separation of the bone.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Lastly,</hi> Between the frontal bone before, and the parietal
                    bones behind, is seen a serrated line crossing the cranium transversely, the
                    whole breadth between the two sphenoid bones. This, which is named the <hi
                    rend="italic">coronal</hi> suture, presents large indentations on each side and
                    small ones in the middle, on the external table, and a converse arrangement on
                    the internal.</p>
                <p>By these sutures the bones forming the vault of the cranium are firmly secured;
                    and each bone is made to press against the other so as to augment rather than
                    diminish strength.</p>
                <p>The external surface of the cranium may be distinguished into four regions, a
                    superior, an inferior, and two lateral ones.</p>
                <p>The superior region, or the vault, is bounded before and behind by the nasal and
                    occipital protuberances, and on each side by the temporal arches. It presents,
                    besides the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoidal sutures, the superciliary arches,
                    the frontal, parietal, and occipital protuberances, and the parietal holes. It
                    is covered by the epicranial muscle and its <hi rend="italic"
                    >aponeurosis.</hi></p>
                <p>The inferior region or base, which maybe defined from the occipital protuberance
                    behind to the nasal spine before, is free as far as the pterygoid processes of
                    the sphenoid bone, anterior to which it is joined to the bones of the face.</p>
                <p>In the posterior portion are seen the occipital spine and muscular impressions,

                    in the recent subject. Before these objects, and nearly in the same transverse
                    line, are seen the anterior half of the glenoid cavity of the temporal bone, the
                    guttural orifice of the Eustachian tube, the spinous and elliptical holes of the
                    sphenoid (Plate XXIV. fig. 5), and the pterygoid processes.</p>
                <p>• The anterior portion presents the crest or azygos process united with the vomer
                    and ethmoidal plate, the sphenoidal· sinuses, the ethmoidal bone itself, and the

                <p>The lateral regions of the cranium are nearly of an elliptical shape. Each region
                    may bc circumscribed by a line drawn from the mastoid process backwards to the
                    union of the temporal and mastoid sutures, then following the semicircular arch

                    in this region are the posterior mastoid hole, the mastoid process, the

                    where it is obtuse, and the external angular ridge of the frontal bone, where it
                    becomes acute. To this line, the <hi rend="italic">zygoma,</hi> and the malar
                    bone, the fascia of the temporal muscle is firmly attached; the muscular fibres
                    adhere to the bone below as far as the line of the sphenoid bone, and pass
                    downwards under the <hi rend="italic">zygoma.</hi> The whole region, though
                    convex in early life, becomes less so in adolescence, and in manhood and
                    advanced age it is flattened and even hollowed.</p>
                <p>The internal surface of the cranium, lined by the <hi rend="italic">dura

                <p>In the former, which is a regular spheroidal concave, the chief peculiarities
                    are, on the mesial plane, the frontal crest, the sagittal groove for the

                    and the internal occipital spine and protuberance. (Plate XXIV. fig. 6.)</p>
                <p>Of the lateral halves, the anterior or frontal region is bounded before by an
                    indistinct curved line, formed by the vertical with the horizontal table of the
                    frontal bone, and behind by the sphenoidal arch. In this, which is named the <hi

                <p>Between the sphenoidal arch before, and the posterior margin of the temporal
                    pyramid behind, is contained a cavity shaped like a spherical segment. In this,

                <p>Between the temporal pyramid and the internal occipital spine is contained the
                    posterior or temporo-occipital hollow <hi rend="italic">(fossa
                    temporo-occipitalis),</hi> which is further subdivided into two cavities, the
                    cerebral above, and the cerebellic below. From the posterior margin of the

                    a superior for lodging the posterior lobe of the brain, and an inferior or
                    cerebellic for lodging the lobes of the cerebellum. In the anterior or
                    cerebellic division is seen the posterior surface of the pyramid, with the
                    internal auditory hole, the orifice of the cochlear aqueduct, the groove for the
                    lateral sinus terminating in the jugular opening, the groove of the inferior
                    petrous sinus, and the mastoid hole and suture. The only object behind is the
                    posterior cerebral <hi rend="italic">fossa,</hi> traversed by the lambdoidal
                    suture.</p>
                <p>In the foetus the cranial bones inclosed between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pericranium</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dura mater,</hi> which are thick, soft,
                    and vascular, are incomplete shells not in contact with each other, with
                    prominent and rather thick ossifie centres, from which the osseous radii
                    diverge, and terminate in thin, ciliated margins. At birth, and for some weeks
                    after, though ossification is far advanced, the margins of the bones are
                    incomplete, so as to form the open spaces denominated fontanelles. Of these
                    there are six at the period of birth; the anterior or rhomboidal between the
                    frontal and parietal bones; the posterior or triangular between the occipital
                    and parietal bones; two lateral anterior between the parietal, sphenoidal, and
                    temporal bones; and two posterior lateral between the parietal, temporal, and
                    occipital bones, both of irregular shape. At these points the motions of the
                    brain are distinctly felt.</p>
                <p>At the same time the bones have not yet acquired their serrated margins, so that
                    the places of the sutures, which are not yet formed, are occupied by narrow
                    grooves between the cranial bones. As ossification advances, however, their
                    fimbriated margins extend, and mutually meeting, are prolonged so as to be
                    indented into each other by alternate notches and processes. At the same time
                    the bones acquire thickness, so that a distinct space is perceived between the
                    external and internal surface of each. The alternate processes and notches thus
                    acquire firmness, and are immovably dovetailed into each other. In this manner
                    the anterior angles of the parietal bones unite with the frontal, and between
                    the posterior ones the apex of the occipital bone is gradually mortised.</p>
                <p>In some instances, however, where the ossifie centre of the original bone appears
                    deficient in energy, or tardy in progress, a new centre may be developed in the
                    line of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040001?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0001-0784"/> junction, while the bones are still much apart.
                    Thus, be- <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> tween the occipital and parietal bones,
                    or between the occipital and temporal bones, may be developed new centres, from
                    which ossification advances, as from the principal points, towards the
                    circumference; and by the successive deposition of bony matter, the margins
                    begin to meet those of the primary bones. The process of mutual indentation
                    takes place exactly in the same manner as with the primary bones; and by this
                    means secondary bones are formed in the lines of the sutures.</p>
                <p>The period at which the cranium is entirely ossified varies in different
                    individuals. In general the anterior or fronto-parietal fontanelle, which is the
                    largest, is ossified at the end of the 18th or 20th month, while the anterior
                    and posterior lateral are closed at an earlier period. In some instances,
                    however, between the parietal and frontal bones a small space is left till the
                    6th or 7th year; and in many persons the part continues depressed and tender for
                    the greater part of life. The sutures are completed at the same time, and are
                    always distinctly formed by the 10th or 11th year. A few years after, they
                    become more consolidated, and, as the bones acquire thickness and density by the
                    compactness of the external and internal tables, are firmly wedged into each
                    other. The spheno-basilar junction generally remains soft and separable till
                    adult age, when by its union the sphenoid and occipital bones are converted into
                    a single piece. Some time afterwards the sphenoid is united with the ethmoid,
                    the two parietals are converted into one, and occasionally one or both are
                    united to the frontal bone. In advanced age many of the sutures disappear
                    entirely, at least in one surface of the cranium, generally the internal first;
                    and the cranium would be converted into a single bone if life were continued
                    sufficiently long.</p>
                <p>In shape and dimensions the cranium varies at different periods of life. After
                    ossification is completed in the child, the prominence of the ossifie points,
                    which continue more or less conspicuous till manhood and the formation of the
                    frontal sinuses, gives it a cubo-spheroidal shape. Its section is an oval or two
                    hemispheroidal segments, the anterior being the smallest. At this period the
                    parietal tuberosities and the occipital eminence are prominent, the frontal bone
                    is vaulted, and the high open forehead communicates to the countenance an
                    expression of beauty and simplicity which are always associated with the early
                    and middle periods of life. In the progress of years, however, these prominences
                    become less distinct, partly by the operation of muscular action, partly by the
                    uniform rising and swelling of the margins of all the bones; and the anterior
                    upper and posterior part acquires a uniform spheroidal or vaulted appearance,
                    while the lateral regions are flattened by the action of the temporal muscle.
                    The occipital region also below the spine is flattened, and occasionally
                    excavated; so that while thespine isprominent and unciform, the base is
                    excavated, and overhung by the mastoid processes and the semilunar ridges. The
                    aged scull is thus distinguished by a general rotundity or ovoidal character,
                    unless in the temples, which are flat and hollow; and the convex but
                    occasionally depressed forehead indicates in some degree the transition from
                    youth to age.</p>
                <p>The dimensions of the cranium are estimated from its diameters, longitudinal,
                    transverse, and vertical. The first, which extends from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >foramen</hi><hi rend="italic">caecum</hi> of the frontal bone, is about five
                    inches at an average. The largest transverse diameter, which extends between the
                    bases of the temporal pyramids, is about 4⅜ inches; and a smaller one between
                    the extremities of the two small sphenoidal wings is about 3 inches and 9 lines.
                    The longest vertical diameter, which is between the anterior margin of the
                    occipital hole and the middle of the sagittal suture, varies from 4 inches to 4
                    inches and 3 lines. From these measurements it results, that the most capacious
                    part of the scull is nearly at the union of the two anterior thirds with the
                    posterior, viz. the level of the occipital hole and basilar groove; and that the
                    ovoidal or oblong-spheroidal is the most general shape. The variations from this
                    shape are found chiefly in the vault, which may be flattened, oblong, cuboidal,
                    or conical.</p>
                <p>The Asio-European may be regarded as the best and most symmetrical shape, and to
                    this most of the European <hi rend="italic">crania</hi> belong. According to
                    Soemmering, the Belgic scull is the most oblong-globular, the German and Italian
                    spherical, and the Turkish the most spherical of the European. In this country
                    the most usual shape is the oblong-spheroidal, especially among the inhabitants
                    of England. Among an extensive collection of sculls preserved in the Museum of
                    the University of Edinburgh, and believed to be chiefly Parisian, the prevalent
                    shape is the oblong-spheroidal, and the globular, or the general spherical
                    shape, with large transverse diameter approaching to the longitudinal. From the
                    delineations given by Sandifort (<hi rend="italic">Museum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomicum,</hi> tom. ii.), the English appears most prominent in the occipital
                    region, the French the most vertical forehead, and the Italian most elevated in
                    the vertical region, and most prominent between the parietal tuberosities. The
                    scull of the Swede approaches the cubo-spheroidal, and that of the Russ is
                    distinguished chiefly for the vertical front, considerable transverse width, and
                    large cheekbones. The latter appear not to be peculiar to the Scotish
                    cranium.</p>
                <p>Of the Asiatic craniums, the Tartar has the forehead large, not much arched, the
                    occipital region large, the nasal bones descending straight from the frontal,
                    the upper maxillary bone slightly overhanging the lower, and the chin prominent.
                    That of the Calmuc has the vertical, occipital, and parietal regions prominent,
                    the frontal bone and face flattened, the cheek-bones large, and the alveolar
                    arches and jaws broad and prominent. The Mongolian is distinguished by the
                    narrow forehead, flattened and rather depressed glabellar and nasal regions,
                    great facial width between the cheek-bones, and prominent upper jaw.</p>
                <p>From the observations of Blumenbach and Soemmering it results, that the ancient
                    Egyptian or Coptic head, as exemplified in mummies,belongs to the European class
                    of craniums. The negro head, on the contrary, is distinguished for its oblique
                    forehead, compressed sides, prominent jaws, general wedged shape, and large size
                    compared with the rest of the skeleton. For more minute information on these
                    varieties, the reader will consult with advantage the work of Soemmering (tom.
                    i.), and the <hi rend="italic">Decades</hi><hi rend="italic">Craniorum</hi> of
                    Blumenbach.</p>
                <p>In shape the face forms an irregular hexahedron, with a large excavation at its
                    lower region for the mouth and pharynx. Its anterior surface is trapezoidal,
                    with the short side below; its sides trapezoidal, with the short side formed by
                    the posterior margin of the maxillary <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and its upper surface is an oblique parallelogram.</p>
                <p>The greatest transverse diameter is between the zygomatic angles of the
                    cheek-bones, varying from 4∣ to 5 inches; its smallest at the symphysis of the
                    lower jaw, from <hi rend="italic">lį</hi> to 2 or 2∣ inches; and on the extent
                    and prominence of which depends the general oval shape of the countenance. The
                    height, measured from the glabella to the triangular process of the lower jaw,
                    varies from 4∣ to 4 inches 9 lines.</p>
                <p>The direction of the face varies according to the position of the lower jaw. When
                    this is horizontal, the racial plane forms with it an angle of 60°, or deviates
                    30° from <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040014?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0014-0785"/> the vertical plane; and in some tribes, as the
                    negro, this deviation is still greater. A more important character, ' however,
                    is believed to be found by determining the direction of the face in relation to
                    that of the cranium, or ascertaining what Camper denominates the <hi
                    rend="italic">facial angle.</hi> This he proposes to fix by drawing one line
                    from the frontonasal protuberance to the spine of the upper maxillary bone,— <hi
                    rend="italic">doe facial</hi><hi rend="italic">(linea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >facialis)</hi>; another transversely between the external ear-holes; and from
                    the latter a third line <hi rend="italic">(linea horizontalis),</hi> drawn at
                    right angles to meet the first. The angle thus formed by the facial and
                    horizontal lines, which is termed the facial, indicates the comparative
                    prominence of the cranium and face. In European heads generally it is about 80°;
                    in the negro it is not above 70°; and in the Mongolian, which is intermediate,
                    it is about 75°. The effect of this angle in giving the countenance intellectual
                    expression, the nearer it approaches to the rectangle, was known to the
                    ancients. In many of the busts of heroes it is almost 90°, and in those of
                    divinities 100°; and as we know that this is much more rectangular than any
                    specimen of the human scull furnishes, it may be inferred that it is
                    imaginary.</p>
                <p>It may be further observed, that in the infant the facial angle approaches to
                    90°, in consequence of the small relative developement of the face. Towards
                    boyhood and puberty, when the face acquires greater size and prominence, it
                    diminishes to 85° aņd 80° successively. (Cuvier, Bichat.)</p>
                <p>The face is subdivided into cranial, facial, zygomatic, and palato-maxillary
                    regions. It is unnecessary to enumerate again the objects found in these several
                    regions; but it is requisite to consider shortly the cavities which are formed
                    by the cranio-facial bones. They consist of tlιe nasal cavities, the orbits, the
                    tympanal cavity, and the palato-maxillary region. These cavities are
                    distinguished by the following circumstances. All of them communicate mutually,
                    and are covered by fibro-mucous membrane, also continuous. In each of them is
                    lodged one of the organs of special sensation; and each communicates with the
                    cranial cavity by openings, through which nerves always, and sometimes vessels,
                    are transmitted. Lastly, these cavities may be regarded as the points by which
                    the cutaneous surface communicates directly with the mucous membrane of the
                    gastro-pulmonary organs.</p>
                <p>The nasal cavities <hi rend="italic">(cavum nasale,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nares),</hi> of an irregular quadrilateral shape, consist of four regions; the
                    upper, the lower, and two lateral. The first is bounded before by the nasal
                    bones, behind by the sphenoidal cells, with which it communicates, and above by
                    the cribriform plate; while its lower limit is a line uniting the inferior
                    margins of the lateral portions of the ethmoid bone. This is parted by the
                    vertical plate of the ethmoid bone into two halves, which are the two superior
                    passages <hi rend="italic">(meatus superior).</hi> The lower region is bounded
                    below by the palato-maxillary plate; on the sides by the maxillary, palate, and
                    inferior turbinated bones; above by a plane uniting the lower margins of these
                    bones, and is parted into two by the vomer, which opens before at the nasal
                    notch of the maxillary bones, and behind at the posterior margin of the palate
                    bones. This constitutes the lower passage <hi rend="italic">(meatus
                    inferior),</hi> at the anterior extremity of which the nasal canal opens. The
                    anterior part of the region presents on the mesial plane a vertical triangular
                    notch between the middle ethmoid plate above and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vomer</hi> below, occupied in the recent subject by the cartilaginous <hi
                    rend="italic">septum</hi> of the nose. The middle and lateral regions, which
                    communicate before by this notch, are separated behind by the ethmoid plate and
                    vomer, and are bounded above by the ethmoidal turbinated bone, and below by the
                    maxillary turbinated bone. This constitutes the middle canal <hi rend="italic"
                    >(meatus</hi><hi rend="italic">medius),</hi><hi rend="italic">m</hi> which the
                    frontal and maxillary sinuses open.</p>
                <p>These cavities communicate freely with each other; and their parietes are covered
                    by continuations of the same general fibro-mucous membrane. Their use appears to
                    be to increase the extent without adding to the weight of die facial bones, to
                    afford great superficial extent to the nasal membrane as an organ of smell, and
                    to afford a sonorous vault to the organ of voice.</p>
                <p>These cavities, and their appendages, do not exist in the foetus, nor for some
                    time after birth. The ethmoidal and sphenoidal are early formed; and the
                    maxillary sinus begins to be manifest some months after birth. After the primary
                    dentition they enlarge, and rapidly after the second; and towards the approach
                    of puberty, when the maxillary tuberosity is formed, they increase, and speedily
                    attain their natural capacity.</p>
                <p>The orbits are two cavities, one on each side of the mesial plane, of the shape
                    of a quadrilateral pyramid, with the apex towards the cranial cavity, and the
                    base anteriorly. Each orbit presents a <hi rend="italic">vault</hi> formed by
                    the frontal bone, a <hi rend="italic">floor</hi> formed by the superior
                    maxillary, an internal wall formed by the palate bone, ethmoid, and lacrymal,
                    and an external wall formed by the malar and sphenoid bones. The two internal
                    walls are nearly parallel,—an arrangement which renders the axes of the orbits
                    convergent backwards, and indefinitely divergent before. The vault of the orbit
                    is so thin, that a pointed instrument easily penetrates; and a thrust in the
                    e^yeţ is invariably attended with severe, generally fatal, injury to the base of
                    the brain. The base of the orbits iş oblique, with the temporal margin behind
                    the plane of the nasal, making the eye more exposed without than on the mesial
                    side. The inner or nasal margin presents the upper orifice of the nasal canal.
                    At the posterior extremity of the inner wall is the optic hole; at the apex is
                    the sphenoidal fissure, which forms nearly a right angle with the
                    spheno-maxillary fissure below; and the floor is traversed by the superior
                    maxillary fissure and canal. The apex of the orbit is occupied by the optic
                    nerve, the third and fourth pair, the ophthalmic branch of the fifth, and the
                    sixth; and the origins of the six muscles of the eyeball, with interposed fat.
                    The base is occupied by the eyeball, surrounded with the tendinous extremities
                    of the muscles, the lacrymal gland at the external region of the vault, and the
                    lacrymal sac in the anterior depression of the nasal margin. To its margins are
                    attached the palpebral and the orbicular muscle. Each orbit communicates with
                    the nasal cavities by means of the nasal duct.</p>
                <p>The tympanal cavity, formed in the temporal bone, communicates by the Eustachian
                    tube with the posterior part of the nasal and palato-maxillary cavities. Its
                    further examination belongs to a subsequent head.</p>
                <p>The palato-maxillary cavity is formed by the palatine vault above, tlιe alveolar
                    arches and teeth before, by the lower jaw before and laterally, and behind by
                    the basilar process of the occipital bone and the pterygoid processes. It is
                    very irregular in shape, and consists of two regions, the palato-maxillary
                    proper and the pharyngeal. The principal objects deserving notice are the
                    incisive duct in the palatine vault, for the naso-palatine nerves; the
                    pterygo-palatine canal at its posterior angles, for the pterygopalatine
                    branches; and the posterior opening of the nasal cavities. The vault is covered
                    by periosteum and mucous membrane, with the <hi rend="italic">uvula</hi> or soft
                    palate suspended at its posterior margin; and the space inclosed by the lower
                    jaw contains the tongue, attached to the hyoid bone, sublingual and submaxillary
                    glands, and is completed by membrane, muscles, and integuments.</p>

                <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">The Thoracic Extremities.</hi></p>
                <p>The superior or thoracic extremities consist of the shoulder, the arm, the
                    fore-arm, the wrist, and the hand.</p>
                <p>The shoulder consists of two bones,—the <hi rend="italic">scapula or</hi>
                    shoulder-blade, and the clavicle or collar-bone.</p>
                <p>’ The <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> is a triangular bonc occupying the posterior
                    part of the chest, having a dorsal and a costal surface, and a superior, a
                    vertebral, and an axillary margin.</p>
                <p>The dorsal or posterior surface <hi rend="italic">(dorsum)</hi> is divided by a
                    transverse elevated spine into two parts, the <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">supraspinata</hi> for the <hi rend="italic">supraspinatus</hi>
                    muscle, and the <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">infraspinata</hi>
                    for the <hi rend="italic">infraspinatus</hi> muscle. The latter is concave
                    above, convex in the middle, and concave towards the axillary or external margin
                    <hi rend="italic">(costa),</hi> from which it is separated by a round line or
                    crest for the attachment of the fascia which separates the <hi rend="italic"
                    >infraspinatus</hi> from the <hi rend="italic">teres major</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">minor.</hi> Between this crest and the axillary margin above is a
                    convex surface, of a triangular shape, with the apex above, for the attachment
                    of the <hi rend="italic">teres minor,</hi> and below a flat quadrilateral
                    surface for the <hi rend="italic">teres major.</hi></p>
                <p>The spine is a triangular-shaped eminence, rising obliquely from the upper fourth
                    of the dorsal surface; low at the vertebral, elevated at the axillary margin,
                    where it terminates in a broad, flat surface, also triangular, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">acromion</hi> or shoulder-top. In the posterior margin of the
                    spine may generally be distinguished two surfaces separated by a ridge. Above
                    the ridge the <hi rend="italic">cucullaris</hi> is fixed; below, part of the
                    deltoid is attached; and between is a common aponeurosis. The ridge is biparted
                    towards the <hi rend="italic">acromion,</hi> leaving an interval covered by
                    periosteum and integuments only. The anterior part of the acromion presents a
                    cartilaginous facette, for articulation with the acromial end of the clavicle.
                    To its posterior and external margin the deltoid is attached, and to its tip the
                    acromio-coracoid ligament is fixed.</p>
                <p>• The costal or anterior surface is of a triangular shape, with the apex below,
                    generally concave, but subdivided into smaller spaces by two or more oblique
                    ridges, to which intermuscular <hi rend="italic">fasciae</hi> are attached. This
                    surface, which is the <hi rend="italic">subscapular fossa (venter),</hi> lodges
                    the belly of the subscapular muscle, the fasciculi of which are interposed
                    between the aponeurotic ridges. Near the vertebral margin is an irregular
                    surface, to which, and also to the margin, the <hi rend="italic">serratus
                    magnus</hi> is attached.</p>
                <p>The superior margin <hi rend="italic">(costa superior)</hi> is thin and pointed
                    behind, where the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi> and omohyoid muscles arc
                    attached, and becomes sinuous externally, with a notch converted by a ligament
                    into a hole for the transit of the suprascapular vessels and nerves. The inner
                    or axillary extremity terminates in an elevated hooked process, the coracoid, to
                    the tip of which are fixed the coraco-clavicular ligament, and the united origin
                    of the short head of the <hi rend="italic">biceps flexor</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">coraco-brachialis,</hi> to the anterior margin the small pectoral,
                    and to the posterior the acromio-coracoid ligament.</p>
                <p>The vertebral or posterior margin <hi rend="italic">(costa posterior, basis</hi>
                    of some authors) is thin, and ascends straight to the spine, giving attachment
                    to the <hi rend="italic">rhomboideus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then bends
                    forward, and forms with the superior an angle, to which, as also to the edge now
                    mentioned, the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi> is fixed.</p>
                <p>The axillary margin <hi rend="italic">(costa axillaris,</hi> sometimes <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior)</hi> is round and broad above, and narrow below. It
                    presents above, first the glenoid cavity, round at its lower margin, angular
                    above, hollow, covered by cartilage and synovial membrane for receiving the head
                    of the <hi rend="italic">humerus.</hi> At the angular point above is a surface
                    for the attachment of the long head of the <hi rend="italic">biceps flexor,</hi>
                    and the lower margin presents two tubercular eminences for that of the long head
                    of the <hi rend="italic">triceps extensor.</hi> Below this are fixed the <hi
                    rend="italic">teres minor,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">subscapularis,</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">teres major.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">latissimus
                    dorsi,</hi> passing over its lower angle, binds it down.</p>
                <p>The scapula consists chiefly of compact bone, with little cancellated matter
                    interposed. In the subscapular <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> this becomes
                    completely absorbed, rendering the bone thin and translucent, sometimes
                    perforated. The spine, processes, and angles contain cancellated matter. It is
                    formed from one part for the body of the bone, with <hi rend="italic"
                    >epiphyses</hi> for the coracoid process and the margins. Nutritious holes are
                    generally found in the angle formed by the spinc with the body, and in the
                    axillary margin.</p>
                <p>The collar bone or clavicle is a cylindrical bone, alternately incurvated like an
                    <hi rend="italic">f</hi> placed at the upper part of the chest, between the
                    sternum and acromion of the scapula. It has therefore two extremities, a sternal
                    and acromial, with intermediate body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">sternal</hi> end is triangular, cartilaginous, concave and
                    convex in opposite directions, surrounded by ligamentous insertions. The <hi
                    rend="italic">acromial</hi> end is flattened and recurved, presenting a lunated
                    surface for articulation with the acromion.</p>
                <p>The body, with the shape of a triangular prism at the sternal end, is rounded
                    above for the attachment of the clavicular portion of the sterno-mastoid muscle,
                    and presents below a rough surface for the costo-clavicular ligament, and a
                    sinuated line for the subclavian muscle. Towards the acromial end, where it is
                    flattened above and below, it presents before, a surface for the attachment of
                    the large pectoral and deltoid muscles; behind, another for the <hi
                    rend="italic">cucullaris;</hi> and below, a prominent oblique crest for the
                    coraco-clavicular ligaments.</p>
                <p>Compact in the middle, and cancellated at its extremities, the clavicle is
                    developed from a single point.</p>
                <p>The arm-bone or <hi rend="italic">humerus (os</hi><hi rend="italic">brachii)</hi>
                    is a long cylindrical bone, divided into head or scapular end, cubital or lower
                    end, and shaft or body.</p>
                <p>The head presents three eminences, the articulai· head, the anterior tuberosity,
                    and the external tuberosity. The first, which is hemispherical, incrusted by
                    cartilage and synovial membrane, with the axis oblique to that of the bonc, and
                    articulating with the glenoid cavity of the scapula, is separated from the bone
                    by a narrow depressed line named the neck <hi rend="italic">(collum),</hi> in
                    which is fixed the margin of the scapulo-humeral capsular ligament. The second
                    is a small, pointed, sometimes bifid eminence, to which the tendon of the <hi
                    rend="italic">subscapularis</hi> is attached. In the external tuberosity arc
                    distinguished three facettes, to the upper of which the tendon of the <hi
                    rend="italic">supraspinatus,</hi> to the middle that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >infraspinatus,</hi> and to the posterior the tendon of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >teres minor,</hi> arc inserted. Between the anterior and the external
                    tuberosity is a longitudinal groove named the <hi rend="italic">bicipital,</hi>
                    for the transit of the long head of the <hi rend="italic">biceps
                    flexor.</hi></p>
                <p>The cubital or lower extremity is flattened transversely, and moulded into
                    different eminences and depressions. Internally is the inner or ulnar condyle,
                    large and prominent, for the attachment of the internal lateral ligament, and a
                    tendon common to the <hi rend="italic">pronator teres,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >palmaris longus,</hi><hi rend="italic">flexor</hi><hi rend="italic">sublimis,
                    radialis internus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulnaris internus.</hi> Externally
                    is the outer or radial condyle, to which are attached the external lateral
                    ligament, and the tendon common to the supinators and extensors, viz. <hi
                    rend="italic">supinator</hi><hi rend="italic">longus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    >extensor communis.</hi> Between these is an articular surface covered by
                    cartilage, moulded into the small head which moves in the cavity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">radius,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a groove corresponding to the

                <p>another groove rather larger, in which the prominence of the sigmoid cavity is
                    lodged; and the trochlear or pulley-like eminence, which is received in the
                    internal part of the sigmoid cavity, and the size of which renders the inner
                    side of the humerus larger than the outer, and gives it the oblique direction
                    when placed on the horizontal plane. Before is a superficial pit for the
                    coronoid process of the <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> during flexion of the
                    fore-arm, and behind is a deep one for receiving the <hi rend="italic"
                    >olecranon</hi> during extension.</p>
                <p>The shaft is not cylindrical, but prismatic, eonsisting of three surfaces,
                    bounded by an equal number of lines. The first line, which descends from the
                    anterior tuberosity, and, winding to the side, terminates on the ulnar condyle,
                    is anterior above, where the tendons of the <hi rend="italic">latissimus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dorsi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">teres major,</hi> and the short
                    head of the <hi rend="italic">triceps,</hi> are attached, but becomes
                    internal-lateral below, where an intermuscular aponeurosis is fixed. The second,
                    which descends from the fore-part of the large tuberosity to the anterior
                    articular pit, is anterior throughout, and gives attachment above to the large
                    pectoral muscle, at the middle to the deltoid, and below to the <hi
                    rend="italic">brachialis externus.</hi> The third line, which descends from the
                    back of the great tuberosity to the external or radial condyle, is posterior
                    above, where the <hi rend="italic">triceps</hi> is fixed, but external below,
                    where the intermuscular aponeurosis and the <hi rend="italic">supinator

                <p>Of the three surfaces, the first, which is anterior and internal, presents above,
                    the bicipital groove, covered by periosteum and synovial membrane for the long

                    for the insertion of its tendon, and below this an oblique sinuosity traversed
                    by the radial nerve. The third, which is posterior, gives attachment above to
                    the <hi rend="italic">triceps,</hi> and below is merely covered by that
                    muscle.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> cancellated at its extremities, and compact
                    in the shaft, is ossified in three parts; one for the latter, and one for each

                    sigmoid cavity. The second is a broad, thin-edged process, prominent before,
                    about half an inch below the olecranon, the upper surface of which is
                    cartilaginous, and completes the sigmoid cavity; the lower surface is rough for

                <p>The lower or carpal extremity presents a cartilaginous surface, shaped like a
                    circular sector, the.circular margin being bent upwards, so as to form a

                <p>The shaft has the shape of a trilateral prism, except at the lower extremity,
                    where it becomes cylindrical. Of the three lines by which the surfaces are
                    bounded, the external or radial, which is strongly marked, and sharp at the
                    middle, extends from the posterior tip of the small sigmoid cavity to about two
                    inches above the lower end, and gives attachment to the interosseous ligament.
                    The second, internal or ulnar, which is obtuse, descends from the inner edge of
                    the coronoid process to the inside of the styloid, and gives attachment above
                    and in the middle to the <hi rend="italic">flexor profundus,</hi> and below to
                    the <hi rend="italic">pronator</hi><hi rend="italic">quadratus.</hi> The third,
                    posterior, obtuse above and below, sharp in the middle, extends from the
                    olecranon to the outside of the styloid process, and gives attachment to an
                    aponeurosis.</p>
                <p>Of the surfaces inclosed by these lines, to the anterior, which is concave, and
                    contains the medullary hole, the <hi rend="italic">flexor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sublimis</hi> is attached above, and the <hi rend="italic">pronator</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">quadratus</hi> below. The inner is covered above, where it is
                    broad, by the <hi rend="italic">flexor profundus,</hi> and below by the
                    integuments. The posterior or radial is parted by a line into two spaces, to the
                    larger of which are fixed the <hi rend="italic">anconeus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ulnaris externus,</hi> and to the smaller the <hi rend="italic"
                    >supinator brevis,</hi><hi rend="italic">extensores pollicis longus et
                    brevis,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">abductor</hi><hi rend="italic">pollicis,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">extensor</hi><hi rend="italic">indicis.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> is a long bone, rather shorter than the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna,</hi> forming the outer bone of the fore-arm, articulated
                    above with the <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> below with the carpus, and at the
                    inside with the <hi rend="italic">ulna.</hi></p>
                <p>The upper extremity consists of a circular cartilaginous head, concave for
                    receiving the small head of the <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> with a
                    cartilaginous surface on its inner or ulnar side for articulating with the small
                    sigmoid cavity of the ulna, and a rough one for the annular ligament on the
                    outside. Below this the bone is contracted and forms the neck of the radius, and
                    again swells before into a large rough prominent tubercle, to which the tendon
                    of the <hi rend="italic">biceps flexor</hi> is fixed, and which is therefore
                    named the <hi rend="italic">bicipital tuberosity.</hi></p>
                <p>The lower extremity, which is double the size, forms an extensive surface for
                    articulation with the scaphoid and semilunar bones of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >carpus,</hi> continuous on the ulnar side with a small cartilaginous surface
                    for articulation with that of the <hi rend="italic">ulna,</hi> bounded without
                    by the styloid process, a rough triangular eminence, to which is fixed the
                    external ligament, and bounded elsewhere by a rough margin for ligamentous
                    insertions. The posterior part of this end presents two eminences inclosing a
                    wide hollow, separated by a small eminence into two grooves,—an inner or ulnar,
                    large for the tendons of the <hi rend="italic">extensor communis</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="italic">extensor</hi><hi rend="italic">proprius indicis,</hi> and an
                    outer or radial for the <hi rend="italic">extensor longus pollicis.</hi> Between
                    the middle eminence and the styloid process are two other grooves,—the anterior
                    for the <hi rend="italic">abductor</hi><hi rend="italic">magnus</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">extensor brevis</hi> of the thumb, and the posterior for those of
                    the <hi rend="italic">radiales</hi><hi rend="italic">exterm.</hi></p>
                <p>The shaft or body, which is thin and round above, prismatic in the middle and
                    below, presents three surfaces inclosed by an equal number of lines. Of the
                    latter, the inner or ulnar descends from the inner margin of the bicipital
                    tuberosity, sharp and prominent, to the small inner articular surface, and gives
                    attachment to the interosseous ligament. To the outer, which descends from the
                    outer margin of the tuberosity, obtuse, to the base of the styloid process, the
                    <hi rend="italic">flexor</hi><hi rend="italic">sublimis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pronator</hi><hi rend="italic">quadratus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >supinator</hi><hi rend="italic">longus</hi> are attached. The third, also
                    obtuse, is indistinct to the second third of the bone.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040053?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0053-0788"/>
                <p>whence it proceeds to the middle tubercle of the carpal extremity.</p>
                <p>The anterior surface, which is hollow above, presents the medullary hole and the
                    attachment of the <hi rend="italic">flexor</hi><hi rend="italic">longus
                    pollicis</hi> below that of the <hi rend="italic">pronator</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >quadratus.</hi> The posterior, hollowed in the middle, corresponds to the <hi
                    rend="italic">supinator brevis,</hi> the extensors, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >abductor</hi><hi rend="italic">pollicis,</hi> which are attached to it; and the
                    common extensors, <hi rend="italic">extensor</hi><hi rend="italic">proprius
                    indicis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">extensor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pollicis,</hi> by which it is simply covered. The external surface, which is
                    rounded, is covered above by the <hi rend="italic">supinator brevis,</hi> in the
                    middle by the <hi rend="italic">pronator teres,</hi> which are attached to it;
                    and below by the radial extensors <hi rend="italic">(radiales externi),</hi>
                    which merely glide over it.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> consist of
                    cancellated structure in the <hi rend="italic">epiphyses,</hi> and compact
                    inclosing cancelli in the <hi rend="italic">diaphyses,</hi> and are each
                    ossified in three points.</p>
                <p>These two bones are mutually connected by a broad web of periosteum continued
                    from that of the bones, and named the <hi rend="italic">interosseous</hi>
                    ligament, the principal use of which is to enable the radius to roll laterally
                    in the motions of pronation and supination on the <hi rend="italic">ulna,</hi>
                    and to give attachment to muscles without adding to the weight of the fore-arm
                    by intermediate bone.</p>
                <p>The bones of the hand consist of those of the <hi rend="italic">carpus,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">metacarpus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">phalanges.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> consists of eight short and irregular-shaped
                    bones, arranged in two rows. Those of the first are the scaphoid or navicular
                    <hi rend="italic">(os scaphoides, os</hi><hi rend="italic">naviculare),</hi> the
                    semilunar <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic">lunatum),</hi> the
                    cuneiform or trilateral <hi rend="italic">(os triquetrum),</hi> and the pisiform
                    or lenticular <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic">orbiculare,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">pisiforme).</hi> Those of the second row
                    are the trapezal <hi rend="italic">(trapezium),</hi> the trapezoidal <hi
                    rend="italic">(os trapezoides),</hi> the large bone <hi rend="italic"
                    >(os</hi><hi rend="italic">magnum,</hi><hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">capitatum),</hi> and the unciform bone <hi rend="italic">(os
                    unciforme, os</hi><hi rend="italic">hamatum).</hi></p>
                <p>Of these bones, which it would be tedious to describe minutely, it is enough to
                    say, that their names are intended to indicate their shape; that they are
                    connected mutually by cartilaginous surfaces, so as to allow the gliding motion
                    only; and that, besides periosteum, they are invested by ligaments which
                    maintain them in their position, and tend to strengthen and consolidate the
                    wrist, as the basis of support for the hand and fingers.</p>
                <p>By the upper articular surface of the scaphoid and semilunar bones, the <hi
                    rend="italic">carpus</hi> is connected to the lower extremity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">radius</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the upper surface of the
                    trilateral bone is contiguous to the fibro-cartilage of the radio-carpal
                    articulation, and the upper surface of which •is in contact with the lower
                    articular surface of the <hi rend="italic">ulna.</hi> The pisiform bone, which
                    is attached to the anterior surface of the latter, and thus projects before the
                    plane of the other bones into the hand, may be regarded as a sesamoid bone,
                    which serves as a point of insertion to the tendons of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >flexor carpi</hi><hi rend="italic">ulnaris</hi> above, the fibres of the <hi
                    rend="italic">adductor of</hi> the little finger below, and those of the
                    anterior carpal ligament before.</p>
                <p>The inferior surface of the navicular bone is articulated at once to the superior
                    surfaces of the <hi rend="italic">trapezium</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >trapezoides.</hi> The palmar or anterior surface of the former presents a small
                    groove, in which moves the tendon of the <hi rend="italic">flexor carpi</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">radialis,</hi> bounded on the outside by the pyramidal process, to
                    which the annular ligament is attached. The <hi rend="italic">os magnum,</hi>
                    which is articulated above with the semilunar bone, on the radial side with the
                    scaphoid and trapezoidal, below with two metacarpal bones, and on the ulnar side
                    with the unciform bone, is thus wedged firmly like a central base between the
                    others, and contributes much to the solidity of the carpal articulations. The
                    unciform, which is placed at the inside of the range, and is articulated above
                    with the lunar and cuneiform, laterally with the scaphoid, and below with the
                    two inner metacarpal bones, is distinguished by the unciform process rising from
                    its palmar surface, to which part of the <hi rend="italic">abductor</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">flexor brevis minimi</hi><hi rend="italic">digiti</hi> and the
                    annular ligament are attached, and which, stretched between this and the
                    pyramidal process of the <hi rend="italic">trapezium,</hi> form a species of
                    arch over the flexor tendons.</p>
                <p>The carpal bones consist of cancellated tissue, invested by a thin pellicle of
                    compact bone. In the foetus and infant they are composed chiefly of
                    brown-coloured, callous substance, homogeneous, but without the smallest trace
                    of bone. Their penetration with this substance takes place about eighteen months
                    or two years after birth.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> is usually said to consist of five bones.
                    This is correct so far as situation goes; but one of these bears little
                    resemblance either in shape, connection, or purpose with the other four. It
                    appears, therefore, more natural to restrict the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >metacarpal</hi> to the four bones which support the digital phalanges, than to
                    extend it to the thumb, the first bone of which is to be regarded as a <hi
                    rend="italic">phalanx</hi> only.</p>
                <p>The four metacarpal bones agree in having trapezoidal heads, cylindrical bodies
                    with an elevated longitudinal line before, and rounded convex lower ends for
                    moving on the concave articular surfaces of the phalanges.</p>
                <p>Besides the upper trapezoidal surfaces for articulating with the trapezoidal,
                    large, and unciform bones, the lateral margins are provided with facettes, the
                    first and fourtlι on one side only, the mutual, the second and third, on both,
                    for articulation with each other. In this manner the metacarpal bone of the
                    index finger is articulated above to the trapezoidal and large bone, and on the
                    inside to the metacarpal bone of the middle finger; the latter is articulated
                    above to the large bone, and on the one side to the index metacarpal bone, on
                    the other to that of the ring finger; while the latter and the metacarpal bone
                    of the little finger are articulated above to the unciform bone and to each
                    other.</p>
                <p>The bodies of the metacarpal bones are slightly ĩncur-vated before, and form a
                    hollow which corresponds with the palm. In their intervals are contained the <hi
                    rend="italic">interossei</hi> muscles, the internal at the volar, the external
                    at the dorsal surface. The anterior surface is covered by the flexor tendons,
                    the <hi rend="italic">lumbricales,</hi> and the palmar fascia. The dorsal
                    surface, which is convex in general, is covered by the extensor tendons.</p>
                <p>The index metacarpal bone has attached to its radial margin the first dorsal <hi
                    rend="italic">interosseus,</hi> to its ulnar, before, the first palmar <hi
                    rend="italic">interosseus,</hi> and behind the second dorsal <hi rend="italic"
                    >interosseus;</hi> while to its upper anterior extremity the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rαdiαlis</hi><hi rend="italic">internus</hi> is inserted, and to the same
                    extremity behind the <hi rend="italic">extensor</hi><hi rend="italic">radialis
                    longior.</hi></p>
                <p>To the second or middle metacarpal bone, besides the palmar <hi rend="italic"
                    >fascia</hi> and the second and third <hi rend="italic">interossei,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">adductor</hi><hi rend="italic">pollicis</hi><hi rend="italic">and
                    flexor brevis</hi> are attached to the palmar surface; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >extensor</hi><hi rend="italic">radialis brevior</hi> is inserted into its
                    dorsal surface.</p>
                <p>The fourtlι or small metacarpal bone, besides the palmar fascia and the third
                    palmar and fourth dorsal <hi rend="italic">interosseus,</hi> gives insertion by
                    its dorsal surface to the <hi rend="italic">extensor carpi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ulnaris.</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> or bones of the fingers are fifteen small
                    longitudinal bones placed vertically on each other, three to each finger; or
                    forming ranges distinguished into metacarpal, middle, and unguinal, the first
                    row being the longest, the second shorter, and the third or unguinal the
                    shortest.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040066?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0066-0789"/>
                <p>The metacarpal <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> agree in having the upper
                    extremities shaped like rounded cubes, with concave cartilaginous surfaces for
                    receiving the lower extremities of the metacarpal bones, and tubercular sides
                    for the attachment of the lateral ligaments. The upper ends of the middle and
                    unguinal are moulded into two cartilaginous cavities with an intermediate ridge,
                    with lateral tubercles for the lateral ligaments. The lower extremities of the
                    metacarpal and middle <hi rend="italic">phalanges,</hi> which are smaller than
                    the upper, are rounded and separated by a small groove into two condyles, which
                    are received into the cavities of the upper ends. The lower extremities of the
                    unguinal phalanges, which terminate the fingers, are flattened
                    antero-posteriorly, and moulded into crescentic tips <hi rend="italic"
                    >(lunulae)</hi> transversely.</p>
                <p>The bodies of the metacarpal and middle phalanges are convex behind, and have a
                    surface flat before, bounded on each side by a sharp marginal line, and taper
                    gradually from above downwards. Those of the unguinal phalanges, excepting that
                    of the thumb, are convex before as well as behind. The palmar surface of the
                    metacarpal phalanges is covered by the flexor tendons, which in the superficial
                    muscle are inserted into the anterior and upper part of the middle phalanx,
                    while those of the deep-seated flexor are inserted into the upper anterior part
                    of the unguinal phalanx. The first phalanx of the thumb, which is generally
                    considered as a metacarpal bone, has the <hi rend="italic">abductor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">magnus</hi> inserted into its upper extremity, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">opponens</hi><hi rend="italic">and flexor brevis</hi> into its
                    body. The dorsal surfaces are covered by the extensor tendons, which, with those
                    of the <hi rend="italic">lumbricales</hi> and <hi rend="italic">interossei,</hi>
                    are inserted into the middle phalanges.</p>
                <p>The metacarpal and phalangeal bones are compact, with cancellated extremities,
                    and are ossified in three points.</p>
                <p>The bones now enumerated are connected so as to admit of motion to various
                    extents. The <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> articulated with the glenoid cavity
                    of the <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> by a capsular ligament, while the long
                    head of the <hi rend="italic">biceps</hi> serves the purpose of a round
                    ligament, admits of motion in every direction,—flexion, extension, abduction,
                    adduction, circumduction, and rotation. The humero-cubital articulation, which
                    is secured by two lateral ligaments, admits of extension and flexion only; but
                    in any position of the <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> in relation to the humerus,
                    the <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> rolls on the former, so as to produce those
                    motions of the wrist and hand which are denominated <hi rend="italic"
                    >pronation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">internal rotation,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">supination</hi> or <hi rend="italic">external rotation.</hi></p>
                <p>The carpal bones are articulated chiefly with the <hi rend="italic">radius,</hi>
                    so as to admit of flexion and extension, adduction and abduction, and even some
                    degree of circumduction and rotation. The metacarpal bones are limited in
                    motion. The metacarpal phalanges admit of flexion and extension, abduction and
                    adduction, circumduction and rotation; while those of the middle and unguinal
                    range are confined to flexion and extension. The precision, nevertheless, of
                    which these motions are susceptible, with the numerous modifications which they
                    undergo in combination with the opposable powers of the thumb, and the nicety
                    and delicacy of tact inherent in the skin of the fingers, arc the means from
                    which the human hand derives its remarkable aptitude for all the mechanical
                    arts, and all operations requiring manual dexterity. By the combination almost
                    endless of a number of simple motions, so many complex motions arc produced,
                    that it is difficult to set limits to the degree of perfection which the hand
                    and fingers, as an organ of prehension, may attain.</p>

                <p>The bones proper to the lower or pelvic extremities are, the thigh-bone <hi

                    >(rotula,</hi><hi rend="italic">patella),</hi> seven tarsal bones, four
                    metatarsal bones, and 15 phalanges.</p>
                <p>The thigh-bone <hi rend="italic">(femur, os</hi><hi rend="italic">femoris)</hi>
                    is the largest, thickest, strongest, and heaviest bone of the skeleton.</p>
                <p>The upper or iliac extremity consists of a head, neck, and two tuberosities named
                    <hi rend="italic">troehaniers.</hi> The head is globular, incrustcd by cartilage
                    and synovial membrane, unless at its internal point, where there is an irregular
                    depression for the iųsertion of the round ligament, and is lodged in the
                    cotyloid cavity <hi rend="italic">(acetabulum).</hi> It is situate internally in
                    relation to the shaft; and its axis, which forms with that of the latter an
                    obtuse angle, variable in extent according to age and sex, is represented by
                    that of the neck, a contracted cylinder of bone, varying in length according to
                    the same circumstances, flattened before and behind, presenting numerous
                    vascular holes, and covered by fibrous slips and synovial membrane. The junction
                    of the neck with the bone is marked by a large prominent body named the <hi

                    >glutaeus minimus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a posterior for that of the
                    <hi rend="italic">quadratus femoris.</hi> At the union of the neck with the <hi
                    rend="italic">diaphysis</hi> below, and externally, is a conical eminence named
                    the small <hi rend="italic">trochanter</hi> (t), to which the united tendon of
                    the <hi rend="italic">psoas</hi><hi rend="italic">magnus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">iliacus internus</hi> is fixed. The spaces between the trochanters
                    before and behind are united by oblique rough lines, to which the femoral margin
                    of the capsular ligament is attached, and the entire space within which is
                    continuous with the articular cavity.</p>
                <p>The lower or tibial extremity, which is large, is moulded into two rounded
                    eminences named condyles ∕%ovδυλo∕) (1, 2; a, b); the one internal, deeper, and
                    larger than the external, separated by an antero-posterior depression <hi
                    rend="italic">(fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">intercondylaris),</hi> and prominent
                    and convex behind. Each condyle has an external and internal surface, while the
                    articular one, which is incrusted by cartilage and synovial membrane, is shaped
                    something like a horse-shoe, incurvated upwards in the middle before, and behind
                    on each side, with elevated irregular margins for the attachment of the
                    articular capsule. The intercondylar depression before receives the upper part
                    of the knee-pan <hi rend="italic">(patella),</hi> while in the intercondylar
                    cavity behind are lodged the fimbriated margins of the synovial membrane, with
                    the femoral ends of the cross ligaments, the anterior of which is inserted into
                    the inner surface of the external condyle, and the posterior into that of the
                    internal condyle. The outer or fibular surface of the external condyle presents
                    an eminence for the attachment of the external lateral ligament, and a
                    depression below for that of the <hi rend="italic">pcplitaeus.</hi> The outer or
                    tibial surface of the internal condyle has a prominent tubercle, to which are
                    fixed the internal lateral ligament and the tendon of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >adductor</hi><hi rend="italic">magnus.</hi> In a pit above each condyle the
                    heads of the <hi rend="italic">gemellus</hi><hi rend="italic">(gastrocnemius
                    externus)</hi> are fixed.</p>
                <p>The shaft or body, which approaches the cylindrical shape, is incurvated, with
                    the convexity before, and the concavity behind (F, f). The anterior surface is
                    uniformly round, and covered by the <hi rend="italic">cruraeus,</hi> which is
                    fixed above to the interval between the trochanters. The posterior surface
                    presents a rough elevated line, descending from the base of the large
                    trochanter, meeting a similar line descending from the small trochanter, and
                    inclosing a triangular rough space, forming about the middle third of the bone a
                    rough elevated line <hi rend="italic">(linea aspera)</hi> (1), which again is
                    parted into two, less distinct; one termi-natĩng<pb break="no"

                    external, the other very faint on the inter- • nal condyle. To the upper part of
                    the external line, <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi> where it is most prominent,
                    the tendon of the <hi rend="italic">glutoeus</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus</hi>

                    >internus</hi> is attached below; while the <hi rend="italic">adductor</hi><hi

                    whole length, unless at one point, where it is interrupted about three inches
                    above the condyle by a smooth surface, on which the femoral artery passes under
                    the tendon of the <hi rend="italic">ajdductor</hi><hi rend="italic">magnus,</hi>
                    to continue its course between the condyles, where it becomes the popliteal
                    artery.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">femur,</hi> which is one of the most perfect examples of a
                    long cylindrical bone, is compact in the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis,</hi> with
                    distinct medullary canal, and cancellated in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >epiphyses.</hi> It is ossified in four portions; one for the <hi rend="italic"
                    >diaphysis</hi> and neck, one for the two condyles, one for the head, and in
                    general one for the <hi rend="italic">trochanter major.</hi> The neck, which is
                    short in early life, becomes long in adult age, and the body acquires its
                    peculiar incurvation apparently from muscular action. In the female this
                    incurvation is greater than in the male, and the neck forms a greater angle with
                    the body.</p>
                <p>The knee-pan <hi rend="italic">(rotula,</hi><hi rend="italic">patella)</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(p)</hi> is a short bone, shaped like a heart, with the apex
                    downward, convex and fibrous before, where it is covered by tendinous matter;
                    flat above, where the <hi rend="italic">rectus,</hi> the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >vasti,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">cruraeus,</hi> are inserted; plane and
                    concave behind, where it is covered by cartilage and synovial membrane, and
                    separated into two unequal divisions by a middle ridge, forming the anterior
                    wall of the knee-joint, and applied by its superior half over the anterior
                    intercondylar <hi rend="italic">fossa.</hi> The lower apex is rough for the
                    attachment of the inferior ligament; and to the margins are fixed those of the
                    fibro-tendinous capsular, by which it is connected to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >femur</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi></p>
                <p>The knee-pan, which has a peculiar cancellated structure, invested by a thin
                    plate of compact bone, is to be regarded partly as a sesamoid bone for the
                    insertion of the common tendon of the four extensors of the leg, partly as an
                    appendage or <hi rend="italic">epiphysis</hi> to the superior part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia,</hi> performing to that bone the same function which the
                    <hi rend="italic">olecranon</hi> does to the <hi rend="italic">ulna.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> is a prismatic-shaped long bone, situate at the
                    inner and anterior region of the leg, with the femoral condyles above, the <hi
                    rend="italic">astragalus</hi> below, and the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> on
                    the external side.</p>
                <p>The head, upper or femoral end, is large., and of an irregular oval shape. It
                    presents two slightly concave elliptical cartilaginous surfaces, with the long
                    diameter antero-posterior, separated by a rough vascular space, large before and
                    narrow behind. Of these elliptical surfaces the external margin is most regular,
                    and presents a crescentic or lunated mark for the attachment of the semilunar
                    fibro-cartilages, which thus increase the concavity of the articular surfaces
                    for the reception of the condyles. The inner or mesial margin of each is
                    elevated into a curved peak, mutually separated by a depression. These
                    eminences, which are jointly named the <hi rend="italic">spine</hi> of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia,</hi> correspond in flexion and extension to the
                    intercondylar <hi rend="italic">fossa.</hi> Before is a triarcual surface, rough
                    for the insertion of the anterior crucial ligament, and behind a notch for that
                    of the posterior. The lateral circumference of the head, which is rough, and
                    marked by vascular holes, presents before a triangular surface, the upper half
                    of which corresponds to the inner surface of the knee-pan, and is contained
                    within the cavity of the joint; while the lower angular portion is convex for
                    the insertion of the inferior patellar ligament, or the last insertion of the
                    tendon of the <hi rend="italic">rectus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vastus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">externus.</hi> The sides, which are rounded and prominent, are

                    >internal tuberosities,</hi> and give attachment to the external and internal
                    lateral ligaments. To the back part of the internal also the tendon of the <hi
                    rend="italic">semimembranosus</hi> is fixed (d), while that of the external
                    presents a cartilaginous facette for the articulation of the head of the <hi
                    rend="italic">fibula</hi> (c).</p>
                <p>The lower or tarsal extremity, which is much smaller, is nearly quadrilateral,
                    with a cartilaginous surface concave transversely, with elevated anterior and
                    posterior borders, and the internal raised into a vertical eminence named the
                    inner ankle <hi rend="italic">(malleolus</hi><hi rend="italic">internus)</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(f),</hi> to the apex of which the internal lateral ligament is
                    fixed. This cartilaginous surface, which receives the head of the <hi
                    rend="italic">astragalus,</hi> is surrounded by a furrow, very distinct before,
                    in which ligamentous fibres are inserted; while the external margin, which is
                    broader than the internal, presents between two prominences a trilateral hollow,
                    in which the tarsal end of the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> is lodged. The
                    anterior surface is covered by the tendons of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibialis</hi><hi rend="italic">anticus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                    and the posterior, behind the internal ankle, is marked by a groove for the <hi

                    rend="italic">longus digitorum,</hi> and another for <hi rend="italic">dne

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">body</hi> or <hi rend="italic">diaphysis,</hi> which is
                    thick above, is prismatic, and presents three surfaces, bounded by the same
                    number of lines. The first, which is anterior <hi rend="italic">(crista),</hi>
                    descends sharp and prominent from the anterior margin of the external tuberosity
                    to the fore part of the internal ankle, and, though subcutaneous, gives
                    attachment to the tibial aponeurosis and the <hi rend="italic">tibialis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">anticus.</hi> To the external, which is sharp, and descends from
                    the posterior margin of the same tuberosity to the anterior tubercle of the
                    lower end, the interosseous ligament is fixed. To the internal, which is obtuse,
                    and rather rounded, and descends from the posterior part of the internal
                    tuberosity to that of the inner ankle, the <hi rend="italic">poplitoeus</hi>
                    above, and the second or inner head of the <hi rend="italic">soloeus,</hi> with
                    the <hi rend="italic">flexor</hi><hi rend="italic">longus digitorum,</hi> are

                <p>The lower or tarsal end consists of a pointed trilateral pyramid, the external

                <p>The body is marked by several lines inclosing surfaces rather irregular in shape

                    respectively of the <hi rend="italic">malleolus externus,</hi> inclosing a
                    triangular space, which is covered by integuments only. The internal, descending
                    from about an inch below the head to the anterior edge of the internal <hi
                    rend="italic">malleolus,</hi> coincides there with the anterior part of the

                    round below to the posterior part of the tarsal end, giving attachment to an <hi

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tarsus</hi> consists of seven short irregular-shaped bones,

                <p>The first <hi rend="italic">(talus, astragalus)</hi> has a convex cartilaginous

                    for articulating with the malleolar process, and with a smaller triarcual
                    surface on the outside for the fibula; two cartilaginous surfaces, separated by

                    and an anterior eminence, with a convex cartilaginous surface, for articulating
                    with the scaphoid bone before. The <hi rend="italic">calcaneum,</hi> which is

                <p>The scaphoid bone is connected by its posterior concave surface with the anterior
                    convex one of the <hi rend="italic">astragalus,</hi> and presents before a

                    tuberosity for the attachment of the <hi rend="italic">tibialis posticus.</hi>
                    The cuboid bone, which constitutes the outer margin of the tarsus, and is
                    articulated with the trilateral surface of the <hi rend="italic">calcaneum,</hi>
                    and by a minute facette with the scaphoid bone, is chiefly distinguished by an
                    oblique or diagonal groove, for the tendon of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >peronoeus</hi><hi rend="italic">longus.</hi> The third and fourth metatarsal
                    bones are articulated to its anterior surface.</p>
                <p>The three cuneiform bones agree in having posterior cartilaginous surfaces for
                    articulation with the scaphoid bone, and anterior ones for that with the first
                    phalanx of the great toe, and the metatarsal bones of the second and third toes.
                    The internal surface of the large cuneiform bone is convex, covered by
                    integuments; the external or fibular cartilaginous, with two facettes for
                    articulation with the second cuboid bone and the first metatarsal. Its lower
                    surface is irregular for the insertion of the <hi rend="italic">tibialis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">anticus,</hi> and part of the <hi rend="italic">tibialis
                    posticus.</hi> The second cuneiform bone, which is the smallest of the three,
                    and the most like its name, is wedged between the scaphoid behind, the first and
                    third on each side, and supports the first metatarsal bone before. The third,
                    which also is not unlike its denomination, is wedged between the scaphoid
                    behind, and the second cuneiform and the cuboid bone, and sustains the second
                    metatarsal bone; while the third and fourth are articulated with the anterior
                    surface <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the cuboid.</p>
                <p>Of the metatarsal bones there are four; the first three similar to each other;
                    the fourth, which sustains the phalanges of the small toe, distinguished by a
                    large oblique angular head for the insertion of the tendon of the <hi
                    rend="italic">peronoeus brevis,</hi> while that <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    <hi rend="italic">peronoeus</hi><hi rend="italic">tertius</hi> is fixed above.
                    Of the other three the heads are trilateral or wedge-shaped with the base
                    upwards, with cartilaginous facettes on the sides for mutual articulation. The
                    bodies are cylindrical, and, tapering, terminate in round heads flattened
                    laterally. The dorsal or upper surface is covered by the extensor tendons, the
                    <hi rend="italic">extensor brevis</hi><hi rend="italic">digitorum,</hi> and the
                    dorsal vessels and nerves derived from the anterior tibial artery and nerve. The
                    surface of these bones is so constructed that it forms an arched or convex
                    inclined plane, descending from the tibial to the fibular side of the foot. In
                    the anterior or plantar surface, which is concave, arc lodged the <hi

                    of the <hi rend="italic">interossei.</hi></p>
                <p> The <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> of the toes, in number 15, bear a general
                    resemblance to those of the fingers; but are considerably shorter, unless in the
                    instance of the great toe. Like these also, they are disposed in three
                    ranges,—metatarsal, middle, and unguinal.</p>
                <p>The bones now described are united so as to admit of different degrees and forms
                    of motion. The head of the <hi rend="italic">femur,</hi> lodged in the <hi
                    rend="italic">acetabulum,</hi> is retained in that cavity not only by the
                    capsular and round ligaments, but by the numerous strong muscles with which the
                    hip-joint is surrounded. The length of the neck, which is peculiar to the human
                    subject, throws the supporting column of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040105?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0105-0792"/> the bone to a
                    greater distance, not only from the pelvis, but from the mesial plane and centre
                    of gravity; and this character, with the great proportional length of the bone,
                    and the extent and direction of the pelvis, constitutes the most decisive
                    argument in favour of the doctrine, that man must support himself in the erect
                    position on the two pelvic extremities. In most quadrupeds the neck of the <hi
                    rend="italic">femur</hi> is short; the cylinder is shorter than the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia,</hi> and not arched; and the <hi rend="italic">pelvis,</hi>
                    both by its vertical direction and peculiar dimensions, is calculated for the
                    quadruped motion only. The femur admits of motion in every direction,—flexion,
                    extension, adduction, abduction, circumduction, and rotation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tibia,</hi> with its appendage the knee-pan, is articulated
                    to the condyles of the <hi rend="italic">femur</hi> by means of an external and
                    internal lateral ligament, strengthened by an anterior or patellar ligament,
                    posterior fibres, and an anterior and posterior cross ligament, contained within
                    the synovial membrane. The effect of this arrangement, with the anatomical
                    configuration of the articular ends, is to allow cardinal opposition, or flexion
                    and extension only. A small degree of rotation, nevertheless, may be
                    effected.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> is articulated to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia</hi> above by a genuine capsular joint, and below by fibrous matter, and
                    connected at its internal side by a duplicature of periosteum forming the
                    interosseous ligament. These connections admit of little motion, and the chief
                    use of the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> is to give attachment to several
                    muscles which bend or evert the foot. The chief weight of the person, divided as
                    it is between each lower extremity, is communicated from <hi rend="italic">.the
                    pelvis</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">femur,</hi> thence to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia,</hi> and finally to the <hi rend="italic">astragalus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">calcaneum</hi> behind, and the metatarsal bones before. The motion
                    of opposition is confined to the former, which rolls backwards and forwards in
                    the cavity formed by the lower extremity of the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and
                    the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> in the flexion and extension of the foot. In
                    this, therefore, which forms the ankle-joint, all the motions of the foot as a
                    whole are executed. It appears further to be susceptible of a slight degree of
                    lateral rotation, so as to contribute to the eversion and inversion of the
                    foot.</p>
                <p>The tarsal bones are mutually connected by cartilaginous surfaces, and secured by
                    numerous fibrous bands, so as to admit of the gliding motion only. This motion
                    is further between each individual articulation very limited, and its general
                    amount is inconsiderable. The great use of the tarsal articulations is evidently
                    stability and solidity as a base of support, not mobility.</p>
                <p>The bones of the foot form two distinct and separate arches,—an antero-posterior
                    and a transverse. The first is constituted by the posterior part of the
                    heel-bone behind and the metatarso-phalangeal articulations before; and its
                    chief use is to distribute the weight of the extremity from the <hi
                    rend="italic">astragalus,</hi> which may be regarded as the centre, to the <hi
                    rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">calcis</hi> and extremities of the
                    metatarsal bones on each side. In standing, for example, either on one foot or
                    both, the weight of each extremity is distributed before to the
                    metatarso-phalangeal joints, and behind to the tuberosity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">os</hi><hi rend="italic">calcis,</hi> while the anterior part of
                    the latter bone and the whole second range of tarsal bones do not touch the
                    ground. The second arch results first from the arrangement of the cuneiform
                    bones with the scaphoid, and that of the cuboid with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >os</hi><hi rend="italic">calcis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and next from the
                    arrangement of the metatarsal bones. These arches, which are indistinct in early
                    life, become conspicuous as the bones are completed, and acquire their complete
                    developement in adult age. These arches are of great use in the alternate
                    elevation of each half of the person in progression, in ascending an inclined
                    plane or a series of steps, and especially in springing and leaping.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The phalanges</hi> are articulated with the metatarsal bones
                    and with each other, so as to admit of flexion and extension chiefly, with a
                    very limited extent of abduction and' adduction. The articulation of the great
                    toe, also destitute of the power of opposition, abridges much its extent of
                    motion. While these circumstances, with the great brevity of the phalanges,
                    render the foot much less perfect than the hand as an organ of prehension, they
                    extend its sphere of support, and enlarge its powers as a locomotive agent.</p>
                <p>The pelvic and thoracic extremities present several points of resemblance which
                    have been well traced by Soemmering. The head, neck, and tuberosities of the <hi
                    rend="italic">humerus</hi> resemble the head, neck, and trochanters of the <hi
                    rend="italic">femur</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if the lower end of the
                    former bone is articulated both with the <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">radius,</hi> while that of the latter is connected to the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia</hi> only, there is still sufficient analogy between the
                    lower ends of both bones. The <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> resembles the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> above, with the knee-pan corresponding to the olecranon;
                    but the lower extremity of the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> is represented by
                    that of the <hi rend="italic">radius,</hi> in consequence of the extensive
                    connection of the latter bone with the <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> for the
                    purpose of pronation and supination. The navicular and lunar bones of the carpus
                    are represented by the single <hi rend="italic">astragalus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> an arrangement which appears to be allied in the latter
                    case to the purpose of stability and solidity. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >calcaneum</hi> may be regarded as an enlarged <hi rend="italic">os magnum,</hi>
                    fitted for the same purpose; and even in the shape and position of the scaphoid
                    bone the same object may be recognised. This comparison, however, it is
                    superfluous to pursue farther. The general conclusion is, that the thoracic
                    extremities are intended to combine with strength great extent and precision of
                    motion, while the purpose of the pelvic is stability, solidity, and
                    strength.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. — MYOLOGY; THE ANATOMY OF THE MUSCLES.</p>
                <p>The muscles, with their appendages the fasciae, tendons, and synovial sheaths,
                    constitute the second division of the locomotive organs. By the term muscle,
                    indeed, in Special Anatomy, is meant not only a mass of flesh adequate to effect
                    motion, but an organ consisting of <hi rend="italic">fascia,</hi> muscular
                    flesh, and tendon, connected by the first and last substances to the parts,
                    fixed or movable, to be approximated. While the middle portion is denominated
                    belly <hi rend="italic">(venter),</hi> the two extremities are most properly
                    named <hi rend="italic">attachments;</hi> though by others they have been termed
                    respectively head or origin <hi rend="italic">(caput,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >origo),</hi> and insertion <hi rend="italic">(insitio)</hi> or termination <hi
                    rend="italic">(finis),</hi> according as the one or the other end has been
                    imagined to be most fixed.</p>
                <p>By the contraction of the middle portion or belly the two extremities are
                    approximated; and according as the one is connected with a bone or soft part
                    more movable than the other, that movable portion is approximated to the fixed.
                    This, which is the general effect of muscular action, is well exemplified in the
                    primary bones of the extremities, the muscles of which have tlιeir fixed end in
                    general in the trunk, and their movable end attached to the bones of the
                    extremities. Thus in the case of the <hi rend="italic">pectoralis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">major</hi> (p), Plate XXVII., and <hi rend="italic">latissimus
                    dorsi</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(l, l),</hi> Plate XXVIII., the fixed ends are in
                    the trunk, and the movable or insertions are in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >humerus;</hi> and the effect of the contraction of the belly is to carry the
                    <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> fon-ward over the chest in the one case, and
                    backward on the trunk in the other. This is easily applied to other muscles, as
                    to those of the face.</p>
                <p>The converse of this arrangement nevertheless may take place. The extremity,
                    which in ordinary circumstances is the most movable, may be converted into the
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040118?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0118-0793"/>
                    fixed; while that which is fixed becomes movable. Thus, in the case of the two
                    muscles already mentioned, the <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> may become the
                    fixed point; and the effect will be to elevate and approximate the trunk to the
                    part to which the extremity is fixed.</p>
                <p>Though all the muscles are agents of motion, all are not of locomotion; and it is
                    chiefly the muscles connected by both ends with the skeleton, and especially
                    those of the extremities, which are entitled to this distinction. The muscles of
                    the face are connected always by one end, often by both, with the skin, and
                    hence are cutaneous muscles. Those of the lower jaw and pharynx are organs of
                    motion simply to move the parts with which they are connected in the acts of
                    mastication and deglutition. Those of the larynx are of two orders, the <hi
                    rend="italic">common</hi> or <hi rend="italic">extrinsic,</hi> connected to some
                    of the bones of the head and chest; and the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">intrinsic,</hi> pertaining to the laryngeal cartilages only. Those
                    of the eye and ear, external and internal, are equally unconnected with the
                    locomotive faculty.</p>
                <p>These circumstances have induced several authors, especially the ancient
                    anatomists, and among the moderns Winslow, to arrange the muscles according to
                    the parts which they move. By others, however, especially Douglas and Albinus,
                    they have been classified according to the regions which they occupy; and this
                    method, which is certainly more strictly anatomical, has been more or less
                    adopted by Innes, Sabatier, Bichat, and Boyer. To the first method the principal
                    objection is, that the same muscle may pertain to different classes of organs,
                    and may effect different purposes in each; while of the second it must be
                    admitted, that it communicates no information regarding the remarkable part
                    which the muscles perform in the complicated processes of the animal machine.
                    This consideration it was which induced Albinus, after a minute description of
                    the situation, connections, and separate actions of each muscle of the human
                    body, to construct a table representing the various classes into which they may
                    be divided, according to the parts on which they act; for the same reason,
                    doubtless, Soemmering arranged them according to the organs to which they
                    belong; and for the same reason Portal, after a description equally minute with
                    that of Albinus, gives a second account of the muscles as they are observed to
                    act in the living body.</p>
                <p>In the following tabular view, modified from that given by Albinus in the fourth
                    book of his <hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Musculorum,</hi>
                    the muscles are arranged according to their regions.</p>

                <p>The limits assigned to the present treatise preclude particular details on the
                    situation and relations of this numerous list of muscular organs. Any
                    description sufficiently minute for the purpose of explaining the situation,
                    attachments, relations, and actions of the muscles of the different regions,
                    would be tedious in the extreme, and would not be intelligible without
                    dissection; and no descriptioņ according to their actions only would be
                    intelligible, without a previous account of their anatomical relations. For
                    these reasons it seems most expedient to direct the attention of the reader to a
                    few general circumstances only. For descriptive details the reader will study
                    with advantage the third book of the elaborate and accurate <hi rend="italic"
                    >Historia</hi><hi rend="italic">Musculorum</hi> of Albinus, or the more recent
                    treatise of Sandifort. The descriptions of Innes are clear, short, and
                    sufficiently minute; and a good account of the muscles, as they appear on
                    exposition, is given in the <hi rend="italic">London Dissector.</hi> Of
                    systematic treatises, the second volumes of those of Soemmering, Portal, and
                    Bichat are the best.</p>
                <p>This section, therefore, we shall conclude with such a general view of the
                    muscles as agents in the attitudes and motions of the trunk and extremities, as,
                    with the occasional remarks on their situation and connections in describing the
                    bones, may be easily intelligible. It is further proper to advert briefly to
                    those of the flexor muscles of the fingers, partly with the view of illustrating
                    the general effects of muscular action, partly to show the mechanism by which
                    the hand and fingers are enabled to execute such a variety of nice and delicate
                    motions.</p>
                <p>The muscles of the trunk are employed not only as agents of motion and
                    sustentation, but as the protecting walls of the large cavities. Thus the
                    external and internal ranges of intercostals, the two pectorals, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">serratus magnus,</hi> operate not only in moving the ribs and
                    shoulder respectively, but in contributing to complete the walls of the thorax,
                    and to protect the internal organs. The diaphragm is not only an agent in
                    enlarging the chest downwards, but constitutes an essential partition between
                    the thoracic and abdominal viscera, prevents the lungs and heart from descending
                    into the abdomen, and the stomach and bowels from being thrust upwards into the
                    chest. These characters are still more conspicuously displayed in the <hi
                    rend="italic">recti abdominis,</hi><hi rend="italic">obliqui externi et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iηterni</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">trans-</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193040144?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0144-0795"/><hi rend="italic">versi abdominis,</hi> which
                    operate a little in drawing the chest downwards and compressing it before and on
                    the sides, but act much more powerfully as retaining and supporting walls of the
                    abdominal viscera, counteracting by the inward and upward action the downward
                    impulse of the diaphragm. In this manner the abdominal <hi rend="italic"
                    >viscera,</hi> placed between two opposing but equally balanced powers, are
                    retained in the cavity, and prevented from being protruded upwards or downwards,
                    while they are subjected to the alternate motions of inspiration and
                    expiration.</p>
                <p>The muscles of the trunk are employed in retaining that part of the skeleton in
                    the erect attitude, in balancing it properly on the pelvic extremities, in
                    occasionally inflecting and extending it, in bending it to one side, or in
                    producing rotation. Those of the spine and back are particularly the agents of
                    the erect attitude, and of extension; and those of the anterior region are
                    employed in inflecting the person.</p>
                <p>The muscles of the superior extremities taken together are the agents of numerous
                    varied motions. Though the principal object of the thoracic extremities is <hi
                    rend="italic">prehension,</hi> or embracing any object or objects firmly either
                    by one or both hands, this may be modified in various ways, so as to give rise
                    to prepulsion, traction, and constriction; while diduction and circumduction are
                    the result of the combinations of the simple movements,—abduction, adduction,
                    flexion, and extension.</p>
                <p>Prepulsion may be either instantaneous or continued. The first takes place in the
                    act of inflicting a blow or repelling an object. All the flexors are previously
                    put in action to shorten the member, which is then at once forcibly extended,
                    and communicates a violent shock to the part of the object to which its
                    extremity is applied. Of this motion, in which the extension takes place in the
                    scapulo-humeral and humero-cubital articulations, the deltoid and <hi
                    rend="italic">brachialis externus,</hi> or third head of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >triceps,</hi> are the chief agents. The wrist and fingers arc almost passive.
                    But an analogous motion is executed by the latter in giving a fillip. In
                    continuous prepulsion, for instance, or the act of impelling an object, the
                    mechanism is of two kinds. In the first case, the member being previously
                    extended and supported on the object, the individual inclines the trunk, and
                    avails himself of its weight; while the member, remaining passive, becomes a
                    lever moved by gravity. In the second case, the continued action of the
                    extensors retaining the member forcibly extended, impels the object without
                    interruption. When, for example, a man pushes a wheelcarriage before him, the
                    superior extremities are extended and communicate motion to the carriage, while
                    the trunk approaching it immediately, the extremities are again inflected; and
                    so forth successively. In most instances this twofold mechanism is combined.
                    When in prepulsion the body impelled is fixed, the impulse is thrown back on the
                    person of the prepelling agent. Examples of this effect of prepulsion are
                    observed in the act of rising from a seat by the occasional use of the thoracic
                    extremities, and in pushing a vessel from the shore by means of an oar .or
                    pole.</p>
                <p>Traction, which consists in a general action of the flexors of the thoracic
                    extremities, is directly the reverse of prepulsion. Its effect is to diminish
                    the space between the agent and the object drawn, which takes place by
                    shortening the member; while in prepulsion this space is enlarged by elongating
                    or extending the member. In the case of a very great effort, for instance that
                    of detaching a piece of wood strongly fixed in a wall, the action oí the flexors
                    is aided by the weight of the trunk, which is instinctively inclined in the
                    opposite direction; and if the body drawn yields at once, a fall is often the
                    result, because in this inclination the centre of gravity is subverted. In
                    another form of traction, in which the body grasped does not yield, and when the
                    action takes place upwards, the effect is to elevate the person of the agent by
                    the flexors of the superior, and even occasionally of the inferior extremities.
                    Familiar examples of this are afforded in the act of climbing walls, trees, and
                    occasionally rocks, in ascending the rigging of a ship, and still more forcibly
                    in the manner in which the active seaman ascends a single rope.</p>
                <p>Constriction consists in the forcible and continued inflection either of a single
                    hand or of the whole of both members. In the first case the agents are the
                    superficial and deep flexors, and the flexors of the thumb and little finger;
                    and in the second, with the action of these muscles, that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">biceps,</hi><hi rend="italic">brachialis internus,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">coraco-brachialis</hi> is combined. This motion can neither be so
                    sudden as that of prepulsion, nor, like it, can it be aided by the weight of the
                    person.</p>
                <p>Diduction, which consists in the forcible separation of the upper extremities
                    from each other, as in swimming, is effected partly by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >latissimus dorsi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">teres major,</hi> partly by the
                    posterior <hi rend="italic">fasciculi</hi> of the deltoid moving the whole
                    extremity in the scapulo-humeral articulation.</p>
                <p>Circumduction, which also is exclusively confined to the scapulo-humeral
                    articulation, is effected principally by the deltoid, large pectoral, <hi
                    rend="italic">latissimus dorsi, teres major,</hi> &amp;c.; while rotation is
                    performed by the <hi rend="italic">supraspinatus, infraspinatus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">teres minor,</hi><hi rend="italic">subscapularis,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>Besides these general classes of motion executed by the thoracic extremities, to
                    them also belongs the power of assuming many of those attitudes and all the
                    varieties of gesture which man employs for the purpose either of expressing his
                    feelings or giving significance and animation to the language which he adopts
                    for that purpose. How much these gestures, when well chosen and properly
                    introduced, aid both the expression of the countenance and the language of the
                    lips, is well known to the public speaker and the dramatic performer.</p>
                <p>Besides the ordinary flexors of the wrist <hi rend="italic">(radialis externus et
                    internus, ulnaris internus),</hi> there are two common flexors of the fingers,
                    one superficial <hi rend="italic">(sublimis),</hi> the other deep-seated <hi
                    rend="italic">(profundus)</hi>; the thumb has a long and short flexor, and the
                    little finger has a short flexor. The flexor muscles, therefore, may be
                    distinguished into four orders; those common to the wrist and hand, those common
                    to the hand and fingers, those proper to the fingers, and those proper only to
                    some of the fingers. Though the <hi rend="italic">radialis internus</hi> änd <hi
                    rend="italic">ulnaris internus</hi> chiefly bend the wrist and hand, yet both
                    the superficial and deep flexors, by passing beneath the annular ligament,
                    co-operate in the same motion, and necessarily bend the hand previous to their
                    final action on the digital phalanges. In this they are considerably aided by
                    the action of the <hi rend="italic">palmaris longus</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">palmaris</hi><hi rend="italic">brevis,</hi> which render the
                    palmar aponeurosis tense, and enable it to afford the necessary resistance to
                    the subjacent flexor tendons.</p>
                <p>The superficial flexor., the tendons of which are inserted into the anterior and
                    citerior part of the second row of phalanges, has the effect of bending that
                    part of the fingers; and further, by being bound down by a ligamentous sheath to
                    the first phalanx, inflects them at the same time into the palm. The slits in
                    each tendon allow those of the deep flexor to pass forward on the median line of
                    each phalanx, to be inserted in the unġuinal phalanges, and thereby to operate
                    most directly and perfectly in inflecting them on the palm; and, by being
                    confined also in the same sheath by strong ligamentous bands, aid in inflecting
                    the second and first range of phalanges. (Plate XXVIII. fig. 2 and 3.) <pb

                    These actions are further facilitated and modified by another class of muscles.
                    The <hi rend="italic">lumbricales,</hi> which, situate in ' the palm, are
                    attached above to the tendons of the <hi rend="italic">flexor .profundus,</hi>
                    and inserted sometimes into the extensor ten- <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi>
                    dons, sometimes into the lateral regions of the phalanges, may either concur
                    with the <hi rend="italic">profundus</hi> in bending the first phalanges, or
                    they may adduct or abduct the fingers, according to the separate or conjunct
                    motion; and hence are of the utmost importance in all nice and minute motions of
                    the fingers. Without the <hi rend="italic">lumbricales,</hi> which are peculiar
                    to man, it would be impossible for the human fingers to execute those minute and
                    rapid movements which are necessary in performing on musical instruments; and
                    the great advantage which one individual possesses over another in what is
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">execution,</hi> consists chiefly in the perfect
                    use of these little muscles. In playing on the piano-forte especially, the <hi
                    rend="italic">lumbricales</hi> are of the most essential service; and though the
                    superficial flexor enables a lady to strike the keys, the former must be
                    employed in the more minute and delicate motions requisite in the transition
                    through numerous chords.</p>
                <p>In this action the <hi rend="italic">internodii</hi> at the same time appear to
                    be auxiliary; and their connections are calculated to modify the action of the
                    flexors.</p>
                <p>Another peculiarity in the human hand consists in the four muscles with which the
                    thumb is provided, and the two connected with the little finger. By means of its
                    short abductor, short flexor, and adductor, the thumb may be separated,
                    inflected, and approximated to the hand quite independently of the fingers, and
                    with the utmost precision. But from the <hi rend="italic">opponens</hi> it
                    derives the remarkable property of being accurately and precisely applied to the
                    tip of any one of the fingers, and thus made to grasp minute objects, which
                    could not without this be effected. From this muscle, in short, the human hand
                    derives its power of appliance to all the arts requiring nice manual operation.
                    Without the <hi rend="italic">opponens</hi> there is no penmanship, no painting,
                    no drawing, no tracing, no needlework, no engraving; in short, none of those
                    operations requiring the obedience of the hand to the conceptions of the mind
                    and the guidance of the eye.</p>
                <p>The movements of the lower extremities are less distinguished for precision and
                    delicacy than those of the superior; and though the foot has both <hi
                    rend="italic">lumbricales</hi><hi rend="italic">aadinter-</hi> ossez, the
                    brevity of the phalanges compared with the length of the metatarsal bones, and
                    the close connection of the toes, form insurmountable impediments to the
                    rapidity and nicety of motion which is observed in the inflections of the
                    fingers. The circumstance, however, which places the foot at an immeasurable
                    distance behind the hand as an organ of prehension, is the want of the <hi
                    rend="italic">opponens.</hi> Void of this, the human foot is little more than
                    the foot of the quadruped, constituting chiefly a base of support, and
                    susceptible of such motions only as are requisite to progression. It is
                    expedient, therefore, to consider shortly the agents by which these functions
                    arc performed.</p>
                <p>Station, or that attitude in which man supports himself in the erect position on
                    a horizontal plane, is effected by the foot being planted firmly on the ground
                    by means of the <hi rend="italic">gemellus, solaeus, tibialis aηticιιs,

                    stretched by the four extensors, aided by the <hi rend="italic">tensor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">va</hi><hi rend="italic">ginae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >femoris.</hi></p>
                <p>The equilibrium of the trunk and pelvis on the heads of the thigh-bones is
                    maintained by several powerful muscles, connecting the former to the latter.
                    Before, for instance, this action is performed by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >sartorius,</hi><hi rend="italic">rectus,</hi> the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >psoae,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">iliacus internus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> behind by the <hi rend="italic">biceps,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >semitendinosus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">semimembranosus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> without by the <hi rend="italic">glutaeus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">tensor vaginae</hi><hi rend="italic">femoris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and within by the <hi rend="italic">pectinaeus,</hi> the adductors, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">gracilis.</hi> By these muscles the pelvis is impelled on
                    the axis of the <hi rend="italic">two femora</hi> only, and is prevented from
                    inclining in any other direction. To maintain the trunk above the pelvis in the
                    same steady position, numerous other muscles concur. Behind are the various
                    extensors of the vertebral column and trunk; the <hi rend="italic">longissimus
                    dorsi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sacro-lumbalis</hi> on each side, the <hi
                    rend="italic">cervicis descendens, splenius</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >biventer</hi><hi rend="italic">cervicis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">transversi cervicis,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spinalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cervicis et dorsi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">semispinalis, multifidus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >interspinales</hi> on each side. Before are the sterno-mastoid, the great and
                    small anterior <hi rend="italic">recti,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">longi
                    colli,</hi> and anterior <hi rend="italic">scaleni</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and on each side are the trachelo-mastoid, the lateral <hi rend="italic"
                    >scalcni,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">intertransversi,</hi> and the lateral <hi
                    rend="italic">recti.</hi> In this enumeration it is manifest that the muscles of
                    the posterior surface of the trunk and spine are at once more numerous and more
                    powerful than those on the anterior,—an arrangement which is rendered necessary
                    to counteract the effect of the weight of the thoracic and abdominal viscera on
                    the anterior side of the vertebral column, which is thus rendered liable to
                    anterior incurvation, and which becomes so in old age, notwithstanding the
                    agents now mentioned.</p>
                <p>This circumstance is further illustrated in the number and size of the muscles by
                    which the head is retained in the erect position, and prevented from inclining
                    forwards. These are the <hi rend="italic">cucullares,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >splenii capitis, biventres cervicis,</hi> and posterior <hi rend="italic"
                    >recti</hi> on each side—all powerful, and several of them large.</p>
                <p>Station on both pelvic extremities, therefore, requires the co-operation of a
                    very considerable number of powerful muscles; and it is a mistake to imagine, as
                    some authors appear to do, that a small degree of muscular energy is requisite
                    for this purpose, and that the skeleton is the chief means of maintaining the
                    erect position. Without the skeleton, as points of support, the muscles cannot
                    act; but without the muscles the bones are passive brute matter.</p>
                <p>In station on one extremity only, a different and certainly a less degree of
                    muscular action is requisite. All the external muscles of the fixed member are
                    at first strongly contracted, to prevent it from <hi rend="superscript"> -</hi>
                    gliding inwards, in which direction the trunk, not supported by the opposite
                    limb, tends to impel it. Proceeding from below upwards, we find the lateral <hi
                    rend="italic">peronaei,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">vastus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >externus,</hi> and even the <hi rend="italic">rectus,</hi> draw the limb
                    outwards; while the <hi rend="italic">tensor vagina,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >femoris,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">glutaeus</hi><hi rend="italic">medius</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">minor,</hi> carry the pelvis, and with it the trunk, in
                    the same lateral direction. In this case the weight of the person is employed in
                    antagonizing the muscles of the side thrown into action; and the person is
                    balanced between these two forces.</p>
                <p>Elevation on the tip of the foot is effected chiefly by the action of the
                    muscles, which extend the <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> on the metatarsal
                    bones, viz. the <hi rend="italic">tibialis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >anticus,</hi><hi rend="italic">extensor hallucis, extensor</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">longus digitorum,</hi> and even the <hi rend="italic">extensor
                    brevis</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> all of which must fix the leg before, and
                    the tarsal and metatarsal part of the foot on its phalangeal region, before the
                    latter can be employed to elevate the person. These extensors, therefore,
                    perform in the tip-toe attitude the duty which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gastrocnemius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">solaeus</hi> execute behind in
                    ordinary station; and the smaller power <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040170?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0170-0797"/> of the former
                    readily explains the difficulty of maintaining this attitude for a long
                    time.</p>
                <p>Progression or gait <hi rend="italic">(incessus)</hi> consists in the anterior
                    propulsion of the person by the alternate propulsion of each pelvic extremity.
                    In this, therefore, not only are the muscles necessary to maintain the erect
                    position put in action, but those which bend the lower extremity on the trunk
                    operate on one side, while the extensors of the other maintain that extremity
                    for the instant fixed. Progression consists of a series of steps <hi
                    rend="italic">(passus)</hi>; and each step consists in the antero-posterior
                    separation of the pelvic extremities by the propulsion of one, while the other
                    remains fixed. Supposing the left foot to be the fixed one, the right foot is
                    elevated, and the leg is propelled by the contraction of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gemellus, solaeus,</hi><hi rend="italic">semitendinosus,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tibialis</hi><hi rend="italic">anticus</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">posticus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while at the same time the
                    extensors of the knee raise the leg, and the <hi rend="italic">psoas,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">iliacus,</hi><hi rend="italic">pectinaeus, triceps
                    adductor,</hi><hi rend="italic">sartorius</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >gracilis,</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">tensor vaginae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >femoris,</hi> raise and stretch the whole limb. When this is accomplished, the
                    right foot, with the knee extended, the elevating muscles being relaxed, and the
                    trunk, are inclined forwards, and the foot is planted at some distance before
                    the left.</p>
                <p>In this motion, however, in which the trunk is carried forward by the <hi
                    rend="italic">recti</hi> and <hi rend="italic">obliqui</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >abdominis,</hi> and downward by the <hi rend="italic">psoae</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">iliaci interni,</hi> and the leg by the long flexor and the
                    anterior <hi rend="italic">peronoeus,</hi> a fall would be the immediate result,
                    unless the knee, to preserve equilibrium, were somewhat bent, and the other foot
                    at the same time began to assume the same action. While the toes, therefore, are
                    forcibly impelled by their flexors to the ground, the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >gastrocnemii,</hi> the anterior and posterior <hi rend="italic">tibiales,</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">peronaei,</hi> elevate the foot with the sole
                    backward, and bend the knee, and the <hi rend="italic">psoas</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">iliacus</hi> raise and extend the whole member.</p>
                <p>Running differs from progression, not only in velocity, but in the mode of its
                    accomplishment. Not only are the pelvic extremities more inflected and moved
                    than in mere walking, but they remain inflected. Thus, while the trunk is
                    inclined forward on the pelvic extremities by the <hi rend="italic">recti
                    cruris,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">psoae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iliaci,</hi>

                    the leg, and the anterior <hi rend="italic">tibialis,</hi> great and small
                    extensors of the toes, and extensor of the great toe, are employed to bend the
                    foot and the phalanges on the metatarsal bones. The last action is essential to
                    running, which is always most perfect on the tip of the foot. In this movement
                    also the centre of gravity is constantly undergoing change, and is not only
                    carried forward, but makes a sort of undulating motion on each side, and above
                    and below the plane of motion. This is the effect of the pectoral extremities
                    being employed to balance the person.</p>
                <p>In leaping, the pelvic extremities are much inflected, and the sole of the foot
                    rendered tense, by the <hi rend="italic">gastrocnemius, solaeus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tibiales,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">peronaei,</hi> while the

                    <hi rend="italic">biceps</hi> in the pelvis.</p>
                <p>In dancing, the muscles are made to co-operatc in producing a number of
                    complicated motions. In most of the motions composing the dances practised in
                    ordinary society, while the muscles of the pectoral extremities are employed in
                    balancing the person, and those of the trunk in maintaining it in the erect
                    attitude, the flexors and extensors are employed to diduct, inflect, or extend;
                    to cross the extremities with more or less rapidity; and, while the extensors
                    and <hi rend="italic">tibialis</hi><hi rend="italic">anticus</hi> elevate the
                    person on tip-toe, the lateral <hi rend="italic">peronaei</hi> are employed to
                    evert the foot and point the toes.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II. THE ORGANS OF SENSATION.</p>
                <p>The organs of sensation may be distinguished into two orders, according as their
                    province is to recognise general or peculiar affections and qualities in
                    external objects. Thus, while it is the purpose of touch to recognise the
                    consistency, shape, and resistance of bodies, it communicates no information
                    regarding their colour, smell, or taste, or the effects which their collision
                    produces in the vibrations of the atmosphere. With these affections of the
                    material world man becomes acquainted by means of organs of a peculiar
                    construction, and adapted to receive the impressions occasioned by these
                    qualities. These organs are, for smell, the nostrils and their appendages; for
                    colour and the general purposes of sight, the eye; for taste, the palate and
                    mouth; and for sound, the ear. For the purposes of common sensation the skin is
                    the agent; but on the structure of this membrane it is unnecessary to add any
                    thing to what has been already said in the General Anatomy, unless that in
                    certain regions, for instance the tips of the fingers, the erectile arrangement
                    of the capillaries, with a minute distribution of nerves, and great thinness of
                    cuticle, communicates the delicacy necessary to the refined purposes of
                    tact.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. THE ORGAN OF SMELL; THE NASAL CAVITIES.</p>
                <p>The organ of smell consists of an external part for receiving and transmitting
                    substances capable of producing the sensation of smell; and an internal part, in
                    which this sensation takes place.</p>
                <p>The nose <hi rend="italic">(nasus),</hi> which constitutes the external part, is
                    a pyramidal eminence, bounded above by the forehead, below by the upper lip, and
                    on the sides by the orbits and cheeks. It has two anterior-inferior oval-shaped
                    lateral openings named the nostrils <hi rend="italic">(nares),</hi> separated by
                    a partition. It consists above of the nasal bones and the nasal processes of the
                    superior maxillary bones, covered by periosteum, cellular tissue, part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">compressor</hi><hi rend="italic">narium,</hi> and skin. Below,
                    it consists of membranous fibro-cartilages, attached to the nasal bone and
                    superior maxillary above and behind, and supported by a middle cartilage <hi
                    rend="italic">(septum</hi><hi rend="italic">narium),</hi> which rests on the
                    fissure of the <hi rend="italic">vomer</hi> below, and is fixed to the vertical
                    plate of the ethmoid bone above, and to which is attached a slip of
                    fibro-cartilage before, named <hi rend="italic">columna</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >nasi.</hi> The lateral fibro-cartilages, which are occasionally named wings <hi
                    rend="italic">(aloe nasi, pinnoe nasi),</hi> covered by cellular tissue,
                    muscles, and skin, liberally supplied by blood-vessels and sebaceous follicles,
                    are moved by the <hi rend="italic">levator, compressor,</hi> and two depressors.
                    These parts, with the middle <hi rend="italic">septum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >columna,</hi> are lined by a form of mucous membrane named the pituitary or
                    Schneiderian.</p>
                <p>To what was already said of the nasal cavities under the head of Osteology it is
                    superfluous to add any thing, unless what relates to the lining membrane, the
                    distribution of which is exactly according to the extent of the bony walls of
                    these cavities and their subdivisions.</p>
                <p>This membrane consists of two layers; a <hi rend="italic">fibrous,</hi> which is
                    the periosteum or perichondrium of the nasal cavities; and a <hi rend="italic"
                    >mucous,</hi> resembling the other forms of this tissue. It is soft, spongy,
                    red, and more or less vascular, with an attached and a free surface, the latter
                    secreting the thin mucus necessary to preserve the membrane in a proper state
                    for receiving odorous impressions. In this membrane<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040183?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0183-0798"/> mucous glands
                    are indistinct; but we recognise minute orifices or pores, which maybe the
                    follicular cavities ’on a small scale, or the orifices into which the mucous
                    fluid is poured after secretion by the arteries.</p>
                <p>This mucous membrane is supplied from the internal maxillary artery with
                    blood-vessels, which are at once abundant and superficial. These anastomose with
                    the infra-orbital and ethmoidal branches of the ophthalmic artery and some
                    others of the internal carotid. On these circumstances depends the frequency of
                    hemorrhages from this membrane in early life, while the capillary system is
                    energetically employed in the enlargement of the cranio-facial region; and in
                    advanced life, when venous <hi rend="italic">plethora</hi> is most conspicuously
                    evident in the vessels of the head.</p>
                <p>The nerves which supply the nasal cavities are the first or olfacient nerves
                    principally, the internal nasal of the ophthalmic, and several branches derived
                    from the sphenopalatine ganglion, the frontal, the great palatine, and the
                    vidian. The distribution of these nerves has been beautifully represented by
                    Scarpa (<hi rend="italic">Annot. Acad.),</hi> from whom fig. 1 and 2 of Plate
                    XXXIΠ. are imitated.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. THE ORGAN OF VISION; THE EYES.</p>
                <p>The eyes, placed in the orbits, are distinguished into the globes of the eyes,
                    and their appendages.</p>
                <p>The globe or ball of the eye, situate at the base of the orbit, has a spheroidal
                    shape, with the antero-posterior diameter longest, and varying in the adult from
                    10 to 11 lines. The direction of the eye differs from that of thę orbit, the
                    axis of which is oblique and convergent behind, while that of the two eyes is
                    parallel.</p>
                <p>The eye-ball <hi rend="italic">(bulbus oculi)</hi> consists of several membranes,
                    containing fluid or semifluid substances, denominated humours. The external and
                    strongest is the sclerotic, with the <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> enchased in
                    its anterior aperture; next is the choroid and retina; and the iris, a circular
                    membrane, with an annular aperture, is placed transversely across, dividing the
                    cavity into anterior and posterior chambers. The humours are the vitreous, the
                    crystalline lens, and the aqueous humour.</p>
                <p>The sclerotic, soπιetimes named <hi rend="italic">cornea opaca,</hi> in
                    contradistinction to the clear cornea, is shaped like a spherical shell,
                    truncated before, and is estimated to occupy about four fifths of the globe. Its
                    exterior surface is covered by the adipose matter of the orbit behind, and by
                    the tendons of the muscles of the eye and the ophthalmic <hi rend="italic"
                    >conjunctiva</hi> before. Its inner concave surface is lined by the choroid
                    coat. In its anterior opening, which is about six or seven lines diameter, the
                    cornea is enchased by imbrication of the sclerotic; and in a posterior opening
                    about one and a half line in diameter, the ophthalmic end of the optic nerve is
                    fixed. It is fibrous in structure, becoming translucent when immersed in oil of
                    turpentine. Its vessels are generally colourless, and it appears void of
                    nerves.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cornea,</hi> often named the clear or transparent <hi
                    rend="italic">cornea (cornea lucidα),</hi> to distinguish it from the opaque
                    cornea or sclerotic, which was supposed by the old anatomists to be of the same
                    nature, is a segment of a smaller sphere than that of the sclerotic, attached to
                    its anterior aperture, and occupying the anterior fifth of the eyeball. Before
                    it is covered by a thin pellicle continued from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conjunctiva,</hi> behind by the anterior part of the membrane of the aqueous
                    humour; and its circumference is inseparably enchased within that of the
                    anterior aperture of the sclerotic. The cornea consists of several concentric
                    layers of transparent homogeneous matter, void of vessels or nerves, closely
                    united, but separating and becoming opaque after death.</p>
                <p>The choroid coat <hi rend="italic">(tunica choroides)</hi> lines the inner
                    surface of the sclerotic, to which it adheres loosely, except at the insertion
                    of the optic nerve, where it has a posterior opening, yet may be easily
                    detached. The margin of its anterior opening, which is large, adheres to the
                    ciliary circle and processes, and appears to be continuous with the iris. The
                    outer surface is covered by a brownish-black viscid matter, which partly adheres
                    to the inner surface of the sclerotic. The inner surface, over which the <hi
                    rend="italic">retina</hi> is extended without adhesion, is covered by the same
                    brownish-black matter; but of this the retina receives none, as the sclerotic.
                    The choroid is a thin membrane, of a grayish colour when deprived of its brown
                    pigment, translucent, homogeneous, and, so far as observation goes, void of
                    fibres, but liberally supplied by minute blood-vessels, partly from the long,
                    chiefly from the posterior ciliaries, which, dividing on its outer surface into
                    numerous ramifications, mutually approximate, and anastomosing, form a network
                    of quadrilateral and trapezoidal meshes. The <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    Puyschiana</hi> is imaginary, unless this arrangement of capillary vessels be
                    such.</p>
                <p>From these vessels is derived the brownish-black matter <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pigmentum, nigrum)</hi> with which the retinal surface of the choroid is
                    covered. Its appearance on the convex or sclerotic surface is the effect of
                    cadaveric transudation. The nature of this colouring matter is imperfectly
                    known. When first secreted it is brown, but becomes black successively as it
                    continues. It is not affected by the action of light or caloric, and undergoes
                    no change from the operation of the mineral acids, <hi rend="italic">aqua
                    potassae,</hi> ammonia, and alcohol. It appears to consist chiefly of
                    carbonaceous matter. Menghini asserts that he has obtained from it minute
                    particles of iron attracted by the magnet.</p>
                <p>The anterior orifice of the choroid is firmly connected to a thick ring of
                    grayish pulpy substance, and forming the point at which the sclerotic and cornea
                    without, and the iris within, are united. This ring, named the ciliary circle
                    <hi rend="italic">(ligamentum ciliare),</hi> is readily detached from the
                    sclerotic. Its structure is unknown.</p>
                <p>Posterior to this is a range of prominent minute bodies, with free extremities,
                    lying over the crystalline lens, varying in number from seventy to eighty. These
                    are the ciliary processes <hi rend="italic">(processus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ciliares).</hi> They are trilateral-prismatic in shape, about a line and a half
                    long, more distinct and longer in the human eye than in those of most brute
                    animals. Their intimate structure is not very well known; but they are highly
                    vascular, and their vessels appear to be capable of occasional erection. (Plate
                    XXX. fig. 4∙)</p>
                <p>Anterior to the ciliary circle is the iris, a circular membrane, placed in the
                    transverse vertical position, with anterior and posterior surfaces, and a
                    circular opening in the centre. The exterior ciliary margin <hi rend="italic"
                    >(annulus major)</hi> is attached, as already stated, to the ciliary circle. The
                    inner or pupillar <hi rend="italic">(annulus minor)</hi> is free, and forms what
                    is named the pupil of the eye. The anterior surface is marked by a variety of
                    colours, blue, gray, or black, brown, or that peculiar brownish-black named
                    hazel, and which are not unfrequently allied with the tints of the skin and
                    hair. The same surface presents radiating lines, which pass from the small to
                    the large circle diverging. Both appearances are produced by vascular
                    arrangement. The posterior surface of the iris, which has been distinguished as
                    a separate membrane under the name of <hi rend="italic">uvea,</hi> is covered by
                    the same dark-coloured matter secreted by the Choroid, generally more abundant,
                    and of a deeper tint, than the pigment of that membrane. When this is removed by
                    washing, the observer recognises the radiated streaks impressed by the ciliary
                    processes. (Fig. 4.) <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040196?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0196-0799"/> The different characters of these two surfaces
                    have induced some anatomists to distinguish the iris into anterior 'and
                    posterior membranes. Though it has some thickness, this is perhaps a fanciful
                    refinement. The anterior surface, which is continuous with the membrane of the
                    aqueous humour, is different from the posterior, which is continuous with the
                    ciliary circle and choroid. The structure of the iris is chiefly vascular, and
                    its vessels have an; erectile arrangement. The long ciliaries, from which these
                    vessels are derived, divide each at the ciliary body into two branches, which
                    divaricating at obtuse angles, unite with several of the anterior ciliaries, and
                    form with them, beyond the ciliary ligament at the large circumference of the
                    iris, an arterial circle. From this arise smaller branches, which, crossing,
                    unite and form within this a second smaller arterial circle, midway between the
                    ciliary and central margin; and from the concavity of this proceed very minute
                    vessels, which radiate in a flexuous manner, and converge towards the pupil,
                    where, anastomosing most minutely, they form a third circle—the marginal ring of
                    that aperture.</p>
                <p>It is chiefly in the middle and inner anastomosing circles that the vessels
                    assume the erectile arrangement; and on this circumstance, and not on that of
                    muscular fibres, so often, so positively, so inconsistently, and so erroneously
                    maintained to exist in the iris, does the mobility of that singular membrane
                    depend. On exposure to direct or bright light, on the application of vinegar,
                    alcohol, or any stimulating substance to the eye, and during the presence of
                    inflammation, the erectile capillaries, distended with blood, arc elongated, and
                    necessarily contract the pupillary aperture. In the dark, under the influence of
                    henbane <hi rend="italic">(hyoscyamus niger),</hi> deadly night-shade <hi
                    rend="italic">(atropa belladonna),</hi> and some other narcotics, and when the
                    retina is insensible, these vessels seem to lose their faculty of distension,
                    and, perfectly empty and shrunk, allow the pupillar margin to approach the
                    ciliary.</p>
                <p>. The retina, which is the third and internal tunic, is of the same shape as the
                    choroid, thin, like cobweb, whitish, translucent, inclining to transparent, and
                    very delicate. Its extreme tenuity and looseness from the choroid causes it to
                    collapse unless inspected under water, when it may be unfolded and expanded for
                    examination. Its outer surface is covered by a very delicate membrane, visible
                    only in a very recent eye, discovered by Mr Jacob of Dublin. It is almost void
                    of red vessels, unless at the part where the optic nerve enters, where one or
                    two from the central artery may be seen. The others are colourless. The
                    assertion that this membrane is an expansion or production from the optic nerve,
                    seems to be gratuitous; for it bears no resemblance to nervous matter, or to the
                    appearance of the optic nerve. It appears to be simply a peculiarly delicate
                    transparent web, fitted to receive the impressions of luminous rays, and to
                    communicate them to the optic nerve, with which it is continuous.</p>
                <p>On this membrane, about two lines on the temporal side of the optic nerve, and in
                    the axis of the ball, is a circular yellow spot <hi rend="italic"
                    >(macula</hi><hi rend="italic">lutea),</hi> from about a line to a line and a
                    half in diameter, with a minute point or hole in its centre <hi rend="italic"
                    >(foramen centrale).</hi> At this part the retina is much thinner than at any
                    other; and even in the most recent eyes it presents loose folds, which Bichat
                    regards as cadaveric. The yellow spot and its central hole are seen in none of
                    the mammalia except man and the monkeys.</p>
                <p>The vitreous humour, occupying about three posterior fourths of the eye, is
                    spherical and convex behind and on its lateral circumference, but concave before
                    for receiving the posterior part of the crystalline lens. Contiguous only to the
                    retina, it is attached to the coats by the branch sent from the central artery
                    to the lens. It is transparent, and consists of two parts, an investing
                    membrane, the hyaloid <hi rend="italic">(membrana hyaloidea),</hi> and inclosed
                    fluid. This membrane is not single, but, sending numerous partitions from its
                    inner surface, forms an assemblage of cells in which the fluid is contained.
                    These facts may be demonstrated by incision, bruising the humour, by
                    congelation, or by boiling it. Before, at the outline of the lens, this membrane
                    divides into two folds, one of which is stretched before the capsule, and the
                    other behind. The trilateral-prismatic space resulting from this separation is
                    completed by the capsule, and forms the circular canal of Petit, which is
                    without fluid, and which is demonstrated by inflation. On the anterior fold the
                    ciliary processes are stretched. The structure of the hyaloid membrane is little
                    known; but it is believed to consist of exhalant arteries and colourless
                    veins.</p>
                <p>The hyaloid fluid may be separated from the membrane either by incisions or
                    compressing it between two folds of linen. It then has the appearance of a clear
                    but somewhat viscid fluid, like gum diluted with water. Though rendered slightly
                    turbid by boiling water, acids, and alcohol, it does not coagulate,—a phenomenon
                    which is to be ascribed to the small proportion of albumen which it contains.
                    According to the analysis of Berzelius, 100 parts contain 98∙4 of water, ∙16 of
                    albumen, 1∙42 of muriates and lactates, and only <hi rend="subscript"> 3</hi><hi
                    rend="superscript"> j</hi> θth of a part of soda.</p>
                <p>The crystalline lens, which is transparent and shaped like an oblate spheroid, is
                    situate in the posterior chamber, and in the anterior depression of the vitreous
                    humour, to which the convexity of its posterior surface corresponds. Before also
                    it is prominent and convex; and it is partially covered by the free extremities
                    of the ciliary processes. It consists of two parts, an inclosing capsule and a
                    lens proper.</p>
                <p>The capsule is usually distinguished into anterior and posterior walls, both
                    covered by hyaloid membrane, both transparent, and both firm and resisting. By
                    boiling water, alcohol, or the acids, it is rendered opaque, whitish, and horny;
                    and it becomes yellow by contact with the air.</p>
                <p>The lens, which is perfectly transparent, consists of two portions; an exterior,
                    peripheral, thick, soft, adhesive, and easily removed; an interior, central,
                    solid, and consisting of concentric plates. Both are indurated and rendered
                    opaque by boiling water, alcohol, and dilute acids; but the central nucleus is
                    the firmest. When dried in the air it becomes yellowish, but retains its
                    transparency, and may bc preserved for years. These phenomena are to be ascribed
                    to the presence of a peculiar form of albumen. According to the analysis of
                    Berzelius, 100 parts of the substance of the lens consist of 58∙ of water 35∙9
                    of peculiar matter, chiefly albuminous, 2∙4 of muriates, lactates, and animal
                    matter soluble in alcohol, l∙3 of animal matter soluble in water, and 2∙4 of
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>The lens possesses a high refracting power; and its chief use is to concentrate
                    the luminous rays within the eye, so as to represent distinctly the image of
                    visible objects on the retina. Spherical and transparent in early life, it is
                    flattened and acquires a yellowish tint in old age.</p>
                <p>Between the capsule and lens is found occasionally a fluid which has been named
                    <hi rend="italic">liquor Morgagni.</hi> It appears to be the effect of
                    transudation.</p>
                <p>On the structure of the lens, whether organic or not, anatomists vary. Vessels
                    have not been recognised in it; and the most rational view is, that it is the
                    product of an organic action probably in the capsule.</p>
                <p>. The aqueous humour is contained in the anterior chamber, and in that part of
                    the posterior which surrounds the anterior surface of the lens and vitreous
                    humour. It con-šists<pb break="no" facs="nls:193040209?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0209-0800"/> of 98T0 parts in the 100 of water, a trace of
                    albumen, and about 2 parts of muriates and lactates of soda. It is contained in
                    a membrane, which lines the posterior surface of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornea,</hi> and is supposed to cover the anterior surface of the iris. This,
                    however, is questionable. In 1768 a membrane of this kind was described by
                    Demours and Descemet, both of whom claimed the discovery with great eagerness
                    and some animosity. These rival anatomists appear to have forgotten that the
                    aqueous humour may be secreted as well by the cornea and iris as by a proper
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>The relation of the coats and humours of the eye to each other may be understood
                    by the diagram (fig. 3, Plate XXX.), where A is the anterior chamber, P the
                    posterior, L the lens, and c, c the ciliary processes. The other parts are
                    easily understood from the foregoing description.</p>
                <p>The eye is supplied with blood chiefly by the ophthalmic artery.</p>
                <p>The eyeball, thus constituted, is moved in different directions by six muscles,
                    is moistened externally by fluid •secreted from a particular gland, and is
                    protected from external bodies by the eyelids and their appendages.</p>
                <p>Of the muscles, four are straight and two oblique. The former <hi rend="italic"
                    >(attollens,</hi><hi rend="italic">depressor, adductor, abductor),</hi> attached
                    to the margin of the optic hole, and terminating in tendons inserted into the
                    superior, inferior, nasal, and temporal parts of the eyeball, raise, depress,
                    adduct and abduct the organ. Of the two latter, the superior oblique <hi
                    rend="italic">(troch-ledris),</hi> which is attached to the margin of the same
                    hole, passes through a pulley-like cartilage at the inner margin of the vault of
                    the orbit, and is inserted into the internal region of the ball, rolls the eye
                    forward and inward, and turns the pupil outwards and downwards; while the
                    inferior oblique, attached to the orbitar process of the superior maxillary
                    bone, and inserted between the adductor and the optic nerve, rolls it forwards
                    and turns the pupil upwards. These muscles, which occupy the apex of the orbit,
                    are surrounded by a thick cushion of fat, on which the eyeball rolls in its
                    movements. (Plate XXXIII. fig. 6.)</p>
                <p>In the hollow, at the outer temporal region of the orbitar vault, is placed the
                    lacrymal gland, a granular grayish body, about the size of a bean, consisting of
                    lobules, with arteries in the intermediate furrows, derived from a branch of the
                    ophthalmic, and accompanying veins. (Plate XXXIII. fig. 5 and 7, G, g.) These
                    constituent lobules have been represented, on the authority of Steno in the ox,
                    and the elder Monro in the human subject, to terminate in 7 or 8 minute
                    excretory ducts, opening on the <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva.</hi> In man,
                    however, they were sought in vain by Duverney, Morgagni, Haller, and Zinn; and
                    neither Portal nor Bichat have been able to satisfy themselves of the existence
                    of these ducts. It is nevertheless certain that the lacrymal gland secretes the
                    tears, and that the latter issue from its lobules.</p>
                <p>The eyes are covered anteriorly by two musculo-mem- branous folds named the
                    eyelids <hi rend="italic">(palpebrae),</hi> attached to the margins of the
                    orbit, and forming by their free margin the palpebral opening, with commissures
                    at each angle <hi rend="italic">(canthus nasalis, et canthus
                    temporalis).</hi></p>
                <p> The upper eyelid, which is large, is bounded above by the eyebrow <hi
                    rend="italic">(supercilium),</hi> a cutaneous eminence, arched transversely,
                    covered with hairs, and with the <hi rend="italic">corrugator supercilii</hi>
                    attached to its nasal end. Between each eyebrow is a smooth space, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">glabella</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mesophryon.</hi> Into the upper
                    eyelid the levator (fig. 5, L) is inserted.</p>
                <p>Each eyelid consists of skin externally, mucous membrane within <hi rend="italic"
                    >(conjunctiva),</hi> intermediate cellular tissue, muscle, and a fibrous
                    membrane, attached by one margin to the base of the orbit, and terminating by
                    the other in the tarsal fibro-cartilages. These are crescentic bodies placed in
                    the free margin of the eyelids, and by then-firmness and elasticity giving the
                    requisite tension to the eyelids when the orbicular muscle acts, or the <hi
                    rend="italic">levator</hi> is relaxed. The cutaneous border of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tarsi</hi> is occupied by a range of short, firm hairs, named the
                    eyelashes <hi rend="italic">(cilia).</hi> In the mucous borders are the orifices
                    of the tarsal or Meibomian follicles, of the same character as the muciparous
                    follicles generally. These are placed in the substance of the eyelid, beneath
                    the <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva,</hi> and behind the tarsal fibro-cartilages.
                    From the inner surface of the eyelids the palpebral <hi rend="italic"
                    >conjunctiva</hi> is continued over the anterior part of the sclerotic and
                    cornea, forming the ophthalmic <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva.</hi></p>
                <p>In the nasal angle is lodged a minute red body, named the caruncle <hi
                    rend="italic">(caruncula lacrymalis),</hi> chiefly consisting of filamentous
                    tissue and vessels covered by mucous membrane; and behind this is a fold of the
                    membrane, which has been named <hi rend="italic">membrana nictitans,</hi> large
                    in the lower animals, but often so imperfect in man as to be merely
                    rudimentary.</p>
                <p>At the nasal end of each eyelid is a minute capillary] orifice which leads into a
                    horizontal canal, terminating in t a membranous sac lodged in the depression of
                    the lacrymal bone. These orifices, which are named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >puncta</hi><hi rend="italic">lacry-malia</hi><hi rend="italic">(p,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">p,</hi> fig. 5), are the superior or palpebral openings of the
                    lacrymal sac and passages, the lower aperture of which is found in the inferior
                    nasal <hi rend="italic">meatus.</hi> The tears effused from the lacrymal gland
                    at the temporal region of the orbit are carried, by the frequent action of the
                    orbicular muscle, over the ball, till they reach the nasal angle, where they are
                    gradually absorbed by the capillary orifices of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >puηctα,</hi> and conveyed into the sac, and eventually to the nose.</p>
                <p>The eye derives nerves from six different sources, all of which, however, may be
                    distinguished into three classes, the sensitive, motive, and entrophic nerves.
                    The first consists of the second, optic or the proper visual nerves. The second
                    class comprehends the third, fourth, and sixth nerves, of which the third or
                    oculo-muscular are distributed to the <hi rend="italic">levator
                    palpebrae</hi><hi rend="italic">superioris,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >attollens,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">adductor,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >depressor,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">obliquus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >inferior</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the fourth is entirely distributed to the
                    <hi rend="italic">obliquus</hi><hi rend="italic">superior</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> while the sixth pair are confined to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >abductor.</hi> The third class of nerves is derived from the ophthalmic or
                    quadrilateral ganglion, which is formed chiefly from the junction of a
                    sub-branch of the naso-ocular branch of the first or ophthalmic division of the
                    fifth pair, with a small branch of the third nerve. From this arise a small
                    superior cluster of three nerves adhering to the optic, and a large inferior
                    cluster of eight or ten nerves, which quickly join the ciliary arteries, and are
                    with them distributed in the ciliary circle and posterior part of the iris. (
                    Plate XXXIII. fig. 7.) From the other branch of the naso-ocular nerve, the
                    caruncle and lacrymal canal, with the orbicular muscle and <hi rend="italic"
                    >epicranius</hi> on the one hand, and the lacrymal gland on the other, receive
                    nervous filaments.</p>
                <p>SECT. III. THE ORGAN OF HEARING; THE EAR.</p>
                <p>The organ of hearing consists of the auricle or external ear, with the ear-hole;
                    the middle ear, including the tympanal cavity and its appendages; and the
                    internal ear or labyrinth.</p>
                <p>The auricle is a fibro-cartilaginous substance, moulded into a conchoidal shape,
                    covered by skin, attached to the cranium by ligaments, and susceptible of motion
                    by muscles. It is common to distinguish in it the following parts. The <hi
                    rend="italic">helix,</hi> a semicircular eminence above the earhole; the groove
                    of the <hi rend="italic">helix</hi> below it; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >antihelix,</hi> an eminence commencing in the groove by a superior, broad, <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193040222?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0222-0801"/>
                    oblique portion, and an inferior, narrow, horizontal one; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">navicularis;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tragus,</hi> an anterior eminence below; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >antitragtιs,</hi> a smaller eminence behind; the lobule, a pendulous body at
                    the base behind; and, lastly, the <hi rend="italic">concha,</hi> a deep conoidal
                    cavity leading to the ear-hole.</p>
                <p>The latter is a canal about 10 or 12 lines long in the adult. Twisted at first
                    obliquely forward and upward, it bends slightly backwards and downwards, forming
                    a Convexity of incurvation above, and a concavity below. Though the extremities
                    are large, the middle is contracted; and it cannot be termed cylindrical, for
                    its section is elliptical or oval. The structure of this tube is
                    fibro-cartilaginous externally where it adheres to the bone, lined by skin
                    passing into mucous membrane, and occupied by minute follicles <hi rend="italic"
                    >(glandules</hi><hi rend="italic">ceruminosa;),</hi> which secrete the wax <hi
                    rend="italic">(cerumen)</hi> formed in this canal. The nature of this secretion
                    is imperfectly known. Though, like oil, it stains paper, it is partly soluble in
                    tepid water, and forms with it a yellow emulsion. It is secreted at first fluid,
                    and acquires consistence by exposure to air and admixture with dust. Alcohol
                    has. little influence on it. The internal extremity of the auditory canal is
                    bounded by the vertical membrane of the <hi rend="italic">tympanum.</hi></p>
                <p>Within this is the tympanal cavity, a space of an irregular cylindrical shape,
                    directed obliquely, nearly in the axis of the pyramidal portion, in the base of
                    which it is contained. This cavity is shut up externally by the vertical
                    tympanal membrane <hi rend="italic">(membrana tympani),</hi> and is bounded
                    within by the bony partition which separates it from the labyrinth. The <hi
                    rend="italic">membrana,</hi> which is oval-shaped, or nearly round, and attached
                    to the margin of the <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >externus,</hi> is directed obliquely downwards and inwards, and is so delicate
                    that it is difficult to determine its structure in the human subject. In the
                    elephant, however, and Other large animals, it presents radiating fibres, which
                    are believed to be muscular (Plate XXXVII. fig. 14); and Sir E. Home represents
                    it as such not only in the elephant and whale, but in the human subject. The
                    outer part is evidently a sort of epidermis, continuous with that of the canal;
                    the inner is a mucous epidermis, continuous with that of the tympanal cavity;
                    and between these the muscular fibres are interposed.</p>
                <p>ι The tympanal cavity communicates behind with the mastoid cells, and before and
                    internally by the Eustachian tube, with the pharynx. This tube is estimated to
                    be two inches in length, of which one and a half is in the bone of the pyramid,
                    and about half an inch at its extremity, with the upper side completed by
                    cartilage. Narrow at the tympanal end, it becomes wide and capacious towards the
                    pharyngeal, and presents at length a free open extremity, forming a fissure at
                    the upper and lateral part of the <hi rend="italic">pharynx.</hi> The
                    cartilaginous end is covered by mucous membrane continuous with the pharyngeal,
                    and is surrounded by the <hi rend="italic">peristaphylini,</hi> the action of
                    which is believed to separate the walls of the aperture. Within the tube, and
                    towards the tympanal end, this membrane parts with its pharyngeal spongy
                    character, and becomes thin and semitransparent where it lines the bone. The
                    same kind of membrane, partaking of the characters of periosteum and mucous, is
                    continued over the tympanal cavity, and into the mastoid cells.</p>
                <p>Above the Eustachian tube is a thin osseous plate, which separates it from a
                    small canal, convex below, concave above, and which, commencing in the fissure
                    between the squamous and pyramidal portions, terminates in the tympanal cavity.
                    In this canal is lodged the internal muscle of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >malleus,</hi> one of the tympanal bones.</p>
                <p>These are four in number, very minute, and denominated, from their mechanical
                    figures, the hammer <hi rend="italic">(mal</hi><hi rend="italic">letis),</hi>
                    the anvil <hi rend="italic">(incus),</hi> the lenticular or round bone <hi
                    rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic">orbiculare),</hi> and the stirrup <hi
                    rend="italic">(stapes).</hi> Of these the <hi rend="italic">malleus</hi> is
                    attached to the vertical membrane by its handle, while its head is articulated
                    with the body of the <hi rend="italic">incus.</hi> The latter presents two limbs
                    or branches, to the larger of which the <hi rend="italic">stapes</hi> is
                    articulated by the interposition of the lenticular bone; while the base of the
                    former rests on the membrane of the <hi rend="italic">foramen ovale.</hi> These
                    articulations are secured by capsules, which allow the bones to move freely on
                    each other; and for this purpose the <hi rend="italic">stapes</hi> is provided
                    with one muscle, and the <hi rend="italic">malleus</hi> with two, an internal
                    already mentioned, and an external passing from the spinous process of the
                    sphenoid bone to the slender process of the <hi rend="italic">malleus.</hi> On
                    the motions of these, however, and their part in the process of hearing, we have
                    only conjectural statements.</p>
                <p>The internal bony wall of the tympanal cavity presents two apertures and a convex
                    intermediate eminence. Of the apertures, the first, which is named the oval or
                    vestibular aperture <hi rend="italic">(foramen ovale, fenestra</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ovalis),</hi> is situate above, oval transversely, with its great
                    diameter horizontal antero-posterior. It communicates with the vestibule, but is
                    closed by a fine membrane, to which the base of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stapes</hi> is fixed, and for the insertion of which its margin is grooved. The
                    oval aperture is bounded above by a round prominence, corresponding within to
                    the Fallopian aqueduct, and below by a large convex eminence named the
                    promontory <hi rend="italic">(promontorium),</hi> which indicates the situation
                    of the cavity named the vestibule. Before and above the promontory is the
                    extremity of the thin osseous plate which separates the Eustachian tube from the
                    canal of the internal muscle of the <hi rend="italic">malleus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and behind is an oblique cavity, which is placed between
                    the lower entrance of the mastoid cells and the pyramid. Below the promontory is
                    the round or cochlear aperture <hi rend="italic">(foramen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rotundum,</hi><hi rend="italic">fenestra rotunda),</hi> trilateral in early
                    life rather than round, and still preserving in the adult the tendency to this
                    shape; smaller than the oval, and directed backwards and outwards. The round
                    aperture is shut by a membrane, the direction of which is oblique to that of the
                    tympanum, and one side of which is towards that cavity, while the other forms
                    part of the <hi rend="italic">cochlea.</hi></p>
                <p>At the upper part of the tympanum is a triangularshaped opening, which leads into
                    a rough short canal, <hi rend="superscript"> ι</hi> terminating in the mastoid
                    cells. These are analogous to the cells of the ethmoid, sphenoid, and occipital
                    bones. They are lined by fibro-mucous membrane, and their use is to afford a
                    posterior sonorous apartment for the vibrations produced in the tympanal
                    cavity.</p>
                <p>Near this triangular opening is a small bony process named the pyramidal, in
                    which is a canal for the fleshy part of the <hi rend="italic">stapedius,</hi>
                    while the tendon issues from its orifice. Near the base of the pyramidal process
                    is the hole by which the nerve of the <hi rend="italic">tympanum (chorda</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tympani)</hi> passes through the glenoid fissure.</p>
                <p>The labyrinth consists of the vestibule, three semicircular canals, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">cochlea.</hi></p>
                <p>By removing the <hi rend="italic">stapes</hi> and stapedial membrane the oval
                    aperture is opened, and communicates with the vestibule. This cavity, which is
                    irregular in shape, about the size of a grain of barley, is bounded without by
                    the <hi rend="italic">tympanum,</hi> within by the internal auditory canal,
                    before by the <hi rend="italic">cochlea,</hi> behind by the semicircular canals,
                    and above and below by the solid bone of the pyramid. It is lined by a membrane
                    common to the whole labyrinth. Besides the oval aperture by which it is
                    separated from the <hi rend="italic">tympanum,</hi> it has, above, the two
                    anterior openings <hi rend="italic">(ampulluloe)</hi> of the superior vertical
                    and horizontal canals; behind, the two openings <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ampullulce)</hi> proper to the posterior vertical and horizontal canals, and
                    the common opening of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040235?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0235-0802"/> two vertical canals; and before and below, the
                    orifice of the external <hi rend="italic">scala</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cochleae.</hi></p>
                <p>There is still another aperture, which leads into a canal discovered by Cotugno,
                    named the aqueduct of the vestibule. This, which, though distinct in some
                    subjects, is almost imperceptible in others, is near the common orifice of the
                    vertical canals; and from it the aqueduct proceeds first upwards, where it is
                    narrow, then backwards and downwards, widening, and terminates in the fissure on
                    the posterior surface of the pyramidal portion.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">semicircular canals,</hi> situate behind the vestibule, are
                    three in number, two vertical and one horizontal. Of the former, one is
                    superior, inclosing by its curvature the substance of the pyramid, and forming a
                    convexity in the adult, very distinct in the foetus; while the other, which is
                    posterior but inferior, is placed with its plane corresponding to that of the
                    posterior surface of the pyramid. The third is placed horizontally between the
                    other two, forming a curvature with the convexity towards the base of the
                    pyramid. (Plate XXXIII. fig. 8, 9, and 10.)</p>
                <p>Though denominated semicircular, these canals are larger than semicircular, and
                    may be compared to hollow cylinders, incurvated so as to form large circular
                    segments. Each canal has an enlarged extremity named <hi rend="italic"
                    >ampullula</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and as these two vertical canals have
                    one in common, there are five <hi rend="italic">ampullulae.</hi> They are lined
                    by the common labyrinthine membrane, and contain a pellucid fluid.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cochlea,</hi> which forms the third part of the labyrinth,
                    is a conical canal turned spirally within itself, so that its base is at the
                    lower part of the vestibule, and its apex at the anterior side of the pyramid,
                    with the orifices for the auditory nerve inclosed in the centre of its turns,
                    while the convexity is directed towards the lower margin of the pyramid. The
                    cochlear canal is divided longitudinally by a thin sharp-edged plate, half bony
                    half membranous, into two independent cavities, the superior of which
                    communicates with the vestibule, while the inferior is bounded by the membrane
                    of the round aperture. These cavities are distinguished as the vestibular and
                    tympanal <hi rend="italic">(scala vestibuli</hi> and <hi rend="italic">scala
                    tympani)</hi> respectively. At the top they terminate in a common cavity named
                    the funnel <hi rend="italic">(jnfundibulum).</hi> Both are lined by a delicate
                    membrane, in which are contained the ramified filaments of the eighth or
                    auditory nerve. (Plate XXXIII. fig. 10.)</p>
                <p>In the tympanal <hi rend="italic">scala,</hi> near the round hole, is a minute
                    aperture leading to a narrow canal, which gradually enlarges as it ascends, till
                    it terminates by a slit on the posterior surface of the pyramidal portion, as
                    formerly mentioned. ' This is the aqueduct of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cochlea,</hi> first described, like that of the vestibule, by Cotugno.</p>
                <p>These different cavities are supplied with blood chiefly &gt;from minute branches
                    of the auditory, a vessel generally derived from the basilar trunk or the
                    vertebral arteries. From the meningeal artery also minute branches enter the
                    auditory canal, and anastomose with those of the auditory artery; and the
                    internal carotid sends to the membrane of the tympanal cavity a branch, the
                    capillary ramifications of which anastomose with those derived from the
                    pharyngeal, transmitted by the walls of the Eustachian tube.</p>
                <p>The eighth or the proper auditory nerve enters the cochlea by several minute
                    apertures in the internal <hi rend="italic">meαtus,</hi> and is divided into <hi
                    rend="italic">two fasciculi,</hi> of which the posterior and largest is expanded
                    in the form of soft pulpy brush-like filaments, like a hair-pencil, in a
                    pellucid fluid, in the <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    while the smallest, which is anterior, is distributed partly to the bottom of
                    the hemispherical cavity of the vestibule, partly to the beginning of the spiral
                    lamina. “The tympanal cavity is chiefly for the purpose of conveying and
                    augmenting the intensity of sonorous vibrations, while the shape of the auricle
                    is ⅛upposed to collect' them. But of the mechanism of its operation we know
                    nothing satisfactory. The essential part of the organ of hearing is the
                    labyrinth.</p>
                <p>SECT. IV. THE ORGAN OF TASTE.</p>
                <p>It is impossible to define the exact limits of the sense of taste. More or less
                    diffused over the cavity of the mouth, it is particularly confined to the tongue
                    and palate. The former, nevertheless, is remarkable for being a muscular organ,
                    which combines with the faculty of taste the power of prehension and
                    transmission of the alimentary articles both during and after mastication, and
                    is further an essential agent in the faculty of articulation. It is requisite,
                    therefore, to give a short account of the mouth, the palate, and the tongue.</p>
                <p>a. The mouth is the cavity formed by the lips before, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pharynx</hi> and <hi rend="italic">isthmus</hi><hi rend="italic">faucium</hi>
                    behind, the palatine vault above, the intramaxillary membrane and muscles below,
                    and on the sides by the cheeks. Its horizontal direction may be regarded as one
                    among other proofs of the necessity of the erect biped attitude.</p>
                <p>The mouth is lined by a mucous membrane, soft, spongy, red, and vascular. It may
                    be traced from the inner or alveolar surface of the lips to the inner surface of
                    the cheeks on each side over the gums, where it is continuous with that of the
                    alveolar <hi rend="italic">folliculi,</hi> over the inner surface of each
                    maxillary <hi rend="italic">ramus,</hi> and the attached muscles and glands
                    below, until it is identified with that of the tongue, and above over the
                    palatine vault back to the <hi rend="italic">uvula.</hi> In these several
                    points, though its organization is the same, its mechanical arrangement varies
                    considerably as the parts are fixed or movable. Thus, on the palatine vault and
                    at the gums it is tense, and adheres pretty firmly to the fibrous layers forming
                    the periosteum of these parts. In the angular space between the lips and gums,
                    however, in that between the inner surface of the alveolar arch, and all over
                    the lower part of the mouth, where it is connected to the inferior surface of
                    the tongue, it is extensive, loose, moves easily over an abundant layer of
                    filamentous tissue, and is generally disposed in irregular folds. Adhering to
                    the internal spine of the lower jaw, a fold or duplicature containing
                    condensedfilamentous tissue is reflected, to be attached to the median line of
                    the tongue, and forms the <hi rend="italic">frenum</hi> of that organ. In all
                    points it abounds with muciparous follicles. It also presents on each side of
                    the tongue the orifices of the sublingual glands.</p>
                <p>The mouth has two outlets, an anterior or facial formed <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> by the lips <hi rend="italic">(labia),</hi> and a posterior or pharyngeal
                    formed by the <hi rend="italic">velum</hi><hi rend="italic">palatinum</hi> and
                    its appendages.</p>
                <p>The lips are musculo-membranous folds, attached all' round to the superior and
                    inferior jaw-bones, above and below the alveolar arches, and parted by a
                    transverse opening or fissure into upper and lower, with right and left
                    commissures or angles <hi rend="italic">(canthi).</hi> In the Negro race they

                <p>The point of union between the skin and oral mucous membrane is marked by a

                    labial ends of the common levators <hi rend="italic">(levator</hi><hi

                    zygomatics.</p>
                <p>The lips are supplied with blood from the branches of the external carotid. The
                    external maxillary sends a large branch over the angle of the inferior jaw,
                    upwards and forwards to the labial commissures on each side. This vessel, which

                <p>The lips derive their nerves partly from the superior maxillary, partly from the

                    membranous fold attached to the posterior margin of the palatine quadrilateral
                    bones, and hanging with its free margin downwards. This curtain, which has two
                    surfaces, an anterior or oral and a posterior or pharygneal, is shaped like a
                    double arch, meeting on the mesial plane, where it terminates in an elongated
                    conical prominence, supposed to resemble a grape suspended by its stalk, and
                    denominated therefore <hi rend="italic">τιvula (orα&lt;f&gt;υλr1),</hi> but
                    which, with the lateral arches,bears a closer resemblance to the dcseending cusp
                    of a Gothic window. From this central process the arch rises on each side; and
                    when it passes to the outer edge of the palate-bone on each side, it is
                    supported by two musculo-membranous vertical columns, united at the top, but
                    separating and forming an intermediate cavity, in which the tonsil on each side
                    <hi rend="italic">(amygdala)</hi> is contained.</p>
                <p>The palatine curtain consists of two folds of mucous membrane, with interposed
                    filamentous tissue and muscular fibres. The anterior mucous membrane is of the
                    same character with that of the mouth, with which it is continuous. The
                    posterior, which is continuous with the nasal mucous membrane, partakes of the
                    characters of that tissue, and is redder and more vascular. These two meet in
                    the lower margin of the <hi rend="italic">velum,</hi> and pass into each other.
                    Both arc well supplied with mucous follicles, but the anterior or oral division
                    most copiously.</p>
                <p>These mucous membranes rest on filamentous tissue; and beneath this we find, in
                    the middle, the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi> or <hi rend="italic">azygos

                    and regulate its motions.</p>
                <p>Between the internal <hi rend="italic">peristaphylini,</hi> which are immediately
                    below the pituitary or posterior mucous membrane of the velum and the anterior,
                    is an aponeurotic web, connected with the <hi rend="italic">circumflexi,</hi>
                    which, fixed to the margin of the palatine vault, tends to consolidate the <hi
                    rend="italic">velum.</hi></p>
                <p>The free margin of the <hi rend="italic">velum</hi> forms the upper boundary of
                    the posterior or pharyngeal opening of the mouth, while the upper surface of the
                    base of the tongue forms the lower boundary. The size of this opening, which is
                    usually named the isthmus of the throat <hi rend="italic">(isthmus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">faucium),</hi> varies according to the state of the <hi

                    deglutition the <hi rend="italic">velum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uvula</hi>
                    are raised by the <hi rend="italic">peristaphylinus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >internus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">azygos uvulae,</hi> and the whole curtain
                    is constricted by the <hi rend="italic">constrictor isthmi faucium</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">pharyngo-staphylinus.</hi> In the act of vomiting it is forcibly
                    drawn up against the posterior nasal openings by these muscles; but
                    notwithstanding this, matters from the stomach are occasionally projected
                    through the nostrils. In singing on false notes the <hi rend="italic">uvula</hi>
                    is progressively elevated, as the voice ascends.</p>
                <p>In the space between the anterior and posterior pillars are contained the tonsils
                    <hi rend="italic">(tonsilloe, amygdaloe),</hi> bounded above by the commissure
                    of the pillars; below by the lateral part of the base of the tongue, where they
                    are continuous with the muciparous glands of that organ; before by part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">constrictor</hi><hi rend="italic">isthmi faucium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and behind by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pharyngo-staphylinus.</hi> The shape varies in different individuals, though
                    their pendulous attachment gives them the oblong spheroidal or almond-like
                    shape. They consist of several lobules, grayish, soft, and of structure similar
                    to that of the muciparous glands of the tongue. The lobules present minute
                    cavities, isolated or mutually communicating, in the reeess of which are minute
                    pores, the orifices of the excretory ducts, and from which a watery but viscid
                    liquor may be expressed. In short, each tonsil may be regarded as an assemblage
                    of muciparous glands, destined to secrete fluid for lubricating the throat
                    during the process of deglutition, when it is most abundant.</p>
                <p>The chops <hi rend="italic">(buccoe)</hi> or lateral walls of the mouth consist
                    externally of skin, internally of mucous membrane and of an intcrmediąte layer
                    of muscles imbedded in abundant filamentous and adipose tissue.</p>
                <p>The cutaneous covering is in general thin, soft, and peculiarly smooth, with a
                    minutely distributed and abundant capillary system, which approaches in its
                    characters to the erectile.</p>
                <p>Beneath the cutaneous covering is the <hi rend="italic">zygomaticus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">major,</hi> the only muscle proper to the cheek, resting on a
                    thick layer of fat; below this is the <hi rend="italic">buccinator,</hi>
                    perforated by the parotid duct; and to the filamentous tissue inside, the buccal
                    mucous membrane, furnished with numerous muciparous follicles, adheres. The
                    orifice of the parotid duct is seen oppoşite the second molar tooth of the
                    superior jaw.</p>
                <p>c. The tongue is a longitudinal muscular organ, invested by a mucous membrane
                    provided with numerous <hi rend="italic">papilloe,</hi> attached behind to the
                    hyoid bone, below to the mucous membrane of the mouth, and free above and
                    before. It is shaped like a flattened cone, and is distinguished into a base and
                    tip <hi rend="italic">(apex),</hi> an upper and a lower surface, and two
                    sides.</p>
                <p>The base is somewhat thick and broad, but becomes thin and narrow near the hyoid
                    bone. From about I inch anterior to this, however, to near l£ from the tip, the
                    thickness and breadth are nearly uniform. The tip <hi rend="italic">(apex)</hi>
                    is flat and rounded or paraboloid in ordinary circumstances, but may be made by
                    muscular action to taper to an angular point. The upper surface, which is free,
                    presents the lingual mucous membrane divided into right and left halves by a
                    superficial furrow. On this, near its posterior end, is a depression, variable
                    in size, named <hi rend="italic">the foramen coecum,</hi> in which are contained
                    the orifices of muciparous follicles. From this on each side proceeds an oblique
                    line diverging forward, and forming -with that of the opposite side an acute
                    angle, with the angular point behind. These an <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040261?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0261-0804"/> gular lines,
                    which are variable in shape and disposition, <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> depend
                    on the elevation resulting from the mucous glands at the base of the organ. The
                    rest of the surface presents the minute conical eminences named <hi
                    rend="italic">papilloe,</hi> which belong to the mucous membrane. The lateral
                    margins, which are smooth and void of <hi rend="italic">papilloe,</hi> form the
                    transition from the upper free papillatcd surface to the lower, which is chiefly
                    attached by folds of the oral membrane to the lower region of the mouth.</p>
                <p>The tongue consists of various muscles, connected by filamentous tissue, some
                    adipose tissue, and invested by mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The muscles are of two orders, those common to the tongue and contiguous parts,
                    and those proper to the tongue. The common or extrinsic muscles are, the <hi
                    rend="italic">styloglossi,</hi> between the styloid process and margins of the
                    tongue; the <hi rend="italic">hyoglossi,</hi> between the branches of the hyoid
                    bone and the margins of the tongue; and the <hi rend="italic">genioglossi,</hi>
                    from the upper internal mental tuberosities to the lower part of the organ. The
                    proper or intrinsic muscle <hi rend="italic">(lingualis)</hi> consists of two
                    parallel layers of muscular fibres running along the lower surface of the organ,
                    and a mass of fleshy fibres irregularly arranged and mutually crossing in all
                    directions, and intermixed with a considerable quantity of soft but elastic
                    oleo-adipose matter.</p>
                <p>Of the lingual mucous membrane the most important circumstances are, the leathery
                    thickness and distinctness of its corion and epidermis on the superior surface
                    of the organ, and the papillary eminences with which it is marked.</p>
                <p>These <hi rend="italic">papillae</hi> may be distinguished into three orders; the
                    irregular or granular at the base, the tubercular or rounded about the middle
                    third, and the conical or pointed at the apex.</p>
                <p>The granular <hi rend="italic">papilloe,</hi> which vary in number from 10 to 15
                    or 16, are of a spheroidal or ovoidal shape, and are arranged on each side of
                    the median furrow, obliquely behind the sides of the angle already mentioned.
                    These bodies are evidently muciparous follicles; and it is in general easy to
                    distinguish the orifice of the excretory duct by the eye or a moderate lens.
                    They seem to receive filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal nerves, which enter
                    the tongue immediately beneath these granular glands.</p>
                <p>The tubercular <hi rend="italic">papilloe,</hi> which are much more numerous,
                    have rounded truncated summits, and occasionally pedunculated stalks. They are
                    irregularly distributed towards the middle, margins, and apex of the tongue,
                    promiscuously with the conical; and their nature is unknown.</p>
                <p>The conical or acuminated <hi rend="italic">papilloe,</hi> though occupying the
                    two anterior thirds of the lingual surface, are nevertheless most numerous
                    towards its apex, where they are also smallest, and somewhat inclined forward.
                    These <hi rend="italic">papilloe</hi> are asserted by the older anatomists to be
                    the terminations of nervous twigs; and Cloquet allows them to be the expansion
                    of the filaments of the lingual nerve. This, however, is an evident relic of the
                    fanciful representations of the older anatomists, and is not supported by
                    inspection. I have examined the structure of the lingual <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilloe</hi> in many instances, and in none have I seen any ground for the
                    assertion that they consist of nervous filaments. They do not even receive a
                    larger proportion than other parts of the lingual membrane. The <hi
                    rend="italic">papilloe</hi> consist chiefly of numerous minute blood-vessels,
                    rather tortuous, and communicating directly with veins enveloped in fine
                    filamentous tissue; and from this they derive their property of erection, while
                    their mucous surface secretes mucus copiously. These <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilloe</hi> are further the seat of the white fur with which the tongue is
                    liable to be coated in affections of. the stomach. The yellow fur seems to be
                    produced from the mucous surface generally.</p>
                <p>The tongue is supplied with blood by the lingual arteries, branches of the
                    external carotids, and by the palatine and tonsillary of the external maxillary.
                    The blood is returned by the superficial vein, the ranine, the lingual, and
                    submental.</p>
                <p>The nerves of the tongue are derived from three different sources; the inferior
                    maxillary, or third branch of the fifth pair; the glosso-pharyngeal; and the
                    hypoglossal. From the first it receives the lingual nerve, which, after sending
                    filaments to the sublingual gland, the <hi rend="italic">styloglossus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">genioglossus,</hi> and proper muscle of the tongue, is distributed
                    chiefly to the upper surface, sides, and apex of the organ. This is believed to
                    be the proper <hi rend="italic">gustatory nerve.</hi> From the second it
                    receives a lingual branch, which, passing between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >styloglossus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">hyoglossus,</hi> gives filaments to
                    these, the proper muscle, and the posterior part of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >genioglossus,</hi> and to the granular <hi rend="italic">papilloe.</hi> By
                    means of this nerve the motions of the tongue and pharynx are made to associate.
                    The third, which is distributed chiefly to the muscles attached to the hyoid
                    bone, sends filaments also to the <hi rend="italic">hyoglossus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">styloglossus,</hi> and chiefly to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >genioglossus.</hi> The hypoglossal is believed chiefly to preside over the
                    motions of the tongue, and probably those destined for articulation.</p>
                <p>The tongue is one of the best examples in the human body, of the felicity with
                    which a single organ may be adapted to a great variety of useful purposes.
                    Endowed with the common sensation of tact, diffused over the body at large, its
                    mucous investment is so organized that it recognises readily the peculiar
                    impressions communicated by sapid bodies. To render it more serviceable in this
                    respect, its muscles make it an organ of prehension, and elongate, contract,
                    inflect, incurvate, or extend it, so as to apply objects placed on its tip to
                    the palate or any part of the mouth. By the same means it becomes an important
                    agent in the prehension of food, and in deglutition, by transmitting the
                    masticated food to the pharynx. Lastly, it is a most essential and necessary
                    organ of speech, and, by the nice motions which it undergoes, enables the human
                    race to pronounce literal sounds and articulate consonants, which without its
                    aid would be unutterable. Of this the letters 1 and r are examples.</p>
                <p>d. Connected with the organs of taste are the salivary glands, of which there are
                    three pairs, one on each side of the mesial plane; the parotid, submaxillary,
                    and sublingual.</p>
                <p>The parotid, so named from its situation before the ear, is the largest of all
                    the salivary glands. It consists of two parts, the parotid proper, a large
                    oblong mass placed in the deep angular cavity formed by the maxillary <hi
                    rend="italic">ramus</hi> and the mastoid process; and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >socia parotidis,</hi> a large flat irregularly oval mass extending beneath the
                    skin of the face. Partaking of the general characters of glandular structure, it
                    is supplied with blood from the external carotid, by the temporal and transverse
                    facial; its veins open into the external jugular; and it receives numerous
                    nervous filaments from the facial and the ascending branches of the cervical
                    plexus.</p>
                <p>It has an excretory duct, named also the duct of Steno <hi rend="italic">(ductus
                    Stenonianus),</hi> which, quitting the surface of the gland a little above the
                    middle of the upper margin of the <hi rend="italic">masseter,</hi> proceeds
                    horizontally over the tendinous part of that muscle, and, sinking into the
                    filamentous adipose tissue of the cheek, perforates the <hi rend="italic"
                    >buccinator,</hi> and terminates in the mouth at the level of the second
                    superior molar tooth.</p>
                <p>The submaxillary or intramaxillary is smaller than the parotid. Oblong in shape,
                    it is placed on the internal pit <pb break="no"

                    jaw, bounded by the internal pterygoid and mylo-hyoid above, the lingual nerve,

                    lingual and external maxillary arteries, and nerves from the lingual and the
                    myloid branch of the inferior dental. Its excretory duct, named, from its
                    discoverer, <hi rend="italic">the duct of Wharton,</hi> terminates on the side
                    of the <hi rend="italic">frenum,</hi> in a narrow tuberculated orifice.</p>
                <p>The sublingual gland is the smallest of the three. Parallel to that of the
                    opposite side, it is separated from it by the base of the two <hi rend="italic"
                    >genio-glossi,</hi> and rests on the <hi rend="italic">mylohyoideus,</hi> which
                    separates it from the intramaxillary. Occasionally, however, these two glands
                    communicate by a slip from the intramaxillary below the muscle. It is supplied
                    with blood by the sublingual, ranine, and submental arteries; and its nerves
                    proceed from the lingual and hypoglossal. Its excretory ducts are manifold, and
                    terminate either in several orifices on the sides of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >frenum,</hi> or unite in a single tube, opening in the same region.</p>
                <p>The use of these glands is to separate from the blood a watery but somewhat
                    saline and sapid fluid, which has the twofold office of preserving the gustatory
                    membrane in its necessary moisture, and of mixing with the food during
                    mastication.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">saliva</hi> consists chiefly of water, holding in solution
                    hydrochlorate of soda, sulpho-cyanic acid, and a minute portion of animal matter
                    intermediate between albumen and osmazome. The presence of sulpho-cyanic acid,
                    an active poison, is remarkable; nor is the purpose of such an agent known. From
                    the saline matters in this fluid the tartar of the teeth is deposited; and
                    occasionally minute concretions are formed in the glands or their ducts. That
                    appearing in the ducts of the sublingual forms one variety of the affection

                <p>CHAP. ïïï. THE ORGANS OF VOICE.</p>
                <p>Voice is of two kinds, according as it consists in the mere voluntary utterance
                    of sound, or what is named, in reference to the animal world, <hi rend="italic"
                    >cry,</hi> or in the utterance of certain peculiar modifications of this,
                    denominated therefore articulate voice, or simply speech. Inarticulate voice is
                    common to all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds.</hi> By the possession of articulate speech, however, man <hi
                    rend="italic">(μεξοdj)</hi> is particularly distinguished from the animal world
                    in general.</p>
                <p>These two forms of voice have two distinct organs. For inarticulate voice the <hi
                    rend="italic">larynx</hi> is placed at the superior extremity of the windpipe;
                    and for that of speech, to the larynx arc superadded the articulating powers of
                    the teeth, lips, and tongue.</p>
                <p>The larynx is a tubular organ, consisting of cartilages invested by membranes,
                    connected by ligaments, and moved by muscles.</p>
                <p>The cartilages are five in number, the thyroid, cricoid, two arytenoid, and the
                    epiglottis.</p>
                <p>The thyroid cartilage, which forms the anterior and lateral region, consists of
                    two lateral halves united on the mesial plane, where they form an acute salient
                    angle, distinct beneath the integuments, and forming what is named <hi
                    rend="italic">dnepomum Adami.</hi> The anterior surface is slightly concave,
                    covered by the <hi rend="italic">thyrohyoideus,</hi><hi rend="italic">w</hi> ∖
                    <hi rend="italic">Aλ</hi> an oblique line, to which the muscle now mentioned,
                    the <hi rend="italic">sterno-thyroideus,</hi> and inferior <hi rend="italic"
                    >constrictor,</hi> are attached, and a posterior space covered by the two latter
                    muscles. The posterior surface of the thyroid has in the middle a re-entrant
                    angle, to which are attached the ligaments of theøŵtós and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thyro-arytaenoidei;</hi> on the sides two plane surfaces, corresponding above
                    to the cellular tissue of the <hi rend="italic">thyro-arytaenoidei,</hi> and
                    below to the lateral <hi rend="italic">crìco-arytaenoidei,</hi> and some fibres
                    of the <hi rend="italic">crico-thyroidei</hi> attached to this part.</p>
                <p>Each lateral half is quadrilateral and quadrangular. To the upper margin, which
                    is obliquely sinuated like an <hi rend="italic">f</hi> the thyro-hyoid membrane
                    is attached. To the lower, which though shorter iş also sinuated, the
                    crico-thyröid membrane and the <hi rend="italic">crico-thyroidei</hi> are
                    attached.</p>
                <p>The posterior margins, which are oblique and give attachment to several fibres of
                    the <hi rend="italic">stylo-pharyngei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">par
                    lato-pharyngei,</hi> terminate above in an elevated pointed process incurvated
                    inwards and forwards, connected by a ligament to the hyoid bone, and below in a
                    similar process, shorter however and triangular in shape, and articulated by its
                    tip with the lateral process of the cricoid cartilage.</p>
                <p>The cricoid or annular cartilage (κg∕κo^, <hi rend="italic">annulus),</hi> which
                    occupies the lower part of the larynx, is a complete ring of cartilage, narrow
                    before, and broad and elevated behind, where chiefly it constitutes the
                    laryngeal cavity. Convex in the middle, where it is subcutaneous, it widens
                    laterally where the <hi rend="italic">crico-thyroidei</hi> are attached; and
                    farther back, where it is covered by the thyroid cartilage, it presents the
                    lateral process covered by synovial membrane for articulation with the
                    triangular process of the thyroid. Its posterior region is broad and
                    quadrilateral, with a ridge on the median line covered by the pharyngeal
                    membrane only, and two depressions on each side, to which the posterior <hi
                    rend="italic">crico-arytaenoidei</hi> are attached. The inner surface, which is
                    concave, narrow before and broad behind, is covered by the laryngeal mucous
                    membrane. .</p>
                <p>The superior margin presents before a large notch, to which the crico-thyroid
                    membrane is fixed, laterally the insertion of the lateral <hi rend="italic"
                    >crico-arytaenoidei,</hi> and behind two convex surfaces, oblique in direction,
                    covered by synovial membrane for articulation with the arytenoid cartilages, and
                    between which this margin is covered by the arytenoid muscle. The lower margin,
                    less irregular, descending before, sinuated on the sides and notched behind, is
                    united by a fibro-mucous membrane to the firstring of the windpipe.</p>
                <p>The arytenoid cartilages are two small bodies, triangular and pyramidal in shape,
                    placed at the posterior part of the larynx, in the upper margin of the cricoid
                    cartilage. In each arytenoid cartilage may be recognised a concave anterior
                    surface for the arytenoid gland, a concave posterior surface for the arytenoid
                    muscle, an internal surface covered by laryngeal mucous membrane, a base concave
                    and oval, covered by synovial membrane for articulation with the cricoid, and a
                    thin, convex summit, supporting a small cartilage <hi rend="italic">(cornicula
                    laryngis),</hi> invested by mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>These bodies, which are named the tubercles of Santorini <hi rend="italic"
                    >(capitula arytaenoidum)</hi> by whom they were discovered, are conical in
                    shape, with a concave base for articulating with the summit of each arytenoid
                    cartilage, and a pointed <hi rend="italic">apex</hi> incurvated inwards and
                    backwards. To their surface, with part of the arytenoid, the thyro-arytenoid
                    ligament is fixed, and forms the beginning of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis.</hi></p>
                <p>These bodies partake of the general characters of cartilage, and are invested by
                    perichondrium. The thyroid and cricoid have a great tendency to ossification;
                    and it is rare to find them unossified in advanced life.</p>
                <p>The epiglottis is a thin slip of fibro-cartilage, of a paraboloid shape, covered
                    by mucous membrane, attached at its base by cellular tissue to the inner surface
                    of the hyoid bone and the upper margin of the thyroid cartilage, and by
                    duplicatures of mucous membrane to the summits of the arytenoid cartilages. In
                    this duplicature, on each side, is suspended a minute wedge-like cartilaginous
                    tubercle, with the base upward, named the <hi rend="italic">cuneiform.</hi></p>
                <p>These cartilages are articulated so as to admit of motion<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040287?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0287-0806"/> at the points
                    already indicated. The articulations are secured by ligamentous capsules; but
                    the most important ligament is the thyro-arytenoid, which passes from the base
                    of each arytenoid cartilage to the re-entrant angle of the thyroid, where the
                    fibres are mutually mixed with that of the opposite side. The thyroid moves on
                    the cricoid, which may be regarded as the base of the organ; and the two
                    arytenoid move on the upper margin of the cricoid. The epiglottis is depressed
                    over the laryngeal opening by the motion of the tongue in deglutition.</p>
                <p>The agents of motion in the larynx are of two kinds; L·?, those which move the
                    whole organ in relation to the neighbouring parts; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >2dly,</hi> those which move the component parts of the larynx in relation to
                    each other. To the former class belong the sterno-thyroid, thyro-hyoid, and
                    inferior constrictor muscles, with those attached to the hyoid bone, the
                    elevation and depression of which the larynx follows. The second comprehends the
                    cricothyroid, the posterior crico-arytenoid, the lateral cricoarytenoid, the
                    thyro-arytenoid, and the arytenoid. The connections and relations of these
                    muscles it is superfluous to detail more minutely than may be understood from
                    the description already given of the cartilages. It is suffieient to say, that
                    while the crico-thyroid causes the thyroid cartilage to perform a swinging
                    motion on the cricoid, the posterior crico-arytenoid draws the arytenoid
                    cartilages baek, the thyro-arytenoid draws them forwards, the lateral
                    crico-arytenoid separates them from each other, and the arytenoid, sometimes
                    distinguished into transverse and oblique arytenoid muscles, approximates these
                    cartilages in different degrees, according to the act in which they are
                    used.</p>
                <p>The several parts now mentioned are invested on the inside by mucous membrane,
                    continuous above with that of the pharynx and tongue, and below with that of the
                    trachea. Proceeding from the former boundary, it may be traced over the
                    epiglottis and its gland, on the mesial plane and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thyro-arytoenoidei,</hi> and on the sides from the inner surface of the thyroid
                    cartilage before to the outer margin and base of the arytenoid cartilages
                    behind. At this part it rises to form two folds with rounded margins, extending
                    from before backwards, and forming on the outsides a cavity with the arytenoid
                    cartilage. These folds, though occasionally named the <hi rend="italic">superior
                    ligaments of</hi> the <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> are truly mucous membrane
                    doubled, with interposed filamentous tissue. They form an intermediate
                    triangular space, with the base before and the apex behind. The inner surface of
                    this membrane, directed to that of the opposite side, is concave, and forms a
                    sort of pouch called the <hi rend="italic">ventricles</hi> of the larynx <hi
                    rend="italic">(sacculi laryngis).</hi> The membrane here covers the
                    thyro-arytenoid ligaments, over which it is tensely stretched, so as to form
                    inferior folds, much tenser and firmer than the superior ones. These lower
                    folds, which form a triangular interval with the base behind and the apex
                    before, are the proper ligaments of the larynx, or vocal chords <hi
                    rend="italic">(chordae</hi><hi rend="italic">vocales)</hi>; and the intermediate
                    fissure is named the <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >rima</hi><hi rend="italic">glottidis.</hi> Though this opening is triangular in
                    the dead body, its shape varies much in the living. By the joint action of the
                    posterior <hi rend="italic">crico-arytoenoidei</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >arytcenοidm</hi><hi rend="italic">transversi,</hi> the thyro-arytenoidligaments
                    maybe rendered’tense, the arytenoid cartilages approximated, and the fissure of
                    the glottis become a mere slit.</p>
                <p>Though it is impossible to adopt all the views of Do-dart regarding the powers of
                    the thyro-arytenoid ligaments, it is certain that their tension and relaxation,
                    with the mutual approximation of the arytenoid cartilages, are the essential
                    agents of voice. Without the air passing through the glottis there is no voice.
                    The glottis is also the organ by which the quantity of air admitted into the <hi
                    rend="italic">trachea</hi> is regulated. By means of its muscles it may be shut,
                    and the breath retained, so as to fix the chest during any great effort. By
                    contracting it, also, during coughing or forcible expiration, the air is
                    forcibly expelled from the lungs, and necessarily carries at the same time
                    foreign bodies.</p>
                <p>At the base of the epiglottis, in the angle between it and the thyroid, the
                    laryngeal membrane presents several orifices, which may be traced to a cluster
                    of follicles imbedded in the submucous tissue at this part. This cluster has
                    been named the epiglottic gland.</p>
                <p>A similar glandular body, in the anterior depression of each arytenoid cartilage,
                    is named the arytenoid glands.</p>
                <p>Of the body named thyroid gland, situate on the sides of the upper end of the <hi

                    larynx, nothing is known. With the larynx it has certainly no relation.</p>
                <p>The blood-vessels of the larynx are the superior thyroid or laryngeal, the first
                    branch of the external carotid, and the inferior laryngeal branch of the

                    The division of these nerves, or of the pneumogastric, from which they proceed,
                    is followed by palsy of the muscles, and inability to open the glottis at will,
                    or retain it open; and the result is dyspnoea, terminating in asphyxia</p>
                <p>CHAP. IV. THE NERVOUS SYSTEM.</p>
                <p>The nervous system ineludes two general divisions, a central and a distributed.
                    The first is collected in a single and indivisible mass, contained in the
                    cavities of the cranium and vertebral column, and may be designated by the
                    general appellation of brain <hi rend="italic">(cerebrum).</hi> The second
                    consists of long chords connected with some part of the central portion and with
                    each other, and distributed in every direction through the body in the mode of
                    ramification. These are distinguished by the name of nervous chords or nerves
                    <hi rend="italic">(nervi).</hi></p>
                <p> SECT. I. THE BRAIN AND ITS MEMBRANES.</p>
                <p>§ 1. <hi rend="smallcaps">the brain.</hi> Plate XXX.</p>
                <p>The brain may be considered as a continuous organ, consisting of three divisions
                    ;—the convoluted, the laminated, and the smooth or funicular portions. Of these
                    divisions, which are framed according to the peculiar external configuration of
                    each, the first part corresponds to what is called the brain proper <hi
                    rend="italic">(cerebrum)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the second to the small
                    brain <hi rend="italic">(cerebellum)</hi>; and the third to the oblong body
                    contained in the vertebral column, and known under the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >spinal chord.</hi></p>
                <p>The convoluted portion presents two surfaces, an outer or convoluted, and an
                    inner or figurate. The laminated portion in like manner presents two surfaces,
                    an outer or laminated, and an inner or central. The third has only one exterior
                    surface.</p>
                <p>The shape of the first two divisions is like that of the cranial cavity in which
                    they are contained, oblong spheroidal or ovoidal, with the small extremity of
                    the ovoid before, and the large one behind.</p>
                <p>The human brain is larger and heavier in proportion than that of any other
                    animal. The three parts, the brain, cerebellum, and spinal chord, after being
                    washed and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040300?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0300-0807"/> emptied of blood, weigh in the adult from two
                    pounds five ounees to three pounds three ounces, and at an average about three
                    pounds; and of this the brain alone weighs two pounds. The statement of Haller,
                    that the brain weighs five pounds, is incredible, unless it be understood of
                    Troy weight, in whieh ease even it seems exaggerated, sinee of more than 200
                    brains weighed by Soemmering, not one amounted to four pounds. The statement,
                    that the brain of Cromwell weighed six pounds and one fourth, seems equally
                    ineredible. The specific gravity of the adult brain is to water as 1031 to 1000.
                    This, however, varies with age. The cerebellum weighs about five or six ounees,
                    and is therefore about the seventh part only of the weight of the brain.</p>
                <p>The brain <hi rend="italic">(cerebrum)</hi> is divided above and before into two
                    lateral halves, named hemispheres <hi rend="italic">(hemisphaeria),</hi> right
                    and left, separated by a deep furrow, in whieh the vertical, creseentie, or
                    dichotomous portion <hi rend="italic">(falx)</hi> of the hard membrane is
                    received. Each hemisphere is bounded by a superior or convex, an inner or plane,
                    and an inferior convex and eoncave surface. The lower surface of each
                    hemisphere, also, anatomists distinguish into three lobes, an anterior,
                    posterior, and middle.</p>
                <p>The cerebellum is also divided into two hemispheres, separated by a middle furrow
                    of less depth, receiving, as that of the brain, a ereseentic production, smaller
                    in size, from the hard membrane.</p>
                <p>The exterior surfaee of the convoluted division is formed into eminences
                    longitudinal and rounded, but directed in various ways, named convolutions or
                    circumvolutions <hi rend="italic">(gyri,</hi> Soemmering, Wenzel), and separated
                    from eaeh other by deep hollows <hi rend="italic">(sulci).</hi> To see this
                    surfaee, which is termed the <hi rend="italic">convoluted,</hi> the vaseular
                    membrane termed <hi rend="italic">pia mater (meninx tenuis)</hi> must be
                    removed.</p>
                <p>The convoluted surface of eaeh hemisphere may be divided into five regions: 1.
                    The eommutual or dichotomous; 2. the lateral-superior or eonvex; 3. the
                    anteroinferior or frontal; 4. the medio-inferior or spheno-temporal; and 5. the
                    posterior or cerebellie region.</p>
                <p>1. The <hi rend="italic">commutual,</hi> plane, of a shape nearly semicircular,
                    forms the mesial boundary of eaeh hemisphere, and corresponds to the falciform
                    or dichotomous portion of the hard membrane <hi rend="italic">(μηνrfζ, δκ,ληξα,
                    meηinx dura),</hi> by which it is separated from the similar surfaee of the
                    opposite hemisphere. Before and behind it extends from the superior to the
                    inferior surface of the brain; but a considerable portion of its middle is
                    terminated by the upper surfaee of the middle band <hi rend="italic">(mesolobe,
                    corpus callosum),</hi> which lies between the two hemispheres. It is eontained
                    between the semieircular and the rectilinear margins.</p>
                <p>2. The <hi rend="italic">convex</hi> region occupies the anterior, upper,
                    lateral, and posterior parts of the hemisphere, from their anterior to their
                    posterior extremity, and from the semicircular margin to a line whieh extends
                    between these extremities along the lateral borders of the organ.</p>
                <p>3. The <hi rend="italic">antero-inferior</hi> or <hi rend="italic">frontal</hi>
                    rests on the horizontal part of the frontal and ethmoid bones, commencing before
                    with a eurved outline, bounded behind by the curvilinear hollow named the
                    fissure of Sylvius, and at its inner or mesial margin by the great fissure whieh
                    separates the hemispheres. This inner margin presents one convolution,
                    consisting of a longitudinal eminenee, extending in the adult brain about 1⅜
                    ineh from the posterior towards the anterior end of the ñoteh. The outer furrow
                    contains the cerebral portion of the first pair or olfacient nerves. (1,1.)</p>
                <p>4. The <hi rend="italic">medio-inferior</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >splιeno-temporal</hi> is situate immediately behind this region, from which it
                    is separated by the curvilinear hollow <hi rend="italic">(fossa Sylvii).</hi> In
                    the ordinary descriptions this forms the <hi rend="italic">middle lobe;</hi>
                    while the posterior part, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cerebellum,</hi> though distinguished by no evident limit, is with equal
                    impropriety named the <hi rend="italic">posterior lobe.</hi> The whole region,
                    from the curvilinear hollow to the posterior tip of the hemisphere, may,
                    however, be subdivided into two, the <hi rend="italic">medio-inferior</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">postero-inferior</hi> regions of the convoluted surface,
                    according as they correspond to different containing parts.</p>
                <p>5. The <hi rend="italic">posterior cerebellie region</hi> of the convoluted
                    surface, which is plane, corresponds to the horizontal or cerebellic part of the
                    hard membrane.</p>
                <p>The convoluted surface is formed of cerebral matter, of a gray or dirty wax
                    colour, the surfaee of which is smooth and polished where it has not been rent
                    by the removal of the membranes and their attachments. In the furrows are many
                    minute orifiees, into which the soft membrane (λε∙τnj μψ∕yξ, <hi rend="italic"
                    >meηinx tenuis, pia mater)</hi> transmits filamentous bodies, containing minute
                    blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>Neither the eminences nor the hollows are uniform in number or distribution; and
                    in no two brains is it possible to trace any similarity in their figure,
                    presence, or direction, in the upper, lateral, and posterior part of the
                    convoluted surface, unless where it approaches the central or figurate surfaee,
                    where a number of important objects are presented.</p>
                <p>The convoluted surface communicates with another interior surface at two parts;
                    L·/, on the middle plane, under the posterior end of the middle band or mesolobe
                    <hi rend="italic">(corpus callosum)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi

                    the optic chamber or eoueh <hi rend="italic">(thalamus opticus).</hi> This
                    surfaee of the organ may be termed the <hi rend="italic">central</hi> or <hi

                <p>The exterior surfaee of the cerebellum consists of thin portions of eerebral
                    substanee named plates <hi rend="italic">(larninae),</hi> or leaves <hi
                    rend="italic">(folia),</hi> plaeed contiguously, either parallel or concentric,
                    and separated by furrows of various depth. This surface, which may be named the
                    <hi rend="italic">laminar</hi> or <hi rend="italic">foliated</hi> surfaee of the
                    small brain, communicates also with the figurate surface,—L·/, above on the
                    middle plane, between the semilunar notch behind, and the white cerebral plate

                    Instead of presenting the uniform eminences and hollows which distinguish the

                    hemispheres on the mesial plane, with the twainband or vault below; the <hi
                    rend="italic">hippocampus major</hi> on each side; the anterior pyriform
                    eminence or striated body on each side; the posterior pyriform eminence or optic
                    chamber on each side; the semicircular band on each side; the ergot on each
                    side; the <hi rend="italic">conarium</hi> on the mesial plane; the bigeminous
                    eminences on the mesial plane; the valve on the mesial plane; and its pillars on
                    each side.</p>
                <p>The commutual or dichotomous region of the convoluted surface is terminated below
                    by the upper surface of a white band uniting the two hemispheres. This, which
                    was named by the ancient anatomists the smooth or polished body <hi
                    rend="italic">(&lt;swμa nλλοuδsς, corpus loeve),</hi> to distinguish it from
                    surfaces formed by a cutting instrument, appears in the form of white fibrous
                    matter, passing transversely between the hemispheres, and marked by three
                    longitudinal lines, one on the mesial plane, and one on each side. This is the
                    <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> or <hi rend="italic">central band (mesolobe</hi>
                    of Chaussier). Near its middle is a bundle of gray lines, which may be traced to
                    the central portion of the <hi rend="italic">hippocampus major.</hi></p>
                <p>The posterior extremity of this body is rounded, and communicates with the
                    chamber named third or middle ventricle. This surface is continued forward, and
                    forms the vault or cieling <hi rend="italic">(fornix,</hi> Die Zwillingsbinde,
                    <hi rend="italic">the twainband,</hi> Reil). The names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >callous body</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vault</hi> are used, as if they were
                    denominations of different bodies. If they are still retained, it ought to be
                    stated that they are names applied to opposite surfaces of the same object.</p>
                <p>The relations of the posterior end of the middle band are as follow. The handle
                    of a scalpel inserted beneath it is found to be in the middle ventricle, with
                    the vault above, the <hi rend="italic">conarium</hi> or pineal body, and four
                    eminences of the upper surface of the protuberance <hi rend="italic">(corpora
                    bigβ-</hi><hi rend="italic">mina)</hi> below, and a part of each optic chamber
                    on each side. The vault or inferior surface of the band has the shape of an
                    isosceles triangle, with the base behind. Before it is incurvated downward as it
                    becomes narrow; and the space between the band and it is occupied by a thin
                    double plate of cerebral matter, separating the two ventricles, and named the
                    diaphanous partition <hi rend="italic">(septum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >lucidum).</hi> (s, s, s.) The <hi rend="italic">fornix</hi> terminates before,
                    in two bodies named <hi rend="italic">anterior pillars.</hi> (Fig. 3, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">f, f.)</hi></p>
                <p>The posterior end of the middle band penetrates into the substance of the
                    hemispheres; but the gray chords already noticed, pursuing their lateral course,
                    are immediately enveloped in white plates derived from the sides of the vault,
                    and assuming a cylindrical appearance, form, opposite the cerebral limbs, a body
                    with a free rounded surface, which bends in a curvilinear direction laterally
                    and downwards, and is the great <hi rend="italic">hippocampus</hi> or cylindroid
                    process. (Chaussier.) In observing this curvilinear course, it rests on and
                    corresponds, but without adhesion, to the upper margin of the cerebral limb as
                    it issues from the optic chamber; and the surfaces of both parts, though kept in
                    apposition by vascular membrane, are free and unadherent. It forms <hi
                    rend="italic">the great cerebral fissure</hi> of Bichat.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">hippocampus,</hi> therefore, consists of two parts. The
                    first, which is <hi rend="italic">the gray indented band</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >(le</hi><hi rend="italic">corps</hi><hi rend="italic">godronnée,</hi>
                    Vicq-d’Azyr), is an inner or central portion, as thick as a large crow-quill,
                    gray in colour, indented at the free edge, adhering to the cerebral substance by
                    its opposite margin, and connected with the upper surface of the central band.
                    The outer or second part, which is a broad thin plate of white cerebral matter
                    folded over the gray indented band, as a map is rolled over a cylinder of wood,
                    known under the name of the <hi rend="italic">tape</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >fringe</hi> of the hippocampus, is connected with the lower surface of the same
                    central band, or the vault <hi rend="italic">(fornix)</hi> of the brain.</p>
                <p>At the inferior region the communication is effected by the curvilinear hollow.
                    (Fig. 1, s, s.) This presents, ] <hi rend="italic">st,</hi> cerebral substance,
                    penetrated by numerous holes of various size, named the <hi rend="italic">white
                    perforated substance (lamina perforata)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> f</hi><hi rend="italic">2.dly,</hi> the unconvoluted

                    >⅛thly,</hi> the limb of the brain. This body, with that of the opposite side,
                    is covered by a portion of the convoluted surface, the inner and prominent
                    surface of the medio-inferior or spheno-temporal region.</p>
                <p>The convoluted surface, which covers the anterior end and outer margin of the
                    cerebral limb, when everted, presents the thin white body named the <hi
                    rend="italic">tape</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fringe (tcenia)</hi> of the
                    hippocampus; and if the portion of convoluted brain next the curvilinear hollow
                    be raised and everted in the same manner, the anterior end of this object,
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">foot (pes hippocampi),</hi> comes into view. The
                    fringe of the hippocampus forms, in the natural position of the organ, the outer
                    and lower border of the opening; while the limb of the brain, and the outer <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193040326?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0326-0809"/> and
                    lower surface of the optic chamber, form its inner border.</p>
                <p>When the central surface is exposed by removing the central band and the vault
                    and cieling of the ventricles, two pyriform eminences, an anterior and
                    posterior, come into view. The anterior is ash-coloured or gray, inclining to
                    wood-brown, with the round convex extremity before, and the small end tapering
                    backwards and outwards, so as to inclose the round end of the posterior
                    eminence. The surface is smooth and convex, consisting of a thin covering of
                    gray cerebral matter. The interior consists of an admixture of white and gray,
                    so as to form alternate streaks,—a circumstance from which these eminences on
                    each side have been named the striated bodies <hi rend="italic">(corpora
                    striata).</hi> At their anterior mesial extremity are two rounded vertical
                    bodies of white cerebral matter, descending from the anterior end of the vault.
                    These are the anterior pillars, which are thus interposed between the interior
                    front of the striated bodies.</p>
                <p>The posterior and internal margin of the striated bodies is bounded by a gray,
                    hard eminence, about a line broad, stretching with a sinuous or winding
                    direction from its mesial and anterior to its external lateral and posterior
                    margin. This is the semicircular fillet or band <hi rend="italic"
                    >(taenia</hi><hi rend="italic">semicircularis,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >centrum</hi><hi rend="italic">semicirculare geminum).</hi> Always firmer than
                    the neighbouring parts, it appears to be the external margin of a gray-coloured
                    stratum or wall of cerebral matter between the anterior and posterior pyriform
                    bodies.</p>
                <p>Connected before and on the outside to the striated body by means of the double
                    scmicirculai* chord <hi rend="italic">(centrum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >semicirculare geminum,</hi> Vieussens), each optic eminence presents four free
                    surfaces—the upper, the inner, the posterior, and the lower. The upper is gently
                    rounded, convex, and white in colour; its limits are not easily defined. The
                    outer margin is bounded by the circular band, which even passes anterior to it,
                    so as to form its boundary in that direction also. Behind, it is less distinctly
                    limited, unless by the appearance of a considerable prominence, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">posterior tubercle</hi> of the optic couch.</p>
                <p>The inner margin of the upper surface is distinctly marked by a small, sharp,
                    gray line, which, beginning insensibly at the anterior part of the body, becomes
                    more distinct as it extends backwards, and ultimately bends towards the median
                    plane. There it unites with a similar elevated line of the opposite optic
                    eminence; and to the point of union is attached a small conical body with a
                    minute point, of a gray colour, and of a shape like that of the pine-apple. This
                    is the pineal gland <hi rend="italic">(glandula pinealis, conarium)</hi>; and
                    the minute linear eminences which form the inner edge of the upper optic surface
                    have been named <hi rend="italic">peduncles</hi> of the pineal gland.</p>
                <p>The inner surface of the optic couch or chamber presents the small portion of
                    soft cerebral matter <hi rend="italic">(commissura</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >mollis)</hi> which unites it to the similar surface of the opposite body; and
                    the intermediate space between the inner surfaces of these bodies on each side
                    constitutes the third or middle ventricle <hi rend="italic">(ventriculus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">tertius).</hi> Its posterior edge, however, is terminated by the
                    cerebral limb of that side; and the lower edge meets that of the opposite one,
                    and is connected to it by a portion of brain which forms the lower part of the
                    middle ventricle, and corresponds on the outside to the <hi rend="italic">bridge
                    of Tarin (pons Tαrini).</hi>: The posterior surface of the optic chamber is
                    convex and continuous with the unconvoluted space. Its most convex part presents
                    two oblong roundish eminences, separated by a linear depression, which may be
                    traced downwards with an outward curvature, and forwards about five or six
                    lines, in a broad white band, crossing two fluted masses mutually converging
                    behind at an angle. These eminences are the geniculate bodies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(corpus</hi><hi rend="italic">geniculatum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >externum</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">internum),</hi> the
                    outer the largest of the two (fig. 1, g, g); the white bands are the optic
                    tracts or origins of the optic nerve, issuing from the geniculate tubercles (o,
                    t); and the fluted converging masses are the limbs of the brain <hi
                    rend="italic">(crura cerebri).</hi></p>
                <p>On the inner or mesial side of the geniculate bodies, and separated only by a
                    lineaι∙ furrow, are the bigemĩ-nous eminences, four orbicular elevations, two
                    above and two below; two on each side of the mesial plane, with an intermediate
                    cruciform furrow. By the ancients, who examined chiefly brute animals, the
                    superior and larger pair were named <hi rend="italic">nates</hi> (yλoυro∕), the
                    inferior <hi rend="italic">testes</hi><hi rend="italic">(δίδυμοι).</hi> These
                    eminences occupy the upper surface of the protuberance, and partly that of the
                    limbs of the brain; and while the eminences are situate between the posterior
                    ends of the optic chambers above, the limbs appear to issue from the centre of
                    these chambers below, and the linear furrow marks the point of junction.</p>
                <p>These bigeminal eminences, however, though occupying the superior surface of the
                    protuberance, adhere not everywhere to its substance. (Fig. 3.) The mesial
                    furrow is formed on the upper surface of a thin plate of white cerebral matter,
                    which extends from the level of the pineal peduncles above, to the upper margin
                    of the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> below, like a veil, and is named the
                    cerebral valve <hi rend="italic">(valvula Vieussenii).</hi> The lower surface of
                    this is free for about two or three lines broad; and, though applied to a
                    similar surface on the mesial line of the upper region of the protuberance, does
                    not adhere, but forms a canal with the third ventricle above and the fourth
                    below, named the aqueduct of Sylvius <hi rend="italic">(iter</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a tertio</hi><hi rend="italic">ad</hi><hi rend="italic">quartum
                    ventriculum)</hi> (i). While the outer halves, therefore, of the eminences
                    adhere to the matter of the protuberance, the inner are attached to that of the
                    valve, (n, t.)</p>
                <p>The lower or cerebellic margin of the valve is free, and overhangs as it were the
                    fourth or ccrcbellic ventricle. On each side, however, is a longitudinal rounded
                    body of white matter, which passes from the lower pair of bigeminous eminences
                    <hi rend="italic">(testes)</hi> to the cerebellum. These are named the pillars
                    of the valve <hi rend="italic">(columnae valvulae Vieus-senii, processus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">a cerebello</hi><hi rend="italic">ad testes).</hi> The fourth or
                    pathetic nerve <hi rend="italic">(trochlearis)</hi> rises partly from the valve,
                    partly from its lateral pillars, and is seen issuing on the sides of the
                    protuberance not larger than a thread.</p>
                <p>The lower surface of the optic chambers presents within the convoluted space the
                    limbs of the brain <hi rend="italic">(crura cerebri),</hi> two fluted
                    semicylindrical masses, converging backwards, and inclosing by their junction a
                    triangular space, with the apex behind—the <hi rend="italic">intercrural</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">hollow.</hi> The inner margin of the limbs presents the origin of
                    the third or oculo-muscular nerves <hi rend="italic">(oculo-motorii)</hi>; about
                    half an inch anterior on the intercrural hollow are the lenticular or pisiform

                    quadrilateral reddish-gray prominence, with the anterior margin rounded, the

                <p>The limbs are obliquely crossed at their outer anterior end by the broad part of

                    behind with the beginning of the spinal chord <hi rend="italic">(medulla
                    oblongata).</hi> It is marked on the middle by a longitudinal furrow, in which
                    is placed the basilar artery, the united trunk of the vertebrals. Its convexity
                    corresponds to the concavity of the basilar groove of the occipital bone, on
                    which it rests. This eminence may be regarded as the general central point of
                    the cerebral nervous system, with which all the other parts are connected,—with
                    the cerebral hemispheres by the <hi rend="italic">crura cerebri,</hi> with the

                    >tergeminal</hi> or fifth nerve arises; from the posterior furrow the <hi
                    rend="italic">abducent</hi> or sixth nerve; and from the upper anterior margin
                    of the cerebellic peduncle the eighth or lateral facial.</p>
                <p>Continuous with and behind the protuberance is the beginning or bulb of the
                    spinal chord, a part distinguished on the ground of an obsolete hypothesis by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata.</hi> Thick and prominent, its
                    surface is moulded into six oblong-ovoidal eminences, three on each side of the
                    mesial plane; the <hi rend="italic">pyriform</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >pyramidal</hi> eminences before, the <hi rend="italic">restiform</hi> bodies
                    behind, and the <hi rend="italic">olivary</hi> eminences on each side.</p>
                <p>The pyriform eminences <hi rend="italic">(corpora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >pyramidalia)</hi> are two oblong-oval bodies, broad above, tapering below,
                    separated by a mesial line, and bounded laterally by a furrow separating them
                    from the olivary bodies, occupying the anterior-inferior part of the bulb of the
                    chord, and resting on the lower third of the basilar groove. The mesial line
                    terminates above in the <hi rend="italic">foramen</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >caecum</hi> of the posterior furrow of the protuberance, (p.)</p>
                <p>The olivary <hi rend="italic">(corpora</hi><hi rend="italic">ovata),</hi> placed
                    on the outside of the pyramidal bodies, occupying partly the front, partly the
                    side of the bulb, give it a lateral and transverse projection. In the
                    intermediate furrow are the initial filaments of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hypoglossal</hi> or middle lingual nerve; and in the external furrow and sides
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">glosso-pharyngeal</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >pneumogastric</hi> nerves, (o, o. )</p>
                <p>The posterior-upper part of the <hi rend="italic">medulla oblongata</hi> consists
                    of two longitudinal cylindrical bodies, stretching between the cerebellic
                    peduncles above and the spinal chord below. These are the <hi rend="italic"
                    >chordal processes</hi> of Ridley, the <hi rend="italic">restiform</hi> or
                    rope-like processes of Morgagni, the <hi rend="italic">pyramidal bodies</hi> of
                    Haller, Malacarne, and Reil, and the <hi rend="italic">posterior pyramidal
                    bodies</hi> of Ruysch, Prochaska, and Soemmering. Above, where they are
                    connected with the cerebellic peduncles, they are separated by a triangular
                    space with the apex downward, but below by a deep furrow, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >calamus</hi><hi rend="italic">scriptorius</hi> of the ancients, at the bottom
                    of which, when separated, may be observed white chords proceeding from the
                    process of one side, plaited with those of the other. These decussating fibres,
                    which are confined entirely to the mesial margin of the restiform processes, are
                    believed to establish a crossing connection between the right and left sides of
                    the peduncles and the protuberance. The intermediate cavity is named the fourth
                    ventricle. From the inner surface of the restiform process issue several of the
                    initial filaments of the seventh or auditory nerve.</p>
                <p>The spinal chord or funicular brain is a cylindrical body occupying the interior
                    of the vertebral canal, from the margin of the occipital hole to the first
                    lumbar <hi rend="italic">vertebra</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> large and round
                    on the cervical region, broad on the dorsal, and terminating in a brush-like
                    expansion, denominated the <hi rend="italic">cauda</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >equina.</hi> On its dorsal surface may be seen a slightly depressed line
                    continued from the middle furrow of the restiform bodies, but becoming faint and
                    indistinct in the region of the back.</p>
                <p>The central or figurate surface is smooth, polished, and possesses a degree of
                    closeness of texture which prevents it from being readily abraded. These
                    qualities are ascribed by Reil to a thin pellicle, which he terms <hi
                    rend="italic">epithelia.</hi> Though there is no proof of the existence of the
                    covering, the term may be used to designate the smooth surface of the organ.</p>
                <p>Of the central surface not only does every division mutually communicate, but the
                    central surface of the convoluted communicates with that of the laminated part
                    of the organ. The lateral divisions, named <hi rend="italic">ventricles,</hi>
                    communicate directly with each other below the vault, the surface of which lies
                    over the <hi rend="italic">thalami;</hi> both communicate with the third
                    ventricle, which by the Sylvian aqueduct communicates with the fourth; and the
                    posterior part of the lateral ventricle communicates with the digital cavity and
                    inferior recess.</p>
                <p>The central surface is covered by a vascular membrane <hi rend="italic"
                    >(plexus</hi><hi rend="italic">choroïdes),</hi> continued from the <hi
                    rend="italic">pia mater</hi> of the convoluted surface.</p>
                <p>Between the two surfaces now described is placed the proper matter of the brain,
                    white and brown, which in different regions of the organ is differently
                    arranged.</p>
                <p>The convoluted surface consists of a stratum of gray cerebral matter, arranged in
                    the granular form. When indurated by immersion in alcohol or dilute nitric acid,
                    it breaks with a small conchoidal fracture, occasionally uneven, and with an
                    uneven granular surface, void of lustre and without fibrous arrangement. The
                    only part of the convoluted surface presenting the latter appearance is the
                    unciform band· uniting the anterior and posterior lobes. (Fig. 5, v.)</p>
                <p>Within the convoluted surface is contained a large quantity of white matter,
                    surrounding the figurate surface and its divisions. The section of this, usually
                    named the oval centre of Vieussenius <hi rend="italic">(centrum ovale),</hi>
                    shows merely the extent which this occupies in the upper part of the brain, but
                    communicates no information on the intimate structure of the organ.</p>
                <p>In intimate organization the brain may be distinguished into four parts; W, the
                    brain, containing the striated <hi rend="italic">nucleus; 2d,</hi> the
                    cerebellum, containing the. moriform body; 3d, the head or bulb of the chord,
                    containing the moriform body; and, <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> the annular
                    protuberance as a central point of the whole.</p>
                <p>The white fibrous matter of the central band, passing into the hemispheres on
                    each side, diverges like the rods of a fan or the rays of a luminous body, and
                    forms an arrangement denominated by Reil the <hi rend="italic">radiating
                    crown,</hi> and which may be regarded as the exterior investment of the <hi
                    rend="italic">striated nucleus,</hi> which constitutes the internal substance of
                    the striated bodies and optic chambers. (Fig. 5, c.) The arrangement of white
                    and gray matter in this part is so peculiar, that within the limits of this
                    sketch it is impossible to convey a distinct idea of it. It may be stated in
                    general that the fibrous matter of the limbs extends from the protuberance
                    through the substance of the <hi rend="italic">thalamus</hi> and part of the
                    striated body; and while in this manner it maintains a connection between the
                    protuberance and the brain above, by means of the cerebellic peduncles on the
                    sides, and the head of the chord below, it communicates with the cerebellum and
                    spinal chord behind and below. The moriform bodies <hi rend="italic"
                    >(corpora</hi><hi rend="italic">dentata,</hi><hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ciliata,</hi><hi rend="italic">corpora</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rhomboidea),</hi> which consist of white matter inclosed in a brown capsule,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">cerebellic</hi> and olivary eminences, are analogous
                    to the striated nucleus of the brain; and the three may be regarded as the
                    respective centres of each. The annular protuberance, consisting internally of
                    transverse fibres closely interwoven with longitudinal ones, is the general or
                    common centre of the three.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040352?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0352-0811"/>
                <p>The substance of the funicular or vertebral portion con- • sists almost entirely
                    of white fibrous matter, extending <hi rend="superscript"> t</hi> longitudinally
                    from the cranial to the sacral extremity, but bending off laterally at the
                    origins of the spinal nerves in the form of arches.</p>
                <p>. The brain is supplied with blood by the internal carotid arteries and the two
                    vertebral arteries, derived from the subclavian. The former, entering the
                    cranium by the carotic canals, sends a <hi rend="italic">posterior
                    communicating</hi> branch, inosculating with the principal division of the
                    basilar, and an <hi rend="italic">anterior communicating,</hi> which joins the
                    vessel of the opposite side. By these communications, the branches of the
                    basilar artery behind, and the carotids before, form an arterial hexagon round
                    the <hi rend="italic">sella Turcica,</hi> from which arise two anterior vessels
                    <hi rend="italic">(anteriores</hi><hi rend="italic">cerebri),</hi> distributed
                    to the central band, and two lateral <hi rend="italic">(rncdiae)</hi> or Sylvian
                    arteries, distributed to the perforated spot, the Sylvian fissure and striated
                    nucleus. The vertebral, entering’ by the occipital hole, send branches to the
                    head of the spinal chord, and uniting to form the basilar, supply the
                    protuberance and cerebellum; then divaricating into posterior cerebral, finally
                    inosculate with the internal carotid to form the arterial hexagon as mentioned.
                    The blood is returned by triangular canals named sinuses, of which there are the
                    superior longitudinal, the inferior longitudinal, the cerebellic <hi
                    rend="italic">(torcular</hi><hi rend="italic">Herophili),</hi> the lateral, the
                    circular, the superior petrous, the inferior petrous, and the cavernous. The
                    four latter pairs are small sinuses opening into the lateral, where it emerges
                    from the cranium by the temporo-occipital fissure <hi rend="italic">(foramen
                    lacerum in base</hi><hi rend="italic">cranii posterius).</hi></p>
                <p>§ 2. THE CEREBRAL INVESTMENTS OR MEMBRANES.</p>
                <p>The brain is said to be surrounded by three membranous envelopes, the hard
                    membrane <hi rend="italic">(meninx dura, dura mater),</hi> the web-likc membrane
                    <hi rend="italic">(tunica</hi><hi rend="italic">arachnoidea),</hi> and the soft
                    or thin membrane <hi rend="italic">(meninx tenuis, pia mater).</hi> To this
                    arrangement, which has been adopted by almost all writers, there is perhaps no
                    great objection. But it simplifies the subject, without misrepresenting, to
                    refer them to two only; one of which, the hard membrane <hi rend="italic"
                    >(meninx dura, μηvιγξ</hi> &lt;rκλη^, <hi rend="italic">dura mater),</hi> is
                    common to the brain with the inner surface of the scull; the other, the thin
                    membrane <hi rend="italic">(nιeninx tenuis, μrinγζ λε~rη, pia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mater),</hi> is proper to the brain only. They may be
                    distinguished, therefore, by the terms <hi rend="italic">common membrane of the
                    brain</hi> and <hi rend="italic">proper membrane of the brain.</hi> The
                    arachnoid, again, is a pellucid web common to the cerebral membranes.</p>
                <p>The first of these, the common or hard cerebral membrane <hi rend="italic"
                    >(meηiηx dura, dura mater),</hi> presents two surfaces, an outer or cranial and
                    an inner or cerebral. The outer surface is irregular, filamentous, and vascular,
                    and the substance of which it consists is distinctly fibrous. The fibres,
                    however, do not follow any uniform direction, but are interwoven irregularly.
                    Maceration causes this membrane to swell and become separated into fibrous
                    threads. It is liberally supplied with blood-vessels, by which it is connected
                    to the inner surface of the scull. No nerves or absorbents have been discovered
                    in it. This outer or cranial surface of the <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> is
                    of the nature of periosteum. Its vessels may be traced into the inner table; it
                    contributes to the formation of the cranial bones in the foetus, and their
                    nutrition during life.</p>
                <p>The inner or cerebral surface of this membrane is smooth, polished, and shining;
                    and, when examined in water, it appears to be formed by a very thin, transparent
                    membrane, through which the cranial or outer surface and the fibrous structure
                    of the hard membrane may be recognised. This pellucid inner membräne, generally
                    termed the <hi rend="italic">inner lamina,</hi> is the exterior division of the
                    arachnoid membrane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> is an extensive membrane, lining not only
                    the interior surface of the scull, but, in a modified form, that of the whole
                    vertebral column. The inner surface of each vertebra has a proper periosteum
                    continuous with the periosteum of the outer surface; and from this issues a
                    quantity of filamentous tissue, which penetrates directly a membranous canal,
                    evidently of fibrous structure <hi rend="italic">(theca</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >vertebralis),</hi> tough and firm, but more delicate than the cranial <hi
                    rend="italic">dura</hi><hi rend="italic                         subscript">
                    t</hi><hi rend="italic">mater.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> in its
                    course forms sundry prolongations; for instance, the large crescentic one named
                    the <hi rend="italic">falx,</hi> the horizontal one termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >tentorium,</hi> and the small crescentic one named <hi rend="italic">falx
                    minor</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cerebelli.</hi></p>
                <p>The thin, soft, or immediate and proper cerebral membrane <hi rend="italic">(pia
                    mater, meninx tenuis)</hi> presents in like manner two surfaces, a smooth or
                    cranial, which is exterior, and a filamentous or cerebral, which is interior and
                    central.</p>
                <p>The outer or smooth surface of the thin membrane <hi rend="italic">(pia
                    mater)</hi> has a glistening appearance, and is formed by a very thin
                    transparent membrane, exactly similar to that which forms the cerebral surface
                    of the <hi rend="italic">dura mater.</hi> This surface, named in the ordinary
                    works the web-like membrane <hi rend="italic">(tunica arachnoidea),</hi> is
                    believed to be a separate membrane from the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> but that which forms the inner or cerebral surface of the
                    <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> has a claim equally strong to this
                    distinction.</p>
                <p>The inner or cerebral surface of the proper membrane is filamentous, flocculent,
                    and sends out many angular filamentous processes, which, by numerous minute
                    arteries and veins, communicate with the convoluted surface of the brain. These
                    processes <hi rend="italic">(tomenta)</hi> correspond to the furrows of the
                    convoluted surface in which they are lodged. In detaching the membrane from this
                    part of the brain, numerous vessels are drawn out of its substance; and when the
                    membrane is injected these vessels may be seen distinctly filled, and
                    communicating with the gray matter of the convoluted surface. The veins of this
                    membrane may be traced to the sinuses. Neither nerves nor absorbents have yet
                    been recognised in it. Bichat considers it to contain much cellular tissue,
                    which, however, is denied by Gordon, who could not recognise it. The difference,
                    however, consists merely in name. The <hi rend="italic">pia mater,</hi> indeed,
                    possesses no cellular tissue like the subcutaneous, the submucous, or the
                    subserous. If, however, a portion of the arachnoid be peeled from it by careful
                    management of the forceps and blowpipe, there is found a quantity of loose
                    filamentous matter uniting this tissue to the fine web of the former. The
                    existence of this tissue between the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi> and

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pia mater,</hi> or proper membrane of the brain, consists
                    of two parts, an outer, covering the <hi rend="italic">convoluted</hi> surface
                    of the brain, and an inner or central, entering the cavities formed by the
                    inner, central, or figurate surface, and spread over this surface in the form of
                    what has been termed the vascular or choroid web <hi rend="italic">(plexus
                    choroïdes;</hi><hi rend="italic">tela</hi><hi rend="italic">choroidea).</hi></p>
                <p>The continuity of the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi> or exterior division of
                    the proper cerebral membrane, with the choroid plexus or interior division, may
                    be demonstrated in the following manner. <hi rend="italic">First,</hi> The <hi
                    rend="italic">pia mater</hi> may be traced behind and below the posterior
                    extremity of the middle band <hi rend="italic">(ΰωμα.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >rιλλοn0ες, corpus callosum,</hi> der balken), where it is continuous with the

                    >interpositum,</hi> and which may be regarded as the first part of the central

                    rend="italic">velum</hi><hi rend="italic">interpositum,</hi> it may be traced
                    forwards on both sides of the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040365?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-0365-0812"/> mesial plane into the lateral ventricles, spread
                    over the surface of the optic <hi rend="italic">thalamus</hi> and striated
                    eminence in the form of the vascular web called <hi rend="italic">choroid
                    plexus,</hi> the right half of which communicates with the left by means of a
                    similar slip of vascular membrane lying beneath the vault <hi rend="italic"
                    >(fornix),</hi> and behind the anterior pillars of that body at the spot termed
                    <hi rend="italic">foramen Moηroianum. Thirdly,</hi> It may be traced over the
                    geniculate bodies and <hi rend="italic">thalami</hi> into the posterior-inferior
                    <hi rend="italic">cornu,</hi> or sinuosity of the lateral ventricle, where it
                    covers the <hi rend="italic">great hippocampus. Fourthly,</hi> It may be traced
                    at the angle between the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >medulla oblongata,</hi> or what is named the bottom of the fourth ventricle,
                    where it forms a very minute choroid plexus, seldom noticed by anatomists, but
                    not less distinct, and which may be traced up the fourth ventricle to be
                    connected with the <hi rend="italic">velum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >interpositum,</hi> in the middle ventricle, and with the lateral portions of
                    the hippocampus on each side. Each of the divisions of the choroid plexus now
                    enumerated may be shown to be mutually connected, and to form parts of one
                    general membrane, which again constitutes the inner or central division of the
                    membrane of which the <hi rend="italic">pia mater</hi> forms the exterior. Each
                    division of the choroid plexus, in like manner, is connected, by means of minute
                    bloodvessels, to the portion of the figurate cerebral surface on which it rests;
                    and it appears to sustain vessels as theynα <hi rend="italic">mater</hi> does to
                    the convoluted surface.</p>
                <p>In clear water the choroid plexus may be spread out, like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pia mater,</hi> in the shape of a thin semitransparent web, one surface of
                    which is smooth, the other somewhat flocculent, and the substance of which is
                    traversed by numerous minute vessels. The transparent web, which forms the basis
                    of this membrane, is filamcnto-vascular; and its smooth free surface, a
                    continuation of the arachnoid membrane, is smooth, polished, and thin, like
                    silver paper.</p>
                <p>The arachnoid membrane is common to the <hi rend="italic">dura mater, pia
                    mater,</hi> and choroid plexus. It covers the inner surface of the first
                    membrane, to which it communicates its shining polished appearance, though the
                    want of subjacent filamentous tissue causes it to adhere so firmly, that it
                    cannot be readily demonstrated. After covering the free surface of the <hi
                    rend="italic">pia mater,</hi> it follows the course of that membrane into the
                    central surface of the brain, and covers the upper or unadherent surface of the
                    several divisions of the choroid plexus. For the demonstration of this fact we
                    must be permitted to refer to Dr Craigic’s <hi rend="italic">Elements of General
                    Anatomy</hi> (chap, xxiii. seet. 1), where the reader will find proofs, which
                    the limits of this sketch do not allow us to adduce here.</p>
                <p>From these it results that the arachnoid membrane possesses in arrangement and
                    distribution a great resemblance to the serous membranes. It differs,
                    nevertheless, in its extreme tenuity, in the closeness with which it adheres to
                    the collateral tissues, and in its slight disposition to albuminous exudation.
                    It appears to contain in its structure less filamentous tissue than the pure
                    serous membranes.</p>
                <p>The brain is developed from the branches of the internal carotid and vertebral
                    arteries ramified through the vascular membrane <hi rend="italic">(pia
                    mater).</hi> Formation commences in two orders of vessels mutually directed to
                    each other,—those of the convoluted surface <hi rend="italic">(pia mater),</hi>
                    and those of the central <hi rend="italic">(plexus choroides).</hi> The central
                    substance of each part is first deposited; and from these points deposition and
                    moulding proceed to the two circumferences of the organ. The surfaces arė
                    therefore formed last; and the vessels gradually shrink as the process
                    approaches to completion.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. THE DISTRIBUTED CHORDS; THE NERVES.</p>
                <p>The nerves may be distinguished into classes according to the parts of the brain
                    with which their cerebral ends are connected. On this principle they may be
                    arranged in the following order.</p>

                <p>The spinal nerves are derived from anterior and posterior roots separated by the
                    <hi rend="italic">ligamentum denticulatum,</hi> a fibrous notched ligament,
                    covered by arachnoid membrane. According to the researches of Charles Bell and
                    Magendie, the anterior roots furnish motive filaments, and the posterior
                    sensitive. The central connections of most of these nerves have been already
                    mentioned; and their distributed connections have been, and will continue to be,
                    incidentally noticed under the heads of the several organs. It is requisite,
                    however, to notice shortly the relations and general distribution of several
                    nervous chords which perform an important part in the functions of the animal
                    body. These arc the pneumogastric, the phrenic, and the great sympathetic or
                    intercostal nerves.</p>

                    the 8th pair of tlιe i old nomenclature, the 10th in correct enumeration of theí

                    from the posterior upper surface of the latter, emerges from the cranium with
                    the jugular vein by the temporo-occipital hole. Here, closely united by
                    filamentous tissue to the hypoglossal, spinal, and glosso-pharyngeal, it
                    descends before the <hi rend="italic">rectus</hi><hi rend="italic">anticus</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">longus</hi><hi rend="italic">colli</hi> on the outside of
                    the carotid artery, though in the sheath witlι it, and before the subclavian
                    artery on the right side, on the left before the carotid, enters the chest,
                    where it enlarges in size considerably. (Plate XXXI. v, v.) In the chest it
                    passes behind the <hi rend="italic">bronchi</hi> in the posterior fold of the
                    <hi rend="italic">pleura,</hi> and is closely connected to the oesophagus in the
                    shape of a thin cord. Both trunks, on reaching the cardiac end of this tube,
                    pass with it through the diaphragmatic aperture, and are distributed to the
                    stomach. In this course the pneumogastric nerve is divided into five orders of
                    filaments.</p>
                <p>1. In the neck it gives branches to the pharynx, and, communicating with the
                    glosso-pharyngeal, forms the pharyngeal plexus, and furnishes a superior
                    laryngeal branch, an external laryngeal, and an internal laryngeal, the latter
                    chiefly to the intrinsic muscles of the larynx.</p>
                <p>2. In the chest it sends off branches, which, communicating with those of the
                    superior cervical ganglion, are distributed to the heart.</p>
                <p>3. In the chest also it gives off the inferior laryngeal or recurrent nerve (r),
                    which on the right side winding round the subclavian, on the left the arch of
                    the aorta, re-asccnds in the lateral furrow between the windpipe and <hi

                    thyroid, and tracheal filaments, is finally distributed to the intrinsic muscles
                    of the laryngeal cartilages. These multiplied connections tend to associate the
                    motions of the glottis with the lungs, and to maintain a general consent between
                    the nharvnx. larvnx. oesoŋhauus, trachea, lungs, and heart.</p>

                <p>4. The pneumogastrĩc trunk forms with the filaments of the inferior cervical
                    ganglion the <hi rend="italic">anterior pulmonary plexus,</hi> and alone it
                    forms the <hi rend="italic">posterior pulmonary plexus,</hi> which sends

                    the pulmonary artery and veins, and the <hi rend="italic">oesophagus.</hi></p>
                <p>5. After passing the diaphragmatic aperture, the right pneumogastrĩc trunk forms
                    at the cardiac orifice of the stomach a plexus, from which filaments proceed to
                    the <hi rend="italic">pylorus,</hi> the gastro-hepatic artery, the right coeliac
                    ganglion, the duodenum, the pancreas, the gall-bladder, and the liver, where it
                    communicates freely with the coeliac ganglions. The pneumogastric of the left
                    side is distributed chiefly to the pylorus and its arteries, and communicates
                    freely with those of the right.</p>

                    and enters the chest between the subclavian artery and vein. The right passes
                    down on the surface of the right lung, beneath the pleura <hi rend="italic"
                    >(&lt;p, &lt;p,</hi> Plate XXXI.); the left over the pericardium; and both are
                    distributed chiefly to the diaphragm.</p>
                <p>The great sympathetic is much more complicated than either of these nerves. It
                    cannot be said to originate from one part more than from another. Though
                    connected with the brain by means of a communicating filament of the sixth pair,
                    it certainly does not arise from that nerve: nor can it be said to arise from
                    the spinal nerves, though connected with them on each side of the dorsal
                    vertebrae. It appears more rational to regard it as a general and extensive
                    network of nervous filaments, which establish a communication between different
                    important organs. Connected above with three ganglions of the neck, the <hi
                    rend="italic">superior, inferior,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">middle
                    cervical,</hi> and by minute filaments with the lateral-facial, or eighth
                    cerebral, pneumogastric, and glosso-pharyngeal, with which it contributes to
                    form the pharyngeal plexus, it sends off the <hi rend="italic">nervi molles</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">superficial cardiac nerve.</hi> Below the inferior cervical
                    ganglion, generally regarded as a cardiac, the trunk enlarges, and furnishes
                    filaments to the pulmonary and cardiac plexus, the former divided into right or
                    anterior and left or posterior, and the latter into superior and inferior. About
                    the seventh dorsal <hi rend="italic">vertebra,</hi> after being connected with
                    all the intercostal nerves and inferior thoracic ganglions, it forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">splanchnic,</hi> which, though only the abdominal part of the
                    great sympathetic, may be regarded as a separate nerve. The constituent
                    filaments of this nerve, after being united into two ganglions, the coeliac or
                    semilunar, are resolved into plexiform arrangements, which surround all the
                    principal arteries, and with them are lost in the substance of the organs. Thus
                    the coeliac artery is inclosed by the coeliac plexus; and each of its divisions,
                    the coronary or proper gastric and the gastro-hepatic and gastrosplenic, are
                    inclosed in similar plexiform networks. In the same manner, the superior
                    mesenteric, inferior mesenteric, and renal arteries, have each an appropriate
                    plexus; and those of the colon, bladder, and uterus have small plexiform
                    arrangements, which constitute parts of the same general system. In short, the
                    great sympathetic or intercostal forms an independent nervous system of its own,
                    and though not derived from the dorsal nerves, is intimately connected with
                    them; and its distribution to the organs of digestion, of circulation,
                    respiration, and secretion, is connected chiefly with the associated actions of
                    these organs.</p>
                <p>Our limits do not, however, admit of details; and the reader who wishes to
                    understand the minute anatomical relations of these chords, will find the most

                <p>PART II.</p>
                <p>ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS PERTAINING TO THE ENTRO-PHIC OR NUTRITIVE FUNCTIONS.</p>
                <p>The growth of the animal body is effected, and its size and strength maintained,
                    by a class of organs which may be named the <hi rend="italic">Entrophic</hi> or
                    <hi rend="italic">Nutritive.</hi> These organs agree in the possession of
                    certain common characters, by which they are distinguished from those of the
                    functions of Relation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">first</hi> common character is the want of symmetry in
                    arrangement and harmony in action. Instead of being arranged on the median line,
                    or with similar parts on each of its sides, the organ, or part of the organ,
                    which is on one side, bears no resemblance to that which is on the other. Even
                    in the case of the lungs, though there is a general resemblance, the left
                    differs from the right not only in size and shape, but in the number of its
                    lobes.</p>
                <p>It must not be understood, nevertheless, that the organs of this class are
                    altogether void of symmetrical figure. A plane may be made to divide the stomach
                    even into similar halves, so as to leave on each side similar parts of the <hi
                    rend="italic">cardia,</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">pylorus,</hi> and of the
                    intermediate parts. This plane, however, corresponds not with the mesial plane,
                    but passes transversely from left to right. Nearly the same rule is applicable
                    to other organs.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">second</hi> general character of the entrophic organs is,
                    that in action they are not under the influence of the will. The contractions of
                    the muscular tissue of the stomach, and the secretion of its mucous surface, the
                    peristaltic motion of the intestinal tube, the beats of the heart, and the
                    action of the liver, are equally independent of volition. This character Bichat
                    attempted in every instance to trace to independence on the influence of the
                    brain and the cerebral nerves. In one sense this is a truism, in so far as it
                    merely implies that the organs of the entrophic functions do not belong to those
                    of relation. In another sense it is a gratuitous, if not a hypothetical
                    assumption. Though the brain is evidently very intimately associated with the
                    organs of the animal functions, it is not yet determined that it is entirely
                    unconnected with those of the cntrophic order. Serious lesion or injury of the
                    brain or the protuberance operates as forcibly on the action of the heart as on
                    that of the muscles of the extremities. On the whole, the safest mode of
                    defining this character is merely to state the independence of the entrophic
                    organs on the will.</p>
                <p>Several of the organs of the eutrophic function are nevertheless in some degree
                    under the influence of the will. The lungs, for example, by being dilated only
                    by the dilating agents of the chest, are within certain limits under the
                    voluntary power. To this, however, a limit is fixed. Though inspiration or
                    expiration may be effected at the will of the individual, or suspended for a
                    little, very soon the accomplishment of these actions is no longer arbitrary. In
                    like manner, though the bladder is evacuated by the voluntary effort of the
                    individual, the stimulus by which the action is induced is involuntary
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>A <hi rend="italic">third</hi> anatomical character common to the entrophic
                    organs is, that all of them are situate in the interior of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040391?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0391-0814"/> trunk,
                    protected by those of the locomotive system; and that they arc lined on one side
                    by mucous membrane, continuous with the external integuments. By means of this
                    arrangement, which is necessarily allied with their property of converting
                    foreign into proper matter, all the entrophic organs, with the exception of the
                    heart, communicate with the surface of the body.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">A fourth</hi> anatomical character common to these organs is,
                    that though continuous by their mucous investment with the outer surface of the
                    body, their opposite, placed on the outside of the serous membranes, forms shut
                    cavities, not communicating, unless in one instance—the peritoneal end of the
                    oviduct in the female—with the external surface. Whatever be the intermediate
                    substance, these organs are placed between the mucous and serous membranes.</p>
                <p>The entrophic organs may be distinguished into two orders, according to the
                    degree of the process performed by each. The nutritive function consists of two
                    subordinate functions, the <hi rend="italic">limitrophic</hi> or alimentary, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">haematrophic</hi> or circulatory; the first the
                    preparation of the materials destined to be employed in nutrition; the second
                    the distribution of these, after preparation, to the different regions and
                    organs of the system. The organs by which the first process is accomplished
                    constitute the first order; those by which the second is effected constitute the
                    second order.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I. THE LIMITROPHIC ORGANS.</p>
                <p>The limitrophic organs consist of two divisions; those for digestion of the food,
                    or the chylopoietic, and those for absorption of its nutritious part. The former
                    is effected in successive processes in the divisions of the alimentary canal, a
                    tubular musculo-membranous apparatus, extending from the mouth to the anus. The
                    second is accomplished by an assemblage of minute valvular tubes, the lacteals,
                    terminating in the thoracic duct.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. THE ORGANS OF DIGESTION; THE CHYLOPOIETIC</p>
                <p>ORGANS.</p>
                <p>The organs of mastication have been described already in the fourth section of
                    the second chapter of Part First.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pharynx,</hi> placed on the median line, symmetrical and
                    regular, occupying the upper part of the neck, makes a close approach to the
                    organs of relation, and marks the transition from these to those of the
                    entrophic function. Attached above to the cuneiform process of the occipital
                    bone, behind to the cervical vertebrae, and with the nostrils, mouth, and larynx
                    before, it forms an irregular vaulted apartment about four inches long and two
                    broad at its widest part, and contracting below, where it is continuous with the
                    <hi rend="italic">oesophagus.</hi> Besides the opening into this tube, the <hi
                    rend="italic">pharynx</hi> presents six apertures; the pharyngeal apertures of
                    the nostrils, the pharyngeal orifice of the mouth, the upper end of the larynx,
                    and the pharyngeal apertures of the Eustachian tube.</p>
                <p>It consists of a mucous membrane stretched over loose filamentous tissue inclosed
                    by three muscles, the superior, inferior, and middle <hi rend="italic"
                    >constrictor,</hi> and attached to the cuneiform process, the cervical
                    vertebrae, and the lateral regions of the neck, by filamentous tissue.</p>
                <p>By the superior laryngeal, the pharyngeal, the thyroid, the lingual, and palatine
                    arteries, it receives blood, which is returned by a still greater number of
                    veins to the external and internal jugular trunks. The nerves of the pharynx
                    come from the glosso-pharyngeal, the hypoglossal, the pneumogastric, and the
                    great sympathetic.</p>
                <p>• The <hi rend="italic">oesophagus (gula) is</hi> a cylindrical
                    musculo-membranous tube, communicating above with the pharynx, and below with
                    the stomach. Placed above between the cervical vertebrae behind and the windpipe
                    before, at the lower end of the larynx it inclines to the left, returns to' the
                    median line at the sternum, bends again to the left at the bifurcation of the
                    trachea, and continues on the left side of the line, passing the aperture of the
                    diaphragm, near the ninth dorsal <hi rend="italic">vertebra,</hi> to its
                    junction with the stomach. With the vertebral column behind, at its first
                    inclination it covers the <hi rend="italic">longus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >colli</hi> in the chest, crosses the <hi rend="italic">vena azygos</hi> above,
                    and covers the thoracic duct in the middle, and the aorta below. With the
                    jugular veins and carotids on each side in the neck, below it has the <hi
                    rend="italic">trachea</hi> on the right, and the recurrent nerve and common
                    carotid on the left; and in the chest it has the aorta on the left and behind.
                    (Plate XXIX. fig. 2, c.)</p>
                <p>Lined on the inside by a follicular mucous membrane which assumes longitudinal
                    folds <hi rend="italic">(plicae),</hi> the oesophagus consists of two ranges of
                    muscular fibres, the one transverse, the other longitudinal. The first are most
                    distinct at the pharyngeal end. The second form a manifest thick layer through
                    the whole extent of the tube. Externally is a quantity of filamentous tissue,
                    connecting the tube to that of the mediastinum and adjoining parts.</p>
                <p>The oesophagus is supplied with blood from the inferior thyroid, thymic,
                    laryngeal, pharyngeal; the aorta by proper oesophageal arteries, the superior
                    intercostale and bronchials, the pericardial, mediastinal, diaphragmatics, and
                    even the coronary of the stomach. The blood is returned by veins equally
                    numerous. The oesophageal nerves proceed from three different sources. Above, it
                    receives filaments from the glosso-pharyngeal and pneumogastric, in the middle
                    from the latter, and below from the pneumogastric and the great sympathetic.</p>
                <p>The stomach <hi rend="italic">(ventriculus)</hi> is a large pyriform
                    musculo-mcmbranous sac, incurvated on itself (Plate XXIX. fig. 2, and Plate
                    XXXVI. fig. 4), situate in the epigastric and left hypochondriac regions,
                    communicating above with theoeso-phagus, and below with the duodenum. Bounded
                    above by the diaphragm, and the liver, which covers it, it has the spleen
                    attached to its left great extremity, the transverse arch of the colon to the
                    inferior large arch; and its posterior surface corresponds to the duodenum,
                    pancreas, mesocolon, and large abdominal vessels.</p>
                <p>The pyriform sac of the stomach is distinguished into a large end or sac <hi
                    rend="italic">(fundus),</hi> and a small extremity named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pyloric</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while a particular incurvation of its
                    direction gives it a large inferior arch <hi rend="italic">(arcus major),</hi>
                    and a small superior arch <hi rend="italic">(arcus minor).</hi> At the left
                    extremity of the latter is the <hi rend="italic">cardia,</hi> the orifice by
                    which the oesophagus enters the stomach <hi rend="italic">(osteum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">oesophageum)</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and from this round the
                    <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi> is the large arch. A vertical plane drawn from the
                    <hi rend="italic">cardia</hi> divides the stomach into two portions,—the <hi
                    rend="italic">cardiac (fundus,</hi><hi rend="italic">saccus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">coecus),</hi> and <hi rend="italic">pyloric,</hi> terminating in
                    an annular contracted opening, about an inch broad <hi rend="italic">(pylorus,
                    ostium</hi><hi rend="italic">duodenale sive pyloricum).</hi> Between the two
                    arches is the <hi rend="italic">superior-anterior</hi> surface, covered partly
                    by the left lobe of the liver, partly by the left <hi rend="italic">rectus</hi>
                    and hypochondre, and the <hi rend="italic">inferior-posterior</hi> surface
                    behind.</p>
                <p>The stomach consists of peritoneum externally, mucous membrane internally, and an
                    intermediate muscular layer with filamentous tissue.</p>
                <p>The peritoneal covering is arranged in a peculiar manner. The anterior fold,
                    meeting the posterior at the small arch, joins it, and forms a membranous
                    production <hi rend="italic">(omentum gastro-hepaticum),</hi> connecting the
                    organ to the inferior surface of the liver, where they again separate tc invest
                    the upper and lower divisions of that organ. These folds, meeting in like manner
                    along the large arch, where they form similar duplicatures, are again separated
                    to in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040404?mode=fullsize"

                    along the lower division. In the triangular spaces formed by these duplicatures
                    the gastric blood-vessels are lodged.</p>
                <p>The mucous membrane, void of epidermis, is covered with minute piles <hi

                    termination of the oesophageal epidermis, to the pyloric, where they are
                    continuous with those of the duodenum. It is further puckered into wrinkles <hi
                    rend="italic">(rugae)</hi> or folds <hi rend="italic">(plicae),</hi>
                    intersecting each other irregularly, and inclosing irregular quadrilateral
                    spaces,— an effect produced-by the contraction of the muscular coat, and
                    connected with the great extent of the gastric villous membrane. In this also
                    are contained follicular glands, especially at the pyloric end and along the two
                    curvatures.</p>
                <p>The muscular coat consists of two ranges of fibres, one longitudinal, following
                    the great diameter from the <hi rend="italic">cardia</hi> to the pyloric end;
                    the other circular internal, inclosing the circumference of the organ, and most
                    distinct when the organ is empty. On the latter depends the contracted
                    incurvation of the stomach between the cardiac and pyloric divisions. (Plate
                    XXXVI. fig. 4.) Besides these, there are on the left side of the cardia muscular
                    slips expanded on the two surfaces.</p>
                <p>The stomach derives its blood from the coeliac artery, the branches of which are
                    arranged in a peculiar and beautiful manner. The coeliac divides into three
                    vessels; one gastric proper, the <hi rend="italic">coronary</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> one common to it and the liver, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >gastro-hepatic</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and one common to it and the
                    spleen, the <hi rend="italic">gastrosplenic.</hi> The first, the coronary, is
                    distributed to the cardiac end, and, lodged in the peritoneal fold of the small
                    arch, proceeds towards the <hi rend="italic">pylorus,</hi> distributing branches
                    before and behind. The second, after sending a large vessel to the liver, the
                    hepatic, sends a small one <hi rend="italic">(arteria pylorica),</hi> from the
                    pyloric end, towards the gastric, by the superior peritoneal fold, to meet the
                    terminal branches of the coronary; and a large one <hi rend="italic"
                    >(gastro-epiploica</hi><hi rend="italic">dextra),</hi> by that of the large
                    curvature, to meet the terminal branches of the left <hi rend="italic"
                    >gastro-epiploic.</hi> The third or spleno-gastric artery, after transmitting a
                    large vessel to the spleen, and various small vessels <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vasa</hi><hi rend="italic">brevia)</hi> to the large <hi rend="italic"
                    >fundus,</hi> sends a large vessel <hi rend="italic">(gastroepiploica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sinistra),</hi> in the peritoneal fold of the large arch, to
                    inosculate with the terminal branches of the right gastro-epiploic. The stomach
                    is in this manner embraced, as it were, by arterial canals above and below. It
                    is further remarkable, that while only one proper gastric artery, of
                    inconsiderable size and limited distribution, proceeds from the coeliac trunk,
                    the gastro-hepatic and gastro-splenic, each not much less than the coeliac
                    itself, send their largest branches to the stomach, and proceeding from opposite
                    ends of that organ, inclose it, meeting by inosculation in the middle of its
                    great and small curvatures. From the capillaries at <hi rend="italic">↑be
                    fundus,</hi> chiefly the <hi rend="italic">vasa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >brada,</hi> the gastric fluid appears to be secreted. The blood, returned by
                    corresponding veins, is poured into the portal.</p>
                <p>The stomach receives nerves from the pneumogastric and the great sympathetic. In
                    the stomach the alimentary mass is converted into the pulp named chyme.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">duodenum (ventriculus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >succenturiatus),</hi> about twelve inches long in the human subject, is
                    distinguished by being the most fixed part of the tube in situation. Placed on
                    the vertebral column, and on each side in the cavity of the «mesocolon, behind
                    the stomach, and concealed by that organ, it is bounded above by the liver and
                    gallbladder, below by the pancreas and lower part of the mesocolon, and
                    maintains the communication with the pyloric end of the stomach and the ileum.
                    The duodenum is divided by two curvatures into three portions. The first, which
                    is covered by peritoneum, extending from the pylorus to the site of the neck of
                    the gall-bladder, horizontally backwards and a little to the right, descends
                    about two inches almost perpendicularly. With this the second portion, forming
                    an angle, ascends obliquely to the left, and terminates opposite the third
                    lumbar <hi rend="italic">vertebra.</hi> The third, forming an angle rather more
                    than right, extends about two or three inches, and terminates at the peritoneal
                    ring, about one inch on the left of the spine, where the ileum commences. The
                    aperture of the common biliary duct, inclosed in a nipple-like process, and the
                    pancreatic, are in the first portion. These curvatures are firmly connected by
                    filamentous tissue; and the bowel retains them even after removal from the
                    body.</p>
                <p>The duodenum, void of peritoneal covering, consists externally of cellular
                    tissue, inclosing a range of circular muscular fibres, and lined by villo-mucous
                    membrane, arranged in numerous folds, or <hi rend="italic">valvulae
                    conniventes.</hi> The duodenal arteries are derived chiefly from the
                    gastro-hepatic, and are very generally pyloric twigs. This membrane is provided
                    with follicles, first well described by Brunner.</p>
                <p>In the duodenum, by admixture of the biliary and pancreatic fluids with the
                    chyme, the latter is prepared for the separation of chyle, which, though more
                    proper to the ileum, is begun nevertheless in this bowel. The comparative
                    immobility of the bowel is requisite, both in consequence of the admixture now
                    mentioned, and also of the fixed situation of the two glands by which the fluids
                    are supplied.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi> (ε∕λεov) or small intestine <hi rend="italic"
                    >(intestinum</hi><hi rend="italic">tenue),</hi> the longest part of the
                    intestinal tube, extending generally from 28 to 30 feet, commences at the
                    annular process above mentioned, and extends to the head of the colon, in which
                    it opens in the right iliac region. It consists of a cylindrical
                    musculo-membranous tube, surrounded by peritoneum, the two folds of which,
                    meeting behind, attach it for the space of three or four inches to the vertebral
                    column, and are again reflected laterally, as described in the first book of
                    this treatise. This attaching membrane is named the mesentery. The great length
                    of the tube, with the small extent of the mesentery, causes it to hang suspended
                    in numerous turns or convolutions. By the ancients this intestine was
                    distinguished into two parts, <hi rend="italic">jejunum</hi> or the empty, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi> proper; and Winslow idly undertook to fix the
                    limits of this division by referring the two upper thirds to the former, and the
                    two lower to the latter. This distinction, however, for which there is no
                    anatomical foundation, must be rejected as at once arbitrary and useless.</p>
                <p>The muscular tunic consists of circular fibres entirely.</p>
                <p>The villo-mucous membrane presents numerous <hi rend="italic">valvulce
                    conniventes,</hi> which increase its surface to at least double that of its
                    proper area. These duplicatures are most numerous in the upper part of the tube,
                    and diminish as they descend.</p>
                <p>The mucous surface of the ileum is peculiar in presenting the piles or
                    villosities in their most perfect form. When a portion of ileum is inverted,
                    inflated, and immersed in pure water, an infinite number of minute processes are
                    seen waving amidst the fluid; but a powerful glass does not enable the observer
                    to determine whether they are round or flat, solid or hollow, obtuse or pointed.
                    Of their shape and structure various accounts are given.</p>
                <p>They were first represented, in 1721, by Helvetius, as cylindrical prominences in
                    quadrupeds, but conical in the human subject. According to the microscopical
                    observations of Lieberkuhn, each <hi rend="italic">villus</hi> receives a minute
                    lacteal tube, arterial branches, a vein, and a nerve; and in each the lacteal is
                    expanded into a minute sac or bladder <hi rend="italic">(ampullula,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">vesicula)</hi> like an egg, in the apex of which may be seen by
                    the microscope a minute opening.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040417?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0417-0816"/>
                <p>On this sac the arterial branches are ramified to great delicacy, and terminate
                    in minute veins, which then unite into one trunk; while its inner surface he
                    represents as spongy and cellular. The space between the <hi rend="italic"
                    >villi,</hi> which do not touch each other, he further represents to be occupied
                    by the open orifices of follicles, so numerous that he counted eighty of them
                    where were eighteen <hi rend="italic">villi;</hi> and both, he asserts, are
                    covered by a thin but tenacious membrane similar to epidermis.</p>
                <p>Hewson, while he admits in each villus the ramification of minute arteries and
                    veins, denies the saccular expansion, and infers that the lacteals are ramified
                    in the same manner as the blood-vessels, and that the whole constitute a broad
                    flat body, the spongy appearance of which he ascribes to the mutual ramification
                    of the latter. With this in general Cruikshank agrees; while Sheldon, who found
                    the <hi rend="italic">villi</hi> not only round and cylindrical as Hewson, but
                    bulbous as Lieberkuhn, and even sabre-shaped, rather confirms the statements of
                    that anatomist. Mascagni and Soemmering, agreeing in the general fact of
                    vascular and lacteal structure, seem to represent the shape of the <hi
                    rend="italic">villus</hi> as that of a mushroom, consisting of a stalk and a <hi
                    rend="italic">pileus.</hi></p>
                <p>Some of these discordant statements Hedwig attempts with equal ingenuity and
                    industry to reconcile. The differences in shape he refers to differences in the
                    animals oxamined; and in one class finds them cylindrical (e. <hi rend="italic"
                    >g.</hi> in man and the horse); in another conical (the dog); in a third
                    club-shaped (the pheasant); and in a fourth pointed or pyramidal <hi
                    rend="italic">(e. g.</hi> the mouse). The interior structure he also represents
                    as spongy in all the animals which he examined; and invariably also he found at
                    the apex the orifice of the duct, which, after the example of Lieberkuhn, he
                    conceives constitutes the <hi rend="italic">ampullula.</hi></p>
                <p>These conclusions are not exactly confirmed by the researches of Rudolphi, who
                    examined the <hi rend="italic">villi</hi> in man and a considerable number of
                    animals. This anatomist never found the orifice seen by Hedwig, notwithstanding
                    every care taken to distinguish it. He maintains that the <hi rend="italic"
                    >villi</hi> are not alike in all parts of the intestinal canal of the same
                    animal, as represented by Hedwig, but may be cylindrical in one part,
                    club-shaped in another, and acuminated in a third. Admitting their vascular
                    structure, which he thinks may be demonstrated, he regards the ampullular
                    expansion as doubtful, and denies its cellular arrangement.</p>
                <p>About the same time Bleuland, who had previously examined the intestinal mucous
                    membrane, after successful injection of its capillaries, undertook to revive the
                    leading circumstances of the description of Lieberkuhn. By examining
                    microscopically well-injected portions of intestine, he shows that the <hi
                    rend="italic">villi</hi> are composed of a system of very minute arterial and
                    venous capillaries, inclosing a lacteal, which constitutes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ampulla,</hi> and in the interior of which a certain order of these capillaries
                    terminates. He also revives the statement of the absorbing orifice at the
                    extremity of each <hi rend="italic">villus.</hi></p>
                <p>According to the observations of Beclarđ, the intestinal <hi rend="italic"
                    >villi</hi> appear neither conical, nor cylindrical, nor tubular, nor expanded
                    at top, as described by several authors, but in the shape of leaflets or minute
                    plates, so closely set that they form an abundant tufted pile. Their shape
                    varies according to the manner in which they are examined, and according to the
                    part. Those of the pyloric half of the stomach and <hi rend="italic"
                    >duodenum</hi> are broader than long, and form minute plates; those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">jejunum</hi> are long and narrow, constituting piles; at the end
                    of the <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi> they become laminar, and in the colon are
                    scarcely prominent. They are semitranslucent; their surface is smooth; and
                    neither openings at their surface, in their cavity, or in their interior, nor
                    vascular structure can be recognised.</p>
                <p>The villo-mucous membrane of the <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi> is provided with
                    mucous follicles of two orders, the <hi rend="italic">glandulae sοlita-riae</hi>
                    and the <hi rend="italic">glandulae agminatae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the
                    former, like granules, disseminated over the attached surface of the mucous
                    membrane; the latter clustered in bodies at the anterior exterior part. They
                    partake of the general characters of follicular structure.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi> is liberally supplied with blood by the superior
                    mesenteric artery, the arrangement and distribution of which may be understood
                    from fig. 4, Plate XXIX.</p>
                <p>The nerves arc derived from the solar <hi rend="italic">plexus.</hi></p>
                <p>The colon, or large intestine <hi rend="italic">(intestinum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >crassum),</hi> beginning in the right iliac region, extends round the folds of
                    the abdominal cavity, inclosing the <hi rend="italic">ileum,</hi> to the left
                    iliac and pelvic, where it terminates in the <hi rend="italic">rectum.</hi> Its
                    length is from six to seven feet. The beginning <hi rend="italic">(caput</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">caecum)</hi> is a round obtuse bowel, with a minute tubular
                    process, varying in length, named the vermiform. The lower end of the ileum is
                    inserted into the beginning of the colon laterally; and to the part below the
                    insertion the name of <hi rend="italic">caecum</hi> or blind gut is restricted.
                    From the <hi rend="italic">caeeum</hi> the colon descends to the right
                    hypochondre <hi rend="italic">(colon</hi><hi rend="italic">dextrum),</hi> where
                    it is connected at the hepatic flexure to the liver by the hepato-colic
                    ligament, two folds of peritoneum, with intermediate filamentous tissue; between
                    the right or hepatic flexure and the left or splenic it is distinguished as the
                    transverse arch <hi rend="italic">(colon</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >transversum),</hi> attached to the large arch of the stomach by the
                    gastro-colic margin of the <hi rend="italic">omentum;</hi> an angular bend in
                    the left hypochondre forms the splenic flexure; and, finally, after making a
                    long sinuous alternating bend in the left iliac and pelvic regions, named the
                    sigmoid flexure, it terminates in a portion comparatively straight <hi
                    rend="italic smallcaps"> (to</hi><hi rend="italic">tν∂ν, rectum),</hi> and
                    following only the antero-posterior incurvation of the inner surface of the
                    sacrum, on which it is placed.</p>
                <p>The colon is about two inches in diameter at an average.</p>
                <p>The appearance of this intestine is intimately connected with its structure.
                    Inclosed in peritoneum, by the posterior junction of which it is connected to
                    the adjoining organs, it consists of a layer of circular fibres, intersected by
                    three bands of longitudinal fibres. Both are asserted to be muscular; but
                    perhaps the latter are more of the nature of aponeurosis, to give support and
                    resistance to the action of the former. Whatever be their nature, however, they
                    give the colon the appearance of being divided into transverse cells, separated
                    by superficial partitions.</p>
                <p>The mucous membrane of the colon possesses the villous character in the caecum
                    and right part, but loses it towards the lower part of the intestine. It is
                    formed into large transverse folds or duplicatures, which separate the internal
                    cells or compartments of the bowel.</p>
                <p>At the insertion of the ileum into the colon the mucous membrane of each is
                    prolonged with the submucous tissue, and they mutually meet in two crescentic
                    processes, opc superior, small <hi rend="italic">(plica superior, labium</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">superius),</hi> the other inferior, large <hi rend="italic">(plica
                    inferior, labium</hi><hi rend="italic">inferius),</hi> and approaching, by its
                    greater prolongation, the paraboloid shape. The ileal side of both folds is
                    concave, the caecal or colic convex; and between their free margins, which are
                    rounded, is an intermediate fissure, maintaining the communication between the
                    two intestines. This arrangement, which is named the ileo-caecal valve <hi
                    rend="italic">(valvula Bau-hini,</hi> from its supposed discoverer), is supposed
                    to allow the transit of alimentary and excremental matter from the ileum to the
                    colon, but not in the converse direction.</p>
                <p>The organization of the rectum is the same as that of the colon generally; but it
                    is uncovered by peritoneum behind. Its lower extremity is surrounded by two
                    circular ranges of muscular fibres, named the internal and external<pb

                    sphincters. The lower fibres of the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ani</hi> are inserted into its sides.</p>
                <p>The caecum and right and transverse portions of the colon are supplied with blood
                    from the superior mesenteric, by means of the <hi rend="italic">colic</hi>
                    arteries. The left iliac or sigmoid flexure receives vessels from the inferior
                    mesenteric. The splenic part is supplied by vessels derived from the great
                    anastomotic communication between the superior and inferior mesenteries. (Plate
                    XXIX. fig. 4.) The <hi rend="italic">rectum</hi> is copiously supplied with
                    blood from three different sources. The first is the termination of the inferior
                    mesenteric, which is contained between the folds of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesarectum,</hi> under the name of <hi rend="italic">superior
                    hemorrhoidal.</hi> The second is the <hi rend="italic">middle hemorrhoidal,</hi>
                    or proper artery, derived from the hypogastric or posterior iliac. The third is
                    the <hi rend="italic">internalpudic,</hi> the lower or perineal branch of which
                    supplies the sphincter with several branches on each side, distinguished by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">inferior hemorrhoidal</hi> arteries.</p>
                <p>The nerves are derived partly from the hypogastric plexus, partly from the sacral
                    branches.</p>
                <p>The rectum, like the pharynx, placed between the two classes of organs, entrophic
                    and animal, belongs in some degree to both. As the termination of the alimentary
                    canal, it belongs to the former; but by its sphincters and <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator</hi> it pertains to the latter.</p>
                <p>The appendages of the alimentary canal are two glands, the liver and pancreas,
                    and a cellulo-vascular organ, the spleen.</p>
                <p>The liver <hi rend="italic">(hepar, jecur)</hi> is a large glandular organ,
                    weighing from two to three pounds, situate in the right hypochondriac and
                    epigastric regions, with the diaphragm above, and the hepatic flexure of the
                    colon and the stomach below. It has a convex upper surface, a concave lower one,
                    a posterior obtuse margin attached to the diaphragm by cellular tissue, and an
                    anterior inferior acute one which is free. The lower surface is distinguished
                    into right and left lobes by a middle pit <hi rend="italic">(sulcus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">umbilicalis,</hi><hi rend="italic">v.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >horizontalis),</hi> in which the round ligament, the residue of the umbilical
                    vein, is contained, and which is occasionally a canal by an arch of hepatic
                    substance. The inferior surface of the left lobe is divided into anterior and
                    posterior parts by a transverse furrow <hi rend="italic">(sulcus
                    transversus,</hi><hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">transversa),</hi>
                    in which the trunk of the hepatic arteries, and the portal vein, and the hepatic
                    ends of the biliary ducts, are contained. The margins of this furrow, which are
                    elevated in the lower animals, were named gates by the ancients (σuλα∕, <hi
                    rend="italic">portae),</hi> from an erroneous theory. The posterior, which is
                    most prominent, is distinguished by the name of small lobe of Spigelius <hi
                    rend="italic">(lobulus</hi><hi rend="italic">Spigelii).</hi> The other
                    distinctions of this surface into <hi rend="italic">lobulus quadratus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">lobulus caudatus</hi> are immaterial. Between the anterior
                    portal eminence and the umbilical <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> is an oval
                    depression <hi rend="italic">(fovea cystica),</hi> containing the gall
                    bladder.</p>
                <p>The liver is invested by peritoneum, the folds of which connect it to the
                    neighbouring organs, and retain it in its place. Of these, the most important
                    are the broad and coronary above, the lower or falciform below, and the
                    gastro-hepatic duplicature between the liver and stomach. This forms the
                    investment named <hi rend="italic">capsule</hi> of Glisson, in which the portal
                    veins are inclosed.</p>
                <p>The structure of the liver is glandular. Two classes of -vessels and a system of
                    tubes are distributed in it; one ramifying into branches and minute tubes, the
                    hepatic artery and portal vein; another, the hepatic veins, converging to a
                    trunk, the <hi rend="italic">vena cava</hi><hi rend="italic">hepatica</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the third, the <hi rend="italic">ρori biliarii,</hi>
                    converging into ducts terminating in the hepatic duct. From the researches of
                    numerous anatomists, it appears that the hepatic artery, which is derived from
                    the coeliac, and the portal vein, formed from the veins of the stomach,
                    intestines, spleen, and pancreas, terminate in minute vessels mutually
                    communicating. It appears further, that these capillaries communicate with those
                    of the hepatic veins, and even the origins of the biliary pores; and Soemmering
                    especially infers, that every hepatic <hi rend="italic">acinus</hi> consists of
                    hepatic artery, portal vein, hepatic vein, bile-pore, and lymphatic. From this,
                    however, it does not altogether result that bile is secreted from the hepatic
                    arterial blood. Each <hi rend="italic">acinus</hi> may require a minute artery
                    for nutrition, a portal venule for furnishing the materials of secretion, a duct
                    for receiving the secreted product, and a vein for returning the residual
                    blood.</p>
                <p>The hepatic duct unites at an angle with the cystic, and forming the common duct,
                    terminates in the duodenum. The gall bladder, which is a pyriform bag, with <hi
                    rend="italic">doe fundus</hi> below and before, and a neck above and behind,
                    acts as a receptacle for the bile when it is not required in the duodenum. <hi
                    rend="italic">T</hi> ∖∖ <hi rend="italic">e fundus,</hi> placed between the
                    concave surface of the liver above, and the convex one of the pyloric division
                    of the stomach below, may be compressed by that part of the organ when
                    distended, so as to expel the bile from its cavity.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pancreas</hi> is a flat, oblong, glandular body, measuring
                    from five to six inches in length, and weighing from three to five ounces,
                    contained in the posterior epiploic cavity below the duodenum. It consists of
                    lobules similar to those of the salivary glands. It has a proper artery, from
                    which the pancreatic fluid, very similar to the salivary, is secreted, and
                    conveyed into a small duct. The residual blood is conveyed by a proper vein to
                    the portal.</p>
                <p>The spleen <hi rend="italic">(lien)</hi> is an oblong hemispheroidal organ, of a
                    deep blue venous blood colour, varying in weight from 6 to 12 or 15 ounces,
                    placed in the left hypochondre, between the <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi> of the
                    stomach and the left side of the diaphragm, with a plane surface applied to the
                    former, and a convex to the latter part. The spleen is covered by peritoneum,
                    which, doubling before, forms along the middle of the organ a gastro-splenic <hi
                    rend="italic">omentum,</hi> by which it is attached to the stomach. It is
                    generally connected to the colon by a short peritoneal slip.</p>
                <p>The intimate structure of the spleen is peculiar. It consists of a number of
                    minute communicating compartments, separated by <hi rend="italic">septa,</hi>
                    with white granules intermixed. These cells contain dark-coloured blood; and the
                    organ is indeed more abundantly filled with this fluid than any other in the
                    body. These cells appear to be of the nature of erectile vessels. The splenic
                    artery is very large in proportion to the organ, and apparently communicates by
                    minute terminations with veins, in which the blood is occasionally
                    accumulated.</p>
                <p>The principal use of the spleen appears to be, that it serves as a receptacle for
                    a large quantity of blood, which accumulates in the splenic vessels, or flows
                    into those of the stomach, as the latter organ requires. When the stomach is
                    empty, it shrinks; and its blood-vessels, folded on themselves, neither require
                    nor transmit so much of this fluid as they do when the organ is distended. In
                    the latter case the vessels are stretched, their canals are rectified, and the
                    blood flows freely through them. At this period the additional supply seems
                    chiefly to be derived from the spleen. The splenic vessels also appear to
                    contribute chiefly to the secretion of the gastric fluid, which is most abundant
                    at the fundus of the organ.</p>

                    situate behind the aorta, and which, passing through the aortic opening of the
                    diaphragm, proceeds through the chest between the artery and <hi rend="italic"

                    it inclines to the left, and, passing behind the aortic arch and the left

                <p>CHAP. II. THE HEMATROPHIC ORGANS.</p>
                <p>The organs of the hematrophic or circulating function consist of the heart as a
                    central propelling agent, and of arteries and veins as distributing and reducent
                    channels. The hematrophic organs may be distinguished into three orders; <hi
                    rend="italic">first,</hi> those of the general or nutritive circulating system;
                    <hi rend="italic">secondly,</hi> those of the aerating circulating system; and,
                    <hi rend="italic">thirdly,</hi> those of the secreting system. Of these the
                    heart is the central agent; but in the mammalia and man it consists of two
                    divisions, one pertaining to the general arterial, the other to the pulmonary or
                    aerating system.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. THE ORGANS OF NUTRITIVE CIRCULATION.</p>
                <p>§ 1. THE HEART AND HEART-PURSE.</p>
                <p>The heart is a conical muscular organ, containing four communicating chambers,
                    inclosed in a membranous sac, and situate in the anterior middle region of the
                    thorax.</p>
                <p>The inclosing sac, named heart-purse, or capsule of the heart <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pericardium),</hi> consists of two portions or layers, an outer or proper
                    capsular, and an inner or lining division. The outer or proper capsular part of
                    the pericardium possesses the characters of a fibrous membrane, of some density
                    and considerable strength. When washed, its colour is gray or grayish-white, and
                    it appears to consist of minute fibrous threads, arranged without definite
                    order. These fibres are most distinct at its lower margin, where it is connected
                    to the circumference of the tendinous part of the diaphragm. In the young
                    subject it is generally thin and translucent; in adult age or advanced life it
                    is thicker and more opaque. This part of the pericardium is a mere investing
                    membrane, which bounds the region containing the heart, but which extends no
                    further. It embraces the origins of the large vessels above, adheres to the
                    margins of the tendinous centre below, and is on each side connected with the
                    pleura.</p>
                <p>The inner surface of the pericardium has the appearance of a transparent or
                    serous membrane, through which the fibres of tbe outer or capsular part may be
                    seen, and which has the usual glistening aspect of such membranes. It is
                    difficult, however, to insulate it from the outer layer, unless by boiling, when
                    it may be peeled off in minute shreds.</p>
                <p>Like the transparent membranes, this inner layer has neither beginning nor end,
                    neither origin nor termination. After lining the inner surface of the proper
                    capsule, it may be traced from the angle at which this capsule adheres to the
                    large arteries and veins, over the auricles, and finally, over the outer surface
                    of the ventricles to the apex of the heart</p>
                <p>In this course it preserves the characters of a thin transparent membrane, with a
                    free surface, smooth, glistening, and moistened by a watery fluid; and an
                    attached one, adhering on the one hand to the inner surface of the capsule, and
                    on the other to the outer surface of the heart by means of fine filamentous
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>Injection shows that the pericardium consists chiefly of minute arteries and
                    veins. The former are derived from the thymic, phrenic, bronchial, oesophageal,
                    and coronaries of the heart. The substance of the capsular part is probably a
                    modification of the white fibrous system. Nerves have not been traced to any
                    part of this membrane; nor is it ascertained that it contains lymphatics.</p>
                <p>Of a general conical shape, the heart <hi rend="italic">(cor)</hi> is situate
                    obliquely beneath and behind the sternum, with the base <hi rend="italic"
                    >(basis)</hi> above and towards the right, and the tip <hi rend="italic"
                    >(apex)</hi> pointing downwards, forwards, and towards the left. The axis of the
                    cardiac cone lies at once obliquely from right to left and from behind forwards.
                    (Plate XXXI.) The surface may be distinguished into two parts,—the anterior
                    convex, appearing in the space between the right margin of the sternum and the
                    sinuosity of the left lung; the posterior plane, resting chiefly on the oblique
                    surface of the diaphragmatic tendinous centre. These two surfaces are united by
                    a sharp anterior-inferior margin <hi rend="italic">(margo</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >acuta),</hi> and an obtuse posterior-superior one <hi rend="italic">(margo
                    obtusa).</hi> It generally corresponds in size with the fist of the individual;
                    its average weight in the adult is about ten ounces; and its length from the
                    middle of the base to the tip is about five inches.</p>
                <p>The base of the heart is circular, flattened behind, and presents an oblique
                    groove, which indicates the limits between the auricles and the ventricles.</p>

                    valve, by which also it is covered. The inner margin of the pulmonary artery
                    presents three crescentic or semilunar slips, named the sigmoid valves <hi
                    rend="italic">(val-vuloe sigmoideoe),</hi> with their convex surface towards the
                    ventricle, and the concave one towards the artery, and minute bodies at the

                    corresponding to the axis of the artery.</p>
                <p>The interior of the left or posterior auricle presents on the right the two
                    openings of the right pulmonary veins, on the left those of the left pulmonary
                    veins, occasionally uniting in a single aperture, to the right and anteriorly
                    the left surface of the <hi rend="italic">septum,</hi> bounded before by a small
                    semilunar slip, and below the aperture into the left or aortic ventricle.</p>
                <p>The left ventricle has the shape of an obtuse cone, with its base above and
                    behind, and its rounded apex behind and to the left. It is rather larger than
                    the right. The basis has two apertures, a large posterior one, communicating
                    with the auricle <hi rend="italic">(ostium auriculο-ventriculare</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">sinistrum)</hi>; and a smaller anterior, opening into the <hi
                    rend="italic">aorta (ostium</hi><hi rend="italic">aorticum).</hi> To the
                    ventricular margin of the former is attached an irregular membranous slip, not
                    dissimilar to that of the right auriculo-ventricular opening, but always
                    terminating in two apices, to which tendinous chords, connected with tapering
                    muscular bands, arc also attached. This has been denominated the bicuspid or
                    mitral valve <hi rend="italic">(valvula</hi><hi rend="italic">mitralis).</hi>
                    Like the tricuspid, its <hi rend="italic">apices</hi> hang into the ventricle,
                    and are prevented from being re-truded into the auricle by the tendinous chords
                    and papillary muscles.</p>
                <p>The aortic aperture, anterior and smaller, corresponds with the commencement of
                    the aorta. Like the pulmonary aperture of the right auricle, it presents three
                    semilunar valves, with the convex surface to the ventricle and the concave to
                    the artery, and with central granules <hi rend="italic">(corpuscula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Arantii).</hi> These valves are occasionally distinguished into
                    anterior, posterior, and inferior or lateral, according to their relation to the
                    plane of the body. In their aortic side arc generally small hollows, chiefly
                    occasioned by distension of the aorta, named aortic sinuses.</p>
                <p>The heart consists <hi rend="subscript"> Ļ</hi> chiefly of muscular fibres,
                    closely united by filamentous tissue, .covered externally by the reflected or
                    cardiac portion of the pericardium, and internally by a proper membrane.</p>
                <p>Each auricle consists of two parts,—a membranous-muscular, arranged in the
                    stratified mode <hi rend="italic">(fascioe),</hi> distinguished as the <hi
                    rend="italic">sinus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a fasciculo-muscular,
                    distinguished as the tip of the auricle, arranged in short parallel bundles <hi
                    rend="italic">(funes).</hi> The muscular Walls of the left ventricle are more
                    than double the thickness of the right; and while those of the latter collapse
                    on division, those of the former retain their original disposition. The fleshy
                    pillars of the interior of the right are small and slender compared with those
                    of the left, which are thick and strong.</p>
                <p>The arrangement of the muscular fibres of the heart, which has been studied by
                    Senac, Wolff, Duncan, and Gerdy, is peculiar. Though mutually interlacing, like
                    all the muscles of the entrophic order, the external are arranged in layers <hi
                    rend="italic">(strata),</hi> while the internal affect the fasciculated form. At
                    the base they are incurvated round the basilar border, and wind obliquely
                    towards the <hi rend="italic">apex</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but as they
                    approach the latter region, more especially in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >septum,</hi> they observe the longitudinal direction. The assertion of
                    Soemmering, that they are distinguished as being connected without filamentous
                    tissue, is inaccurate.</p>
                <p>The adipose tissue at the surface, and towards the base and apex of the heart,
                    appears to be useful in facilitating motion in an organ in incessant action, and
                    forms a soft cushion for the cardiac arteries.</p>
                <p>The inner membrane of the heart is thin and transparent. In the right auricle and
                    ventricle, where it is continuous on the one hand with the inner venous
                    membrane, on the other with the inner membrane of the pulmonary artery, it is
                    evidently different from that in the left cavities. It is thinner, and more
                    delicate and transparent. Covering every recess, it is doubled to form the
                    different valvular productions. By Bichat it is believed to be identical with
                    the inner venous membrane; but this is mere supposition. In the left cavities
                    the inner membrane is thicker and more opaque than the right; and its valvular
                    duplicatuτcs, which are much thicker, approach to the fibrocartilaginous
                    character. This is particularly the case in the aortic sigmoid valves, which
                    often in the healthy adult are firm and elastic,not unlike the
                    palpebralfibro-cartilages. The supposition of Bichat, that it is identical with
                    the inner arterial membrane, with which it is continuous, is, in regard to the
                    ventricle, not improbable.</p>
                <p>The heart is supplied with blood from the aorta by means of the right anterior or
                    inferior, and the left superior or posterior coronary or cardiac arteries <hi
                    rend="italic">(artcrioe cardiacoe),</hi> both issuing from the aortic sinus
                    immediately above the anterior and lateral sigmoid valves. The right or anterior
                    coronary artery, lodged in the superior furrow, after sending several large
                    branches to the <hi rend="italic">septum</hi> and left ventricle, inosculates at
                    the apex with a large branch of the left or posterior coronary. The latter,
                    which is the largest of the two, after winding round the base of the heart
                    towards the right, is recurvated at the thin margin to the posterior surface,
                    where it runs in the posterior furrow, and is divided into two considerable
                    branches, the larger of which is distributed to the apex; while the smaller,
                    running transversely between the left auricle and ventricle, winds round to the
                    obtuse border, and terminates at the apex, where all the three vessels
                    inosculate freely. The blood is returned by corresponding veins to the coronary,
                    which terminate by one aperture in the right auricle. Its nerves are derived
                    from the pneumogastπc and sympathetic.</p>
                <p>The four chambers of the heart <hi rend="italic">(atria,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >atriola)</hi> are distinguished into pairs,—a right auricle and ventricle
                    communicating mutually and with the pulmonary artery, and a left auricle and
                    ventricle communicating with the aorta. The auricles, separated by the common
                    septum, do not communicate in the natural state; and though in many hearts an
                    oblique opening exists at the anterior margin of the oval depression passing
                    into the left, the crescentic membranous slip by which it is covered prevents
                    the blood of the right auricle from communicating with that of the left. The
                    ventricles are separated also by a thick, fleshy, common partition, through
                    which there is no direct communication, though it was a favourite subject of
                    inquiry before the time of Harvey, to discover communicating apertures.</p>
                <p>The capacity of these chambers varies. The right auricle is always more capacious
                    than the left. The two ventricles are, as near as may be, of equal capacity; and
                    the discordant results obtained on this point by numerous inquirers show merely
                    that any variation is accidental or dependent on the state of the organ during
                    the close of life. The blood found in the right ventricle after death varies
                    from 1∣ ounce to 3 ounces. The capacity of the left, which is generally empty,
                    is estimated by Meckel to vary from 8 to 20 drachms.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040469?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0469-0820"/>
                <p>The blood contained in the right chambers is modena-coloured or venous; that of
                    the left chambers is scarlet-red or arterial. The former is derived from the <hi
                    rend="italic">venae cavae,</hi> which open into the right auricle; the latter
                    from the pulmonary veins, which open into the left. The direction in which the
                    blood flows on both sides is from the venous apertures into the auricles, thence
                    to the ventricles, and thence to the respective arteries. The venous blood, on
                    reaching the auricle, distends it, and impels its muscles to contraction; and
                    the cavity thus diminished expels the blood in the only direction in which it
                    can proceed,—by the aurico-ventricular aperture into the ventricle. This chamber
                    being distended, its muscular walls all round, especially at the base, contract
                    and diminish its cavity, when the blood, extruded, quits the ventricle in the
                    only direction in which it can, viz. by the aperture of the pulmonary artery.
                    The blood from the pulmonary veins follows the same course in the chambers of
                    the left side. The blood of the ventricles is prevented from returning into the
                    auricles partly by the tricuspid and mitral valves, but chiefly by the annιdar
                    contraction of the auriculo-ventricular apertures, which are drawn from the
                    margins towards the <hi rend="italic">septum;</hi> while the latter is
                    shortened, and the <hi rend="italic">apex</hi> is made to approach the base.</p>
                <p>§ 2. THE ARTERIES AND VEINS.</p>
                <p>Connected with each ventricle is a large tube, in which the blood flows from the
                    trunk to the branches. The pulmonary artery, the first of these, divaricates
                    into a right and left branch, subdivided and distributed respectively to the
                    right and left lung.</p>
                <p>The aorta, which is the second, is the large artery which distributes the blood
                    after aeration in the lungs to the system at large.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">aorta,</hi> rising from the left ventricle, after giving
                    off the cardiac arteries, makes an antero-posterior incurvation with the
                    convexity upwards, denominated the arch or curvature <hi rend="italic">(arcus
                    aortce).</hi> (Plate XXXI. A, A.) From the upper side of this arch arise three
                    large vessels, the <hi rend="italic">innominata</hi> or subclavĩo-carotid, the
                    common trunk of the right subclavian and carotid arteries (ι), the left carotid
                    (ι), and the left subclavian. The aortic trunk, after this curvature, proceeds
                    downward on the left margin of the dorsal vertebrae, giving oesophageal,
                    bronchial, and superior intercostal arteries, thymic, pericardial, and inferior
                    intercostal arteries successively. From the level of this arch to the parabolic
                    opening of the diaphragm at the tenth dorsal vertebra, it is distinguished by
                    the name of <hi rend="italic">thoracic aorta</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and
                    below this, to the fourth lumbar vertebra, it is the <hi rend="italic">abdominal
                    aorta.</hi> At its transit through the parabolic aperture it sends off the
                    diaphragmatic arteries.</p>
                <p>The vessels issuing from the abdominal aorta may be distinguished into two
                    orders, those which issue from its sides in pairs, and those which issue from
                    its anterior surface singly only. The former consists of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >capsular,</hi> distributed to the renal capsules; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >renal</hi> or emulgent, to the kidneys; the <hi rend="italic">spermatic,</hi>
                    to the <hi rend="italic">testes;</hi> ’and the <hi rend="italic">lumbar,</hi> to
                    the lumbar muscles, and that region generally. The latter are three in number
                    onlv, the <hi rend="italic">coeliac, superior mesenteric,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior mesenteric.</hi> Opposite the fifth lumbar <hi
                    rend="italic">vertebra,</hi> or the fibro-cartĩlage uniting the fourth and
                    fifth, the aorta terminates by divaricating into two large lateral trunks, the
                    common or primary iliacs <hi rend="italic">(iliacoe communes)</hi>; while from
                    its middle behind proceeds a small <hi rend="italic">azygos</hi> artery,
                    distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">sacro-médian,</hi> along the median line
                    of the <hi rend="italic">sacrum.</hi> In this course the aorta is placed in the

                <p>In general the denominations of these arteries indicate the parts to which they
                    are distributed. In the ultimate ’distribution of the arterial system, however,
                    there is great variety; and it is often impossible to determine the exact
                    origin, course, and distribution of the smaller terminations. The trunks alone
                    are constant in position. In distribution, the following general rules are
                    observed :—tø, The arterial trunks send small lateral branches to the parts
                    between which they run. 2&lt;⅛∕, The majority of individual organs are supplied,
                    not by one proper vessel, but either by one principal artery and two or more
                    subordinate ones, or by several subordinate ones. <hi rend="italic"
                    >2&gt;dly,</hi> A trunk, after giving off several lateral branches, may either
                    terminate in one vessel, which is ultimately distributed to the organs to which
                    it is destined; or it may divaricate into several, none of which may be
                    considerable enough in size, or direct enough in course, to be regarded as the
                    proper terminal vessel. Thus it is often difficult to determine whether the
                    temporal artery or the internal maxillary is the continuation of the external
                    carotid, which of the palmo-digital arteries is the continuation of the radial,
                    whether the anterior or the posterior tibial artery is the continuation of the
                    popliteal, and whether the dorsal of the foot is the termination of the former,
                    <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> In the terminal vessels, where inosculation is
                    frequent, it is impossible to determine whether an artery arises from one trunk
                    or another. Thus in the arterial arches of the hand and foot, in which the
                    digital vessels issue from the convexity of the arch, it is impossible to say
                    whether these arteries arise from the radial or the ulnar in the one case, or
                    the anterior or the posterior tibial in the other.</p>
                <p>The arteries are accompanied by veins, which in general correspond, for the
                    purpose of conveying the residual blood, after distribution, to the right
                    chambers of the heart, to be transmitted by the pulmonary artery to the lungs
                    for renovation. The veins of the head, chest, and superior extremities, open
                    into the <hi rend="italic">superior cava</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> those of
                    the lower part of the trunk, the pelvis and pelvic extremities, terminate in the
                    <hi rend="italic">inferior cava;</hi> the veins of the stomach, intestinal
                    canal, spleen, and pancreas, terminate in the portal vein; and the regredient
                    hepatic veins are united in one vessel, which terminates in the upper end of the
                    <hi rend="italic">inferior cava.</hi></p>
                <p>SECT. II. THE ORGANS OF AERATING CIRCULATION, OR</p>
                <p>RESPIRATION.</p>
                <p>The lungs are two soft, spongy, vascular bodies, contained in the cavity of the
                    chest, one on each side, and imitating in shape the internal figure of that
                    region. Each lung, resembling somewhat a cone, with one side truncated, and the
                    base obliquely cut, is distinguished into a convex external surface,
                    corresponding to the concave internal one of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >thorax</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> a flat inner or mesial surface,
                    corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">mediastinum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    a rounded obtuse <hi rend="italic">apex,</hi> corresponding to that of the <hi
                    rend="italic">demithorax</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and a concave base
                    directed obliquely from the mesial plane to the hypochondres, corresponding to
                    the convex surface of the diaphragm.</p>
                <p>Each lung is distinguished into lobes <hi rend="italic">(lobi)</hi> separated by
                    fissures <hi rend="italic">(incisurae).</hi> The right, which is the largest,
                    consists in general of three lobes, the <hi rend="italic">superior, middle,</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">lower;</hi> the left of two only, an <hi rend="italic"
                    >upper</hi> and <hi rend="italic">lower.</hi> The mesial margin of the left is
                    distinguished from that of the right by a sinuous notch, indicating the
                    situation of the heart <hi rend="italic">(fovea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cardiaca).</hi></p>
                <p>The intimate structure of these bodies, which has been the subject of much
                    research, depends on the nature of the tubes which are distributed to them, and
                    of which chiefly they consist. These are the bronchial or breathtubes <hi
                    rend="italic">(bronchi),</hi> the continuations of the windpipe, and the
                    branches of the pulmonary artery and veins.</p>
                <p>The windpipe <hi rend="italic">(trachea)</hi> is a cylindrical tube, about four
                    or five inches long, extending from the cricoid cartilage, to which it is
                    attached by a fibro-mucous membrane behind the sternum, to the level of the
                    third dorsal <hi rend="italic">vertebra,</hi> or the fibro-cartilage between it
                    and the second. (Plate XXXI. τ.) It consists of from 17 to 18 or 20
                    cartilaginous rings <hi rend="italic">(annuli),</hi> truncated behind, united by
                    a fibrous membrane without, continuous, but particularly firm in the
                    interannular spaces, and along the whole posterior part of the canal. These
                    fibres are white, firm, longitudinal, and closely set. Within is the mucous
                    membrane, continued from the larynx to the <hi rend="italic">bronchi,</hi>
                    resting on filamentous tissue, in which are embedded the mucous follicles. By
                    many, muscular fibres have been represented to exist between the rings;
                    according to Soemmering transversely and longitudinally; and Reisseissen has
                    recently maintained their reality at the posterior part of the tube. Their
                    fibrous disposition is undeniable, but their muscular character may be
                    doubted.</p>
                <p>The windpipe, covered before by the thyroid gland, and corresponding to the
                    sigmoid pit of the sternum, is attached to the oesophagus behind by filamentous
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>Opposite the third dorsal vertebra the <hi rend="italic">trachea</hi> is
                    bifurcated into two tubes named air-tubes <hi rend="italic">(bronchi),</hi>
                    which are directed obliquely to each lung with a mutual intermediate angle of
                    about 35°. The right is about one fourth larger and one fifth longer than the
                    left. Both are cylindrical, but divaricate at their lower end, where they sink
                    into the substance of the lungs, into several smaller tubes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(bronchia),</hi> which again ramify and subdivide into tubes still smaller, and
                    successively. The interbronchial angle is occupied by lymphatic glands, which
                    are also arranged round the tubes.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">bronchi</hi> consist of cartilaginous rings, complete
                    above, but parted into three annular segments between the middle and lower ends,
                    united by whitish fibrous tissue, longitudinal externally, transverse within,
                    and lined by mucous ſolliculated membrane. As they advance into the substance of
                    the lungs, and are still more minutely divided, the cartilages diminish in size
                    and firmness, and their place is supplied by fibrous tissue of transverse
                    circular fibres, which at length also disappear, and mucous membrane alone is
                    left.</p>
                <p>These transverse annular fibres have been supposed by Haller, Soemmering, and
                    recently Reisseissen, to be muscular. It is not improbable that they are so; but
                    no positive proof of this fact has yet been adduced, and they appear rather to
                    belong to the elastic fibrous system.</p>
                <p>The larger bronchial tubes are accompanied each by aň artery derived from the
                    aorta or the subclavian, and following their ramifications into the pulmonic
                    substance. The blood conveyed by these vessels is returned either to the <hi
                    rend="italic">vena azygos</hi> or the superior <hi rend="italic">cava.</hi></p>
                <p>The pulmonic or final divisions of the bronchial tubes terminate in blind sacs
                    covered by mucous membrane, and communicate with each other, forming an
                    appearance of intersecting compartments, which have been distinguished by the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">air-cells (cellulae aereae),</hi> or pulmonic vesicles
                    <hi rend="italic">(vesiculae pulmonis).</hi> They are represented as polygonal
                    and irregular, and about one eighth or one tenth part of a line in diameter.
                    (Haller and Soemmering.) On the whole, these air-cells appear to be merely the
                    terminations of the bronchial tubes mutually communicating, lined by a very
                    delicate mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The pulmonary artery, ramified and subdivided to a great degree of minuteness,
                    communicates most freely with a number of vessels, which may be traced into
                    trunks terminating in the pulmonary veins. This capillary system, enveloped in
                    filamentous tissue, is distributed beneath the mucous membrane of the terminal
                    bronchial tubes or communicating cells. The exterior surface of this filamentous
                    tissue is covered by the <hi rend="italic">pleura.</hi> From <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040495?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0495-0822"/> these facts it
                    results that the lung consists of cartilaginous and fibrous tubes mutually
                    intersecting, and the capillary communications of the pulmonary artery and
                    veins, inve-loped in filamentous tissue, lined on one side by mucous membrane,
                    covered on the other by transparent serous membranes. The air-cells, lined by
                    mucous membrane, have no communication with those of the filamentous tissue, as
                    some have absurdly imagined. Except this filamentous tissue, the lung has no
                    proper substance or <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and its structure is entirely filamento-vascular.</p>
                <p>In the capillary vessels of the pulmonary artery and veins, the venous or modena
                    blood, exposed to the influence of the inspired air through the thin bronchial
                    membrane, parts with its dark, and gradually acquires a bright red tint. This
                    may be styled the aerating or ar-terializing capillary system.</p>
                <p>The lung, however, receives other vessels, the bronchials, by which its mucous
                    aerating membrane and submucous tissue are nourished. Entering with the
                    bronchial tubes between the folds of their <hi rend="italic">pleura,</hi> these
                    vessels are subdivided as they proceed, and at length form a minute network on
                    the attached surface of the bronchial mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The lung derives its nerves from the eighth pair chiefly, and a few filaments
                    from the great sympathetic. The lung is well supplied with lymphatics, both
                    superficial and deep.</p>
                <p>SECT. III. — THE ORGANS OF SECRETORY CIRCULATION, OR SECRETION.</p>
                <p>Of the organs of secretory circulation, several, as the lacrymal gland, the
                    salivary glands, the liver, and pancreas, have been already considered; and
                    others, for example the <hi rend="italic">testes,</hi> will fall under
                    subsequent heads. This, however, is the proper place to notice the organs of the
                    urinary secretion, which consist of two glands, the kidneys, and two excretory
                    ducts, the ureters, terminating in a common receptacle, the bladder.</p>
                <p>The kidneys <hi rend="italic">(renes)</hi> are two glandular bodies situate in
                    the posterior or lumbar part of the abdominal region, one on each side of the
                    lumbar vertebrae, behind the peritoneum, and before the <hi rend="italic"
                    >psoas</hi> muscle and part of the diaphragm, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >quadratus lumborum</hi> behind and laterally, and enveloped in a thick layer of
                    adipose tissue.</p>
                <p>The right kidney is below the liver, above the caecum, behind part of the
                    duodenum, colon, and the right extremity of the pancreas. The left is bounded
                    above by the spleen, by the transverse arch of the colon before, and it has the
                    sigmoid flexure below. The right kidney is about two inches from the outer
                    margin of the <hi rend="italic">vena cava,</hi> and the left at about the same
                    distance from the outer margin of the aorta.</p>
                <p>The situation of the right kidney is generally lower than that of the left, so
                    that part of its lower extremity is in the iliac <hi rend="italic">fossa,</hi>
                    while the lower extremity of the left is quite above the margin of the
                    ilium.</p>
                <p>Resembling in general shape the large French bean, named from it, each kidney may
                    be described as an oblong body, convex externally and at both ends, and with a
                    sinuosity at its inner margin, named the renal fissure <hi rend="italic">(fovea
                    renis),</hi> in which the vessels and excretory duct are contained. Each kidney
                    is between four and five inches long, and two broad; and the weight of each
                    varies from three to four ounces. The anterior surface, corresponding but not
                    attached to the outer surface of the peritoneum, it convex, but becomes hollow
                    at the inner margin, where it terminates in the renal fissure. The posterior
                    surface, which is less convex, is separated from the internal aponeurosis of the
                    transverse abdominal muscle, the diaphragm, and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >psoas</hi><hi rend="italic">magnus,</hi> by a thick layer of adipose
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>The kidney consists of glandular structure, invested by a firm membrane, somewhat
                    fibrous in appearance.</p>
                <p>In the glandular structure the anatomist recognises the I most distinct example
                    of this form of tissue. It consists of two parts, a granular external, and a
                    tubular internat The former, which occupies the exterior of the kidney, is a
                    homogeneous substance, of a yellow fawn colour, and consists of minute spherical
                    or spheroidal granules <hi rend="italic">(granulo),</hi> aggregated together by
                    filamentous tissue, and forming at their exterior calycoid or cup-like cavities,
                    in which the round <hi rend="italic">fundi</hi> of the tubular conoids are
                    lodged. In these the capillary vessels of the kidney are ramified with great
                    minuteness. The tubular part consists of very minute capillary tubes <hi

                    >tubuli</hi><hi rend="italic">Belliηiaηi),</hi> varying in length, united by
                    filamentous tissue, and arranged in parallel juxtaposition, so as to form
                    conoids with globular bases, which are lodged in the cup-like cavities of the
                    granular portion, and rounded <hi rend="italic">apices</hi> directed to the
                    renal fissure. The number of these tubular cones varies from 10 or 12 to 18 or
                    20. Their apices form an equal number of nipple-like processes <hi rend="italic"
                    >(papilloe),</hi> covered by a thin membrane almost transparent, in which are
                    numerous minute holes, apertures of the tubes of which the cones are composed.
                    These apertures, however, are much less numerous than the tubes, several of
                    which are united in one common orifice. The renal <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilloe</hi> thus constituted project into a series of conical cavities,
                    formed within of the papillary membrane, without of fibrous <hi rend="italic"
                    >strata</hi> and filamentous tissue. These cavities, which from their shape are
                    denominated funnels <hi rend="italic">(infundibula,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >calyces),</hi> uniting into three or four larger ones, terminate in a
                    considerable membranous sac named the basin <hi rend="italic">(pelvis)</hi> of
                    the kidney.</p>
                <p>These two parts of the kidney are distinguished not only in structure but in
                    colour and consistence. While the granular part is fawn-coloured, and somewhat
                    soft and flabby, the tubular is pink-red, fleshy and firm; and the boundary line
                    is distinct. The tubular cones are separated from each other by partitions,
                    which appear to be filamentous tissue.</p>
                <p>There is no doubt that the granular is the secreting part of the gland; and the
                    tubes are merely conduits of the urine, which indeed may be expressed from their
                    apertures. It is important, however, to determine the mode in which the two
                    portions communicate. The assertion of Ferrein and Eysenhardt, that the tubes
                    are blind canals, is inaccurate in this respect, that the terminal tubes
                    evidently communicate with others in the interior of the cones, which again are
                    immediately connected with the granular part. It further appears, that in the
                    granular part there are very minute white tortuous canals, which appear to
                    communicate with the straight tubes of the cones. All beyond this is entirely
                    conjectural.</p>
                <p>The kidney, therefore, cannot be said to possess <hi rend="italic"
                    >parenchyma</hi> or proper substance. The idle distinctions into cortical and
                    medullary ought to be rejected as remnants of an exploded theory.</p>
                <p>The kidneys are supplied with blood from the aorta by the renal arteries. Issuing
                    at right angles from the lateral regions of the abdominal aorta, below the
                    superior mesenteries, these vessels pass directly into the fissure at its
                    superior and anterior part, the left behind, the right occasionally before the
                    renal vein, but crossing its direction. The calibre of these vessels is
                    considerable, about three lines at least; and they have been estimated to convey
                    the sixth part of the blood of the abdominal aorta. The left artery is about one
                    inch long, the right is the whole breadth of the vertebral column longer. In the
                    renal fissure each artery divaricates into three or four consider·</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040508?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0508-0823"/>
                <p>able branches, which enter the kidney a little above the attachment of the basin
                    <hi rend="italic">(pelvis).</hi> These vessels are again subdivided into an
                    anterior series before, and a posterior cluster behind the <hi rend="italic"
                    >infundibula,</hi> which they accompany to the <hi rend="italic">papillae.</hi>
                    Dividing more minutely, they form anastomotic arches, from the convexity of
                    which proceed minute vessels, radiating into the granular substance of the
                    gland. These vessels are distributed principally to the granular matter at its
                    calycoid surfaces, in which the tubular cones are lodged.</p>
                <p>The veins are arranged exactly in the same manner, and connected with the renal
                    trunk, much as the arterial branches are connected with it.</p>
                <p>The kidney is supplied with nerves, accompanying the arteries, derived from a
                    plexus inclosing the renal trunk, and which is originally formed from filaments
                    of the solar of the great sympathetic.</p>
                <p>The pelvis consists externally of a prolongation of the renal investment, a
                    proper middle membrane, white, opaque, and fibrous, and an inner lining, which,
                    though thin and semitransparent, presents the character of mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The upper extremity of each kidney is covered by the renal capsule, a substance
                    of no peculiar structure, and the nature of which is unknown.</p>
                <p>The basin forms the common termination of the renal funnels, and the commencement
                    of the ureter. This is a membranous tube, of the diameter of a moderate-sized
                    quill, passing between the renal basin, behind the peritoneum, to the posterior
                    and inferior part of the bladder, in which the lower extremity opens. Each
                    ureter is inclined to the mesial plane below. The right ureter is on the
                    outside, and nearly parallel with the inferior cavity. Both cross the <hi
                    rend="italic">psoas</hi> at an acute angle, and below the common iliac arteries
                    and veins. In the pelvis they cross the <hi rend="italic">vas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">deferens</hi> in the male, and on reaching the bladder pass
                    obliquely, from eight lines to an inch, through its coats, and open in the
                    posterior margin of the lower <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi> of that organ.</p>
                <p>These tubes consist of fibrous membrane, lined by mucous and covered by
                    filamentous tissue. It contains no muscular fibres, notwithstanding the
                    assertions of some.</p>
                <p>The ureters are supplied with blood derived from the renals, occasionally from
                    the lumbars and spermatics, but more especially from the aorta by two ureteric
                    arteries.</p>
                <p>The urinary bladder is a muscular membranous bag, spherical above and
                    cubo-spherical below, placed on the lower region of the pelvis, behind the pubal
                    symphysis, and before the <hi rend="italic">rectum</hi> in the male, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus</hi> in the female. From the peculiarity of its figure and
                    relations, it is distinguished into a superior∕wn&lt;⅛s, spheroidal, directed to
                    the abdominal cavity; an inferior <hi rend="italic">fundus,</hi>
                    cubo-spheroidal, between the ureters and urethral opening; a neck <hi
                    rend="italic">(cervix),</hi> pyriform at the latter point; an anterior surface,
                    corresponding to the posterior of the pubal symphysis; a posterior,
                    corresponding to the rectum in the male and the uterus in the female; and
                    lateral regions, corresponding to the ilio-ischial inner surface, and those of
                    the <hi rend="italic">obturator</hi><hi rend="italic">internus</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">levator am.</hi></p>
                <p>In females generally the transverse extent of the bladder is greater than in the
                    male, and in females after childbearing than in the virgin. In infancy its
                    superior fundus is pointed and conical rather than globular,—a peculiarity
                    derived from its foetal shape, which is pointed, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >urachus,</hi> a ligamentous chord proceeding to the navel, attached.</p>
                <p>The bladder consists of a muscular coat, covered above, behind, and laterally by
                    peritoneum, and lined by mucous membrane.</p>
                <p>The peritoneal covering is continued from the anterior surface of the rectum, and
                    the lateral regions of the pelvis over the posterior and lateral and part of the
                    superior surfaces of the bladder, all of which are free; while the inferior <hi
                    rend="italic">fundus,</hi> the neck, and the anterior, are covered by
                    filamentous tissue, connecting the organ to the neighbouring parts. This
                    filamentous tissue is abundant, especially below.</p>
                <p>The muscular coat, always distinct, varies in thickness in different individuals.
                    In females, so far as we have observed, it is rather thicker than in males. The
                    fibres run in all directions, but are strong at the superior surface, where some
                    anatomists have arbitrarily distinguished them by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >detrusor urinoe.</hi> There are no fleshy pillars, mentioned by some, in the
                    healthy state.</p>
                <p>The neck is surrounded by a thick range of circular fibres, which has been
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">sphincter</hi> of the bladder.</p>
                <p>The mucous membrane, without <hi rend="italic">villi</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >epidermis,</hi> is extended over the whole inner surface of the organ, and is
                    continuous behind with that of the ureters, and before with that of the urethra.
                    The space inclosed between these three orifices is named the vesical triangle
                    <hi rend="italic">(trigorιus vesicoe);</hi> and a minute duplicature of the
                    mucous membrane at the urethral orifice is denominated the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vesicoe uvιda.</hi></p>
                <p>The bladder is supplied with blood chiefly from the posterior iliac or
                    hypogastric trunk, by means of the common pudic, the obturator, the ischiatic,
                    and the hemorrhoidal. Of these, one vesical artery proceeds from the
                    hemorrhoidal; another often comes off directly from the hypogastric as an
                    inferior vesical; and in some instances they issue from the umbilical. The
                    vesical nerves are partly from the sympathetic, partly from the sacral.</p>
                <p>The capacity of the bladder varies in different individuals. In the female it is
                    generally more capacious than in the male. In the healthy state it may contain a
                    pound of urine, without extreme distension; and it is often capable of
                    containing two, three, or four pounds. Its situation varies at different periods
                    of life, and in different degrees of distension. In the foetus and infant, when
                    the pelvis is small, the bladder is contained in the abdomen. In the adult in
                    the ordinary state it is within the limits of the pelvis; but when much
                    distended, its superior <hi rend="italic">fundus,</hi> rising above the <hi
                    rend="italic">pubis,</hi> is in the abdomen. During pregnancy, also, it is
                    thrust forwards and upwards by the gravid womb.</p>
                <p>Urine, the fluid secreted by the kidneys, is particularly distinguished by
                    containing, with various saline substances, <hi rend="italic">urea,</hi> an
                    animal principle containing 46 per cent, of azote. As the saline ingredients
                    also abound in principles containing this element, it may be inferred that the
                    chief purpose of the kidneys is to remove from the system a considerable
                    proportion of nitrogen, which would either be injurious by its presence, or
                    disturb the due proportion of the other elements.</p>
                <p>The urethra, which terminates the urinary apparatus, is nevertheless common to it
                    with the reproductive organs. The male urethra especially is more connected with
                    the reproductive than the secretory organs. In the female, in whom alone this
                    canal is proper to the latter, it is a short muco-membranous tube, terminating
                    in a papillated orifice in the superior anterior wall of the vagina.</p>
                <p>PART III.</p>
                <p>ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS PERTAINING TO THE REPRODUCTIVE FUNCTIONS.</p>
                <p>These organs, by the possession of which the individuals of the human race are
                    distinguished into two sexes, male and female, consist in the former of
                    impregnating, and in the latter of the impregnable organs. The former may be
                    again distinguished into preparing and transmitting <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040521?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0521-0824"/> Organs; and
                    the latter into receiving and ootrophic organs, or those which nourish the
                    product of generation.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I. — THE MALE OR IMPREGNATING ORGANS.</p>
                <p>The male organs consist of two glandular organs, named testicles with excretory
                    ducts, for secreting the impregnating fluid, and an organ for transmitting it to
                    those of the female.</p>
                <p>The testicles <hi rend="italic">(testes')</hi> are two ovoidal bodies contained
                    on each side of tne mesial plane in a cutaneo-cellular sac named the <hi
                    rend="italic">scrotum,</hi> attached to the anterior inferior part of the pubal
                    <hi rend="italic">symphysis.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">scrotum</hi> consists of skin with very thin corion,
                    resting on loose filamentous tissue, which forms on the mesial plane a thick
                    wall, separating the right half of the scrotal bag from the left. On the median
                    line is a superficial groove, named suture <hi rend="italic">(raphe),</hi> at
                    which the corion and filamentous tissue, elsewhere loose, are united into a
                    solid and firm substance. Most of the old anatomists mention a muscular layer
                    known by the name of <hi rend="italic">dartos,</hi> and to which they ascribe
                    the contraction of the scrotum on exposure to cold; but the existence of this
                    muscular layer is not supported by inspection. The scrotal skin is well Supplied
                    with arteries, and especially veins connected with those of the epigastric,
                    external iliac, femoral, obturator, and external pudic, the branches of which
                    anastomose freely. The nerves are from the lumbar, obturator, and crural.</p>
                <p>The scrotal filamentous tissue incloses on each side a thin membranous sac of a
                    pyriform shape, with the base below, and tapering to a neck above. Adherent on
                    the outside to the filamentous substance, this membranous sac is free and smooth
                    within, except at the neck, where it embraces a part distinguished by the name
                    of spermatic chord. This, which is the sheath-like or vaginal coat <hi
                    rend="italic">(tunica vaginalis),</hi> is distinguished into two parts, an
                    inferior pyriform, forming a cavity for the testicle, and a superior
                    cylindrical, covering the spermatic chord, and adhering to it. This membrane is
                    said to be fibrous externally; but it appears to be merely condensed filamentous
                    tissue. Within it is evidently a transparent serous membrane, both in qualities
                    and distribution. It is continued from the adherent part of the chord downward,
                    and over the testicle.</p>
                <p>Within the cavity of the former are contained the testicles, both suspended by
                    the spermatic chord, with the <hi rend="italic">epididymis</hi> behind. Their
                    substance is inclosed in a firm, opaque, white, fibrous investment, covered by a
                    thin transparent membrane, reflected from the vaginal coat. The former is the
                    <hi rend="italic">tunica albuginea,</hi> or proper tissue of the gland; the
                    latter is the vaginal coat of the testicle <hi rend="italic">(tunica vaginalis
                    testis).</hi></p>
                <p>The testicle consists of minute irregular-shaped granules, of a white or
                    gray-white colour, soft, closely compacted, and with numerous capillaries
                    distributed through them. More minutely examined, these are found to be
                    capillary tubes of extraordinary length, folded on themselves, and contorted so
                    as to occupy a small space, and when unfolded extending, according to some
                    anatomists, 16 feet, according to others to 25 or even 100 ells. These long
                    tortuous tubes, which are named the seminiferous <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ductus</hi><hi rend="italic">seminiferi),</hi> are estimated at about 300 in
                    number. They communicate by one extremity with the bloodvessels and lymphatics
                    of the testicle, and by the other, after several unite into one common duct,
                    terminate in about 20 larger tubes, denominated egredient ducts <hi
                    rend="italic">(vasa</hi><hi rend="italic">efferentia),</hi> which, united in a
                    cluster by means of filamentous tissue, and invested by part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tunica</hi><hi rend="italic">albuginea,</hi> form at the upper
                    part of the gland a whitish cylindrical body, about six lines long and two
                    broad, distinguished by the name of the process of Highmore <hi rend="italic"
                    >(corpus Highmori).</hi> These efferent vessels unite and form a single' tube of
                    great length, which, folded on itself by innumerable turns, connected by
                    filamentous tissue, and invested by <hi rend="italic">tunica albuginea,</hi>
                    constitutes the <hi rend="italic">epididymis,</hi> attached by its <hi

                    rend="italic">(vas</hi><hi rend="italic">deferens).</hi></p>
                <p>The latter is a long fibro-cartilagĩnous tube, ascending upwards from the tail of
                    the epididymis, and making part of the spermatic chord, with which it enters the
                    abdomen at the inguinal aperture. At the inner margin of this it separates from
                    the chord, and descends into the pelvis, first by the side, then at the
                    posterior and inferior <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi> of the bladder; and,
                    approaching that of the opposite side with the <hi rend="italic">vesicula
                    seminalis</hi> on the outer margin, each <hi rend="italic">vas</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">deferens</hi> is in contact with the other at the base of the
                    prostate gland. Here each receiving a tube from the corresponding <hi
                    rend="italic">vesicula,</hi> forms a common duct <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ductus</hi><hi rend="italic">ejaculans),</hi> which traverses the prostate,
                    and terminates in the urethra about one inch and a half from its vesical end, on
                    each side of the eminence named <hi rend="italic">veτu-montanum.</hi></p>
                <p>The spermatic chord, by which the testicle is suspended, consists of the
                    spermatic artery or its divisions, derived in general from the <hi rend="italic"
                    >aorta,</hi> two or three spermatic veins, several lymphatics, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">vas</hi><hi rend="italic">deferens,</hi> inclosed in filamentous
                    tissue, and covered by a slip of muscular fibres denominated the suspensory
                    muscle <hi rend="italic">(cremaster, tunica erythroides),</hi> detached partly
                    from the internal oblique and transverse of the belly, fixed partly at the inner
                    surface of the ligament of Poupart and the tuberosity of the pubis.</p>
                <p>The spermatic artery divaricates into several branches, which are distributed,
                    after a few sent to the <hi rend="italic">epididymis,</hi> among the
                    seminiferous ducts. They communicate with numerous tortuous veins, which are
                    collected into a cluster known by the name of <hi rend="italic">the pampiniform
                    body,</hi> situate immediately below the <hi rend="italic">tunica
                    albuginea.</hi></p>
                <p>Below the inferior <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi> of the bladder, on the outside
                    of that organ, are placed two bodies, oblong, flattened, pyriform, with the base
                    behind, composed at first sight of a series of cells separated by <hi
                    rend="italic">septa.</hi> Each of these bodies, which have been named the
                    seminal vesicles <hi rend="italic">(vesiculae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >seminales),</hi> consists of a long tortuous membranous tube, convoluted on
                    itself, and with the folds aggregated by bridles of filamentous tissue, which
                    convert it into communicating sacs. The cavity of this canal, which communicates
                    with the urethra by a tube, common to the vesicles and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vasa deferentia,</hi> has been supposed to serve as a reservoir for the seminal
                    fluid after secretion by the testicles; but this supposition is by no means
                    verified, and is open to several objections.</p>
                <p>The transmitting organs consist of the <hi rend="italic">penis</hi> with the
                    urethra and prostate gland.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">penis,</hi> the shape of which is well known, consists, of
                    two parts, the cavernous body <hi rend="italic">(corpus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cavernosum),</hi> and the spongy body <hi rend="italic">(corpus
                    spongiosum)</hi> containing the urethra. The cavernous body, single before,
                    bifurcated behind, may be described as two cylindrical bodies, inclosed in a
                    fibrous investment, which, uniting them on the mesial plane, forms a partition
                    <hi rend="italic">(septum medium),</hi> perforated nevertheless with orifices
                    for vessels. The divaricating posterior extremities <hi rend="italic"
                    >(crura)</hi> are firmly attached to the ιschio-pubal <hi rend="italic"
                    >rami</hi> on each side. The intermediate triangular interval is occupied by the
                    perineal filamentous tissue, fat, the perineal muscles, and the spongy body in
                    the middle. Above and before, both are connected to the pubal symphysis by a
                    triangular, flat, fibrous substance, named the <hi rend="italic">triangular</hi>
                    or <hi rend="italic">suspensory ligament.</hi></p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193040534?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0534-0825"/>
                <p>The spongy body is a cylindrical cellulo-vascular tube, inclosing the urethra,
                    and occupying the middle depression, along the lower surface of the cavernous
                    body, from ’its anterior extremity, where it constitutes the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glans,</hi> to the angular bifurcation of the cavernous body, where it is
                    expanded into a substance denominated the <hi rend="italic">bulb</hi> of the
                    urethra. The spongy body is invested on the side and below by integuments
                    only.</p>
                <p>Both these parts, but especially the cavernous body, consist of numerous minute
                    arteries, communicating directly with elongated and dilatable veins, and
                    constitute the best example of erectile arrangement in the body. The injection
                    of these vessels constitutes the erection of the penis, and induces the
                    contraction of the urethra necessary to expel the seminal fluid. The two
                    extremities of the spongy body, the <hi rend="italic">glans</hi> before and the
                    bulb behind, form the limits of the erectile tissue round the urethra. The
                    anterior extremity is covered by loose skin, which forms the foreskin <hi
                    rend="italic">(prceputium),</hi> and, in the shape of a thin semimucous corion,
                    provided with epidermis, is continued over the glans, from which it passes
                    insensibly into the mucous membrane of the urethra.</p>
                <p>With the penis several muscular organs are connected. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >ischio-cavernosus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">transversus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >perinoei</hi> on each side connect the cavernous body to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ischium;</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">bulbο-cavemοsus</hi> connects it to the
                    bulb of the <hi rend="italic">urethra.</hi> Mr Houston of Dublin has lately
                    discovered a packet of muscular fibres situate between the pubal arch and the
                    penis on each side, which, by compressing the dorsal vein, may, he imagines,
                    contribute to erect the organ.</p>
                <p>The cavernous and spongy bodies are supplied with blood from the terminal end of
                    the internal pudic artery, by means of two vessels, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cavernous</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">dσrsal.</hi> The bulb receives
                    branches from the transverse perineal artery.</p>
                <p>The prostate gland is a body cordiform or flat conoidal in shape, with the base
                    behind and the apex before, corresponding to the vesical end of the urethra,
                    situate behind the pubal symphysis before, and below the neck of the bladder, in
                    the angle between it and the <hi rend="italic">rectum,</hi> and between the <hi
                    rend="italic">levator ani</hi> of each side.</p>
                <p>It is distinguished into three lobes,—two lateral, united on the mesial
                    plane,—and a small cellulo-vascular slip in the angle between them, towards the
                    base. In structure it is composed chiefly of minute arteries and veins ramified
                    in a firm, fleshy, filamentous tissue, amidst which are placed follicles with
                    minute ducts, which terminate in larger tubes, varying in number from seven to
                    twelve, the apertures of which are on the sides and the surface of the urethra.
                    These follicles secrete a viscid liquor, the use of which is unknown. From the
                    fact, however, that, when the prostate gland is diseased or injured, the sexual
                    appetite is languid or extinguished, it may be inferred that the prostate is
                    essential to the generative functions in the male. It is analogous to the <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus</hi> in the female.</p>
                <p>With the prostate may be mentioned the accessory glands of Cowper, two small
                    bodies, oblong-round, placed on each side of the urethra, before the prostate.
                    They appear to be mucous follicles on the large scale.</p>
                <p>The urethra is a membranous canal, extending from the neck of the bladder in the
                    pelvis to the extremity of the glans, where it terminates on the surface by an
                    aperture <hi rend="italic">(orificium</hi><hi rend="italic">ureťhroe),</hi>
                    consisting of two lateral segments. Its length and width vary in the erect and
                    unerected state of the penis. In the latter it is about seven or eight inches
                    long, and its calibre is about three lines, but admitting of distension beyond
                    this. According to the parts with which it is connected, it is distinguished
                    into four different portions; 1sZ, the <hi rend="italic">prostatic,</hi> about
                    one inch; <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">membranous,</hi> from
                    one to one inch and a half; 3&lt;7, the <hi rend="italic">bulbous,</hi> scarcely
                    one inch; and, <hi rend="italic">⅛th,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">spongy</hi>
                    portion, occupying the anterior part of the canal, inclosed by the spongy
                    body.</p>
                <p>The surface of the urethra is a mucous membrane supplied with follicles, and
                    moulded into blind sacs named <hi rend="italic">laxunae,</hi> which appear to
                    contain mucous ducts. Its capacity varies in different parts. Wide at the middle
                    of the prostate, it is contracted in the membranous part, which is indeed the
                    narrowest of the canal; it enlarges again in the bulb; and from this it
                    preserves the same diameter to immediately behind the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glans,</hi> where it forms a dilatation distinguished by the name of the
                    navicular <hi rend="italic">(fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">navicularis).</hi> The
                    apertures in this canal have been already mentioned to be, besides that of the
                    bladder, one ejaculatory on each side of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >veru-montanum,</hi> from seven to ten excretory apertures from the prostatic
                    ducts, and one aperture from each accessory gland. The mucous membrane of the
                    membranous and spongy portions presents longitudinal folds, which appear to be
                    connected with the occasional distensions of the tube for the expulsion of the
                    urine.</p>
                <p>The urethra, straight in direction on the mesial plane, is incurvated within the
                    pelvis from behind forwards, so that its concave incurvation incloses the pubal
                    arch, while its convexity is turned to the perinaenm. The pendulous state of the
                    <hi rend="italic">penis,</hi> when nncrected, causes it to acquire another
                    incurvation without the pelvis, with the convexity directed upward. These
                    curvatures are considerably exaggerated in engravings. The first round the arch
                    of the pubis is much less angular than it is delineated.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II. THE FEMALE OR OOTROPIIIC ORGANS.</p>
                <p>The female generative organs consist of the ovaries, the uterine or Fallopian
                    tubes, the womb, and the vagina. These organs are contained in the pelvis.</p>
                <p>From the time of Steno, anatomists have given the name of ovaries or eggbeds <hi
                    rend="italic">(ovaria)</hi> to two ovoidal bodies, about the size of a pigeon’s
                    egg, placed one on each side of the womb in the pelvis, in a duplicature of
                    peritoneum termed the broad ligament <hi rend="italic">(ligamentum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">latum)</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">uterus.</hi> Convex and free
                    on their anterior and posterior surfaces, and tapering towards each extremity,
                    their lower margin is straight or slightly concave, with a vascular sinuosity.
                    The external extremity is contiguous to a round solid chord <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ligamentum</hi><hi rend="italic">teres),</hi> forming the anterior margin of
                    the broad ligament, and proceeding from the womb to the internal orifice of the
                    inguinal canal and the pubal extremity of the ligament of Poupart, and by which
                    the uterus is retained in the pelvis. Each ovary weighs about one drachm and a
                    half.</p>
                <p>Covered externally by peritoneum, stretched over a&lt; fibrous membrane of some
                    firmness, the ovaries consist of <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> a pulpy
                    brownish-gray substance, very vascular, in which l are embedded minute bodies of
                    vesicular appearance and oval shape, varying in number from 15 to 20. These
                    bodies, which, from the time of De Graaf at least, have been regarded as ova or
                    embryal atoms or germs <hi rend="italic">(ova Graafi-ana, ovarii
                    vçsiculae),</hi> consist of a thin membrane containing a viscid, reddish, or
                    yellow fluid.</p>
                <p>The ovary is supplied with blood from arteries analogous to the spermatic of the
                    male.</p>
                <p>Previous to puberty the ovaries are smooth in surface and entire. After this
                    period, both in females who have had children, and even in virgins, they are
                    marked on the surface by minute depressions, which have been denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">cicatrices,</hi> and which are believed to be the consequence of
                    minute breaches of the ovarian tunics, occasioned by the escape of the vesicles
                    from the surface of the ovary. There is no proof that these cicatrices are the
                    invariable result of sexual intercourse. Small before puberty, at that period
                    they acquire considerable size, and <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040547?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0547-0826"/> retain them
                    till the age of 45 or 48, after which they shrivel and shrink to a very small
                    size.</p>
                <p>The Fallopian or uterine tubes are the excretory ducts of the ovaries. They are
                    cylindrical tubes about four or five inches long, contained in the anterior fold
                    of the superior margin of the broad ligament, between the round ligament and the
                    ovary, and connected by their lower extremity with the superior angles of the
                    womb. Their superior extremity, which is loose, is surrounded by a fringed or
                    laciniated slip of peritoneum, in the centre of which is seen the upper or
                    peritoneal aperture <hi rend="italic">(orificium superius),</hi> larger than the
                    calibre of the canal, which admits a hog’s bristle, but contracts at the lower
                    or uterine extremity <hi rend="italic">(orificium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >uterinum),</hi> which is situate in the upper angle of the inner surface of the
                    womb.</p>
                <p>Covered by serous membrane externally, lined by thin mucous membrane with
                    follicular glands, the Fallopian tubes consist of fibrous tissue interposed
                    between these two. Below, however, at their junction with the womb, they seem to
                    partake of the structure of that body.</p>
                <p>The womb <hi rend="italic">(uterus, matrix)</hi> is a hollow organ with thick
                    walls, shaped like a conoid, flattened before and behind, situate on the mesial
                    plane in the pelvic cavity, between the bladder before and the rectum behind.
                    Small before puberty, at that period it is about 2į-inches long, l-ļ-broad at
                    its widest part, and weighs from 7 drachms to 1⅜ ounce. It is distinguished into
                    thej‰rc&lt;⅛s, body <hi rend="italic">(corpus),</hi> and neck <hi rend="italic"
                    >(cervix)</hi>; the first free, directed upwards; the second also free, between
                    the bladder and rectum; and the third connected within and below to the <hi
                    rend="italic">vagina.</hi> At each side of the <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi> is
                    a corner or angular part, which communicates with the uterine extremity of the
                    Fallopian tube. The neck of the womb may be distinguished into the external or
                    peritoneal, and the internal or mucous neck, which terminates in an elliptical
                    opening, with rounded, thick, firm margins, not unlike the mouth of the tench,
                    and named therefore <hi rend="italic">os tincoe,</hi> as well as <hi

                <p>The cavity of the womb is small compared with the volume of the organ, in
                    consequence of the thickness of its containing walls. It is triangular in shape,
                    with the base at the <hi rend="italic">fundus,</hi> and the apex at the neck.
                    The superior angles are small recesses, in which the uterine extremity of the
                    Fallopian tube of each side opens. The cavity is much contracted at the neck,
                    forming a short cylindrical canal, the lower aperture of which is the <hi

                <p>Covered externally by peritoneum, the womb consists of a peculiar thick, firm,
                    whitish substance, lined by mucous membrane. This intermediate matter, though
                    neither red nor distinctly fibrous, has been very generally regarded as
                    muscular. Its contractile powers during parturition it is impossible to doubt.
                    But while it is difficult to reconcile this phenomenon with the absence of
                    muscular tissue, it must be allowed that it is much more easy to maintain than
                    demonstrate the unequivocal appearance of muscular fibres. On this topic the
                    reader may consult a paper by Mr Charles Bell, in the 4th volume of the <hi

                    >Transactions</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and an elaborate account of the
                    different ranges of muscular fibres in the uterus, by Madame Boivin, an eminent
                    Parisian <hi rend="italic">accoucheuse,</hi> in her <hi rend="italic">Memorial
                    de (Art des Accouchemens,</hi> Paris, 1824.</p>
                <p>The uterine mucous membrane is thin, but reddish-gray, villous, and marked by
                    numerous pores, the apertures of blood-vessels, most probably those which
                    secrete the menstrual fluid. At the neck it is provided with muciparous glands,
                    which are the seat of several of the forms of leucorrhoea.</p>
                <p>The blood-vessels of the uterus are derived partly from the spermatic, partly
                    from the hypogastric. The former, after passing between the folds of the broad
                    ligaments, and giving branches to the tubes, enter the uterine substance by its
                    lateral regions. The second, named the <hi rend="italic">uterine,</hi> after
                    sending branches to the vagina and neighbouring parts, ascend along the margins
                    of the organ, and are distributed to itsjfimćføs.</p>
                <p>The uterine veins correspond to the arteries in course and connections. In the
                    walls of the organ they form large sinuses, very distinct after parturition.</p>
                <p>The uterine lymphatics are connected with those of the pelvis and hypogastric
                    region. The nerves, which are numerous, proceed from the lower extremity of the
                    great sympathetic, from the renal plexus, the spermatics, the last lumbar
                    nerves, and the sacral.</p>
                <p>The womb is the proper ootrophic organ, to the inner surface of which the <hi
                    rend="italic">ovum</hi> is attached by a vascular body denominated the <hi
                    rend="italic">placenta</hi> or after-birth.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> is a membranous vascular tube, situate on the
                    mesial plane, behind the pubal arch, and before the <hi rend="italic"
                    >rectum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">urethra,</hi> and extending from the neck of
                    the womb in the pelvic cavity to the external outlet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vulva),</hi> where it is continuous with the surface. Not exactly cylindrical,
                    but flattened before and behind, its length is about four inches, its breadth
                    one, but very distensible. It is generally distinguished into the upper vaginal
                    recess <hi rend="italic">(vaginae fundus),</hi> inclosing the neck of the womb
                    behind the <hi rend="italic">os tincoe,</hi> the lower vagina <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vagina propria),</hi> and the vaginal opening <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vulva).</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> consists of mucous membrane surrounded by
                    filamentous tissue, a vascular network, and some muscular fibres. The mucous
                    membrane, which is red below, gray above, and not unfrequently marbled, soft and
                    spongy, is disposed in numerous large transverse and semicircular folds <hi
                    rend="italic">(rugoe)</hi> on the anterior and posterior surfaces. In the
                    recesses of these folds are numerous pores, evidently the source of the mucous
                    viscid secretion which is so abundant on this membrane, during sexual
                    excitation, at the period of parturition, and morbidly in gonorrhoea in the
                    female. On the lateral regions it presents pyramidal eminences <hi rend="italic"
                    >(papillae).</hi></p>
                <p>The mucous membrane is connected by filamentous tissue to another, which in the
                    vicinity of the uterus is compact, firm, and elastic, and below, towards the
                    orifice, is thinner, and contains a network of numerous communicating vessels,
                    in which the blood is occasionally accumulated in the manner of erection. The
                    lower extremity is inclosed laterally by some muscular fibres <hi rend="italic"
                    >(constrictor'vulvoe),</hi> which are believed to have the effect of contracting
                    the <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> voluntarily, and by which, when continued, as
                    they occasionally are, to the base of the <hi rend="italic">lαbiα</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">magna,</hi> women, according to Soemmering, may move these parts.
                    The vaginal membrane is provided with lymphatics connected with those of the
                    pelvis. The nerves, which are numerous, and some of which appear to terminate in
                    the pyramidal eminences, are derived partly from the sacral, partly from the
                    crural trunks.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">vagina</hi> terminates in the <hi rend="italic">vulva,</hi>
                    an opening formed within by the <hi rend="italic">clitoris</hi> before, the <hi
                    rend="italic">hymen</hi> behind, and the <hi rend="italic">nymphoe</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">labia parva</hi> on each side; externally by the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mons veneris</hi> before, the <hi rend="italic">frenum</hi> and navicular <hi
                    rend="italic">fossa</hi> behind, and the <hi rend="italic">labia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">magna</hi> on each side.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">clitoris</hi> is a small, oblong, conical process,
                    consisting of erectile vessels, covered by mucous membrane, attached to the
                    lower margin of the pubal symphysis. The <hi rend="italic">hymen</hi> is a
                    crescentic fold of mucous membrane, surrounding the sides and posterior part of
                    the vagina. The small lips or <hi rend="italic">nymphoe (labia parva)</hi> are
                    two crescentic bodies, consisting chiefly of erectile vessels, contained within
                    a duplicature of semimucous membrane. With these the inner surface of the <hi
                    rend="italic">labia</hi> is continuous; and they consist <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040560?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0560-0827"/> chiefly of
                    filamentous tissue, placed between semimucous membrane and skin.</p>
                <p>Connected with the female ootrophic organs are the ’breasts or <hi rend="italic"
                    >mammae.</hi></p>
                <p>The female of the human species has only two breasts; and their position on the
                    anterior and superior part of the <hi rend="italic">thorax,</hi> on each side of
                    the mesial plane, is a character which, with those of the locomotive apparatus,
                    indicates distinctly the erect biped attitude.</p>
                <p>Of a hemispherical or conical shape, the female breast consists of a glandular
                    organ, named the <hi rend="italic">mammary,</hi> surrounded by adipose tissue,
                    and covered by integuments. It is distinguished into the breast <hi
                    rend="italic">(mamma),</hi> the nipple <hi rend="italic">(papilla,
                    mammilla),</hi> and a coloured ring of skin <hi rend="italic">(areola).</hi></p>
                <p>The gland is of a flat, rounded figure, and consists of lobes of white pulpy
                    substance, separated from each other by filamentous tissue, and which may be
                    resolved into granules or <hi rend="italic">acini</hi> about the size of millet
                    seeds, which again arc composed of minute oblong vesicles disposed in a
                    radiating manner. From the granules or <hi rend="italic">acini</hi> proceed
                    minute tubes named the lactiferous <hi rend="italic">(ductus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">lactiferi, tubuli</hi><hi rend="italic">galactophori),</hi> which
                    uniting into larger tubes, varying in number from 20 to 30, terminate in the
                    centre of the mammary gland, behind the areola in conical dilated sacs <hi
                    rend="italic">(sinus),</hi> varying from one or two to three lines in diameter.
                    These galactophorous ducts, which are larger than in any other gland, are formed
                    of mucous membrane, which extends into the sinuosities, and is at the nipple
                    identified with the skin. Several of the lactiferous tubes arc said to originate
                    from the adipose tissue of the breast; but this seems merely to indicate that
                    they communicate with the vessels of this substance. The lactiferous tubes arc
                    indistinct before puberty, small in the virgin, and in general in the sterile,
                    and during the intervals of pregnancy, and large only at the close of that
                    period, and during the process of suckling.</p>
                <p>The nipple of the female breast is a flat, conical process, the shape of which is
                    well known, consisting externally of skin, with thin delicate corion and
                    epidermis, internally of mucous membrane, and an intermediate network of
                    dilatable arteries and veins mutually and freely communicating. These parts are
                    united by filamentous tissue, which varies in quantity at different periods. But
                    from the vessels now mentioned the nipple derives its property of occasional
                    erection, especially under the influence of mental emotions.</p>
                <p>The breast derives its blood from the internal mammaries, the intercostals, and
                    the thoracics or external mammaries, ’the branches of which penetrate between
                    the lobules of the gland. It has lymphatics, though not more abundantly than any
                    other organ. The nerves are chiefly cutaneous.</p>
                <p>The mammary gland is separated from the pectoral muscle by a thick cushion of
                    adipose substance, on which it rests; and it derives a gentle conical elevation
                    from the subcutaneous adipose tissue. The mammary skin is remarkable for the
                    delicacy and softness of the corion.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III. THE PRODUCT OF GENERATION.</p>
                <p>The ovum or impregnated germ, the result of the union of the sexes, consists of
                    an embryo or new animal, inclosed in several membranes, and attached to the
                    inner surface of the uterus by a vascular mass.</p>
                <p>Of the membranes, one, the <hi rend="italic">decidua (epichorion),</hi> belongs
                    to the uterine surface; the other two, the <hi rend="italic">chorion</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">amnion,</hi> belong to the foetus or embryo. The <hi
                    rend="italic">decidua</hi> consists of two parts, an external <hi rend="italic"
                    >(decidua vera),</hi> and an internal <hi rend="italic">(decidua τefleχa)</hi>;
                    both modifications of albuminous secretion. The chorion, the outer covering of
                    the foetus, is a thin transparent membrane, covered with villosi ties on both
                    surfaces, but especially the external. The amnion is a thin transparent
                    membrane, adhering feebly by its external surface to the inner of the chorion,
                    and inclosing a watery fluid, variable in quantity, in which the foetus,
                    suspended by the umbilical chord, floats.</p>
                <p>The umbilical chord <hi rend="italic">(funis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >umbilicalis)</hi> consists of, <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> one vein and two
                    arteries, inclosed in— <hi rend="smallcaps">2íZ,</hi> a soft, semifluid,
                    gelatinous substance, named from Wharton <hi rend="italic">gelatiηa
                    Whar-toniana; 3d,</hi> the urachus, a ligamentous chord proceeding to the
                    superior <hi rend="italic">fundus</hi> of the bladder; and, <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛th,</hi> the umbilical sheath <hi rend="italic">(vagina</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >umbilicalis).</hi> In the early period of uterine life, it also contains part
                    of the intestinal canal, the <hi rend="italic">vesicula umbilicalis</hi> either
                    partly or wholly, and the omphalo-mesenteric vessels. Of these parts the
                    umbilical veins and arteries, by their connection with the placenta, are the
                    most important. The others our limits allow us merely to indicate.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">placenta</hi> is a round or orbicular, thick, cake-shaped
                    mass, with two surfaces, a filamento-vascular, attached to the inner surface of
                    the womb, and a smooth membranous one, to which the umbilical chord is fixed. It
                    consists of lobular portions <hi rend="italic">(cotyledones),</hi> separable
                    from each other, and each of which receives a small artery derived from the
                    uterine trunks, which are much enlarged during pregnancy. The average weight of
                    the <hi rend="italic">placenta</hi> is 1 pound 2 ounces.</p>
                <p>The placenta, according to Dr Hunter <hi rend="italic">(Anatomical Description of
                    the Human Gravid Uterus,</hi> edit, by Dr Baillie, Lond. 1794), consists of two
                    portions; a <hi rend="italic">foetal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">umbilical,</hi>
                    and a <hi rend="italic">maternal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">uterine
                    part.</hi></p>
                <p>The foetal part is composed entirely of ramifications of the umbilical arteries
                    and umbilical vein. These, dividing with extreme minuteness, are distributed to
                    all parts of the placenta. The branches of the umbilical arteries finally
                    terminate in the umbilical vein, and have no other termination: all the branches
                    of the umbilical vein arise from the umbilical arteries, and have no other
                    commencement.</p>
                <p>The maternal part consists of a whitish-coloured substance, which is spread over
                    the outer surface of the placenta in the form of a membrane, and sends off
                    innumerable irregular processes, which pervade its substance as deep as its
                    inner surface. These are everywhere so blended and entangled with the
                    ramifications of the umbilical system, that it is impossible to discover the
                    nature of their union. They are interwoven in such a manner, however, as to
                    leave innumerable small vacuities or cells between them, which communicate
                    freely with each other through the whole mass. The maternal part is full of
                    large and small arteries and veins, none of which arc derived from the vessels
                    of the foetal part, but all from the arteries and veins of the uterus. All the
                    arteries are serpentine, and much convoluted; the larger, when injected, arc
                    almost of the size of crow-quills; and, after little or no ramification, they
                    terminate abruptly in the cells already described. This is their only
                    termination. The veins have frequent anastomoses, pass in a very slanting
                    direction, and generally appear flattened; some of them are as large as a
                    goose-quill, but many of them very small; and all arise abruptly from the cells
                    of the placenta. This is their only commencement.</p>
                <p>The umbilical arteries, which are branches of the hypogastric, ascend beside the
                    bladder and before the rectum, approach each other, pass over the <hi
                    rend="italic">fundus</hi> of the bladder, and reach the navel with the <hi
                    rend="italic">urachus.</hi> There they alter their direction, and are wound
                    round the umbilical vein, which proceeds from the placenta by the same aperture
                    (the navel) by which the arteries escape. These arteries, which are almost equal
                    in diameter to the hypogastric or posterior iliac, of which they appear to be
                    the continuation, diminish in size after birth, and appear then to be mere
                    branches. Eventually they are obliterated and converted into solid chords, about
                    1⅜ inch from their origin.</p>
                <p>The umbilical vein, which is larger than both arteries taken together, is the
                    common trunk of the veins of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193040573?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-0573-0828"/> placenta, from
                    which it proceeds through the umbilical opening or navel, in the folds of the
                    falciform ligament, to the umbilical fossa of the liver, where it divides into
                    two branches, one large, proceeding to the <hi rend="italic">vena portae</hi>
                    and liver, another small, into the <hi rend="italic">vena cava,</hi> known by
                    the name of venous duct or canal <hi rend="italic">(ductus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >venosus).</hi> The umbilical vein is distributed chiefly to the left lobe of
                    the liver.</p>
                <p>The structure of the foetus differs in many respects from that of the adult; and
                    these differences depend on the stage which the process of developement has
                    attained. As it is impossible to trace the history of this interesting process
                    within the limits of this sketch, we shall merely specify the principal
                    anatomical peculiarities by which the foetus is distinguished from the
                    full-grown subject.</p>
                <p>A large vascular body, denominated the thymus gland, is found to occupy the
                    anterior <hi rend="italic">mediastinum.</hi> The kidneys are covered by
                    triangular filamento-vascular bodies, named <hi rend="italic">renal
                    capsules,</hi> larger than the glands themselves, and supplied with large
                    blood-vessels. The liver is very large, especially its left lobe, and occupies
                    not only the right hypochondriac and epigastric, but the left hypochondriac
                    region. The lungs are compact and of a deep red colour, and sink in water; and
                    the bronchial tubes are collapsed and void of air. In the heart the right and
                    left auricle communicate freely by an oval aperture in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >septum.</hi> The pulmonary artery, rising from the right ventricle, divides,
                    not into two, as in the adult, but into three branches; one on each side, going
                    to each lung, small, and conveying little blood; and one in the middle,
                    proceeding to the aorta, about 9 lines long, named the arterial canal <hi
                    rend="italic">(ductus</hi><hi rend="italic">vel canalis</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >arteriosus).</hi> The umbilical vein, proceeding to the liver, is distributed
                    by about 15 or 20 branches to the left lobe of that organ. In the horizontal
                    furrow it divides into two branches, one of which goes to the portal vein, the
                    other, apparently the continuation of the trunk, opens into the <hi
                    rend="italic">vena cava,</hi> under the name of venous duct <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ductus vel</hi><hi rend="italic">canalis venosus),</hi> forming with it an
                    angle acute above, and provided with a valve. The kidneys consist of lobules as
                    numerous as their tubular cones, which indeed these lobules are, separate from
                    each other. The urinary bladder is not within the pelvis, but in the abdominal
                    part of that cavity; and it terminates above in a point, to which a ligamentous
                    process <hi rend="italic">(urachus),</hi> connecting it to the navel, is
                    attached. In the male, the testicles are contained in the abdomen, often
                    immediately behind the internal aperture. Lastly, till the seventh month the
                    pupillary aperture is closed by a peculiar membrane.</p>
                <p>In the foregoing account of the anatomy of the human body, many points have been
                    treated in a manner too short and cursory, considering their importance; and in
                    the attempt to restrain it within due limits, the heads of several have been
                    only indicated. For those who wish to study the subject more minutely, besides
                    the works occasionally mentioned, we refer to the following general systems.</p>

                    accurate descriptive system yet extant; and the strongest proof of its
                    superiority is, that its descriptive portion has been very closely copied in the

                <p>RED-BLOODED ANIMALS only can be said to possess that assemblage of bones
                    denominated skeleton; and as in these the most constant part is the vertebral
                    column, it furnishes the general character of Vertebrated. The shells of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mollusca</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Crustacea</hi> have
                    been generally regarded as a species of internal skeleton; and in the
                    circumstance of affording mechanical support and external protection, they
                    indeed resemble the skeleton of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata.</hi> But
                    neither in mode of developement nor in chemical constitution can they be
                    regarded as of the same nature. Hence it is only in the vertebrated classes that
                    it is requisite to study the peculiarities of the skeleton.</p>
                <p>In general characters the bones of the Mammalia resemble those of the human
                    subject. Like them, they are white, firm, elastic, and incompressible. They
                    consist also of compact and reticular or cancellated tissue. In the lower
                    animals the latter kind of structure is in general coarser and looser than in
                    man; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> especially the cavities are
                    large. In the carnivorous animals the compact structure is exceedingly dense,
                    and gives the bone much greater weight than in other animals. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> also the acoustic or lithoid portion of the
                    temporal bone is of a marble hardness.</p>
                <p>The bones of the Mammalia may, like those of man, be distinguished, according to
                    their mechanical form, into long, flat, and short bones. Though the first class
                    in general possess a medullary canal, this cavity is imperfect or wholly wanting
                    in the bones of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Amphibia.</hi></p>
                <p>The cavities denominated <hi rend="italic">sinuses</hi> are much more completely
                    developed in several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> than in the human
                    skeleton. In the pig these cavities extend into the occipital bone; in the
                    elephant they not only give the frontal bone extraordinary protuberance, but
                    they extend into the parietal, temporal, and even the occipital bones, and
                    contribute much to augment the volume of the head. In the ox, deer, and sheep,
                    they communicate with the cavity of the horns.</p>
                <p>The bones of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> are in general whiter, firmer, and
                    smoother than those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>; and they consist
                    of a firm, compact substance, which is elastic and hard in the bones of the
                    trunk, and extremely brittle in those of the extremities. With the exception
                    also of some of the thin, flat bones, as the sternum, they consist of thin,
                    compact walls, inclosing large capacious cavities, which contain not marrow, but
                    air, and which communicate by one or more minute holes with the windpipe and
                    lungs. While these cavities, which may be regarded as the most perfect and
                    advanced form of sinuses, diminish considerably the weight of the whole
                    skeleton, by the density and completely cylindrical shape, they rather augment
                    the strength. In the chick, and at birth, the bones are homogeneous and without
                    cavities; afterwards they contain marrow; and eventually this disappears and
                    gives place to air.</p>
                <p>The bones of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> are not remarkable in any
                    respect, unless in being void in general of medullary cavity. The absence of
                    this canal was originally observed by Caldesi, and afterwards by Cuvier, in the
                    tortoise; by Troja in the bones of the frog and toad; and by Carus in those of
                    the turtle. In the crocodile, however, and in several of the lizard family, they
                    are large and distinct. The bones of Reptiles also are less firm than those of
                    Birds and Mammals.</p>
                <p>The bones of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> are remarkable for great softness,
                    flexibility, and elasticity. Those of the lamprey, shark, ray or skate, and
                    sturgeon family, are soft, flexible, sectile, of a bluish white colour,
                    translucent, and so elastic that a cutting instrument forced into them is
                    speedily re-truded by the resilient nature of the bony matter. From these
                    characters, the bones of these families have been regarded as cartilaginous, and
                    the fishes themselves have been distinguished by this character. <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Pisces</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">cartilaginei, pisces</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">cπondropterygπ.)</hi> In the other fishes, the bones, though
                    softer than those of Mammals, Birds, and Reptiles, present a greater degree of
                    firmness and solidity, are whiter and more opaque, and are much less sectile,
                    than those of the cartilaginous division. As in this respect, therefore, they
                    approach the genuine bone of the Mammals, these are distinguished as fishes with
                    osseous skeletons. <hi rend="smallcaps">(Pisces</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >ossei.)</hi></p>
                <p>The bones of both classes of fishes consist of a large quantity of gelatine, with
                    a small proportion of phosphate <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095587?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5587-0002"/> of lime. In
                    the osseous fishes, however, the latter substance is most abundant. .</p>
                <p>The colour of the bones of fishes, though in general whitish gray, is observed to
                    vary in certain genera. In the gar-pike <hi rend="italic">(esox belone),</hi>
                    for instance, they are green, and in the viviparous blcnny <hi rend="italic"

                    >aeruginosa),</hi> they assume a green colour after boiling. The causes of these
                    varieties in colour are unknown.</p>
                <p>SECT. 1. OSTEOLOGY OF THE MAMMIFEROUS ANIMALS.</p>
                <p>The skeleton of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> bears a general
                    rĉsem-blance to that of the human subject, in the construction, shape, and
                    disposition of its component pieces. Distinguished, like that, into head, trunk,
                    and extremities, we recognise the importance of the trunk, and especially of the
                    spine, in the different classes of mammiferous animals.</p>
                <p>The spine consists of separate vertebrae, which are conveniently distinguished,

                <p>The number of cervical vertebrae is the same in animals with the longest and
                    shortest necks,—in the horse, camel, and giraffe, and in the mole and ant-eater.
                    They are always seven. The only exception is observed in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ai</hi> or three-toed sloth <hi rend="italic">(bradypustridactyla),</hi> which
                    has 9 cervical vertebrae (Cuvier); and an apparent exception is presented in the
                    dolphin and porpoise, in which the first two are consolidated into one; and in
                    the cachalot or large-headed whale, in which the last six, sometimes the whole
                    seven, are united or ankylosed. The last six are also united in the ant-eater
                    and manis (Cuvier). Even in this state, however, the traces of the original
                    separation are distinct.</p>
                <p>In the ape the cervical vertebrae are distinguished from those of man chiefly by
                    the spinous processes being stronger and not bifid, and in their bodies being
                    projected more over each other before, so as to support the head more perfectly.
                    In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> the transverse processes of the
                    cervical vertebrae are flattened from behind backwards, and those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">atlas</hi> are very large, both for supporting the head and giving
                    attachment to the strong muscles employed in defence, attacking prey, or bearing
                    it off. For the same purpose the spinous process of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >axis</hi> is very prominent, while the others are short and directed towards
                    the head. In the mole and shrew the cervical vertebrae, which are void of
                    spinous processes, are simple osseous rings, which move easily on each other,
                    probably to facilitate the frequent motions requisite in these animals in
                    burrowing. In the hog the cervical transverse processes are compressed and broad
                    before, so as to appear double. In the elephant the cervical vertebrae have
                    short single spinous processes, and the bodies projecting over each other as in
                    the ape. In the Ruminants the length of the spinous processes diminishes as the
                    neck is elongated. . Thus they are almost wanting in the camel and giraffe, in
                    which the arched neck is much retro-flectcd; and the same peculiarity is
                    recognised in those of the’ horse.</p>
                <p>From these facts it results that the length of the neck depends not on the
                    number, but on the longitudinal extent, of the cervical vertebrae.</p>
                <p>The dorsal, thoracic, or costal vertebrae are distinguished by forming the
                    central fixed basis of the ribs; and their number depends on that of the latter
                    class of bones, which is very variable. The number of costal vertebrae varies
                    from 11, which is that of the Chinese monkey, commonbat, armadillo,
                    helmet-headed dolphin <hi rend="italic">(delphinus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >glo-btceps),</hi> and Gangetic dolphin, to 23, which is that of the <hi

                    which is that not only of man, but of the ourang-outang, silky monkey <hi

                    hare and rabbit, agouti, flying squirrel, mouse and field rat, and camel and
                    dromedary. The next most frequent number is 13, which is that of the mole, white
                    bear, civet, the cat tribe <hi rend="italic">(ſelis),</hi> the dog, wolf and
                    fox, the <hi rend="italic">didelphis</hi> tribe, the cavy, guinea pig and paca,
                    the mouse tribe, excluding the two exceptions already mentioned, the longtailed
                    <hi rend="italic">manis,</hi> the stag, the antelope genus, the goat, sheep, and
                    ox, and the dolphin and porpoise. The number is 14 in the gibbon, coaïta, and
                    weeping monkey, in the howling ape <hi rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">beelzebuľ),</hi> the <hi rend="italic">tarsius,</hi> the brown
                    bear, raccoon and coati, the weazcl <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi> the porcupine,
                    hog, and giraffe. It is 15 in the lori, hedgehog and tenrec, in the badger,
                    pangolin, and seal. The number is 16 in the glutton, hyena, ant-eater, American
                    lamantin, and <hi rend="italic">megatherium.</hi> In the horse, quagga, and
                    dugong, they are 18; in the rhinoceros 19; in the Indian elephant and tapir 20;
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">Unau</hi> or two-toed sloth 23, which, as already
                    stated, is the greatest number yet known.</p>
                <p>In the ape family the dorsal vertebrae resemble those of the human subject, but
                    their spinous processes are long, and erect in the macaca and magot. In the
                    bats, instead of spinous processes, which are wanting, there are minute
                    tubercles. The want of these, however, in sundry species, leaves the column
                    comparatively smooth behind. In the proper quadrupeds these processes arc
                    larger, straighter, and stronger, as the head is weighty or supported on a long
                    neck, in order to give attachment to the strong yellow cervical ligament. This
                    peculiarity is very distinct in the giraffe, camel, ox, rhinoceros, and
                    elephant. In the dolphin they are straight, and smaller than those of the
                    loins.</p>
                <p>The lumbar vertebrae vary in number still more, perhaps, than the cervical and
                    dorsal; and this variety may occasionally be traced to the greater or less
                    distinctness with which the sacral and coccygeal are distinguished. The smallest
                    number is 2, which is that of the two-toed anteater, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> and American lamantin; and the greatest 9, which is that
                    of the lori. The most frequent number is 7, which is that of the greater part of
                    the monkeys, the macauco, the great bat <hi rend="italic">(noctula),</hi> the
                    hedgehog, shrew, raccoon; the tiger, panther, puma, and cat, in the feline <hi

                    whole murine <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> except the hamster; and in the camel
                    and dromedary. The next number in frequency is 6, which is that of the
                    horse-shoe bat, the colugo <hi rend="italic">(galeopithecus),</hi> the white and
                    brown bear, the coati, the weasel genus, the civet, the lion, among the feline,

                    beaver, pangolin, long-tailed manis, hog, giraffe, gazelle, chamois, and seal,
                    all 5; and the agouti and flying squirrel have 8. <hi rend="superscript"> j</hi>

                    θf each posterior articular process presents an apex turned backward, so that
                    the anterior articular process of the next vertebra is locked between two
                    eminences, which confine its movement much. Though this apex is found <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193095600?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5600-0003"/> in
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> it is there shorter; and the arrangement
                    is wanting in the other tribes. The size of the transverse processes indicates
                    the strength of the loins,—a fact which is evinced especially in the instance of
                    the horse, porpoise, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The number of sacral vertebrae is still more various, even in the species of the
                    same genus. Thus, while in several of the ape <hi rend="italic">genus.,</hi> in
                    the lori, in the vampyre bat, the colugo <hi rend="italic">(galcopithccus),</hi>
                    the coati, and two of the didelphis, there is one sacral vertebra only, most of
                    the apes have <hi rend="italic">sacra</hi> consisting of 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6
                    pieces; the majority of other animals have 3 sacral vertebrae; the hedgehog,
                    porcupine, guinea pig, paca, hare, tiger, several of the murine genus, the
                    ant-eater, rhinoceros, camel, dromedary, chamois, goat, sheep, and ox, have 4;
                    the elephant has 5; the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> 6; the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Unau</hi><hi rend="italic">Ί</hi>; and in the mole, white bear, and quagga,
                    they also amount to 7. The frequency of the three sacral vertebrae in the lower
                    animals shows that Galen, who ascribes only 3 to the human subject, must have
                    derived this inference from the former.</p>
                <p>These vertebrae are in the mammalia narrower than in man, and their direction
                    forms with the spine, instead of receding backwards, a straight line; an
                    arrangement evidently connected with the horizontal position of the former. The
                    shape of the sacrum in the lower mammals is that of an elongated triangle; and
                    it is further remarkable, that in those species which occasionally assume the
                    erect attitude on the hind leg, as apes, bears, and sloths, the width of the
                    sacrum is proportionally greater. The sacral spines, which are short in man and
                    the ape, become longer in the Zoom <hi rend="smallcaps">aga,</hi> and form a
                    continuous ridge in the rhinoceros, most ruminants, and especially in the mole.
                    In the vampyre bat the sacrum forms a long compressed cone, the extremity of
                    which is united to the ischial tuberosities, without sustaining a coccyx. The
                    seal has two sacral bones; but the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the dolphin and porpoise, are void both of sacrum and
                    coccyx.</p>
                <p>The coccygeal bones constitute the tail of the lower animals, and in many
                    instances they are extremely numerous. The smallest number is 3, which is that
                    of the magot <hi rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi rend="italic">sylvanus,</hi><hi

                    ant-eater, in which they amount to 40, and the long-tailed manis, in which they
                    amount to 45. Next to these may be placed that of the coaïta 32, the baboon 31,
                    the phalangcr <hi rend="italic">(didelphis</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    determinate order, descending so low as to 9, 8,7, 6, and 4. The quilled
                    duckbill <hi rend="italic">(echidna, ornithorhyncus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >hystrix)</hi> has only 12 caudal vertebrae, while the common one <hi
                    rend="italic">(ornithorhyncus paradoxus)</hi> has at least 20. The gibbon and
                    vampyre bat are the only mammiferous animals, excepting the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> in which there are no coccygeal bones. It sometimes happens that
                    a monkey or opossum loses a portion of its tail, when the truncated end is
                    converted into a knotty excrescence, sometimes carious, always different from
                    the taper point of the last coccygeal vertebra; and in this case it is difficult
                    to determine the exact species.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> in which the absence of <hi

                <p>In general, however, if we reckon the first 2, 3, or 5 vertebrae after the costal
                    as lumbar, it may be said that the caudal vertebrae of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea</hi> vary from 22 or 25, which are the numbers respectively in the
                    lamantin and dugong, to 34, 38, and 42, at which they may be estimated in the
                    dolphin. We shall see that, in the dugong at least, we arc guided in this
                    estimate by the rudimental bones of the pelvis.</p>
                <p>The coccygeal or caudal vertebrae of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> may
                    be distinguished into two kinds; those which contain a canal in continuity with
                    that of the vertebral column and sacrum, and those in which the pieces are
                    solid. The first, which are next the sacrum, have articular, transverse, and
                    spinous processes, distinct in proportion as the animals move their tails. The
                    latter are generally prismatic in shape, diminish in size towards the extremity,
                    and have only slight tubercles for muscular attachments. Animals with prehensile
                    tails, as the American ape <hi rend="italic">(sapajous),</hi> have above, at the
                    base of the body of each vertebra, two small tubercles, between which pass the
                    tendons of the flexor muscles. By means of this mechanism these animals can
                    twine the tail round the branch of a tree with sufficient force to support the
                    weight of the body.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> with long mobile tails have often two or
                    three small supernumerary bones placed on the lower surface of the junctions of
                    several of the coccygeal vertebrae, from the 3d or 4th to the 7th or 8th. These
                    sesamoid bones give attachment to muscles. In the beaver, which employs its tail
                    as a trowel, the transverse processes are remarkable for size, while the lower
                    spinous processes are larger than the upper ones,—an arrangement which enables
                    it to depress the tail forcibly when it beats the ground.</p>
                <p>The shape of the chest in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> varies in
                    general as the clavicles are present or wanting. In animals provided with
                    clavicles, as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> bats, the squirrel,
                    beaver, mole, ant-eater, hedgehog, and sloth, the shape of the chest approaches
                    to the human, or is conoidal, and flattened before and behind. In those void of
                    clavicles it is compressed laterally, from the smaller incurvation of the ribs;
                    and the sternum makes a remarkable prominence, so that the transverse or
                    intercostal diameter is less proportionally, and the sterno-vertebral· is
                    greater proportionally, than in man and the claviculated animals. In the
                    long-legged animals, as the giraffe and those of the stag kind, this prominence
                    of the sternum is sufficient to give it a keel-like appearance <hi rend="italic"
                    >(thorax</hi><hi rend="italic">carinatus).</hi> In the carnivorous animals the
                    chest presents its greatest longitudinal extent.</p>
                <p>The number and shape of the ribs varies in the different tribes. In number,
                    indeed, the ribs always correspond with that of the costal vertebrae. Thus, in
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadruma-na,Zoopπaga,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ruminantia,</hi> they vary from 12 to 15 pair, with only three exceptions, the
                    glutton, hyena, and ant-eater. In the Chinese monkey, common bat, and armadillo,
                    they are a pair less than in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095613?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5613-0004"/> man. While the quilled duckbill <hi rend="italic"
                    >(echidna, ornithorhyncus</hi><hi rend="italic">hystrix)</hi> has only 15 ribs,
                    the common duckbill <hi rend="italic">(ornithorhyncus paradoxus)</hi> has 17;
                    the horse and quagga have 18, the rhinoceros 19, the elephant and tapir 20, and
                    in the <hi rend="italic">Unau</hi> or two-toed sloth they amount to 23, which is
                    the greatest known number. On the whole, the most prevalent number is 13. In the
                    carnivorous animals they are narrow and dense in structure. In the herbivorous
                    they are large, broad, and thick. In the armadillo the two first ribs are large
                    compared with the others. In the two-toed ant-eater, which has 16 pairs, they
                    are so broad that they are imbricated over each other like the plates of a
                    corslet, and render the parietes of this animal’s chest exceedingly solid. In
                    the two species of duckbill <hi rend="italic">(ornithorhyncus paradoxus</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">hyştrix</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >echidna</hi> of Cuvier), the true ribs, in number 6, consist of two portions—a
                    long or vertebral joined to the spine, and a short or sternal attached to the
                    sternum. These portions are united by cartilage, so as to resemble the ribs of
                    birds. The 9 or 10 false ribs terminate before in broad, flat, oval plates of
                    bone, whieh are mutually connected by elastic ligaments.</p>
                <p>The sternum, which is broad in the ourang and pongo, is narrow in the other
                    species of ape, and consists of seven or eight pieces. In the vampyre and all
                    the bat family it is narrow, but presents before or below rather a prominent
                    azygous ridge or keel <hi rend="italic">(carina),</hi> and an anterior
                    extremity, broad on the sides, like a T, for receiving the clavicles. In the
                    mole the clavicular extremity of the <hi rend="italic">sternum</hi> is continued
                    before the ribs, and is flat on the sides for receiving the two short clavicles.
                    In the hog the sternum is broad behind and narrow before. In the rhinoceros,
                    horse, and elephant, it is prolonged before and flat on the sides. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it is broad and thin, especially before.</p>
                <p>Though the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> have 8 cranial bones, the
                    sphenoid often consists of two portions, one forming the orbitar wings and the
                    anterior clinoid processes, the other the temporal or large wings, the posterior
                    clinoid processes, and the basilar fossa. The two parietal bones are early
                    united into one in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera</hi> and the other Zoo-
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">phaga,</hi> in which, however, the frontal remains biparted
                    by a middle suture. The temporal tympanum is separated from the rest of the bone
                    by a suture, which is seldom obliterated in the feline, canine, and <hi
                    rend="italic">viverra</hi> genera. The temporal tympanum is also separate in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> and the frontal ununited. The parietal is
                    united in some, as the hare, the porcupine, <hi rend="italic">cabia,</hi>
                    marmot, rat, and squirrel; separate in the mouse, fat dormouse, and rabbit. The
                    frontal and parietal bones of the elephant are early united with the other
                    cranial bones, find form a vault without trace of suture. In the hog, tapir, and
                    ’ <hi rend="italic">hippopotamus,</hi> the two parietal bones form one picee,
                    while the frontal bone is biparted; and though in the rhinoceros both are
                    biparted, the frontal is early united into one portion. The sphenoid bone of the
                    animals of this tribe long consists of two pieces, one forming the orbitar wing;
                    the other the temporal wings, which, it is to be further observed, are the
                    smallest, in opposition to their proportional dimensions in man. In the
                    Ruminantsand <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> the frontal remains long
                    parted by its middle suture; but the two parictals are represented by a single
                    bony vault. The tympanum is always distinct from the temporal bone. In the seal
                    and walrus the parietal and the frontal consist of two pieces. The lamantin has
                    only one bony areh, representing the two parietal and the squamous part of the
                    temporal bones, while the temporal tympanum is detached from the rest of the
                    bone. In the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the. parietal bones are at
                    an early period united to the occipital and temporal bones, so that the five
                    form one solid portion. The auditory or pyramidal bone is always detached from
                    the temporal, and adheres to the cranium by soft parts only. The sphenoid is not
                    only long separate, but consists of several portions.</p>
                <p>Though, among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> the cranium oţ the
                    ourang-outang approaches that of man in shape, it differs nevertheless in the
                    connections of the constituent bones. The temporal wing of the sphenoid bone is
                    very narrow, docs not reach the parietal, and touches the frontal only by its
                    upper extremity, so that the temporal bone is partly articulated with the
                    frontal. The temporal suture is not imbricated, but serrated. The same mode of
                    connection is observed in the mandrill, macaca (s. <hi rend="italic"
                    >cynocephalus),</hi> magot, and guenon <hi rend="italic">( Cercopithecus),</hi>
                    or tailed monkey tribe. In the American monkey the temporal wing of the sphenoid
                    touches neither the frontal nor the parietal bones; but the temporal bone is
                    articulated directly with the malar by its flat portion. In the American monkeys
                    the frontal bone does not touch the temporal wing of the sphenoid, and the
                    parietal is articulated to the malar. In the howling ape <hi rend="italic"
                    >(simia</hi><hi rend="italic">beelzebuι)</hi> the connections are as in man.</p>
                <p>The connections of the cranial bones are in the Zoo-PHAGA the same as in man. In
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> the sphenoid is joined to the frontal and
                    temporal, without touching the parietal; and the orbitar and temporal <hi
                    rend="italic">fossae</hi> are very small. In the armadillo, pangolin, and sloth,
                    the connections are as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi>; but in the
                    ant-eater the parietal bone, continued below the cranium, is united to the
                    sphenoid at the posterior part of the orbito-temporal <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae.</hi></p>
                <p>In the elephant, though the cranial bones are at an early period consolidated
                    into one, the auditory is always distinet from the temporal bone. In the hog,
                    tapir, rhinoceros, and hippopotamus, the sphenoid is united to the parietal
                    bone, and its temporal wings occupy a small space only of the orbitar and
                    temporal fossae. The orbitar wings, though larger, appear small externally. The
                    auditory bone, though distinct, is, however, united by its base to the margin of
                    the auditory canal of the temporal bone. The sphenoid of the ruminants is
                    articulated, as in man, with all the cranial bones; but its orbitar wing, which
                    is extensive, is principally concealed within the cerebral cavity, and covered
                    by the orbital part of the frontal bone. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea</hi> generally, all the sutures which remain after early life are
                    squamous or imbricated.</p>
                <p>The outline of the frontal bone in the ourang-outang is more irregular than in
                    man, and the orbitar arches are less surbased. In the American monkeys its
                    outline is triangular, and terminates in a point towards the vertex. In the
                    others of this family <hi rend="italic">(Simia),</hi> this bone is almost
                    elliptical, and the orbitar arches arc nearly straight; and in the whole family
                    these arches form, as in man, the anterior border of the frontal bone, in
                    consequence of the narrowness of the root of the nose. In the makis it begins to
                    widen, and the eyes become oblique,—a circumstance which gives their frontal
                    bone a rhomboidal shape.</p>
                <p>The frontal bone in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> and in all the
                    subsequent <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> except the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> forms an irregular prismatic or cylindrical surface with three
                    faces—a superior, bounded before by the muzzle, behind by the cranial convexity
                    and two lateral, descending into the or-bιtar and temporal <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae</hi> on each side. The hedgehog, mole, shrew, ant-eater, some of the <hi
                    rend="italic">phocae,</hi> the morse or walrus, and the rhinoceros, have no
                    proper orbitar arches; and the frontal bone, though broad behind, is contracted
                    and nearly cylindrical between the orbits. In the hippopotamus, the ruminants,
                    and the one-hoofed animals, it enlarges, and forms a vault over each orbit.
                    Lastly, in t ιe <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it is narrow from before
                    backward, resembling a fillet stretched across the cranium, but descends beneath
                    the maxillary bones to form the floor of the orbit.</p>

                <p>The parietal bones of the ourang-outang differ from those of man only in their
                    temporal margin being nearly straight. Those of the ape are narrower, and become
                    more oblique-angled as the cranium is flattened. Tn the Zoo-PHAGA and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata</hi> they are almost rectangular. The single parietal
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> is nearly quadrilateral; but it is
                    sometimes flat, sometimes rounded, sometimes surmounted by a crest. Of the
                    single parietal bone of the ruminants, that of the stag, most of the antelope
                    <hi rend="italic">genus·,</hi> the sheep and the goat, is broad, and sends on
                    each side a narrow process into the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> before
                    the occipital arch; in the camel it is narrower, and bears a longitudinal crest;
                    and in the ox and <hi rend="italic">antilope</hi><hi rend="italic">bubalus</hi>
                    it is placed behind the occipital crest, and resembles a fillet surrounding the
                    back of the head transversely. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> the
                    single parietal is nearly quadrilateral, and placed before the occipital
                    crest.</p>
                <p>The occipital bone in the lower mammalia is remarkable for five characters. 1.
                    The proper occipital surface, instead of being oblique or horizontal, and
                    inferior or basilar, becomes vertical and posterior. 2. The plane of the
                    occipital hole forms with that of the orbits an angle constantly diminishing,
                    becomes parallel to the orbitar plane, and at length crosses it above the head.
                    3. The plane of the occipital condyles, instead of being transverse and
                    horizontal, becomes oblique, and at length vertical. 4. The basilar or cuneiform
                    process is not only horizontal, but forms with the occipital a right angle. And,
                    5. The mastoid process, which in man and the ape forms part of the temporal,
                    belongs in the other mammalia to the occipital. In the polar bear, however, the
                    mastoid process constitutes part of the temporal bone.</p>
                <p>From the 1st, 2d, and 3d characters, it results that the head of quadrupeds is
                    not balanced on the spine, but is suspended by muscles, tendons, and ligaments,
                    especially the strong cervical, which connects the occipital spine to the
                    spinous processes of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae. This ligament,
                    therefore, though feeble and indistinct in man, is strong, particularly in
                    quadrupeds with heavy head or long neck, in order to counteract the disadvantage
                    of the long lever. It is strongest in the elephant, and is almost wholly
                    ossified in the mole—a condition requisite for the burrowing faculty exercised
                    by that animal.</p>
                <p>The temporal bone is naturally distinguished in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >•Mammalia</hi> into two parts; a flat or proper temporal, corresponding to the
                    squamous part of the human temporal bone, and the pyramidal, acoustic, or
                    auditory, corresponding to the pyramidal or lithoid portion of the human
                    subject. The first only, which is proper to the scull, claims attention here. In
                    the ourang-outang and most of the genus <hi rend="italic">simia</hi> it forms a
                    trapezium with the longest side above, and the height of which varies with that
                    of the scull. In the American apes it is smallest in this direction. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> the proper temporal bone is as in the ape. Being
                    narrow in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> behind, it is a little rounded
                    in the short-muzzled <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paciiydermata.</hi></p>
                <p>The ethmoid is, strictly speaking, the olfactory bone, and shall be mentioned
                    under the organs of sense. The sphenoid, among other offices, may be regarded as
                    the essential ophthalmic bone.</p>
                <p>The facial bones of the lower <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> differ from
                    those of man; first, in the number of separate pieces; and, secondly, in the
                    form and proportional horizontal extent.</p>
                <p>The difference in number consists in each superior maxillary bone being divided
                    into a maxillary bone proper, and an anterior or labial portion; which being
                    interposed between the proper maxillary, are commonly denominated the
                    intermaxillary <hi rend="italic">(ossa</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >intermaxillaria).</hi> As it bears also the superior incisors, it is named by
                    Haller the incisive bone <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >incisivum)</hi>; but since it is found not only in the ruminants, which,
                    excepting the camel, are void of incisors, but in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Edentata</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> this denomination is less
                    applicable than the former. It may be doubted whether these should be regarded
                    as additional bones, as they are generally represented by zootomists; for they
                    are in truth merely the incisive or anterior portion of the superior maxillary
                    bones. In other respects, the difference between the human and the animal
                    superior maxillary bone is, that in the former each bone is in one piece, in the
                    latter it is in two. Even in the human foetus the trace of the separation may be
                    recognised; and we have seen it in the human scull some years after birth.
                    Conversely, it is early obliterated in some quadrupeds. Thus, though distinct in
                    the ourang-outang seen by Cuvier, it was not found by Tyson or Daubenton, and is
                    wanting in one preserved in the Hunterian museum. In a young specimen of the
                    jocko also, noticed by Cuvier, no trace of the intermaxillary suture was
                    observed. It appears also to be wanting in the perforated bat, the horse-shoe
                    bat, and the three-toed sloth.</p>
                <p>Mutually united on the mesial plane, the intermaxillary bones are united to the
                    maxillary by sutures, which pass from the outer angles of the latter, near the
                    incisive holes, towards the palate, where they intersect. In form and size it
                    varies in the different orders and genera. Small in many of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> and the walrus, it is large in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in the hippopotamus, porpoise, and cachalot, and
                    prominent in the wombat. In the duckbill’ it consists of two unciform portions,
                    united by a broad intermediate cartilage.</p>
                <p>The peculiarity of the animal face consists in the horizontal elongation of the
                    two jaw-bones. In the monkey tribe this elongation is trifling; and all that is
                    remarked is, that the palate and maxillary bones are more elongated in
                    proportion to their height, and that their anterior part, instead of being
                    vertical, is more or less inclined forwards. The degree of this elongation,
                    which differs in different <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> may be estimated by
                    the acuteness of the facial angle.</p>
                <p>The narrowness of the interorbital space is another character of the animal
                    countenance. In the <hi rend="italic">guenon</hi> and American ape it is a mere
                    <hi rend="italic">septum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in the ourang-outang,
                    magot, and howler, it is larger, by reason of the nasal <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossae</hi> ascending to this height. From these the face of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> is distinguished by the following circumstances.
                    1. The breadth of the ascending maxillary processes throws the orbits to the
                    sides; 2. these orbitar surfaces form the anterior wall instead of the floor of
                    the orbit; 3. the malar bone is united neither to the frontal nor to the
                    sphenoid bone, and forms only the zygomatic arch and the lower margin of the
                    orbit; 4. the orbit, closed neither behind nor below, communicates freely with
                    the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and, 5. the
                    palate bones are much elongated and form a considerable space of the internal
                    wall, to which the ethmoid bone does not contribute. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia</hi> the interorbital space is still larger, by reason of the size of
                    the intermaxillary bones throwing the maxillary backwards and to the sides,
                    where they form the inner orbitar wall, in which the palate bones occupy only a
                    small space. The anterior wall is formed by a process of the maxillary, which
                    contributes to form the zygomatic arch, while the malar is suspended in the
                    middle between the process and that of the temporal bone. Very similar is the
                    face of the elephant, except that the height of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >alveoli</hi> from the tusks, thrusting the nose upwards, and shortening its
                    bones, alters entirely the expression of the head of this animal.</p>
                <p>In the sloth, in which the face is short in proportion to <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095639?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5639-0006"/> the scull, the
                    malar bone attached to the maxillary only, is not united to the zygomatic
                    process of the temporal. In the long-muzzled <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi>
                    in which the face is conoιdal, the maxillary bones extend to the orbits, and are
                    scpaιat-ed by a broad lacrymal bone, while a long palate bone forms the inner
                    wall of these <hi rend="italic">fossae.</hi> The zygomatic arch, which is
                    interrupted in the ant-eater and pangolin, is completed in the Cape ant-eater
                    and the armadillo. In the tapir and rhinoceros the maxillary bone passes beneath
                    the orbit; and the nasal bones form a sort of vault, which supports in the first
                    animal the trunk, and in the second the horn. . <hi rend="subscript">
                    1</hi>,</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the maxillary and intermaxillary bones
                    form a sort of flattened beak, distinguished into four parallel bands, of which
                    the maxillary, which are external, alone bear teeth in three genera, provided
                    with the latter organs. The nasal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi> is a vertical
                    opening before the cranium, surrounded before and laterally by the
                    intermaxillary bones. The maxillary ascend in the same manner, and cover that
                    part of the frontal bone which forms the orbitar vault, but do not themselves
                    contribute to the formation of this cavity. The nasal bones are two minute
                    tubercles implanted on the frontal bone above the narrow aperture. The malar is
                    in the shape of a style, suspended by cartilages beneath the orbit; and the
                    latter cavity is completed behind by a process of the frontal, which joins the
                    zygomatic of the temporal bone, and below which the orbitar and temporal <hi
                    rend="italic">fossae</hi> communicate.</p>
                <p>The direction of the orbits, the shape of their base or facial border, and their
                    relation to the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa,</hi> are important
                    circumstances in the animal face and cranium. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >simiae</hi> the angle of the orbitar axes is rather smaller; and the shape of
                    the margin, which is quadrilateral in the jocko, becomes oval in the
                    ourang-outang and American monkeys. The angle of the axes enlarges in the other
                    Mammalia; and the base or anterior margin becomes nearly circular in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Zoopiiaga,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi>; but
                    the arch is incomplete behind. In the <hi rend="italic">Ruminants</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidipeda,</hi> however, in which it is also circular, the
                    border is complete. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the orbitar vault
                    is semicircular, their axes are rectilineal, and there is no floor.</p>
                <p>In the human scull the junction of the malar bone with the frontal and.sphenoid
                    completes the orbit externally, and prevents it from communicating with the
                    temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the same
                    arrangement is observed in the <hi rend="italic">simiae.</hi> In the <hi

                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi>
                    however, in which the malar bone is united neither to the frontal nor the
                    sphenoid, the orbit is not only incomplete on the external posterior border, but
                    communicates freely with the temporal <hi rend="italic">fossa.</hi> In the
                    Ruminants is observed an arrangement intermediate between that of the <hi

                    >Carnivora.</hi> The malar bone, united to the frontal, completes the orbitar
                    ring; but as it is not united to the sphenoid, it allows the orbits and
                    temporal/ossAE to communicate. The orbit of the mole is so superficial, that it
                    can scarcely be said to exist.</p>
                <p>The lower jaw of the mammifcrous quadruped differs from that of man chiefly by
                    the following circumstances. The triangular flat surface which constitutes the
                    chin,.and which is most distinct in the Caucasan race, begins to become faint in
                    the negro, and is altogether lost in the monkey tribe. In the ourang-outang,
                    indeed, the animal character of the lower jaw appears distinct in the vertical
                    convexity of the anterior arch of the jaw, and the retreating of its lower
                    margin. In the lower <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> the anterior maxillary
                    arch is still more retreating, and the maxillary <hi rend="italic">rami</hi>
                    form a more acute and elongated angle. These animal characters are still more
                    conspicuous in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Car</hi><hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nivora,</hi> most of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> Ruminants, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi> The
                    ascending <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi> also becomes short in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> and several of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> more so in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> and is almost
                    extinct in several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> for instance the
                    paca, beaver, and porcupine, and the armadillo, ant-eater, and duckbill, among
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata.</hi> In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga,</hi> however, in which the prehensile and masticatory muscles are
                    large and powerful, the <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi> becomes broad, and its
                    coronoid process is extensive. The angle which the <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi>
                    forms with the body of the jaw, and which is almost right in the adult human
                    subject, becomes obtuse in the lower animals, nearly at the same rate at which
                    the <hi rend="italic">ranntş</hi> disappears; and indeed the transition of the

                    >Edentata</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> in which there is neither
                    <hi rend="italic">ramus</hi> nor coronoid process, after thesie parts have been

                <p>When the mammiferous cranium is considered generally, and the relative direction
                    and proportion of the cranial and facial part of the head examined, we recognise
                    more distinctly the characters by which the lower orders of that class arc
                    distinguished from man. This character consists in the position of the occipital
                    bone and hole, the position and direction of the facial bones in relation to the
                    frontal, the elongation of the former, and large size which they present in
                    relation to the cranial.</p>
                <p>In the human subject, it has been already observed, the position of the occipital
                    bone is oblique and horizontal, and the plane of the occipital hole is
                    horizontal, while its position is anterior. In most quadrupeds, while the bone
                    assumes a vertical position, the hole becomes posterior, and its plane vertical
                    or oblique, in proportion as the face is elongated. The plane of the occipital
                    hole forms with that of the horizontal a considerable angle, which Daubenton
                    undertook to determine, by drawing one line through the plane of the aperture,
                    and another from its posterior margin through the lower edge of the orbit.
                    (J∕e⅛. <hi rend="italic">de ľAcad, des Sciences de Paris,</hi> 1764, p. 568.) In
                    the horse this angle is about 90°, while in the ourang-outang it is only 37°,
                    and in the <hi rend="italic">lemur</hi> 47°. In other respects, however, it
                    furnishes an imperfect result, since in most quadrupeds which differ very much
                    it ranges between 80° and 90°.</p>
                <p>The direction of the face in relation to that of the&lt; cranium, determined
                    according to the method of Camper,] furnishes more accurate results. While in
                    the human <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> subject it varies, according to the
                    races, from 70° to 80°, in the ourang-outang it is only 65°; in the American and
                    long-tailed monkeys about 60°; in the macaca and baboon about 45°; and, lastly,
                    in the mandrillo, the most vicious and ferocious of the monkey tribe, only 30°.
                    In some species in which the ear is elevated and the guttural <hi rend="italic"
                    >fossa</hi> deep, for instance in the pongo and <hi rend="italic">alouate</hi>
                    or howler, the small size of this angle does not indicate proportional
                    elongation of muzzle; and to rectify this inconvenience, it is requisite to draw
                    the basilar line of the facial angle parallel to the base of the nostrils. With
                    this modification, however, the Camperian line admits of correct application to
                    the human race and <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> only, in which the
                    frontal sinuses are small and not prominent. In quadrupeds, for instance the
                    carnivora, several of the ruminants, and in the elephant, the frontal sinuses
                    are so large and prominent as to affect the results given by the facial angle
                    very materially. In other orders, again, for instance the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia</hi> and the morse, the nose occupies so much space that the cranium
                    is inclined backwards without its walls being free before; and it is impossible
                    to know where the facial line passes. These, therefore, must be measured by the
                    inner surface. Lastly, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095652?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5652-0007"/> in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> the
                    pyramidal elevation of the cranium above an elongated but flattened face renders
                    the facial line much more vertical than it ought to be. The following
                    measurements show the angle subtended by a line drawn parallel to the base of
                    the nostrils, and another passing by the anterior margin of the <hi

                    cranial and facial part of the head, by comparing the respective areas exhibited
                    by a longitudinal and vertical section of both. In this section the area of the
                    cranium is to that of the face sometimes in a ratio of majority, sometimes of
                    minority, occasionally of equality.</p>
                <p>In the European the area of the cranial section is about four times that of the
                    face, excluding that of the lower jaw. In the negro the cranial area remaining
                    the same, that of the face augments about one fifth, whereas in the Calmuck it
                    augments only one tenth. In the ourang-outang the proportion is still less. In
                    the American ape the facial is almost half the cranial area. The ratio is that
                    of equality in the mandrill and most of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi>
                    except the varieties of short-muzzled dogs, as the pug, in which the facial is
                    rather less than the cranial area. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> Ruminants, and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula,</hi> the facial is larger than the cranial area. Among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in the hare and marmot, it is a third larger; in
                    the hedgehog double; in the Ruminants almost double; in the pig a little more
                    than double; nearly triple in the hippopotamus; and almost four times in the
                    horse. In the morse and elephant the face is rendered large by the height of the
                    <hi rend="italic">alveoli;</hi> and it may be regarded as augmenting the organs
                    of the senses. The cranium of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> is very
                    convex, and the face very flat, and the proportional area of the latter is
                    thereby diminished. The facial area of the dolphin may be a third larger than
                    the cranial.</p>
                <p>The outline of the cranial section in the human subject is oval, that of the
                    facial section forms a triangle, with the longest side contiguous to the
                    cranium, and the smallest without, while the angle formed by the latter with the
                    third side or palate is the facial. In the lower animals, this triangle, which
                    may be named the <hi rend="italic">facial,</hi> becomes so much elongated, that
                    the cranial side, which is the longest in man, becomes the shortest of the three
                    in the <hi rend="italic">cynocephalus</hi> and mandrill, and continues so in the
                    other quadrupeds.</p>
                <p>The basin <hi rend="italic">{pelvis')</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> in general agrees with that of man in forming a part common to
                    the trunk and the lower extremities. It differs, however, altogether in the
                    direction which it takes, which is obliquely backwards, with its anterior
                    opening or brim forwards and downwards, and in the bones being smaller and much
                    narrower; both of which characters are connected with its not being used in the

                    are much elongated; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> their
                    superior or ilial part is not much broader than their pubal. In the Ruminants,
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula,</hi> the ilial portions again become broad; and in the elephant
                    and rhinoceros especially, this width, combined with the length of the
                    ilio-pubal <hi rend="italic">rami</hi> and the concave abdominal surface,
                    concurs to give the <hi rend="italic">pelves</hi> of these animals the
                    prodigious capacity by which they are distinguished. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >pelvis of</hi> the amphibious <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> differs from
                    that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoopiiaga</hi> only in being narrow and
                    elongated, and in the <hi rend="italic">pubis</hi> being thrown behind. In the
                    ant-eater, mole, and shrew, the pubal junction is open as in birds; and in the
                    two latter <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> the bones are so narrow that the
                    sexual and urinary organs are placed without its circumference. In the sloth <hi
                    rend="italic">genera,</hi> e. g. the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">Unau,</hi> the pelvis is wide, the cotyloid cavities turned
                    upwards, and the ischial tuberosity is united with the sacrum, so as to convert
                    the ischiatic notch into a hole. This sacro-ischial junction is also observed in
                    others of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> as the ant-eater and
                    armadillo, and in the <hi rend="italic">phascoloma {didelphis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ursina).</hi> The marsupial animals present two minute bones, one
                    on each side, connected by movable articulation to the pubis, and which are
                    employed to sustain the mammillary pouch <hi rend="italic">{marsupium)</hi> or
                    nipple-bag, in which the young are reared after exclusion from the <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus.</hi> These bones, which are distinguished by the name of
                    marsupial <hi rend="italic">{ossa marsupialia),</hi> are oblong and flattened.
                    Lastly, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> in which the pelvic
                    extremities are wanting (Plate XXXIV. fig. 2), the pelvis is also so far
                    deficient, that instead of consisting of the sacrum and coxal bones, it is
                    represented by a small bony appendage, suspended in the soft parts on each side
                    of the anus, and which, meeting at angles on the mesial plane so as to form a
                    bone like the letter V, are merely a rudiment of the ischial bones.</p>
                <p>The shoulder of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally differs from
                    that of man by the absence or the proportions of the collarbone, and by the
                    shape of the <hi rend="italic">scapula.</hi></p>
                <p>The collar-bone exists in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> nearly as in
                    man; but it is wholly wanting in the three orders of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ungulata</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">—</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi>
                    the Ruminants, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula—</hi> and in all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea.</hi> Between these extremes it is found in various
                    forms in the intermediate orders of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Unguiculata.</hi>
                    Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> it exists in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ciiiroptera,</hi> especially the bats proper, in which it is
                    strong and large; the <hi rend="smallcaps">Insectivora,</hi> as the hedgehog,
                    shrew, and mole <hi rend="italic">genera</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in the
                    didelphis or opossum among the marsupial animals. In the others of this order,
                    as the bear, raccoon, coati, weasel, otter, dog, cat, and seal, the collar-bone
                    is represented by clavicular bones, suspended among the muscles, touching
                    neither the sternum nor acromion; and in some species it is altogether wanting.
                    The <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> may be distinguished into two
                    subdivisions, as they are provided with or void of collarbones. The first
                    comprehends the squirrel, beaver, and mouse, with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >helamys,</hi> marmot, and aye-aye or cheiro-mys <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi>
                    The second consists of the porcupine, hare, and cavy <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera,</hi> as the guinea-pig and paca, in which the collar-bone is rudimental
                    only, suspended among the soft parts. It exists in most of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> as the sloth, armadillo, ant-eater, and the
                    gigantic fossil animal named <hi rend="italic">megatherium</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> but it is wanting in the pangolin, and was believed to be wanting in the
                    <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and duckbill till Cuvier demonstrated its
                    existence. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> there is no vestige of
                    collar-bone.</p>
                <p>From these facts it results that the clavicle exists in all animals, the fore
                    legs of which are frequently or habitually protruded, either to seize, as apes
                    and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi>; or to fly, as bats; or to dig and
                    burrow, as the mole; or to rake the ground, as the hedgehog and ant-eater. In
                    the mole particularly, the collar-bone, instead of being long, is <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095665?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5665-0008"/> a broad,
                    thick, short, quadrangular bone; and while it is connected to the acromion by a
                    ligament, it is articulated to the humerus by a large facette. The collar-bone
                    'of the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ornithorhyncus</hi>
                    is very singular. It consists of a broad central bone, surmounted by two
                    transverse branches spreading out on each side, so as to give the whole bone
                    some resemblance to the letter T, but siņuated so as to make the diverging
                    branches like the Greek υ. In young animals this bone consists of three
                    portions. The two diverging branches are genuine collarbones, and may be
                    regarded as a bifurcated bone; while the middle is supported on the sternum, and
                    has articulated to each side a part of the <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi>
                    corresponding to the coracoid process. The collar-bone, indeed, is a power? ful
                    buttress, which prevents the arm-bone from being thrust too much forward.</p>
                <p>Of the shoulder-blade or <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> which is present in all
                    red-blooded animals with thoracic extremities, and hence in all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> the principal point is to remark the varieties
                    which its shape presents. Though in man, most of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quadrumana,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera,</hi> and the elephant,
                    the vertebral margin or base of several authors on human anatomy is the longest,
                    it becomes the shortest in most quadrupeds, especially those which, like the
                    Ruminants and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> have long legs and
                    narrow chest. In most of them, also, this margin, instead of being straight, is
                    rounded,as in theCARNivoRAandllθDENτiA. In theCAR- <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >nivora</hi> without collar-bone, the hedgehog and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dideĩphis,</hi> the acromion is less prominent; there is another eminence
                    directed backwards, almost perpendicular to the spine. The coracoid process,
                    also, which is present in the Cm-ROPTEiiA, the hedgehog, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >dideiphisgenus,</hi> is wanting in most of the zoophagous tribe. In the hare
                    the acromion terminates in a long slender process, rising at right angles and
                    bending backwards, which may be named the <hi rend="italic">recurrent.</hi> In
                    the Ruminantsand <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> notonly are this and the
                    acromion, but even the coracoid, wanting. The <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi>
                    again, of the hog and rhinoceros is remarkable for the disappearance of the
                    spine at the glenoid angle; while from its middle proceeds a prominent process
                    towards the costal or inferior margin. In the mole the scapula is long and
                    narrow, like a cylindrical bone, placed parallel to the spine,—an arrangement
                    which, together with the shortness and thickness of the clavicle, already
                    mentioned, is evidently connected with the burrowing habits of this animal.
                    Lastly, in the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> which in so many characters of organization approach the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> on the one side, and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds</hi> on the other, the scapula is a single sinuous bone, attached by one
                    extremity to the sternum and middle part of the clavicular bone, with the other
                    loose; and in the middle an articular cavity, in which the head of the humerus
                    is plaçed, and which evidently corresponds to the glenoid. In this instance,
                    therefore, the clavicle and <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> may be regarded as
                    united into a single bone.</p>
                <p> The <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> which exists in all the animals with
                    thoracic extremities, undergoes considerable variations. In the lower animals
                    generally it is much shorter than in man; and .it is invariably shorter in
                    proportion as <hi rend="italic">the, metacarpus</hi> is elongated. Thus, in
                    animals with what is named a <hi rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone, that is, one
                    metacarpal, as in the horse and the ruminants, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >humerus</hi> is so short that it is concealed in the soft parts as far as the
                    cubit. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it may be said to attain its
                    maximum of brevity. In the bat and sloth it is long in proportion to the rest of
                    the body.</p>
                <p>Ιhe <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> of the mole is perhaps the most extraordinary
                    of all those of the mammiferous animals. Not only is it articulated with the <hi
                    rend="italic">scapula</hi> by a small head, but it is connected with a facette
                    of the clavicle by another belonging to the great tuberosity, and between which
                    and the head is a deep pit. Tile crest of the small tuberosity is so large, that
                    it represents a square placed vertically, so that the <hi rend="italic">ĩinea
                    aspena,</hi> is above. The rest of the body <hi rend="subscript"> ι</hi> of the
                    bone, which is very short, is arched above, so that the cubital extremity is
                    directed upwards. From this arrangement it results that the cubit is elevated
                    above the shoulder while the palm is turned downwards,—a disposition necessary
                    for the burrowing habits of the animal.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">simiae</hi> the <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> are arranged as in man, except that in the <hi
                    rend="italic">cynocephalus,</hi> mandrill, magot, and guenon, the coronoid
                    process of the <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> is narrower, and the radial facette
                    deeper. In the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ulna</hi> very generally disappears or becomes rudimentary only. In the bat
                    family and the colugo <hi rend="italic">{galeopithecus)</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> is wanting or is represented by a slender style placed
                    below the radius. These animals are therefore destitute of the power of
                    pronation and supination. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">radius</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ulna,</hi> though separate, are
                    void of rotatory motion; and the <hi rend="italic">olecranon</hi> is compressed,
                    and continued farther back than in man. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Paciiy-dermata</hi> the <hi rend="italic">radius</hi> is before and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> behind, and, though distinct, there is no rotation. In
                    several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> for instance the marmot,
                    porcupine, &amp;c. the coronoid process is small, and in others, <hi
                    rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the cavy, hare, and mouse family, it is altogether
                    effaced. In the Ruminants the <hi rend="italic">ulna</hi> is united immovably to
                    the radius; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> it is represented
                    by an <hi rend="italic">olecranon</hi> adhering to the posterior surface of that
                    bone. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> though both bones are present,
                    they are much flattened.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> of the ape <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>
                    contains one bone more than that of man, situate between the pyramidal and large
                    bone, and which seems to result from the trapezium being divided into two parts.
                    Conversely, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> but especially in the
                    dog, cat, hedgehog, shrew, bear, and seal, the scaphoid and semilunar are united
                    into one large bone. Those which have a vestige of thumb, as the hyena and
                    glutton, have the trapezium very small. The mole has not only 9 carpal bones, as
                    the ape, but a large sickje-shaped bone, which is attached to the radial margin
                    of the fore paw, and which gives it the shape proper to the habits of the
                    animal. The toes are further very short. Of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia,</hi> the hare resembles the ape; but in the beaver, marmot, squirrel,
                    and cat, the scaphoid and semilunar make one bone; while in the porcupine the
                    supernumerary bone is between the pisiform and metacarpal of the fifth toe. In
                    the two-toed ant-eater there are only 6 carpal bones, 4 in the first row and two
                    in the second; in the three-toed sloth there are only 5, 3 in the first row and
                    2 in the second; the pangolin has 7; the cachecame 8 and a rudimental small toe;
                    the elephant 8, 7 wedge-shaped and one elongated, corresponding to the pisiform;
                    and the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> 8. In the rhinoceros, which
                    has only 3 toes, the trapezium only is wanting; but there is a supernumerary
                    bone on the margin of the scaphoid, and on that of the unciform, as in the
                    porcupine. The first range consists, in the Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula,</hi> of 4 bones; in the former, excepting the camel, the second
                    consists of 2, and the latter of 3. Those of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> which are much flattened, are 3 in the first row and 2 in the
                    second.</p>
                <p>Ιhe <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally have as many metacarpal bones as
                    toes, that is, never fewer than 3 or more than 5, with the exception of the
                    Ruminants, in which these bones are in early life consolidated into one named
                    the <hi rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone. In animals which walk on the tips of the
                    toes, or which use them as organs of prehension, the metacarpal bones are
                    lengthened·to nearly double; and hence in all hese animals the <hi rend="italic"
                    >metacarpus</hi> is erroneously named the. tore leg, and therefore it has been
                    imagined, that in several <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095678?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5678-0009"/> of our domestic animals the different parts of
                    the lower extremity are articulated in opposite directions to those of; man.
                    Thus the fore leg of the horse, deer, sheep, and dog are in truth the <hi
                    rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> of these animals; and what is vulgarly named the
                    fore knee or <hi rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone of the horse, is actually the
                    <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> or wrist-joint. It is therefore convex on the
                    dorsal, and concave and inflected on the palmar aspect, exactly as the <hi
                    rend="italic">carpus of</hi> the human subject.</p>
                <p>In the three-toed sloth, the three bones of which the metacarpus consists are
                    mutually consolidated at the base and with the rudiment of a fourth toe. In the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> the metacarpal bones, which are much
                    flattened, are also mutually united.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally, if we include imperfect or
                    rudimental phalanges concealed in the skin, there are never fewer than 3, nor
                    more than 5. The Unguiculated animals generally have 5, perfect and imperfect·
                    The character of the perfect fore toe or finger is to consist of 3 rows or
                    phalanges, excepting the first of the radial side, which has only 2. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> this is separate, and opposable to the other
                    toes, constituting a thumb, and giving this tribe of animals a prehensible organ
                    entitled to the epithet of hand. It is, however, shorter and less perfect in
                    other respects than the genuine thumb of the human hand. In the <hi
                    rend="italic">coăìta</hi><hi rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >paniscus)</hi> it is converted into a rudimental bone, concealed under the
                    skin.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> which have no power of grasping minute
                    objects, the thumb or first toe is parallel to the others, and, though equal in
                    length to these in the ursine family, it is shorter in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mustela, viverra,</hi> canine and feline <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi> In the
                    latter, which have the power of erecting the claws, to prevent them from being
                    blunted in walking, the shape of the middle and unguinal phalanx is remarkable.
                    The former is triangular prismatic, with two lateral and a plantar or palmar
                    inferior surface. The third or unguinal phalanx is shaped like a hook,
                    consisting of two parts. One, directed forwards, sharp and pointed, receives the
                    nail or claw, in a long groove like a sheath. The second part of the hook, which
                    is behind, rises vertically from the lower part by which it is articulated, and
                    is produced into two processes, to which are attached the erecting muscles of
                    the claw, which are flexors of the phalanx.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> there is a perfect but short thumb
                    in the hare, beaver, and jerbois; a two-phalanx but concealed one in the
                    squirrel, mouse, and rat family, porcupine, paca, agouti; and a one-phalanx
                    concealed one in the cavy, guinea-pig, marmot, &amp;c. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata</hi> the number of fore toes varies much; in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Tamanoir,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tamandua</hi> or four-toed
                    ant-eater, the thumb· toe is obliterated; in the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> or
                    three-toed sloth, both that and the fifth toe are obliterated; and in the
                    two-toed ant-eater, and <hi rend="italic">Uhau</hi> or two-toed sloth, these,
                    with the second toe also, are obliterated.</p>
                <p>The elephant has 5 perfect toes, all concealed under the thick, callous hide of
                    the foot. In hoofed animals with 4 toes, for instance the hog, tapir, and
                    hippopotamus, the thumb-toe is in the shape of a śmall rudimental bone.</p>
                <p>In the Ruminants the single metacarpal bone (Chesel-den’s figure of the Deer,
                    Plate I.) is articulated with two digital phalanges, which constitute one of the
                    distinguishing characters of this order—the cloven foot. In some genera, at the
                    root of these two perfect toes are two small bones, often covered with horn,
                    which represent two other toes. The last or unguinal phalanx is always
                    trilateral in shape. In the horse and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi>
                    generally, the two lateral toes are represented only by two bony styles, named
                    the splint bones, situate on the two sides of the metacarpal or <hi
                    rend="italic">cannon</hi> bone. The three phalanges of the single toe which
                    constitutes the foot are distinguished as the <hi rend="italic">pastern
                    bone,</hi> which is the first phalanx; the <hi rend="italic">coronet,</hi> which
                    is the middle or second; and the <hi rend="italic">coffin</hi> bone, which is
                    the third or unguinal phalanx, which has the shape of the hoof, rounded before,
                    convex above, and flat below. To the back of the pastern joint are connected two
                    sesamoid bones; and to the coffin bone is attached another, named the shuttle
                    bone. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> all the phalanges, which are
                    flattened, and often cartilaginous, are united in the fin or paddle.</p>
                <p>The thigh-bone, which is single in all the classes, follows the type of that of
                    the human frame in general figure and parts. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> it is, however, proportionally shorter, and its length diminishes
                    as that of the <hi rend="italic">metatarsus</hi> augments. In the Ruminants and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> for instance, it is so short that it is
                    concealed by muscles against the belly; and hence it is too often overlooked and
                    confounded with the leg. In other respects the general characters are, that it
                    is not arched; that, excepting in the bear and some of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >simia</hi> genus, e. <hi rend="italic">g.</hi> the ourang-outang, it is shorter
                    than the leg-bones; that its neck is very short, and more perpendicular to the
                    <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis</hi> than in man;
                    and that the great trochanter is raised above the head, which is directed
                    inwards. In the <hi rend="italic">simiae</hi> it is quite cylindrical, and void
                    of <hi rend="italic">linea, aspera.</hi> In the tapir the middle part is found
                    flattened; and at the external margin there is a prominent crest, terminating in
                    an unciform process. In the rhinoceros the great trochanter and the unciform
                    process are so elongated as to unite almost, and form a hole between them and
                    the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis.</hi> The unciform process is observed also in
                    the horse, beaver, and armadillo. The thigh-bone of the seal is so short, that
                    the half of its length consists of the two articular extremities.</p>
                <p>Though the leg-bones of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> bear a general
                    similitude to those of man, the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> alone is constant;
                    and the <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi> after becoming unusually slender, and
                    changing its position from the outside to the posterior part of the tibia, is
                    converted into a mere appendage, and at length disappears entirely. Thus, though
                    it is distinct, and occupies its usual position in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >simiae,</hi> in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chirop-tera</hi> it is extremely
                    slender; and since the <hi rend="italic">femora</hi> are directed backward, the
                    <hi rend="italic">fibulae</hi> are turned towards each other. In several of the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> for instance the pha-tagin, armadillo, and
                    sloth, it is large, curved, and remote from the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi> In
                    the dog family and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> it is altogether
                    behind the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi> In the mole and murine <hi
                    rend="italic">genus</hi> it is consolidated to the lower third of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia,</hi> leaving an empty trilateral space above. In the
                    rhinoceros, elephant, and hog, the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> is flattened
                    and united to the whole length of the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi> In the
                    ruminants it is represented by a small bony appendage, placed on the outer
                    margin of the <hi rend="italic">astragalus,</hi> below the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia,</hi> and forming the external or fibular ankle. Lastly, in the horse and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> is
                    reduced to a styloid rudimental pro-, cess, which is firmly consolidated in the
                    adult animal to the upper part of the <hi rend="italic">tibia.</hi></p>
                <p>Between the <hi rend="italic">tarsus of</hi> man and that of the other <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the following are the principal differences.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">simiae</hi> the fibular facette of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >astragalus</hi> is nearly vertical, and the tibial is very oblique; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">calcaneum</hi> wants the tuberosity, except in the pongo. In the
                    ordinary bat family the calcaneum is elongated into a styloid process, concealed
                    in the substance of the membranous ubiform expansions; but in the roussette <hi
                    rend="italic">(pteropus)</hi> the tuberosity projects beneath the foot.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> the calcaneum is produced considerably
                    backwards, while the scaphoid, which consists of two parts, forms a tubercle on
                    the sole. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata</hi> the three-toed sloth is
                    peculiar in having a tarsus, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095691?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5691-0010"/> consisting of four bones only, the <hi
                    rend="italic">astragalus,</hi><hi rend="italic">calcaneum,</hi> and two
                    cuneiform bones, the first of which is articulated not only with the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia, fibula,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">calcaneum,</hi> but with
                    the 'large cuneiform bone, without any intermediate scaphoid bone. Its
                    connection with the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> is by means of a convex
                    articular surface, which rolls on the external part of the tarsal end of the <hi
                    rend="italic">tibia.</hi> From this mode of articula <hi rend="subscript">
                    φ</hi>- tion it results that the foot of the sloth admits neither of being
                    elevated nor depressed, but simply of performing lateral motions of adduction
                    and abduction, to which it owes the power of clasping the trunks of trees and
                    climbing, but which renders progression difficult and laborious.</p>
                <p>¾ιe hog has a scaphoid with three ordinary cuneiform bones, and a rudimental
                    great-toe bone beneath the.first. In the tapir and rhinoceros there are only two
                    cuneiform bones. All the animals already enumerated have the same number of
                    metatarsal bones as of toes. .</p>
                <p>In the Ruminants the cuboid and scaphoid bones are united, unless in the camel,
                    in which they are distinct. At the outer margin of the pulley of the astragalus
                    is a bone which represents the lower head of the <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi>
                    and which is farther articulated to the upper surface of the os calcis. In this
                    side also there are only two cuneiform bones, which are united in the giraffe.
                    The two metatarsal bones are always united, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >metacarpus,</hi> into one, which forms a posterior cannon bone. The <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi> resemble the camel in this, that the scaphoid
                    is distinct from the cuboid bone, and that there are two cuneiform bones, while
                    the peroneal rudiment and the corresponding articular surface of the calcaneum
                    are wanting. The metacarpal arc also consolidated into a single piece, named the
                    hinder <hi rend="italic">cannon bone,</hi> each side of which is provided with a
                    minute bony style.</p>
                <p>The toes of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Marsupialia</hi> are longer than those of man; but the great toe is shorter
                    than .the others, and its metatarsal bone is susceptible of separation and
                    opposition, as the thumb or thumb-toe of the hand. Hence Cuvier, in his first
                    classification, distinguished the latter by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Pedimana.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Aie-aie</hi> among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> appears to possess the same faculty. Among the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoopiiaga</hi> the great toe remains always conjoined with
                    and parallel to the others; and in the canine and feline genera it is
                    obliterated. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> that of the beaver is
                    nearly equal to the other toes; those of the marmot, porcupine, and the murine
                    genus, are shorter; in the paca it is almost obliterated; it is reduced to a
                    single bone in the Cape gerboa; and the leporine genus have no trace of it. In
                    the cavy, agouti, and guinea-pig, the great and small toes are each reduced to
                    one bone. In the gerboa <hi rend="italic">(mus jaculus)</hi> and alactaga <hi
                    rend="italic">(mus</hi><hi rend="italic">sagitta)</hi> the three middle
                    metatarsal bones are united into a single one similar to the cannon bone of the
                    Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula</hi>; and while the two lateral
                    toes are distinct, though short, in the former animal, they are obliterated
                    altogether in the latter.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> the ant-eater, <hi rend="italic"
                    >oτycteropus,</hi> pangolin, and armadillo, have five toes, of which the great
                    is the shortest in all. In the sloth the great and small toe are reduced to one
                    small bone. The other metatarsal bones are united at their base. The toes have
                    only two phalanges, of which the unguinal are the largest.</p>
                <p>In the subsequent, families the metatarsal bones deserve particular attention, In
                    the elephant and <hi rend="smallcaps">Pach yder-mata,</hi> their tarsal
                    extremity has a flat surface, and the phalangeal consists of a convex tubercle,
                    which presents below a prominent line in the middle of the bone. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Solidun</hi><hi rend="superscript
                    smallcaps"> t</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">gula</hi> this line is above and below
                    both. In the Ruminants, in which the cannon bone consists of the two metatarsal
                    bones, the line of union is represented by a deep line like the tract of a saw.
                    The elephant has 5 perfect toes; the hog 4; the tapir and rhinoceros 3; the
                    Ruminants have two perfect toes on one metatarsal bone, and two small ones
                    attached behind its .base, lhe ðo- <hi rend="smallcaps">lidungula</hi> have one
                    perfect toe, and two imperfect, which are reduced to a single styloid bone. In
                    these animals the body is supported in walking by the last or unguinal phalanx
                    alone; and hence the term <hi rend="italic">foot</hi> is not cf the same import
                    as in the human subject and animals similarly constructed. While indeed man
                    supports his person in progression on the <hi rend="italic">os</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">calcis</hi> and the posteι ior. or metatarsal phalanges, in the
                    other mammiferous animals the former bone touches not the ground, but is always
                    elevated above it a considerable height. All the .zoophagous or unguiculated
                    animals, excepting the plantigrade, support themselves chiefly on the unguinal
                    and middle phalanges both of the fore and hind foot; and neither the posterior
                    <hi rend="italic">phalanges</hi> nor the <hi rend="italic">calcaneum</hi> touch
                    the ground, as is easily demonstrated on observing the gait of the hedgehog,
                    dog, fox, cat, or similar individuals of the same family. The animals
                    distinguished by the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plantigrade</hi> are believed
                    to support themselves on the entire foot. But though the foot is certainly
                    spread on the ground more freely than in those already mentioned, by the bear,
                    glutton, badger, and others, it appears that not the heel, but the <hi
                    rend="italic">metatarsus,</hi> is allowed to touch the ground in progression. In
                    the Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> as already mentioned,
                    the only part of the foot which is applied to the ground is the unguinal
                    phalanx; and it is well known that the horse supports himself on the plantar
                    surface of the coffin bone only.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in the Amphibious Mammals, while the extreme brevity of the <hi
                    rend="italic">humerus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">femur</hi> unfit them for
                    progression on land without extreme awkwardness and difficulty, the expanded
                    shape and oblique position of the metacarpal bones and phalanges, the length of
                    the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">fibula,</hi> and the
                    greater length of the first and last than the middle metatarsal phalanges, all
                    concur to give these animals great facility in swimming. (Cuvier, <hi
                    rend="italic">Ossemens</hi><hi rend="italic">Fossiles,</hi> tome V. partie i.
                    septième partie.) In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> again, while the
                    total want of pelvic extremities renders motion on land quite impracticable, the
                    fin-like disposition of the metacarpus and metacarpal phalanges, with the great
                    strength of the lumbar, and the length of the coccygeal vertebrae, peculiarly
                    qualify them for locomotion in the waters.</p>

                <p>In this table the most remarkable circumstance is the great number of ćervical
                    vertebrae, which are much more numerous than in the Mammalia. They vary from 9,
                    the number in the sparrow, to 23, which is that of the cervical vertebrae of the
                    swan. The most common number is 11, which is that of 10 <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera.</hi> The next most frequent is 12, 13, and 14, which are equally the
                    numbers of 9 <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi> The next is 15, which is that of 8;
                    10 occurs in 6, 18 in 4, and 16 in 3. In the stork and crane they are 19.</p>
                <p>The next remarkable circumstance is, that the dorsal or costal vertebrae are
                    greatly fewer than in the Mammalia, never exceeding the number of ll,.and being
                    more frequently about 7 or 8. Thus, while they arc 11 in the cassowary, swan,
                    and sheldrake, 10 in the goose, bernacle, and grebe, and 9 in the sparrow, lark,
                    humming-bird, parrot, crane, avoset, oyster-catcher, cormorant, and blackdiver,
                    they are 7 or 8 in all the other <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> and only 6 in
                    the bullfinch. , , <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> '</p>
                <p>’ There are no lumbar vertebrae strictly so named, for those which extend from
                    the chest to thė' tail are· consolidated into one piece with the iliac'bones.
                    The tail, which iŝ short, consists of from 7 to 9 vertebrae.</p>
                <p>j The part most variable in proportional length is the neck. It is .so much
                    .longer as-the feet areelevatcd, except in some of the swimmers, in which it is
                    greatly longer, because they require to seek their food below the surface of the
                    waters on which they float.</p>
                <p>The bodies of the cervical vertebrae are articulated not by plane facettes, which
                    would admit obscure motion only, but by portions of cylinders, which allow
                    extensive motion. The 3d, 4th, or 5th superior vertebrae allow of anterior
                    inflection only, and the others of posterior inflection. This gives the necks of
                    birds an alternate serpentine in-flectiön; and it is by rendering the two
                    arches, of which this curvature consists, straight or convex, that the animal
                    elongates or shortens his neck. The articular processes of the superior
                    vertebrae are directed upwards and downwards; those of the lower are turned
                    anteriorly and posteriorly.</p>
                <p>Instead of transverse processes, the cervical vertebrae of birds are provided
                    with a tubercle above, and the anterior extremity of which terminates in a
                    narrow style, descending parallel to the body of the vertebra.</p>
                <p>Only the most superior and inferior vertebrae have distinct spinous processes,
                    and these have anterior as well as posterior ones. The middle ones have before
                    two crests, which form a half-canal, and.behind a tubercle, often bifid, or,
                    when they are elongated, two rough lines. The atlas, which is articulated with
                    the occipital bone by a single facette, has the shape of a minute ring.</p>
                <p>As the neck of birds is movable, the back is fixed. The spinous processes of
                    these vertebrae are in mutual contact, and they are connected by strong
                    ligaments. Most of these processes are generally consolidated into a single
                    continuous crest, extending along the whole back. The extremities of the
                    transverse processes terminate in two <hi rend="italic">apices,</hi> one
                    directed forwards, the other backwards; and occasionally they are consolidated
                    into a continuous mass like the spinous. That this arrangement is requisite for
                    the trunk to remain fixed during the violent motions which take place in flying,
                    is rendered probable by the fact, that in birds which do not fly, as the ostrich
                    and cassowary, the spinal column retains its mobility.</p>
                <p>The last dorsal vertebrae are often placed on the crest of the iliac bones, and
                    they are then united, as the lumbar, on the large piece of the iliac bones, from
                    which it results that the number of vertebrae can often be estimated in no other
                    mode than by that of the holes of the nerves which issue from the chord.</p>
                <p>The caudal vertebrae are most numerous in the species which move the tail with
                    most energy; for instance, the magpie and swallow. They have spinous processes
                    below as well as above, and very long transverse processes. The last of all, to
                    which the pinions are attached, is longest, and has the shape of a ploughshare
                    or a compressed quoit. In the cassowary, which has no visible tai), the last
                    bone is conical; in the peacock, on the contrary it has the shape of an oval
                    plate, situate horizontally.</p>
                <p>It was early observed by the original zoologist and traveller Pierre Belon, that
                    the <hi rend="italic">crania</hi> of birds were void of sutures; and that in a
                    few only were these lines of distinction into separate bones recognised. The
                    explanation of this peculiarity is found in the history of the ossification of
                    the head in young birds, which shows that the cranium consists at that period of
                    separate bones, corresponding in number and situation to those of quadrupeds.
                    Thus, there are two frontal bones, which are continued forwards to form the
                    vault of the orbits; two small parietal bones behind the frontal; a temporal
                    bone on each side of thė ścull; a sphenoid united to the occipital, even in
                    subjects in which the other sütures are distinct; or a sphe∏o-occipital bone,
                    which is early united with the temporal.' ,</p>
                <p>These sutures, however, are distinctly seen only in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095717?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5717-0012"/> young birds
                    and those recently hatched; for the bones are very early united, and in the
                    adult bird the cranial sutures are invariably obliterated. Thus, in the domestic
                    fowl and turkey the scull is one piece; and the only trace of suture that
                    remains is a linear depression in the middle of the frontal bone, indicating the
                    original formation in two halves. In the recently hatched bird, also, the
                    sphenoid is separated from the occipital bone by a transverse suture, extending
                    from the one ear to the other. The occipital bone is at the same time a ring,
                    consisting of four parts; a superior, two lateral, and an inferior which is
                    small. The sphenoid, which forms the greater part of the base of the cranium, is
                    nearly trilateral, with a small anterior process, to which the palatine arches
                    are articulated. It has no pterygoid processes, and does not touch the posterior
                    aperture of the nostrils. The temporal bone, though void of zygomatic process,
                    has a pointed style, which contributes to form the posterior margin of the
                    orbit. The frontal bone, after covering part of the cranium, is continued
                    forwards in a broad, thin plate, which forms the vault of the orbits, while
                    these cavities are separated by a thin vertical bony plate which descends at
                    right angles from the frontal bone, and is connected behind with the sphenoid.
                    The long eminences observed on the heads of the cassowary, curlew, pintado, and
                    some species of hocco, are produced from this supraorbital part of the frontal
                    bone; and their interior, which consists of loose <hi rend="italic">diploe,</hi>
                    communicates with that of the same bone.</p>
                <p>The face in birds is rarely so firmly consolidated as the cranium. It is composed
                    of two lacrymal bones, forming the anterior margins of the orbits, and united on
                    the mesial plane; two nasal bones anterior to the lacrymal; two bones
                    corresponding to the superior maxillary, and forming the external lateral parts
                    of the upper half of the bill; two inter-maxillary bones; two anterior palate
                    bones, corresponding to those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>; two
                    posterior palate. bones corresponding to the pterygoid processes of the
                    sphenoid; and the lower jaw a paraboloid bone, consisting of twortrøi united
                    before, where they are covered by the horn of the lower half of the bill.
                    Besides these, there is in the whole class an irregular-shaped bone, common to
                    the Cranium and lower jaw, and connecting these two together. This bone, which
                    has been rather improperly named the square, quadrangular, or quadrilateral bone
                    <hi rend="italic">(os</hi><hi rend="italic">quadratum),</hi> consists of a body
                    with curvilinear hollow margins, terminating in two elevated and rather pointed
                    processes, one of which is connected with the cavity named <hi rend="italic"
                    >tympanum,</hi> while the other, projecting into the orbit, affords attachment
                    to several muscles. The anomalous character of this bone has perplexed several
                    of the most distinguished zootomists; and while Geoffroy gives it the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">os Tympano-styloideum,</hi> Spix considers it analogous to the
                    annular process of the temporal bone, which in the human foetus is separate; and
                    Carus regards it as representing the <hi rend="italic">incus,</hi> to which it
                    bears a remote resemblance in shape and in one of its connections.</p>
                <p>Both <hi rend="italic">maxillae</hi> are void of teeth; but the hard, horny
                    matter of the bill covering the margins and extremities of each jaw, and
                    constituting the mandibles <hi rend="italic">(mandibula),</hi> is manifestly
                    constructed to perform for <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> what teeth do for the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> But the most remarkable peculiarity of the,
                    facial bones of this class is, that the upper jaw admits of more or less motion.
                    In the majority of instances this is effected by the jaw being united to the
                    cranium by means of thin, flexible, elastic, bony plates; but in the parrot
                    family the upper jaw is entirely distinct, and is connected by a proper
                    articulation.</p>
                <p>The base of the palatine surface of the upper jaw is divided into 4 branches,
                    which diverge backwards. The two external ones, which correspond to the
                    zygomatic arches of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and which are very
                    slender, are articulated to the quadrangular bone which moves on the temporal
                    before the ear. The two intermediate ones, which have been already stated to
                    correspond to the pterygoid processes, and which are parallel, are placed
                    beneath the septum of the orbits, and are articulated by their posterior
                    extremities with a small bone, variable in shape, but named <hi rend="italic"
                    >omoîd</hi> by Hérissant, which is also articulated with the quadrilateral. From
                    this arrangement results a singular species of broken lever, not dissimilar to
                    the parallel joint of the piston and lever of the steam-engine, and the effect
                    of which is, that whenever the lower jaw is depressed by its proper muscles, it
                    necessarily causes the quadrilateral bone to perform a slight rotatory motion,
                    in consequence of which, by means of the omoid bone, the upper jaw is at the
                    same time elevated on the elastic plates; and as soon as the lower jaw is
                    raised, the elasticity of these plates forces down the superior one.</p>
                <p>The upper jaw is immovable in a few instances only, and of these the <hi
                    rend="italic">calao</hi> or rhinoceros bird is one.</p>
                <p>The breast bone <hi rend="italic">(sternum)</hi> is a trilateral, boat-shaped
                    bone, concave internally, convex with a middle longitudinal crest externally,
                    with the base of the triangle above, and the apex, which is also incurvated
                    backwards, below. The middle longitudinal crest, which is occasionally named the
                    keel <hi rend="italic">(carina),</hi> is shaped something like a spherical
                    triangle, with the broadest side above, the base before, and the apex behind;
                    and its prominence forms large spaces on each side for the attachment of the
                    pectoral and other muscles used in flight. In the male wild swan <hi
                    rend="italic">(anas cygnus),</hi> in some sjpecies of curlew, in the crane, and
                    in the guinea-fowl, this crest forms a cavity for the reception of the windpipe.
                    In the ostrich and cassowary, which do not fly, the sternum is void of crest,
                    and is merely arched strongly.</p>
                <p>The ribs, which rarely exceed 10 pairs, may be distinguished into
                    sterno-vertebral and vertebral. Though the latter are generally before, they are
                    sometimes also behind. The vertebral end terminates in two diverging processes,
                    one of which is articulated with the vertebral body, the other with the
                    transverse process. The sternal extremity consists of a bony process, which
                    performs the part of the sterno-costal cartilages of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> by uniting the rib to the sternum. The ribs of birds, however,
                    are further distinguished by presenting near their middle a flat long process,
                    projecting from the rib backwards at an acute angle, and resting on the rib
                    immediately below, so that each rib is supported not only on the vertebrae and
                    sternum, or the vertebrae alone, but on the next rib below. These processes are
                    obliterated in the lower ribs.</p>
                <p>The coxal bones constitute one piece with the sacrum and lumbar vertebrae. The
                    ischial portion is united with the sacrum, and the ischiatic notch is converted
                    into a hole. The part which corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">os pubis</hi>
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> is not consolidated before so as to
                    form a symphysis, but proceeding directly backwards, terminates in a styloid
                    process, variable in length and slenderness. The only exception to this mode of
                    structure occurs in the ostrich, in which the pubal bones are united below. The
                    infra-pubal or oval hole is present in the whole class notwithstanding. It is
                    worthy of remark, however, that in young birds this and the ischial aperture are
                    still notches, in consequence of the deficient ossification of the parts.</p>
                <p>The direction of the <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> in birds is nearly that of the
                    spine, that is, obliquely backwards, and deviating but little from the
                    horizontal line.</p>
                <p>The wings or thoracic extremities are connected to the trunk by three bones, the
                    collar-bone or clavicle, the <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> and the bifurcated
                    bone. The collar-bones, which <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095730?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5730-0013"/> are straight, strong, and cylindrical, are
                    articulated by a large head with the anterior and lateral part of the sternum,
                    in which its motion is rather limited. It forms before and laterally two short
                    processes, one anterior-inferior and internal, articulated with the bifurcated
                    bone; the other posterior-superior and external, uniting with the scapula, and
                    forming a cavity, in which the head of the <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi> is
                    lodged. ’</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> is a long bone, flattened, but narrow, and
                    slightly incurvated, with the convex side turned towards the spine, to which it
                    is nearly parallel in position. The head or anterior extremity is thick and
                    extensive, oblique from before backwards, and is articulated behind with the
                    clavicle, before with the <hi rend="italic">humerus.</hi> The free extremity is
                    thin, flattened, and sharp. The whole bone is not dissimilar in shape to a
                    scimitar.</p>
                <p>Besides these, which <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> possess in common with the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> we find an azygous bone, situate on the
                    mesial plane, denominated in ordinary language the <hi rend="italic">Merry
                    thought,</hi> and, from its shape, the fork-like or bifurcated bone. It consists
                    of two long, rounded, converging branches, united at an acute angle, and forming
                    a broad process, flat in the vertical direction, and by which it is articulated
                    to the anterior extremity of the crest or carinated part of the breast-bone. To
                    the posterior or free extremities of the divergent branches are articulated the
                    humeral ends of the collar-bones, which are thus enabled to sustain the violent
                    motions of the humerus during flight. The branches of the bifurcated bone are
                    separate in the ostrich, and each is united with the clavicle and <hi
                    rend="italic">scapula of</hi> the same side, so that the three bones form only
                    one, much flattened, and with a hole towards the sternal extremity. In the
                    cassowary the bifurcated bone is reduced to a mere rudimental process at the
                    inner margin of the head of the clavicle. From these facts it results, that the
                    bifurcated bone is particularly useful in the energetic and continued efforts of
                    the wings in flight, and not only serves to keep the clavicles apart, but, by
                    lengthening the distance between the collar-bones and sternum, enables the
                    animal to use a longer lever. It is freest, strongest, and most elastic in the
                    birds which fly best. In birds which do not fly, and which use the wings merely
                    to sustain the equilibrium, as the ostrich and cassowary, it is reduced to
                    almost nothing, or it is in such a rudimental and imperfect form, that it cannot
                    keep the collar-bones apart.</p>
                <p>The bones of the thoracic extremities, or those of the wings, correspond in
                    general to those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> They consist of a
                    single cylindrical humerus, articulated with the <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi>
                    and collar-bone above, two bones of the fore wing corresponding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">radius,</hi> two bones of the <hi
                    rend="italic">carpus,</hi> two of the <hi rend="italic">metacarpus,</hi>
                    consolidated by their extremities, one styloid bone as a thumb, a long finger
                    consisting of two <hi rend="italic">phalanges,</hi> and a short one consisting
                    of one. The thumb supports the bastard pinions, the large finger and <hi
                    rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> the primaries, while the small one, which is
                    covered by the skin, is destitute. In several of the webfooted divers, for
                    instance the duck and penguin <hi rend="italic">(alca im-pennis</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">spheniscus),</hi> these bones are flattened like thin plates.</p>
                <p>In the pelvic extremities the thigh-bone is provided with one trochanter only, is
                    shorter than that of the leg, and is almost invariably straight; and is arched
                    only in the cormorant, duck, and dobchick. In the ostrich its diameter is about
                    four times that of the <hi rend="italic">humerus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >tibia</hi> differs from that of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> chiefly
                    at its lower extremity. While the <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> adheres to it
                    like a slender appendage as far as the middle, the tarsal extremity terminates
                    in two trochlear condyles, with an intermediate pulley-like groove. The <hi
                    rend="italic">tarsus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">metatarsus</hi> are represented
                    by a single bone of considerable length, and the head or tibial end of which
                    consists of a middle prominence and two lateral depressions, and which,
                    therefore, <hi rend="subscript"> χ</hi> moves in cardinal opposition, but does
                    not admit of extension beyond the straight line. Though variable in proportion
                    to the length in different orders, this bone is very long in the order <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Grallae</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">(Grallatores).</hi> It
                    terminates below in 3 pulley-shaped processes, to which are attached the bones
                    of the 3 anterior toes, with an internal margin for that of the great toe. In
                    the ostrich there are 2 processes only, corresponding to the two toes. In the
                    penguin tribe, however, the <hi rend="italic">tarsus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >metatarsus</hi> consist of 3 bones, separate from each other in the middle, but
                    united at the tibial and digital extremities. To the tarso-metatarsal bone of
                    the cock, and others of the Gallinaceous tribe, is attached the spur, a conical
                    pointed excrescence of hard horny matter.</p>
                <p>SECT. III.—OSTEOLOGY OF THE REPTILES.</p>
                <p>The number of vertebrae, and all the other attributes of the spinal column, vary
                    more in this class than in all the others.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi> or Tortoise family there are 7
                    cervical, 8 dorsal, connected with the shell in an immovable piece, so as to
                    have neither processes nor articular facettes; from 3 to 5 lumbar and sacral,·
                    consolidated in like manner; and about 20 caudal or coccygeal. (Plate XXXIV.
                    fig. 5.)</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> or Lizard tribe, the number 7
                    predominates in the cervical, being that of the crocodile and most lizards. In
                    several, however, there are 8, as in two of the monitor genus, the American
                    safeguard, the lizard of Fontainebleau, the dragon, the iguana, the anolis, and
                    the gecko and seine; and in a few, as the Nilotic monitor, and an undetermined
                    species of monitor, they amount to 9. In the chameleon there are only 5 cervical
                    vertebrae. Here, however, a singular peculiarity is observed. Instead of the
                    cervical vertebrae being, as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    distinguished by being unconnected with ribs, to those, from the third to the
                    seventh inclusive, short ribs, unconnected with the sternum, are attached. The
                    <hi rend="italic">atlas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">axis,</hi> therefore, alone
                    are proper <hi rend="italic">cervical</hi> vertebrae; but the general analogy is
                    observed in the cervical ribs being exceedingly short and almost rudimental. The
                    dorsal vary from 11, which is that of the crocodile and iguana, to 29 and 30,
                    which are the numbers in the New Holland seine and Nilotic monitor. In the
                    American safeguard, <hi rend="italic">cordy-lus,</hi> stellio, crested basilisk,
                    dragon, guana, and great anolis, they are 16; in the chameleon, black safeguard,
                    and ameiva, 17; in the tupinambis, spotted gecko, and golden seine, 18; in the
                    green lizard and spotted guana <hi rend="italic">(poly-chrus)</hi> 19; in the
                    Fontainebleau and gray lizard 20; 21 in the Levant seine and undetermined
                    monitor; and 22 in the Java and New Holland monitor.</p>
                <p>TheBATRACHoiD or Ranine reptiles are void of ribs, and it is impossible therefore
                    to distinguish the first three orders of vertebrae from each other. In general,
                    however, there are from the nape to <hi rend="italic">¢ae pelvis</hi> 8
                    vertebrae, all provided with long transverse processes, and which are longest in
                    the last. The <hi rend="italic">sacrum</hi> is represented by a long flattened
                    but pointed bone, without <hi rend="italic">coccyx.</hi> In the Surinam toad <hi
                    rend="italic">(rana pipa)</hi> the last vertebra is consolidated with this bone;
                    and the transverse processes of the second and third vertebrae are so much
                    larger than the others, that they resemble rudimental ribs. In the Salamander
                    family there are from the head to the sacrum 14 vertebrae, all alike in shape
                    except the first, which receives the occipital bone, and the last, which is
                    articulated with the sacrum. These two are distinguished by wanting rudimental
                    ribs, which are small elongated bones, movable, and articulated with the trans
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095743?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5743-0014"/>
                    verse processes,'which are directed backwards. The articular processes are large
                    and imbricated, the posterior resting on the anterior, so as to resist the
                    motion of the spine backwards. The sacrum consists of one vertebra only, but the
                    coecyx or tail is composed of 27.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> tribe the vertebrae may be said to
                    attain the most extensive numerical developement. With the exception of the head
                    and rudimental ribs, they constitute the whole skeleton. (Fig. 3.) From the head
                    to the tail their shape is the same, and may be distinguished into body,
                    articular and transverse spinous processes. In some speeies, for instance the
                    <hi rend="italic">boa,</hi> the spinous processes of the back are so mueh
                    separated as to allow mutual motion to a considerable extent. In others,
                    conversely, for instance the rattlesnake, these processes are so long and broad
                    as to toueh each other, while the oblique proeesses, which form their bases, are
                    imbrieated over each other. In eonsequence of this arrangement the motion of the
                    spine is limited behind, but more extensive on the ventral surface. The
                    vertebral bodies, wlιieh move easily on each other, are provided with a sharp
                    spine directed towards the tail, which somewhat limits motion in this
                    direction.</p>
                <p>The first vertebra differs from those of the rest of the body in supporting short
                    or rudimental ribs; there are therefore no cervieal vertebrae and no proper neck
                    in the serpent family. The caudal vertebrae are distinguished by not supporting
                    ribs, and by their spines both dorsal and ventral being double, and forming two
                    rows of tubereles. The articulation of the bodies of these vertebrae is
                    peculiar. On the anterior part of the body is a round hemispherical tubercle,
                    while the posterior presents a corresponding eavity, so that eaeh vertebra forms
                    a cup and ball joint with the following one.</p>
                <p>The number of eostal vertebrae varies from 32, whieh is that of the blind worm
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anguis fragilis),</hi> to 204 in the ringed snake (<hi
                    rend="italic">Coluber</hi><hi rend="italic">natrix),</hi> 244 in the snake, and
                    252 in the <hi rend="italic">Boa constrictor,</hi> and whieh is perhaps the
                    greatest known number. Of intermediate numbers, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amphisbaena</hi> has 54, the viper <hi rend="italic">(Coluber berus)</hi> has
                    139, the rattlesnake 175, and the cobra di eapello 192. The eaudal vertebrae
                    vary in number from 7, whieh is that of the <hi rend="italic">Ampkisboena,</hi>
                    to 112, which is that of the <hi rend="italic">Coluber</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >natrix.</hi> Of intermediate numbers, the blind worm has 17, the rattlesnake
                    26, the boa 52, the viper 55, and the eobra 63; from which it appears that the
                    number of the eaudal is not in proportion to that of the eostal vertebrae.</p>
                <p>Of the heads of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniads,</hi> the most remarkable
                    charaeters are, that the facial line is horizontal, and quite continuous with
                    the eranial line; that the orbits, though complete without, are continuous
                    behind with the temporal fossae; that the parietal and occipital bones are
                    compressed laterally, while the latter terminates above in a sharp spine,
                    projecting behind. The oecipito-parietal and occipito-temporal sutures are
                    distinet. The eranial eavity is small compared with the volume of the scull.</p>
                <p>These characters are not less remarkable in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lacertine</hi> Reptiles. The cranium of a eroeodile
                    measuring from 13 to 14 feet is scarcely capaeious enough to admit the thumb;
                    and Cuvier estimates the area of the cranial section, whieh is oblong, at about
                    ģ¾ of that of the whole head. In these animals, indeed, the bones of the
                    superior and inferior jaws are so mueh prolonged, and occupy so large a
                    proportion of the head, that small space is left for the proper eranial eavity,
                    which indeed is an immediate continuation of the vertebral. In these animals,
                    also, the anatomist can traee, much more distinetly than in the more perfect,
                    the resemblanee between the cranial bones and the vertebral. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniads,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi>
                    especially, the occipital bone is very distinctly a cephalic vertebra.</p>
                <p>Still more manifest is this arrangement in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Batrachoid</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi>
                    or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> Reptiles. In the former, as exemplified in
                    the frog, the occipital bone, whieh forms the posterior cranial vertebra,
                    consists of four pieees, and has two artieular proeesses. The middle eranial
                    vertebra is represented by the parietal bones above and the posterior part of
                    the sphenoid below, while between it and the oeeipital or posterior is contained
                    the temporal as the organ of hearing. The third or anterior cranial vertebra is
                    represented by the anterior part cf the sphenoid bone below and the two narrow
                    frontal bones above. The ſaee, which may be regarded as the organ of the senses,
                    is elongated anterior to the head, somewhat after the manner of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi> family; while an approximation to the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is indieated in the artieulation of the lower jaw,
                    which is connected to the head by the intervention of a quadrilateral bone.</p>
                <p>In the Serpentine family, the eranium of which is very similar in other rcspeets,
                    the most remarkable deviation is in the want of ethmoid bone. .The lower jaw is
                    connected to the eranium by an intermediate bone, corresponding to the
                    quadrilateral, but of an oblong shape, and something like a eollar-bone.</p>
                <p>The ehest of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptile</hi> elass varies mueh in the mode
                    of formation. While true ribs are recognised in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Saurial</hi> family only, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Batraciioið</hi> reptiles
                    have a sternum without ribs, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> ribs
                    without sternum, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniad</hi> ribs united into
                    the dorsal shell, and a sternum expanded into the abdominal one.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family the ribs correspond in number to
                    that of the eostal vertebrae already mentioned, that is, 12 in the crocodile and
                    iguana, two of whieh are not connected to the sternum, 17 in the chameleon, 18
                    in the tupinambis, and 27 in the monitor. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi>
                    reptiles, however, are peculiar in having from 1 to 6 ribs attached to the
                    eervieal vertebrae, and the opposite ends of whieh are not connected to the <hi
                    rend="italic">sternum.</hi> These, which have been named eervieal ribs, form a
                    transition to the rudimental ribs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi>
                    family, which are larger in the neek than elsewhere. The sternum of the
                    croeodile consists of two parts,—an anterior or thoracic, which is osseous,
                    supporting the two collar-bones,—and a posterior or abdominal, whieh is
                    cartilaginous, and extends to the <hi rend="italic">pubis,</hi> and furnishing
                    to the abdominal parietes eight cyhndrieal eartilages. In the East India
                    eroeodile it appears that these lateral processes are converted into a single
                    broad piece of cartilage on eaeh side. (Fig. 4.)</p>
                <p>The ribs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniad</hi> family are represented by
                    the dorsal shell, whieh consists of eight broad incurvated plates, identified
                    behind with the dorsal vertebrae, and terminating before in the margin of the
                    shell, and which are doubtless genuine ribs. In the ordinary land-tortoise <hi
                    rend="italic">(Testudo</hi><hi rend="italic">Groeca)</hi> these are seen in the
                    shape of elevated bonyridges, proceeding from the head of eaeh rib in
                    atrans-verse coneave bend to the margin of the dorsal shell. On each side of
                    these ridges the bone is depressed, and is united at its lowest point by a
                    genuine suture with the adjoining ones. These sutures, however, are not
                    continuous with those of the sterno-abdominal shell, but meet it in the
                    intermediate points. (Fig. 5.) The sterno-abdominal shell consists, in like
                    manner, of several transverse pieces consolidated into one. The ordinary number
                    is eight on each side of the mesial plane, and a ninth azygous, generally plaeed
                    in the eentre of the shell. In a speeimen, however, of the tabular tortoise (<hi
                    rend="italic">Testudo tabulata),</hi> in our possession, the number of the
                    sterno-abdominal pieces is 11, of which 8 are in pairs, united on the mesial
                    line from before backwards, and 3 azygous at the posterior tip of the shell. In
                    young animals it is easy to recognise the unions of these constituent bones,
                    which consist of suturesex-actly<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095756?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5756-0015"/> similar to
                    those of the cranium in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> So feeble is the
                    union, that it often happens that the ab- <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> dominai
                    shell especially separates at the lines of junction, in the attempt to detach it
                    from'the dorsal.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Batraciioid Reptiles,</hi> though void of ribs, are
                    provided with a <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi> which before is a cartilaginous
                    process, terminating on a disc placed below the larynx, where it receives the
                    collar-bones, and forms behind a broad plate placed below the abdomen, and
                    giving attachment to the muscles. In the Salamander tribe, which are without <hi
                    rend="italic">stermιm,</hi> the ribs consist of twelve pair of small rudimental
                    processes, articulated with the vertebrae, but admitting of very limited
                    motion.</p>
                <p>Lastly, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> family, though there is no
                    sternum, the upper vertebrae are provided with costal processes, quite
                    rudimental. The great number of these costal rudiments, amounting in the
                    rattlesnake to 175, in the <hi rend="italic">cobra di capello</hi> to 192, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">coluber</hi><hi rend="italic">natrix</hi> to 204, and in
                    the <hi rend="italic">boa constrictor</hi> to 252, and the freedom oí their
                    anterior extremities, enable the animals of this tribe, which are destitute of
                    locomotive members, thoracic or abdominal, to employ the spinal column and the
                    ribs as organs of progressive motion. On this point the reader will find some
                    interesting observations by Sir Everard Home <hi rend="italic">(Phil.
                    Trans.</hi> 1812, p. 163). In the region of the neck, where the ribs acquire
                    peculiar length, they are employed in erecting that region, and producing the
                    expansive swelling peculiar to this tribe of animals. It is an important link in
                    the same series of facts, that in the animal absurdly named the flying lizard
                    <hi rend="italic">(draco</hi><hi rend="italic">volans),</hi> the five posterior
                    ribs are recurvated and elongated to form the bony skeleton of the membranous
                    sails by which the animal supports itself in its desultory flight from tree to
                    tree.</p>
                <p>It is in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family that the locomotive
                    extremities of Reptiles ought first to be studied. In these we -find an
                    elongated <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi> without spine, and one short flat bone,
                    constituting the clavicle, united to the sternum. In the iguana and chameleon
                    this bone is broad and nearly quadrilateral, while in the tupinambis it is large
                    and oval-šhaped, with its greatest length from before backwards, •and with two
                    unossified points.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> tribe, while the <hi rend="italic"
                    >scapula</hi> consists of two articulated pieces, the upper towards the spine,
                    each shoulder is provided with two collar-bones attached to the two extremities
                    of the sternum, and the two anterior of which correspond to the bifurcated bone
                    of birds. The <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi> collar-bone, and first part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi> form one piece. In the salamander, in which the
                    same consolidation is observed, the scapular portion is most distinct and
                    directed to the spine, while of the clavicular portion the part connected to the
                    sternum stretches below the chest, but, without uniting with that of the
                    opposite side, the right glides over the left,—an arrangement which facilitates
                    the dilatation of the chest during inspiration.</p>
                <p>A nearer approach still to the bifureated bone than is seen in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> may be recognised in theCHELONiAD family. In these
                    animals three bones are united to form the humeral cavity. The first is a flat,
                    trilateral bone, situate below the abdominal and thoracic <hi rend="italic"
                    >viscera,</hi> close to the abdominal shell, and which, notwithstanding its
                    situation, is evidently the <hi rend="italic">scapula.</hi> The second is a bone
                    about the same length, flat, and like the feather of an oar at one extremity,
                    which is free, round in the middle, and flattened in the opposite direction at
                    the other end, which is firmly united at a right angle to a long slender
                    cylindrical bone. At the angle of union of these two bones is part of the
                    glenoid cavity, which is complete in the small end of the scapula. The first of
                    the two bones is the collarbone proper; the second is the lateral branch of the
                    bone, which forms the bifurcated, and which is occasionally united with its fe

                    itself into the atmosphere. This animal, which, like the dragon <hi
                    rend="italic">(draco</hi><hi rend="italic">volans)</hi> of modern times, must
                    have combined the contradictory characters of a flying reptile, may be regarded
                    as forming the link between the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> does
                    between <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi>
                    family it is remarkable that the pubal and iliac bones appear to change places.
                    Thus the <hi rend="italic">ilium</hi> on each side is a narrow bone proceeding
                    backwards to the sacral part of the spine, which is received between its
                    posterior aperture; while the <hi rend="italic">pubis</hi> appears in the shape
                    of a broad, trilateral, flat bone, uniting before with its fellow on the mesial
                    plane, behind with the <hi rend="italic">ilium,</hi> and below with a flat,
                    thin, quadrilateral bone, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">ischium,</hi>
                    with which it forms the oval aperture. The inner of these three bones presents,
                    as usual, the cotyloid cavity. It is further to be observed, that the two iliac
                    bones, and consequently the whole <hi rend="italic">pelvis,</hi> are movable on
                    the vertebral column. (Plate XXXIV. fig· 5∙)</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> Reptiles the pelvic bones are arranged
                    and shaped nearly as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad.</hi> In the <hi

                    elongated, and the pubal and ischial are consolidated into one piece, the
                    symphysis of which forms a rounded crest.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">The femur</hi> is short, thick, and incurvated sinuously, with
                    the convexity before towards the tibial end, and the concavity towards the

                    are wanting in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ranine</hi> Reptiles. In the leg we find both <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">fibula</hi> distinct, and of nearly equal size, in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family,
                    but conjoined in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> family. The <hi
                    rend="italic">tarsus</hi> consists of five bones, and sustains four or five
                    metatarsal ones, on which are supported three rows of phalanges. The metatarsal
                    bones, which vary in length, are longest in the crocodile and others of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Lacertine</hi> tribe. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine,</hi>
                    again, the <hi rend="italic">astragalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >calcaneum</hi> are the bones of greatest proportional length.</p>
                <p>The anatomical characters now enumerated are proper to the skeletons of Reptiles
                    at present existing on the surface of the earth or in its waters; and in these
                    we find a gradual transition from the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,</hi> by means of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Serpentine,</hi> to the finny inhabitants of the ocean. Even the <hi

                    the Fish, in having at once lungs or internal respiratory cells, and gills or

                    strongly demonstrated in the osteological characters of two <hi rend="italic"
                    >Genera</hi> of animals now extinct, so far as is yet known,—the <hi

                <p>From the specimens of the <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> hitherto
                    discovered, it appears that the number of vertebrae varies from 80 to 90 or
                    more; in one entire specimen they amounted to 104 (Conybeare and De la Beche);
                    that they are flattened, with the transverse diameter greater than the
                    longitudinal, and the two articulating surfaces of the bodies calycoid or
                    cup-shaped as in Fishes. Though the annular <hi rend="superscript"> 3</hi> part
                    is distinct from the body, it is united to its sides. The spinous processes,
                    which are long and prominent, form a continuous ridge above the spine, and are
                    connected to each other by a process from the front of the one spine, which is
                    inserted into a pit in the back of the other. Instead of proper transverse
                    process, a certain number of the vertebrae are provided with two tubercles on
                    each side of the body, of which the superior, convex, is articulated to the
                    tubercle of the rib, while the other, which is concave, receives the head. In
                    the inferior part of the vertebral column, these two tubercles, after
                    approximating, are eventually identified into one.</p>
                <p>The ribs, which are numerous, and extend from the <hi rend="italic">occiput</hi>
                    to the <hi rend="italic">pelvis,</hi> are slender and trilateral in shape,
                    bifurcated above, and attached to the vertebrae by a head and tubercle. In the
                    perfect specimen of Mr de la Beche they amount to 31, and of these 17 appear to
                    be cervical or anterior false ribs, with single tubercles; thus affording
                    another mark of resemblance to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> family in
                    osteological characters.</p>
                <p>The bones of the head, distinguished by the extraordinary size of the orbit, are
                    similar to those of the Saurial Reptiles. The <hi rend="italic">sternum,</hi>
                    collar-bone, and scapula, though also similar to those of this family, bear a
                    much closer resemblance to the figure of these parts in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ornithorhyncus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                    >humerus</hi> is short, thick, and sinuated; the bones of the fore arm flat, and
                    probably constituting part of the fore or thoracic fin. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >Carpus</hi> consists of three rows, the first containing three bones, the other
                    two, four each. These are followed by five or six rows of flattened, irregularly
                    cuboidal bones, gradually diminishing in size and number to the tips, and which
                    represent at once the <hi rend="italic">metacarpus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >phalanges of</hi> the fore paw, used apparently chiefly as a fin or paddle. The
                    pelvic extremities appear to have been less strong and perfectly constructed
                    than the thoracic. The <hi rend="italic">femur</hi> is smaller and shorter than
                    the <hi rend="italic">humerus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the <hi rend="italic"

                    in five ranges of flattened bones, gradually diminishing in size, and which
                    represent the <hi rend="italic">metatarsus</hi> and metatarsal phalanges of the
                    hind paw or paddle.</p>
                <p>From the specimens hitherto discovered of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Plesiosaurus,</hi> it appears that the total number of vertebrae amounts to 90,
                    of which 35 appear to be cervical, while the other 55 are dorsal and caudal, the
                    regions of which are proportionally short. The head of this animal also is small
                    and compressed, nor has it the large orbit of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ichthyosaurus.</hi> Each rib consists of a vertebral and sternal portion,
                    united at an obtuse angle, the former articulated by a single head to the
                    transverse process, and the latter connected with its fellow by a transverse
                    slip, so that the lower or abdominal ribs appear to have surrounded the abdomen
                    with a complete cincture. The anterior part of the chest is occupied by two
                    trilateral bones uniting in the middle, which, from their connection with the
                    scapula, are believed to be the coracoid bones; and above these is a transverse
                    piece, with a middle notch and lateral sinuated elevations, which is regarded as
                    the <hi rend="italic">sternum;</hi> while the <hi rend="italic">scapula</hi>
                    extends on each side like a buttress be? tween the two. It is. not improbable,
                    nevertheless, that the middle portions named coracoid bones are the sternum, and
                    the transverse bone the clavicles; and it is worthy of remark, that not only
                    this bone, but the middle piece, closely resembles in figure and disposition
                    those of the <hi rend="italic">Echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ornithorhyncus.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">pelvis</hi> consists of three bones,

                    expanded at the extremities, representing the metacarpal and metatarsal digital

                <p>SECT. IV. OSTEOLOGY OF THE FISHES.</p>
                <p>' The <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophiad</hi>
                    Reptiles present in their osteological characters an approximative transition to
                    those of Fishes. While in the former order the skeleton is reduced to the spinal
                    column, ribs, and head, in the latter class the spine and head only are left;
                    and in some tribes the transition is still more distinctly marked by the
                    presence of ribs.</p>
                <p>The vertebra of a fish is distinġuished from that of any other animal by the
                    shape of its body. The cephalic and caudal, or anterior and posterior surfaces,
                    are hollow cuplike cones, so that the union of each two vertebrae forms a double
                    conical cavity, united by the base, containing a substance composed of
                    concentric fibro-cartilaginous layers, with intermediate albuminous or
                    gelatinous matter. By this cartilage the vertebral bodies are united; and on
                    this the motions of the spine are effected. This motion, however, is chiefly
                    lateral; for the spinous processes are so long, and the articulation so complex,
                    that antero-posterior inflection or extension is nearly impracticable.</p>
                <p>In the cartilaginous fishes, for instance the shark, sturgeon, and lamprey, the
                    vertebral bodies form simple tubes, which, from the extreme elasticity of the
                    constituent cartilage, propel the contained fluid to a considerable distance.
                    Thus Sir E. Home saw the fluid.projected to the height of four feet from the
                    intervertebral cavities of the shark. <hi rend="italic">{Phil. Trans.</hi>
                    1809.) In this order, also, the spine is infinitely more flexible, and its
                    resilient power, when bent by the muscles, is almost incredible. On each side,
                    also, the vertebrae are excavated, to form a canal for lodging the large
                    blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>The vertebrae of fishes are numerous, and not easily distinguished into classes.
                    They may, however, be distinguished into two, according as the spinous process
                    is above only, or above and below at once. Those with the dorsal spine only are
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">dorsal or abdominal verte-broe,</hi> and have
                    commonly at the sides transverse processes for the attachment of the ribs. Those
                    with the dorsal and ventral spines are distinguished as the <hi rend="italic"
                    >caudal vertebrae.</hi> The last caudal vertebra is generally trilateral,
                    flattened in the vertical direction; and its tip is marked with articular pits,
                    which indicate the attachment of the small elongated bones which sustain the
                    caudal fins.</p>
                <p>The number of vertebrae varies. In the <hi rend="italic">uranoscopus</hi> or
                    star-gazer there are only 25, in the <hi rend="italic">balista</hi> 17, and in
                    the four-spined trunk-fish <hi rend="italic">(pstracion)</hi> only 13; while in
                    the sturgeon the number is 84, in the eel 115, and in the shark 207.</p>
                <p>Ţhough'FiSHEs have no chest, and require none, since their respiratory organs are
                    gills, all of them are not void of ribs. The ray, shark, <hi rend="italic"
                    >syngnathus, tetraodon, diodon, cy-</hi><pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">clopterus, fistularia,</hi> &amp;c. have indeed no vestige of rib.
                    But in the sturgeon, <hi rend="italic">balista,</hi> eel, <hi rend="italic"
                    >uranoscopus, pleuronectes,</hi> sea-wolf, and dory, they are in the shape of
                    short rudimental processes; in the7r⅛⅛ and <hi rend="italic">loricaria</hi>
                    their sides are horizontal; in the perch, carp, pike, and <hi rend="italic"
                    >chetodon,</hi> they encompass nearly the whole upper region of the abdominal
                    cavity; and, lastly, in the silver-fish <hi rend="italic">(zcus vomer),</hi> the
                    herring, rhomboidal salmon, &amp;c. they are united to a sternum. In the little
                    animal named sea-horse <hi rend="italic">(syngna-ŧhus hippocampus),</hi> several
                    series of osseous tubercles of the skin, surrounding the body like belts, are
                    supposed to represent false ribs. The sternum is limited to a small number of
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi> Besides those already mentioned, in the dory
                    there is a series of minute flat bones disseminated along the lower edge of the
                    belly, which is supposed to represent a rudimental sternum.</p>
                <p>In size and number the ribs vary, though in the <hi rend="italic">silurus,</hi>
                    carp, and <hi rend="italic">chetodon</hi> they are of largest proportional size;
                    in the herring they are as fine as hairs.</p>
                <p>The head in the finny tribes is more an object of zoological than anatomical
                    description. The chief points to be remarked are, that the cranium forms but a
                    small part of the head; that the orbits are separated by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >septum,</hi> sometimes membranous, occasionally, as in the wolf-fish, bony; and
                    that there is on each side a large movable bone, corresponding to the
                    quadrilateral of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> not square, however, but
                    oblong, which supports not only the lower jaw and palatine arches, but the
                    gill-cover. In the cartilaginous fishes the sutures are early obliterated, and
                    the cranium consists of an inseparable mass of cartilage. In the bony fishes the
                    cranium is separable into numerous pieces, and in the perch they amount to 80.
                    In the cranium of fishes the anatomist recognises more distinctly than in the
                    superior orders the formation according to the vertebral type. Small in
                    proportion to the whole head, the cranium appears like a direct continuation of
                    the vertebral column. In the osseous division of the class especially, the
                    cranium may be distinguished into the occipital or posterior vertebra, the
                    spheno-parietal or middle, and the frontal or facial vertebra. The cavity thus
                    formed is very small; yet small as it is, it is not exactly filled by the brain,
                    between which and the bones there is interposed a pellucid fluid, contained in
                    fine cellular tissue. The cranium of the osseous fishes also is widest between
                    the ears, because the organ of hearing is contained within its cavity with the
                    brain. In the cartilaginous it is quite different.</p>
                <p>Though <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> are destitute of extremities similar to
                    those possessed by the other three classes of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Vertebrata,</hi> they are not, however, without locomotive members. The
                    thoracic extremities are represented by the pectoral fins, and the pelvic by the
                    ventral. In short, it may be said that the bones of the thoracic and abdominal
                    extremities are converted into osseous rays in the finny tribes.</p>
                <p>In the Bay <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi> in which the wing-like disposition of
                    the pectoral fins gives the body a rhomboidal shape, they consist of numerous
                    radiating cartilaginous lines, all attached to a cartilage parallel to the
                    spine, divisible into two or three others, and articulated above to another
                    adherent to the spine. Below there is a strong transverse bar common to the
                    cartilages of both fins, and separating at once the sternum and clavicle. This
                    transverse bar is also seen in the shark tribe; but their pectoral fins, which
                    are much smaller, are not articulated with the spine.</p>
                <p>Iη the osseous fishes, and in many others usually referred to the cartilaginous
                    division, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">balista,</hi> the
                    pectoral fins are fixed to an osseous belt, which surrounds the body behind the
                    gills, and which supports the posterior margin of their aperture. This belt
                    consists of a single bone on each side, articulated to the posteriorsuperior
                    angle of the cranium, and uniting below the breast with that of the opposite
                    side. This bone, which - may be regarded as a <hi rend="italic">scapula,</hi>
                    varies in shape and the <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> angle which it forms with
                    its fellow in different species. In fishes flattened vertically, the angle of
                    union is acute; in those which are depressed, the angle is so obtuse as to' form
                    nearly a straight line. In many fishes, especially those of the order <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Thoracici,</hi><hi rend="italic">e.g.pleuronectes, cottus,
                    zeus,. chetodon,</hi> perch, &lt;⅛c., in the small unicorn <hi rend="italic"
                    >(balista),</hi> and others, the superior part forms a large spine, which
                    descends immediately behind the fin, and to which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >adductor</hi> muscles are attached. This spine, which is moλ <hi
                    rend="superscript"> r</hi>- able, has been improperly named a <hi rend="italic"
                    >clavicle.</hi></p>
                <p>The rays by which the membrane is supported are not directly articulated to this
                    belt, but are connected by a row of minute flat bones, which may be compared to
                    the <hi rend="italic">carpus</hi> in the other three classes. When the first ray
                    of the pectoral fin, however, is thorny, as in the harness-fish <hi
                    rend="italic">(loricaria),</hi> and some species of <hi rend="italic"
                    >silurus,</hi> it is articulated directly with an osseous belt; and it is
                    remarkable that some fishes, as the <hi rend="italic">silurus</hi> and
                    stickle-back, have the power of retaining this spinous ray erected against the
                    body as a means of defence. This is effected by a cylindrical tubercle, on which
                    the spinous ray is articulated by a hollow, bounded before and behind by an
                    elevated process. When the spine is erected, the anterior process, entering a
                    hole in the cylindrical tubercle, is locked in it by the spine revolving
                    slightly on its axis, so that it cannot be inflected unless by the spine
                    revolving in the opposite direction.</p>
                <p>The pectoral fins are so long that they answer the purpose of wings in several
                    species of <hi rend="italic">trigla,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">trigla</hi><hi

                    Their situation also is liable to vary. In the <hi rend="italic">exocoetus</hi>
                    they are near the gills, but in the <hi rend="italic">biennius</hi> and others
                    they are remote. Lastly, they are totally wanting in a small number only, as the
                    lamprey <hi rend="italic">(petromyzon),</hi> the hag-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(myxine,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic">gastróbranchus),</hi> the <hi

                <p>The abdominal or ventral fins, which correspond to the pelvic extremities of the
                    other classes, are so denominated because in the majority of fishes they are
                    situate below the belly, and nearer the anal outlet than the pectoral. By this
                    circumstance a numerous order are distinguished by the name of Abdominal Fishes
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(Abdominales).</hi></p>
                <p>In a small number of fishes, comprehending the <hi rend="italic">gadus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">biennius,</hi><hi rend="italic">kurtus, callionymus,
                    trachinus,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">uranoscopus,</hi> the ventral fins are
                    placed under the throat, below the aperture of the gills, and before the
                    pectoral fins. This order is therefore distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Jugulares.</hi></p>
                <p>In the most numerous order of all, the ventral fins are situate behind and below
                    the pectoral fins. These have therefore been denominated Thoracic Fishes <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(Thoracici).</hi></p>
                <p>The ventral fins consist of two parts—one formed of rays covered by a double
                    membrane, apparent externally, and constituting the proper ventral fin; the
                    other internal, representing the coxal bones of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >pelvis,</hi> always supporting the pinnal rays, and often articulated with the
                    bones of the trunk. It is never articulated, however, with the spine, nor does
                    it form an osseous belt round the abdomen. The bones of which it consists are
                    generally flattened, varying in shape, and in mutual contact by the internal
                    margin. In the shark and ray <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> only is there a
                    single transverse bone, nearly cylindrical, to the extre-inities<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095795?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5795-0018"/> of which the
                    fins are attached. The direction of the pelvic plane to the walls of the abdomen
                    varies according to the shape of the body of the fish. In the flat fishes they
                    are directed obliquely, and their inner margin forms the keel of the bëlly. In
                    fishes with a broad or cylindrical belly they form a plane more or less
                    horizontal.</p>
                <p>. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Jugular</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Thoracic
                    Fishes,</hi> the pelvic bones are always articulated with the base of the belt
                    which sustains the pectoral fins; and they vary much in shape and situation.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">trachinus, uranoscopus, cottus, sçioena, chetodon,</hi>
                    and perch, these two bones are united by their inner margin. In the
                    cuckoo-gurnard, in which they are united by the posterior tip only of their
                    internal margin,.they are broad, flat, and oval. In the sole and flounder <hi
                    rend="italic">genus (pleuronectes),</hi> in which the fins are attached to their
                    anterior tip, they are united in a quadrangular pyramid, the apex of which is
                    directed backwards and upwards, and the base forwards. In some of the
                    stickle-backs these bones are altogether separate, and being long, receive in
                    their middle a movable spine, which supplies the place of the ventral fin. In
                    the dory <hi rend="italic">(zeus</hi><hi rend="italic">faber,</hi> L.) they are
                    flat and triangular, in mutual contact by their whole surface. In the
                    silver-fish <hi rend="italic">(zeus vomer)</hi> they are small and
                    cylindrical.</p>
                <p>In the whole of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Abdominal</hi> order, on the contrary,
                    the pelvic bones are equally unconnected with the bones of the shoulder and with
                    the osseous belt of the pectoral fins, and are confined to the middle-inferior
                    part of the belly, not far from the <hi rend="italic">anus.</hi> In general
                    these two bones are separate from each other, and are retained in their
                    situation by ligaments. In the carp,. in which they are elongated, they touch
                    only by their posterior third. In the herring, in which they are small and
                    approximated, they are continuous with the minute bones of the sternum. In the
                    pike they are broad and trilateral, approximated by their anterior tips,
                    separate behind where the fin is attached. In the <hi rend="italic"
                    >silurus,</hi> in which they are united, they form a round and often spinous
                    shield before, while the fins are attached to the exterior-posterior margin.
                    Lastly, in the cuirassier or harness-fish <hi rend="italic">(loricaria),</hi>
                    the pelvic bones are united in one piece, the posterior notch of which forms the
                    anal aperture, while the fins are attached to its external margin.</p>
                <p>The proper fin consists of a certain number of osseous rays, simple or bifid,
                    supported by one or two rows of ιni- ∙nute bones placed between them and the
                    pelvic bones. On these small bones the constituent rays move, diverging or
                    converging like the rods of a fan, while the whole fin maybe inflected or
                    extended by the minute bones moving on the pelvic, so as to adduct or abduct the
                    fin.</p>
                <p>’ In the cartilaginous fishes the structure is different. To the tip of each
                    pelvic bone are articulated two principal cartilages, one external, forming a
                    kind of toe with seven or eight joints; the other internal, supporting all the
                    other rays of the fin, which often exceed thirty in number.</p>
                <p>r If we suppose these bones, like the minute ones of the <hi rend="superscript">
                    1</hi> pectoral fin, to represent the <hi rend="italic">tarsus of</hi> the other
                    three <hi rend="superscript"> l</hi> classes, it must follow that, in the
                    locomotive extremities, the <hi rend="italic">humerus,</hi> with the <hi
                    rend="italic">ulna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">radius,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">femur,</hi> with the <hi rend="italic">tibia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">fibula“,</hi> are obliterated. It is not en-important to observe,
                    that the general structure of <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Vertebraţa</hi> tends through various transitions to this
                    termination. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> the long bones of the
                    extremities are shortened by removing the <hi rend="italic">diaphysis,</hi> and
                    leaving their articulating ends only. In thą <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetaçea</hi>
                    the pelvic •extremities are removed altogether. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Chęloniad</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial Reptiles</hi> the same long
                    bones of the extremities are much abridged; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ichthyoid.Reptiles,·</hi> now extinct, but sharing by their structure a form of
                    animal existence partaking, of the. reptile and fish at once, and perhaps
                    intermediate between the two, this abbreviation is carried perhaps to its
                    greatest possible degree, in leaving the articular ends only of the four
                    locomotive extremities. Lastly, this reduction is merely preparatory to that
                    exhibited in the whole class of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> in which the
                    three longitudinal bones so conspicuous in the higher classes of animals are
                    completely obliterated, and those representing the hand or forepaw and foot are
                    articulated directly to the shoulder and pelvic bones.</p>
                <p>Besides the bones already mentioned as constituting the skeleton, there are
                    observed in the osseous fishes minute bones, generally fork-like in shape,
                    disseminated through all the muscular parts of the body. The purpose of these
                    bones, which, as being totally insulated from the other parts of the skeleton,
                    arc denominated <hi rend="italic">ossicula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >musculorum·,</hi> is chiefly to afford points of support; and they are probably
                    to be regarded as rudimental representatives of osseous parts, more completely
                    developed in the higher animals.</p>
                <p>It is further a curious circumstance, that the skeleton, which is so symmetrical
                    in all the other classes and orders, begins to exhibit a deviation from this
                    first in the skeleton of the finny tribes. In the Sole <hi rend="italic">genus
                    (Pleuronectes)</hi> this deviation is very conspicuous. Both eyes are placed on
                    the same side of the mesial plane; and the side on which the eyes are placed is
                    broader than the opposite one. The former is bounded by a convex margin, the
                    latter by a concave one. The orbit towards the former is large, the other small
                    and imperfect. Conversely, it is to be observed, that in the latter the
                    maxillary and intermaxillary bones are larger than in the former. The sides of
                    the inferior jaw are less discordant; and though in the Sole and Plaice those of
                    the eyeless side arc more straight and elongated than those of the other, in the
                    Turbot <hi rend="italic">(Pleuronectes</hi><hi rend="italic">maximus)</hi> they
                    are nearly symmetrical,</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.—COMPARATIVE MYOLOGY.</p>
                <p>Though this is the proper place to consider the peculiarities of the muscular
                    system of animals, the limits assigned to this sketch will not allow us to enter
                    into details. We shall merely, therefore, take a cursory view of those points in
                    which the myology of the lower animals differs from that of the human
                    subject.</p>
                <p>In general, in the lower animals, especially the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,
                    Birds,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> the muscles correspond in
                    situation to those of the human subject; and whatever modifications they undergo
                    consist in changes of figure, and in some few instances in changes in
                    attachment. The former kind of changes may be in all cases pretty accurately
                    estimated by the osteological characters of the class, order, or genus; for when
                    the position, shape, or direction of, a bone is altered, in the same proportion
                    nearly are the attached muscles altered in their attributes.</p>
                <p>Though in the lower animals, however, the zootomist traces muscles in general
                    quite analogous to those of the human subject, in several instances this analogy
                    ceases to be observed. In general the muscles of the lower animais are less
                    numerous than those of the human subject; and this, deficiency in number, though
                    not much observed in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> is very
                    remarkable in all the inferior orders of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    and still more in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reptiles.</hi> In general, also, these variations are most conspicuous in the
                    locomotive extremities. Thus the small; pęctoral muscle, which iş present in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadru-maņa,</hi> is; wanting in the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>’ In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> the great pectoral is a remarkable muscle in
                    point of size. It consists indeed of three muscles, the large pectoral, the
                    middle, and the small, which occupy the sides of the vertical crest of the
                    sternum, and constitute what is named the breast of the animal; and which are
                    chiefly employed in the energetic motion of the wings in flying. Thèse muscles
                    are sometimes so large that they weigh more than all the other muscles of the
                    animal together. In birds which fly much they are dark coloured and firm ;· in
                    those which fly little, as the domestic poultry, they are white coloured,' and
                    in general soft. The ⅛ame distinction is observed in the muscles öf the two
                    extremities. In birds much on the wing these muscles are dark Coloured and firm,
                    while those of the legs are comparatively lighter and more tender; and,
                    conversely, in birds little on the wing and mostly on the legs, as the domestic
                    poultry and many of the <hi rend="italic">Gralloe,</hi> the waders, swimmers,
                    &amp;c. the muscles of the wings are light coloured and tender, while those of
                    the legs are dark coloured, firm, and strong.</p>
                <p>The flexor muscles of the leg and toes of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> merit
                    notice. They consist of muscles corresponding to the long flexors, which are
                    divided into three masses. The first consists of· five portions, three of which
                    may be regarded as constituting a single <hi rend="italic">common perforated
                    flexor.</hi> It rises by tWo bellies, one attached to the external condyle of·
                    the <hi rend="italic">femur,</hi> forming a perforated tendon, which receives
                    one of those of the muscle corresponding to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >peronoeus</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other to the posterior surface of
                    the femur,. forming the tendons of the index and small toe. This muscle is
                    further connected by intermediate fibres with the accessory femoral flexor,—a
                    muscle placed on the internal surface of the thigh, and sending its tendon over
                    the knee·; <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> änd as the tendons are inserted into
                    the unguinal phalanges, when the· accessory femoral bends the thigh the flèkors
                    of the toes inflect them also, and retain them in· the inflected position. By
                    means of this arrangement birds are enabled to clasp a perch or other small body
                    when roosting, without continued muscular effort, and thereby-to sleep on the
                    perch. This mode of explanation, which was originally given by Borelli, has been
                    controverted by Vicq d ’ Azyr; but apparently not ön good grounds. ∙ </p>

                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5821-0020"/> that the only cutaneous muscles in man are the
                    <hi rend="italic">latissimus colli,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">epicranius</hi>
                    or scalp-muscle, and those which are attached to the face, and which by their
                    motion give expression to the countenance. The cutaneous muscle even is not
                    found in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Qüadrumana,</hi> nor does it exist in the pig.
                    In various other animals, however, it is found in different degrees of
                    distinctness. It is very well marked in the hedgehog and porcupine ;—by its
                    means they have the power of erecting their spines, and rolling themselves up
                    ;—and in the armadillo and the anteater tribe. In the mole, also, we have seen
                    it pretty well marked.</p>
                <p>It is an interesting fact, that Galen originally observed that the lower animals
                    possess a seventh muscle of the eye, or one more than man. The suspensory or
                    infundibular muscle <hi rend="italic">(musculus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >clιoanoides),</hi> as it has been named, from its shape, especially in the
                    Ruminants and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> has the <hi rend="italic"
                    >apex</hi> fixed to the margin of the optic hole, and its base inserted a little
                    behind the four straight muscles. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga</hi> and
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it consists of four parts, so that these
                    orders appear to be provided with 8 straight muscles. In the rhinoceros it
                    consists of two portions.</p>
                <p>There is yet another part, the muscles of which· can scarcely be said to exist in
                    the human subject, but which attain a very great degree of developement in the
                    lower animals. The <hi rend="italic">coccyx</hi> of the human subject is
                    expanded in the lower animals into a highly flexible prolongation denominated
                    the tail <hi rend="italic">(caudd),</hi> variable in length, but always
                    consisting of separate vertebrae, articulated and movable on each other. While
                    the <hi rend="italic">coccyx</hi> of the human subject possesses two muscles
                    only, the <hi rend="italic">isclιio-coccygeus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacro-coccygeus,</hi> which are so insignificant in size that they scarcely
                    serve to move the part, the caudal vertebrae of the lower animals are moved by
                    muscles greatly larger, more numerous, and more powerful.</p>
                <p>The tail is to animals a much more useful and powerful organ than the coccyx to
                    man. It is a member which peculiarly belongs to them; and though in ordinary
                    circumstances pendulous, it is made to assume a variety of motions of which no
                    other organ is susceptible, and to perform duties which would be otherwise
                    impracticable. With many, as the long-tailed monkeys, the sloths, the ant-eater,
                    and the squirrel tribes, it is indispensable as an organ of prehension. The
                    majority of animals, as the Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,
                    &amp;c.</hi> use it as a whip or lash to drive away insects. The lion, tiger,
                    and others of the feline tribe, lash their sides with it when enraged. The
                    Cetaceous swimmers employ it as a rudder and oar in the waters. The beaver uses
                    it as a trowel, to enable him to construct his clay-built dwelling. An organ
                    employed so variously must consist of a muscular apparatus rather complex.</p>
                <p>The different motions of which the tail of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>
                    is susceptible may be referred to three heads,—one by which it is extended or
                    elevated, another by which it is inflected or depressed, and a third by which it
                    is made to beat the sides. The combination or succession of these motions gives
                    rise to secondary ones more complex in character. It may be twisted on its axis,
                    or turned in a spiral direction. These motions are effected by three classes of
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>Isŕ, The muscles which raise the tail are situate above; they are <hi

                    vertebrae, by fleshy slips, they are connected to tendons, which are inserted
                    into the base of the first of the caudal vertebrae, which are void of articular
                    processes. The second tendon goes to the next following vertebra, and so on to
                    the 13th, each contained in a ligamentous groove, which forms an investment. The
                    muscles of both sides acting together, elevate or incurvate the tail up-
                    wards.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">interspinalis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spinalis</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">obliquus</hi> or lumbo-sacro-coccygeal are the continuations of
                    the <hi rend="italic">interspinales dorsi et lumborum.</hi> The spinous
                    processes, however, becoming indistinct, or being represented by two tubercles,
                    the attachments vary.</p>
                <p>2√, The muscles which depress or inflect the tail downwards take their origin
                    within the pelvis, and are prolonged to various extents along the inferior
                    surface of the tail. Of these there are four pairs, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ileo-coccygeal</hi> of Vicq d’Azyr, the inferior <hi rend="italic"
                    >sacro-coccygeal,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">inter-coccygeal</hi> muscles, and
                    the <hi rend="italic">pubo-coccygeal</hi> of the same author. The insertions of
                    these muscles vary in different genera, according to the number of vertebrae of
                    which the tail consists. The pubo-coccygeal is wanting in the raccoon, but it is
                    distinct in the dog and opossum. The effect of the ileo-coccygeal and it, is to
                    depress the tail and apply it forcibly to the <hi rend="italic">anus.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">3d,</hi> There are only two muscles which carry the tail to the
                    sides of the animal—the <hi rend="italic">ischio-coccygaeus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">externus,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">intertransυersalis</hi>
                    of Vicq d’Azyr; the former proceeding from the pelvic surface of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ischium</hi> below and behind the <hi rend="italic"
                    >acetabulum,</hi> to the transverse processes of the caudal vertebrae, the
                    second extending in a continued band between all the transverse processes.</p>
                <p>The tail, therefore, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> consists of a
                    series of successively decreasing vertebrae, moved by eight pairs of
                    muscles.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> it is not easy to trace any analogy between
                    the muscles and those of the other classes. Though the spine, head and fins,
                    have appropriate muscular bundles, the natural or fascial distinctions are less
                    evident than in the other three classes. It is important, however, to remark,
                    that while the muscles which move the spinal column are placed in these classes,
                    partly before, and chiefly behind the vertebrae, those of <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes</hi> are placed on each side. Hence the lateral motion of the spine,
                    which is inconsiderable in <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammiferous</hi> animals, <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> becomes
                    very conspicuous in the finny tribes, especially in the motion of swimming,
                    while the anteroposterior inflection or extension is altogether
                    insignificant.</p>
                <p>It is almost superfluous to remark, that, in the greater part of the finny
                    tribes, the muscles are white or pale coloured. In a few only, for instance the
                    salmon, trout, gwiniad <hi rend="italic">(coregonus),</hi> herring <hi
                    rend="italic">(clupea</hi><hi rend="italic">harengus),</hi> carp <hi
                    rend="italic">(cyprinus),</hi> and some others, are the muscular fibres of a
                    pale flesh red. The circumstances on which these differences depend arc not
                    known; but it is supposed that in the latter sorts the proportion of
                    oleo-albuminous matter is more abundant than in the former. The proportion of
                    albumen, however, in the muscles of fish, seems in general to be small. They
                    abound in gelatine and isinglass; and in some of the cartilaginous fishes
                    especially, the greater part of the muscles seem to consist chiefly of gelatine
                    in various degrees of consistence. This is particularly the case with the
                    lamprey, the hag-fish <hi rend="italic">(myxine</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >glutinosa),</hi> and even with the sturgeon. The sterlet especially <hi
                    rend="italic">(acipenser</hi><hi rend="italic">Rutlιenus),</hi> a small species
                    of sturgeon found in the rivers of Russia, both European and Asiatic, abounds in
                    gelatine; and the presence of this principle enables the inhabitants to use it
                    in the preparation of a species of soup, the sterlet, which is esteemed a great
                    delicacy. In some of the <hi rend="italic">genus Pleuroncctes</hi> this
                    principle is also very abundant. Thus the Plaice <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Pleuronectes</hi><hi rend="italic">Platessa),</hi> sole <hi rend="italic">(P.
                    Solca),</hi> and especially the turbot <hi rend="italic">(P. Maximus),</hi>
                    contain a considerable proportion of gelatine. On the proportion of this
                    principle depends the quality of fish used <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095834?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5834-0021"/> as an article
                    of food in nourishing without exciting. All fishes which abound in gelatine
                    uncombined with oleo-albuminous matter may be safely used as articles of food;
                    while those in which the latter ingredients predominate are invariably eaten
                    with the risk of disordering the stomach and producing indigestion.</p>
                <p>CHAP. III.—COMPARATIVE AESTHIOLOGY, OR THE COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF
                    SENSATION.</p>
                <p>SECT. I. THE ORGAN OF SMELL.</p>
                <p>The organ of smell consists of the nasal cavities, those of the ethmoidal and
                    turbinated bones, and the frontal, Sphenoidal, and superior maxillary sinuses,
                    all of which communicate with the nasal. The whole of these parts are invested
                    by fine periosteum, lined by mucous membrane. The ethmoid bone is the essential
                    organ of smell; and the others appear simply to multiply the extent of the
                    membrane.</p>
                <p>. The ethmoid bone consists of a perforated plate, with a middle vertical one
                    attached at right angles to it, and lateral portions composed of thin bony
                    plates convoluted with various degrees of complexity and minuteness in different
                    orders and genera of animals. These convoluted plates form what are denominated
                    the ethmoidal cells. They may be represented as numerous tortuous canals,
                    proceeding from the perforated plate forwards and outwards, approximating
                    mutually, and forming numerous communicating cavities. Such nearly is the
                    structure of these plates in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,
                    Pachydermata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> the last of which
                    have more complicated cells than the first. In the dog they are numerous and
                    extensive. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> for instance the
                    porcupine, they are few—not above 3 or 4 on each side.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> the internal side of each nostril is occupied
                    by three orders of plates; the inferior turbinated or spongy bone; the middle,
                    consisting of one plate convoluted on itself two turns and a half; and the
                    upper, shaped like a bell, adhering to the frontal and lacrymal bones. These
                    form three tortuous passages, varying in size and tortuosity in different <hi
                    rend="italic">genera.</hi> Though generally cartilaginous, these turbinated
                    bones are membranous in the cassowary and albatross, and bony in the calao and
                    toucan.</p>
                <p>In the nostrils of <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> there are convoluted
                    prominent plates, which, however, are merely membranous productions, unsupported
                    by any bone.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> in like manner, there are membranous
                    folds, the disposition of which is tortuous. They arc, however, more regularly
                    arranged than in the other classes. In the cartilaginous fishes they consist of
                    semilunar folds placed in parallel tracts on each side of a broad plate, which
                    divides the one side of the nasal cavity from the other. In the sturgeon,
                    however, they are arranged in diverging plates, which are subdivided into more
                    minute ones, like the branches of a tree. In the osseous fishes generally they
                    consist of radiating plates disposed round a prominent central tubercle.</p>
                <p>In these three classes the olfactory nerve is distributed to the membrane much in
                    the same manner. This nerve, however, does not proceed farther than the superior
                    turbinated bones; and the middle and inferior appear to be supplied with
                    filaments of the fifth pair, the naso-ophthalmic branch of which is distributed
                    to the nose in all the vcrtebrated animals. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> further, the spheno-palatine ganglion sends several filaments to
                    the posterior part of the narine membrane.</p>
                <p>By most zootomical authors the trunk of the elephant has been described as an
                    organ of smell peculiar to that animal. We are satisfied, however, from
                    observing the motions of this body in the living animal, that it is an organ,
                    not of smell, but of prehension. Cuvier, after adopting the ordinary view, has
                    relinquished it, and, on the ground of personal inspection, admits that the
                    sense of smell in the elephant is confined, as in other animals, to that portion
                    of the nasal cavities which is contained within the bones of the head. The trunk
                    of the elephant, therefore, will with greater propriety be noticed under a
                    subsequent head.</p>
                <p>The nasal cavities of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetaceous</hi> animals are not so
                    much organs of smell as channels of respiration, and must also be noticed
                    afterwards. It is sufficient here to remark, that in these animals the part of
                    the cranium corresponding to the ethmoid bone is penetrated by no aperture, or,
                    in other words, is not an ethmoid bone. It has therefore been asserted that the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> have no olfactory nerve, and no sense of
                    smell. This, however, is by no means established. Blainville and Jacobsen have
                    observed in the dolphin nerves which they regard as olfacient; and Treviranus
                    delineates nerves of the same character. By Otto and Rudolphi, on the contrary,
                    who have had frequent opportunities of dissecting the dolphin and whale, the
                    existence of these nerves is denied.</p>
                <p>Though almost all the invertebrated animals give proofs of the existence of the
                    sense of smell, in none of them do we find any organ in which this sensation
                    appears with certainty to be exercised. That these animals possess the faculty
                    of smell, is inferred from the fact, that insects recognise their food at a
                    distance; that male butterflies scent the female even when inclosed in cages;
                    and that the ordinary flesh-fly deposits her eggs on tainted meat, and
                    occasionally on fetid plants, in the belief that they arc the proper <hi
                    rend="italic">nidus,</hi> though in the latter case the <hi rend="italic"
                    >larvae</hi> perish for want of the necessary sustenance.</p>
                <p>Since odorous particles are evidently applied to the olfactory membrane of all
                    aeropnoic animals by the medium of the atmosphere, and since the organ of smell
                    is therefore situate in connection with the wind-pipe, it was conjectured by
                    Baster, that, in insects at least, the organ of smell is situate at the entrance
                    of the <hi rend="italic">tracheae</hi> or airtubes. This conjecture derives some
                    probability from the fact, that the inner tracheal membrane in these animals is
                    soft and moist, and that those in which it is expanded into convoluted <hi
                    rend="italic">lacunae</hi> and tortuous vesicles, for instance beetles, flies,
                    and bees, are remarkable for the nicety of their sense of smell.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">antennae,</hi> in which this sense has been placed by some
                    anatomists, appear to be rather organs of touch than of smell.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca</hi> the whole cutaneous covering seems to
                    combine the character of an organ of touch or tact, and of smell. Like an
                    extensive pituitary membrane, it is soft, villous, moist, and liberally supplied
                    with nerves. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Articulata</hi> and Zoophytes seem much in
                    the same state. But on all these points information is rather conjectural than
                    positive.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. THE EYES; THE ORGANS OF VISION.</p>
                <p>All red-blooded animals, without exception, are provided with two movable eyes,
                    consisting of the same essential parts as those of man, forming globular organs,
                    and placed in the cranio-facial cavities named orbits. In none are there more or
                    fewer; and the exceptions to the general rule, either in relation to the
                    presence of these organs, or number, are only apparent. Among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,:</hi> indeed, there are two instances of
                    blindness,—in the <hi rend="italic">zemni</hi> or blind rat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mus</hi><hi rend="italic">typhlus,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic">Spalax
                    typhlus,</hi> Pall.), and <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> the golden mole (<hi
                    rend="italic">Talpa</hi><hi rend="italic">Asiatica,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >Chryşochloris,</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> 1</hi> Lacep. and Cuvier).
                    But in neither of these animals are <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095847?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5847-0022"/> the eyes
                    absolutely wanting; they are merely very minute, and covered by a thin fold of
                    hairy skin, in which there is said to be no aperture. Much in the same manner
                    the <hi rend="italic">muraena coecilia,</hi> and the hag-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(myxine,</hi> Lin., <hi rend="italic">gastrobranclius caecus),</hi> though
                    provided with eyes, are deprived of the use of these organs by the opacity of
                    the <hi rend="italic">conjunctiva.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Anableps (
                    Cobitis Anableps,</hi> Lin.), the <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">iris</hi> are biparted by transverse bands, so as to give the
                    animal the appearance of having two pupils in each eye, though the crystalline
                    lens, vitreous humour, and retina, are single. This animal affords the only
                    example of this structure among the vertebrated animals; but a similar
                    arrangement is observed in the Cephalopodous <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca</hi>
                    and cuttle-fish family.</p>
                <p>The general shape of the eye depends on the medium in which the animal lives. It
                    is nearly spherical, or approaching the spherical shape, in man and the
                    quadrupeds moving along the surface of the earth; that is, in the lowest and
                    most dense region of the atmosphere. The <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> merely
                    forms a slight convexity, in consequence of being the segment of a smaller
                    sphere than the rest of the eyeball; yet in the porcupine, opossum, &amp;c.,
                    this difference is inconsiderable. To show the degree of this convexity, it is
                    merely requisite to compare the axis or antero-posterior diameter with the
                    transverse diameter of the ball, as exhibited in the following table :—</p>

                <p>According to the measurements of the younger Soemmering, the axis of the human
                    eye, taken in a beautiful Tyrolese girl of 20, is to the transverse diameter as
                    100 to 95; that of the eye of the magot <hi rend="italic">(simia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">inuus)</hi> as, 85 to 84; and that of the bat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(vespertilio auritus)</hi> as 12 to 11. In the raccoon <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ursus</hi><hi rend="italic">lotor)</hi> and lynx <hi rend="italic"
                    >(felis</hi><hi rend="italic">lynx)</hi> alone the axis is exactly equal to the
                    diameter. In all the other vertebrateđ animals, it is, as in the measurements of
                    Cuvier, less than the transverse diameter at the rate of from 9 to 33 or 45 per
                    cent. In the horse it is as 186 to 212, in the seal as 130 to 142, in the Indian
                    elephant as 135 to 180, and in the black whale <hi rend="italic">(baloena
                    mysticeius)</hi> as 20 to 29. In the owl it is as 17 to 18, in the golden falcon
                    as 14½</p>
                <p>to 16, in the ostrich as 18 to 19∣, and in the swan as 7 to 10. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> it is always
                    less at the rate of from 3 to. nearly 10 per cent. In the cuttle-fish, which may
                    be taken as a general example of the invertebrated classes, it is much greater,
                    the axis being to the diameter as 80 ţo 57. (D. W. Soemmering <hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">Oculorum</hi><hi rend="italic">Hominis Animaliumque

                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi>
                    which inhabit the sea, the anterior part of the eyeball is much more flattened,
                    and in many fishes it resembles a hemisphere with the plane surface before, and
                    the convex behind. In the ray <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> the superior part is
                    also flat, so as to give the eýe the appearance of the quadrant of a sphere, cut
                    through two large circles perpendicular to each other. In some fishes,
                    especially the burbot <hi rend="italic">(Gadus Lota),</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornea</hi> is convex.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> which occupy the elevated regions of the
                    atmosphere, the deviation from the spherical shape is in the direction opposite
                    to that of fishes. On the anterior part, which is sometimes flat, sometimes
                    shaped like a truncated cone, is chased a short cylinder, closed by a very
                    coņ-vex, and occasionally hemispherical <hi rend="italic">cornea,</hi> always
                    belonging to a much smaller sphere than the posterior convexity.</p>
                <p>These differences in shape depend on the proportion between the density of the
                    medium iń which the animals live and that of the aqueous humour. In the higher
                    régions of the atmosphere, in which the air is very much rarefied, the
                    refracting power of the aqueous humour is much more considerable than at the
                    surface, occupied by quadrupeds; and hence it is more abundant in the former
                    than in the latter class. Its refracting power, however, would be almost
                    extinguished in a watery medium, from which it could differ but little in
                    density; and hence it is either trifling or absolutely wanting in the
                    inhabitants of the deep. In the cuttle-fish family it is entirely wanting.</p>
                <p>The crystalline lens in <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> which is nearly
                    spherical, projects through the pupil, and leaves little room for the aqueous
                    humour. The lens is also very convex in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi>
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibious Mammalia,</hi> the diving birds, as the
                    cormorant, and the marine and aquatic <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles.</hi></p>
                <p>Affecting the oblate spheroidal shape in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    it becomes extremely so in man, and still more in <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds.</hi> Its consistence is greatest in animals in which it is most convex;
                    and hence it is matter of common observation, that the crystalline of fishes is
                    particularly firm. It also contains rather more albumen than the lens of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> The crystalline lens occupies least proportional
                    space of the eyeball in man, and most in fishes.</p>
                <p>The comparative spaces occupied by each of the humours may be understood from the

                <p>On the proportion of the total volume occupied by each of the three transparent
                    parts there are few accurate facts. It may be remarked, however, that the human
                    eye among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> is that in which the vitreous
                    humour is proportionally most abundant. It is estimated to be twenty times more
                    copious than the aqueous. In the ox it is only ten times, and in the sheep nine
                    times the quantity of the aqueous.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> generally, the sclerotic is
                    comparatively elastic, soft, and yielding; but in all animals in which the eye
                    deviates from the spherical shape, as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,
                    Fishes,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> this membrane is strengthened
                    by greater solidity and thickness of tissue, or supported by accessory parts of
                    a hard unyielding structure.</p>
                <p>In the eye of the whale these two parts, the hard and soft, are naturally
                    distinguished in a very striking manner. The lateral parts of the sclerotic are
                    nearly an inch thick, and very hard. The posterior part is about one and a half
                    inch thick, and softer, because the spaces between the firm fibres are filled
                    with oily substance. The, posterior part presents Tor the optic <hi
                    rend="italic">nerve</hi> a canal one aņd a half inch long, the walls of which
                    are formed chiefly by fibres in direct continuity with the <hi rend="italic"
                    >durd mater,</hi> the only fact, it may be observed, which favours the statement
                    of the ancient anatomists, that the sclerotic is derived from the <hi
                    rend="italic">dura mater.</hi> The sclerotic of the porpoise, though only two or
                    three lines thick has the same structure as that of the whale. In the seal it is
                    thick before and thicker behind, but the middle zone is'thiņ and flexible.</p>
                <p>The sclerotic in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is thin flexible, and elastic
                    behind, with a bluish glistening aspect, and without distinct fibres. The optic
                    nerve, enters, not by a hole, but an oblique canal. The anterior part consists
                    of two plates, between which is enchased a zone of thin, hard, oblong,
                    osseous<pb break="no" facs="nls:193095860?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5860-0023"/> scales, varying in number from 11 or 12 to 14 or
                    15, imbricated over each other so as to give the anterior part of the eyeball a
                    great degree of hardness, and a figure unsusceptible of change. Though these
                    plates are nearly flat in most birds, and form an annular zone slightly convex,
                    they are broad, arched, and concave internally in the owl <hi rend="italic"
                    >genus,</hi> and form a bell-shaped tube, with the posterior aperture oval and
                    the anterior round. This may be denominated the osseous ring <hi rend="italic"

                    >Cheloniads</hi> possess an osseous zone, consisting of plates inclosed in the
                    membrane without being continuous with its substance. They are also found at the
                    lateral part of the sclerotic in the chameleon and some of the <hi

                    >Saurial</hi> tribe, that its sclerotic was provided with an osseous zone,
                    consisting, as in these, of 13 separate pieces.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the sclerotic is cartilaginous, homogeneous,
                    semi-translucent, elastic, and, though thin, firm enough not to collapse. In the
                    ray it is expanded into a tubercle, by which the eye is attached to a peduncle
                    or stalk. The sclerotic of the sturgeon is so thick that it resembles a
                    cartilaginous sphere, with the external part hollowed for the humours and
                    membranes.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cepiialopodous</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca</hi>
                    it forms behind a truncated cone, with the apex at the bottom of the orbit
                    containing the gangliform swelling of the optic nerve, and several glandular
                    parts, with the eye before.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">cornea</hi> has often been represented to be merely a
                    continuation of the sclerotic; and though, this is easily disproved by accurate
                    dissection of the human eye and that of our ordinary domestic animals, its
                    inaccuracy is much more manifestly demonstrated in the animal world at large. In
                    the whale and rhinoceros the margins of the two membranes penetrate
                    reciprocally. In man ànd the ox the corneal margin is enchased within the sharp
                    imbricated edge of the sclerotic. In the tope-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(squalus</hi><hi rend="italic">milandra,</hi> Lin.; <hi rend="italic"
                    >galeus,</hi> Cuv.) the cornea is observed distinctly passing within the
                    sclerotic in the manner of imbrication. The cuttle-fish is destitute of cornea;
                    and as there is no aqueous humour, the crystalline lens is covered by a fine
                    thin membrane, extended beneath the conjunctiva.</p>
                <p>In all animals provided with eyelids, the mucous membrane, after being folded
                    behind the eyelids, is reflected forwards over the sclerotic and cornea, in the
                    form of a thin, transparent membrane. In those void of eyelids, as most fishes
                    are, the skin, passing into mucous membrane, is continued directly over the <hi
                    rend="italic">cornea,</hi> without forming any angular fold, and adheres
                    strongly. This is very distinct in the eel, which may be flayed without leaving
                    any trace at the site of the eyes, except a round, translucent spot. The same
                    peculiarity is remarked in <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpents</hi> and <hi
                    rend="subscript"> i</hi> in the cuttle-fish family. In the <hi rend="italic"

                    that the cornea is covered by opaque mucous membrane.</p>

                    and something iridescent. In the ox it is of bright metallic green, changing to
                    sky-blue; in the horse, buck, buffalo, and stag, it is a silvery blue passing to
                    violet; in the sheep of a pale golden green, sometimes bluish; in the lion, cat,

                    which occupies chiefly the side opposite to that on which the optic nerve
                    enters, is named the <hi rend="italic">tapetum.</hi> The use of it is by no
                    means obvious. The explanation of Monro in reference to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >tapetum</hi> of the ox, that it represents more distinctly to that animal the
                    colour of his natural food, is not only frivolous, but inapplicable to the other
                    <hi rend="italic">genera.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tapetum</hi> is wanting in all <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Birds</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> excepting the ray, in which
                    there is at the bottom of the eye a beautiful silvery-coloured space, produced
                    by the transparency of the Ruyschian tunic, through which the tint of the
                    choroid is seen.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> generally the choroid consists of two
                    distinct separable membranes; the external, the proper choroid, white, silvery,
                    or golden, very thin and not vascular; and the inner or Ruyschian, black, and
                    consisting of a network of vessels. Between these two membranes is a body of a
                    bright red colour, consisting of numerous tortuous vessels, convoluted and
                    inclosed in pulpy filamentous tissue. Its general shape is that of a thin
                    cylinder, encompassing the optic nerve like a ring, which, however, is
                    incomplete at one side. This is the choroid gland,—a body about which there has
                    been some difference of opinion, but which appears to be glandular rather than
                    any thing else. Its vascular structure is well seen in the globe-fish, <hi
                    rend="italic">perca</hi><hi rend="italic">labrax,</hi> and cod, in which they
                    are very large, and form numerous anastomotic communications. They are generally
                    covered by a white, opaque, viscid flüid.</p>
                <p>The choroid gland is wanting in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cartilaginous
                    Fishes,</hi> the eye of which approaches more nearly to that of the <hi

                    the ray and shark <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> is a threefold tissue of
                    vessels, thick and consistent; the <hi rend="italic">txιnica Ruyscħiana</hi> is
                    very thin and semi-transparent; and between these is a layer of silvery matter
                    with metallic lustre.</p>
                <p>In the cuttle-fish genus, though between the sclerotic and choroid there are
                    several glandular bodies, there are none between the choroid and Ruyschian
                    tunic. The choroid is thick, soft, and vascular; the Ruyschian thin, firm, and
                    dry; and though there is no <hi rend="italic">tapetum,</hi> thè whole interior
                    surface of the eye is covered by deep purple, semifluid, viscid varnish.</p>
                <p>Ciliary processes are found in all theMAMMALiA, <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi>
                    several <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> and even in the cuttle-fish among'
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca</hi>; but they are wanting in almost all
                    fishes.'</p>
                <p>The indented border of these processes is more distinct, and is converted into a
                    genuine fringe in ťhe large animals, as the òx, horse, rhinoceros, and whale, in
                    v¢hich the angle applied to the capsule is more acuminated than in other
                    animals. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> particularly the lion, the
                    base of the plates is shorter in proportion to the other sides than in the
                    previously mentioned animals, so that the opposite angle is more prominent; nor
                    is the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095873?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5873-0024"/> border indented. In all the species every third
                    or fourth plate is shorter than the others, but without determinate order.</p>
                <p>The ciliary plates of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> are mere serrated <hi
                    rend="italic">striae,</hi> without sufficient prominence to make them undulate
                    in fluid. In the owl they are fine, closely set, and numerous; in the ostrich
                    they are larger and more numerous; and ift all, their extremities adhere firmly
                    to the capsule of the lens.</p>
                <p>In the tortoise the ciliary processes are so short that they are recognised only
                    by the impression left on the vitreous humour; in the crocodile, however, they
                    are distinct, and terminate each by an angle nearly right. They are indistinct
                    in the toad, and imperceptible in the ordinary lizards and serpents.</p>
                <p>The ciliary body and processes are large and distinct in the tope-fish; but if
                    they are seen in any other of the cartilaginous fishes, they are wholly wanting
                    in the osseous, in which the Ruyschian tunic is directly continuous with the <hi
                    rend="italic">uvea.</hi></p>
                <p>The utility of these processes in retaining the lens in its position is nowhere
                    so distinctly seen as in the eye of the cuttle-fish family, and especially the
                    many-feet of the ancients <hi rend="italic">(polypus octopodd).</hi> In these
                    the ciliary processes form a large diaphragm or zone, in the aperture of which
                    the crystalline lens is truly chased. They penetrate a deep annular furrow which
                    surrounds the lens, dividing it in two unequal hemispheres, and cannot be
                    detached without laceration.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">iris,</hi> of the same intimate structure as in man, is of
                    a deep tawny or brown in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and marked
                    witlι fewer coloured <hi rend="italic">striae</hi> than the human <hi
                    rend="italic">iris.</hi> In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> it is of a uniform
                    lustreless colour, varying according to the species, bright yellow, red, or
                    clear blue. In the microscope it appears like a net-work formed by the
                    intersection of numerous very minute fibres. The <hi rend="italic">uvea</hi> is
                    so fine that when the viscid varnish is removed it becomes transparent, and the
                    iris appears of the same colour on both sides. In <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes,</hi> conversely, the <hi rend="italic">iris</hi> is so thin and
                    transparent that the <hi rend="italic">uvea</hi> is seen through it, of a golden
                    or silvery brilliance, showing its direct connection with the choroid.
                    Intermediate in metallic splendour is the iris of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Reptiles.</hi> The vessels, however, are greatly more conspicuous, especially
                    in the crocodile.</p>
                <p>The central aperture or pupil, though round in man, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quadrumana,</hi> many of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> is not of that shape when contracted in all
                    animals. In the feline family it consists of two elliptical segments, which form
                    angles above and below, and which approach mutually so as to form a slit nearly
                    vertical. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminants</hi> it is oblong transversely,
                    and forms at its greatest contraction an oblong or transverse slit. In the
                    horse, in which it is also transverse, its upper margin is distinguished by a
                    five-pointed festoon. In the whale it is oblong transversely, and in the dolphin
                    it is heart-shaped. The pupil of the crocodile resembles that of the cat; in the
                    frog and gecko it is rhomboidal; and round in the tortoise, chameleon, and
                    common lizards. In the ray among <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the upper
                    margin forms several radiating slips like the branches of the palm-tree,
                    gold-coloured without, dark within. In the dilated state these slips are folded
                    backwards between the upper margin of the pupil and the vitreous humour; but
                    when the eye is pressed they are erected, and close the pup'il like a blind.</p>
                <p>The motion of the pupil is voluntary in the parroquet, and is indistinct in most
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi></p>
                <p>The pupillary membrane is well known to exist in the foetuses of all the <hi

                    the chick of birds.</p>
                <p>On the subject of the retina in the lower animals the most important point is the
                    structure of the melanoplectic or pectiniform membrane <hi rend="italic"
                    >(pecten, marsupium nigrum)</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi> In this
                    class the optic nerve forms not a round disk as in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> but a narrow white line, the margins, and extremity of which are
                    in continuity with the <hi rend="italic">retina.</hi><hi rend="italic
                    subscript"> 1</hi> Along this line is suspended a plicated or convoluted]
                    membrane, very fine and vascular in structure, like the &lt; choroid, from
                    which, however, it is quite distinct, and en-J tering a depression of the
                    vitreous humour almost like a∙i wedge. Its vessels, which proceed from a proper
                    branch <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> of the ophthalmic artery, are distributed
                    in a minute arborescent form, among the folds of which the <hi rend="italic"
                    >marsupium</hi> consists; and from these vessels the black viscid pigment with
                    which its folds are covered appears to be secreted. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >plicae</hi> or membranous folds vary in number. In the cassowary they are only
                    4; in the brown owl (&lt;S ’. <hi rend="italic">aluco)</hi> 5; in the common
                    owl, ostrich, Guiana macaw, and merganser, they are 7; in the flamingo 9; in the
                    falcon and swan 11; in the vulture and goose 12; in the duck, large heron,
                    woodcock, and coot, 13; in the stork and partridge 15; in the crane 17; in the
                    pheasant 20; in the turkey 22; in the jackdaw 25; and in the thrush 28.
                    According to the observations of the elder Soemmering, to whom we are indebted
                    for these numbers, the number of folds, though variable in different species, is
                    the same in the same. In most birds the folds are arranged in a pectiniform
                    order. On the use of this organ different opinions have been entertained by
                    Petit, Haller, and Home; but all of them are conjectural.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> and many <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes,</hi> between the optic nerve and the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi> is a
                    small tubercle, from the margins of which the latter membrane appears to rise;
                    and radiating fibres are perceived more distinctly than in most quadrupeds. In
                    many other <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the connection of the retina with
                    the optic nerves resembles that of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi> Thus, in the
                    salmon, trout, herring, mackarel, cod, dory, and moon-fish, the optic nerve,
                    after passing through the Ruyschian tunic, appears to be parted into two long
                    white processes, which, following the outline of this membrane parallel but not
                    contiguous to each other, are connected with the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi>
                    by their opposite margins.</p>
                <p>In all animals provided with ciliary processes the <hi rend="italic">retina</hi>
                    terminates at and is connected with the gray pulpy zone denominated ciliary
                    ligament. In those without ciliary processes, as the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Fishes,</hi> it terminates suddenly at the attached or large margin of the <hi

                <p>In several of the reptiles the retina presents the yellow-spot of Soemmering. The

                <p>In the Ruminants the lacrymal gland consists of two or J three bodies, each
                    composed of granules, each provided £ w-ith a separate short excretory duct. In
                    the hare and rabbit, in which the gland is large, there appears to be only one
                    excretory duct, which perforates the upper eyelid near its posterior angle.</p>
                <p>A gland peculiar to certain species, and wanting in man, that of <hi
                    rend="italic">Harder,</hi> is situate at the external or nasal angle, and
                    presents an aperture under the third or nictitating eyelid, from which issues a
                    thick viscid fluid. It is foünd in the. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminants,</hi> the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachyderm ata,</hi>
                    and in the sloth genus.</p>
                <p>The caruncle exists in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminants</hi> as in man, and
                    appears to consist of numerous aggregated follicles. It is wanting in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi></p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> as in most animals which live under
                    water, there is neither gland nor lacrymal passages; and they are represented
                    apparently by <hi rend="italic">lacunae</hi> below the upper eyelid, which
                    discharge a thick mucilaginous fluid.</p>

                    oblong, and flesh-coloured, placed betwixt the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">adductor,</hi> and discharging by a single canal, opening
                    at the inner surface of the third eyelid, a thick yellow fluid. The lacrymal,
                    which is small, round, and very red, is provided in general with two or three
                    canals, which, though small, are distinct. In most of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Grallae</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Palmiped</hi> Birds there is, in place of
                    the lacrymal gland, a hard granular body, occupying the upper part of the orbit,
                    and following in situation the curvature of the eye. It has, nevertheless, no
                    visible excretory duct.</p>
                <p>In the turtle there is a reddish granular tabulated body, of considerable size,
                    extending beneath the temporal vault. In the tortoise, frog, and toad, there are
                    two small blackish glands without apparent excretory ducts. Neither in Serpents
                    nor <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> has any glandular apparatus in the eye been
                    recognised.</p>
                <p>Though in man and the monkey tribe the eyelids consist of two semilunar
                    cutaneo-muscular folds, with a minute mucous duplicature at the nasal angle, the
                    latter acquires such a developement in the lower animals as to constitute a
                    genuine third eyelid, often distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >nictitating membrane.</hi> This duplicature is semilunar in shape in the
                    Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pachy-Dermata.</hi> In the rhinoceros it is thick and fleshy; but of this the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> present no trace. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    the lower eyelid, which is also the largest, the third eyelid is large, and
                    covers the eye like a blind drawn before it; yet it is in some degree
                    translucent, for it is evident that birds see objects through the membrane. In
                    the owl and goatsucker the eye is closed by the depression of the upper as well
                    as the elevation of the lower eyelid.</p>
                <p>Though the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> reptiles are void of eyelids
                    entirely, in the crocodile, tortoise, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Batrachoid,</hi>
                    there are three, as in birds, the third being vertical in the two former orders,
                    and horizontal in the latter. In the S <hi rend="smallcaps">auri al</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,</hi> also, the third, which is translucent,moves
                    from before backwards by means of a single muscle, and may cover the whole eye.
                    In the lizard <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> the eyelids consist of a circular
                    veil drawn before the orbit, and perforated by a horizontal fissure, which is
                    shut by a <hi rend="italic">sphincter,</hi> and opened by a <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator</hi> and <hi rend="italic">depressor.</hi> The gecko has no movable
                    eyelid.</p>
                <p>In insects, the eye consists of innumerable hexagonal surfaces, slightly convex,
                    and mutually separated by minute furrows, containing fine hairs variable in
                    length. Each of these hexagonal surfaces, which constitute a hard, elastic, very
                    transparent membrane, may be regarded as a cornea or crystalline lens, convex
                    externally, concave within, and thicker in the centre than on the margins.
                    Immediately behind is an opaque, viscid coating, varying in colour in the
                    different species, analogous to the choroid pigment of the vertebrated animals,
                    and completely obstructing the transmission of light. Beneath this varnish are
                    short, whitish filaments, corresponding in number to the corneal surfaces, and
                    mutually joined like mosaic or tessellated pavement, separated only by the
                    dark-coloured pigment, and which appear to correspond to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >retina</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Vertebrata.</hi> Behind these again is
                    a delicate, darkcoloured membrane, which appears to correspond to the choroid;
                    and exterior to this is a membrane continuous with the optic nerve, and which
                    seems to be a <hi rend="italic">general retina,</hi> forming, by subdivision of
                    its parts on the anterior part of the choroid, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >divided</hi> or multiplied <hi rend="italic">retina.</hi> This is the structure
                    of what are named <hi rend="italic">compound eyes.</hi> That of the simple eyes
                    of insects is too minute to be accurately demonstrated; but analogy gives
                    probability to the inference that they are not dissimilar.</p>

                    part of the organ consists of three semicircular canals, with a globular

                    canals named vestibule <hi rend="italic">(vestibulum),</hi> and a conical

                    in a spiral form, and hence is denominated, as in man, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cochlea</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a name, however, which is applicable to it
                    in this class only.</p>
                <p>The organ of hearing in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> consists of the
                    same parts nearly as in man. In someî indeed, for instance the guinea-pig <hi
                    rend="italic">(cabiai),</hi> and porcupine, the <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi>
                    makes three turns and a half; and, conversely, in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea</hi> only one and a half. In most of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga,</hi> and in the hog, elephant, and horse, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cochlea</hi> is much larger in proportion than the semicircular canals; but in
                    the hare it is small, and in the mole very small. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea,</hi> while the <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi> is very large and fully
                    developed, its spiral is on the same plane throughout; and the semicircular
                    canals are so small, that their existence was tang denied by Camper, till they
                    were demonstrated by Cuvier in a foetal whale. In general the labyrinth of the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> is greatly smaller in proportion to the head
                    than in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi></p>
                <p>This part, which is membranous, is inclosed in the solid compact substance of the
                    temporal pyramid, so closely that its existence appears to be identified with
                    the latter. Researches, however, on the labyrinth in the foetus of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and especially in those of whales, demonstrate
                    the fact that it is in a completely membranous form, dis- ∙ tinct from the bony
                    inclosure; that in shape and constituent parts it exists previous to the bony
                    inclosure; and that the latter is afterwards moulded round the different parts
                    as they acquire their full developement. It is also to be observed, that in the
                    mole the semicircular canals are seen within the cranium without preparation,
                    and the <hi rend="italic">cochlea</hi> is merely inclosed in fine cellular
                    tissue. In the bat family, also, both parts are seen without bony inclosure.</p>

                    In the hog only it is occupied by a firm cancellated structure.</p>

                    articulated with each other so as to admit of motion, and are moved by the same

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tympanum</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> is
                    peculiar. It consists of a bony plate, convoluted on itself like a <hi
                    rend="italic">buccinum,</hi> unless that the thick side, instead of containing a
                    spiral cavity, is entirely solid. The opposite side is thin, with an irregular
                    margin. The anterior extremity of the <hi rend="italic">tympanum</hi> is open,
                    and there commences the Eustachian tube, which ascends along the pterygoid
                    process, and, penetrating the maxillary bone, terminates at the upper part of
                    the nose. This direction of the tube and position of its orifice is so much more
                    necessary, because, since these animals have no external bony <hi rend="italic"
                    >meatus,</hi> and the ear-hole scarcely admits a pin, the vibrations of the air
                    reach their organ of hearing entirely by the Eustachian tube, and because the
                    Eustachian tube also in these animals conveys odorous impressions to the part in
                    which the sense of smell appears to reside. The aperture by which it
                    communicates with the nose is provided with a membranous valve, which prevents
                    the water from entering when the animal expels it by his nostrils.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> of the three semicircular canals the vertical
                    is largest, and obliquely directed forwards and outwards; the second is
                    horizontal and turned outwards; and the third, which, like the first, is
                    vertical, crosses the second, and is turned in the direction opposite to that of
                    the first. The vestibule is small and nearly spherical. The bilocular cone,
                    which is obtuse at the <hi rend="italic">apex,</hi> is situate obliquely
                    backwards and outwards below the inferior part of the cranium. The longitudinal
                    septum consists of two narrow cartilaginous plates connected by a thin membrane.
                    The posterior canal is short, and, as in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    is separated from the tympanal cavity by the membrane of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >fenestra rotunda;</hi> while the anterior, which is larger, communicates
                    directly with the vestibule. The whole of these parts are inclosed, as in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> in the compact bone of the pyramid.</p>
                <p>The posterior and inferior .walls of the tympanal cavity are formed by part of
                    the occipital bone; the lateral aperture is large, and the cavity superficial;
                    and its anterior part is closed by the posterior superior <hi rend="italic"
                    >cornu</hi> of the quadrilateral bone and a membrane. The inner wall presents
                    the two apertures—the oval or vestibular, and the round or cochlear. In this
                    class, however, while the upper is round or triangular, the lower is distinctly
                    elliptical,—a disposition the reverse of what is observed in man. The Eustachian
                    tube or tympano-guttural canal is entirely osseous. The tympanal cavity contains
                    only one <hi rend="italic">ossiculum,</hi> consisting of two branches; the first
                    attached to the tympanum, corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">malleus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> the second closing by an oval or triangular plate the
                    vestibular aperture, and therefore corresponding to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >stapes</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> By Carus the incus is
                    supposed to be represented by the quadrilateral bone.</p>
                <p>The external <hi rend="italic">meatus</hi> is short, and opened by a simple
                    aperture, while the absence of external ear is compensated by a ring or zone of
                    fine elastic feathers with thin barbs, between which the air passes very easily.
                    In the owl tribe it terminates in a large cavity, the margins of which are
                    covered by a smooth valvular fold of skin.</p>
                <p>The ear of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> is remarkable for the last
                    appearance of the bilocular cone, and the first of the saccular apparatus which
                    is found in the Fishes. In the crocodile and lizard this part appears, as in
                    Birds, in the shape of a conical tube, divided by a cartilaginous partition into
                    a double canal, one separated by the membrane of the round hole from the
                    tympanal cavity, the other communicating with a membranous sac containing three
                    very small friable stones, not harder than starch. There are also three
                    semicircular canals of considerable size, each forming a large circumference. In
                    the frog and toad, while the three canals form almost a complete circle, the sac
                    contains an amylaceous friable stone; but the bilocular cone is no longer
                    observed. In the salamander, also, in which the three canals form together a
                    sort of equilateral triangle, the sac which is below contains a single
                    amylaceous stone. The same arrangement is observed in the Cartilaginous Fishes,
                    unless that the sac contains two amylaceous stones, nearly oval in shape,
                    suspended in a gelatinous semifluid pulp. In the Osseous Fishes it is a little
                    different. The three semicircular canals terminate in a membranous sac, which is
                    divided by septa into compartments which contain one, two, or three small stones
                    suspended in gelatinous fluid. These minute stones, however, instead of being
                    soft, friable, and amylaceous, as in Reptiles and cartilaginous Fishes, are as
                    hard as rock, and white as porcelain. These parts are situate on the sides of
                    the cranial cavity, and are fixed to it by cellular tissue, vessels, and osseous
                    or cartilaginous processes. This sac, in the fluid of which the extremities of
                    the auditory nerve are distributed, is believed to correspond to the bilocular
                    cone of the higher classes.</p>
                <p>These membranous cavities are contained, in the bony fishes, in the general
                    cavity óf the cranium; and while only the middle of the canals is inclosed in
                    the bone of the cranium, the extremities and the sac are quite free. The
                    sturgeon, which belongs to the cartilaginous order, is the first in which the
                    canals are entirely inclosed in the cranial cartilage; but even in this a
                    membrane is interposed between the cranium and sac, which is free. In the ray
                    and shark <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> again, these organs are entirely
                    inclosed in the cartilage of the head.</p>
                <p>The tympanal cavity, in like manner, is modified, and eventually disappears as we
                    descend in the scale. Though present in the tortoise, crocodile, and lizard
                    tribe, it is superficial and open; it becomes membranous behind in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ranine</hi> tribe, and communicates directly with the back of
                    the mouth; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> reptiles it entirely
                    disappears, so that the handle of the osseous plate by which the oval aperture
                    is closed is suspended in the soft parts with its free extremity below the skin,
                    near the articulation of the lower jaw. In the lizard tribe, also, the round or
                    cochlear aperture is seen for the last time. In the Cheloniad, for instance, the
                    Batrachoid, and the Serpentine, this aperture disappears, and the oval or
                    vestibular alone is left; and in the salamander both disappear, and there is no
                    communication between the external part of the cranium and the labyrinth. This
                    arrangement is continued in the fishes.</p>
                <p>In the molluscous animals the labyrinthine membrane is a simple sac, globular or
                    ovoidal, containing pulpy matter, in which is suspended a small body, which is
                    osseous in the <hi rend="italic">sepia</hi> and amylaceous in the many-feet <hi
                    rend="italic">(polypus),</hi> in which the filaments of the auditory nerve are
                    distributed.</p>
                <p>Our limits do not allow us to enter into the detailed description òf the organ in
                    the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Invertebrated</hi> animals.</p>
                <p>SECT. IV. THE ORGAN OF TASTE.</p>
                <p>Though the sense of taste is seated chiefly in the tongue in animals, yet that
                    organ performs, in all the classes, so important a part as an instrument of
                    prehension, that it cannot with much justice be distinguished by the former
                    title only. In the present section, therefore, we must regard it as one of
                    prehension as well as of taste.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095912?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5912-0027"/>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> the
                    tongue is a muscular organ invested by mucous papillated membrane, supported by
                    a proper bone, the hyoid, which serves as a point of support in its various
                    motions. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ranine Reptiles</hi> it is also muscular,
                    attached to the margin of the lower jaw. In the salamander, however, it is
                    attached as far as the tip, and is movable on the sides only. In the crocodile
                    it is attached so generally, both by tip and margins, that it was long asserted
                    that the animal was tongueless. In the <hi rend="italic">stellio</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">iguana</hi> it is as movable as in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi>; and in the seine and gecko to this property is added that of
                    being bifid, or divided by a longitudinal notch into two pointed tips. In the
                    ordinary lizard, tupinambis, monitor, &amp;c. the tongue is remarkable for its
                    great extensibility, and terminates in two long, flexible though
                    semi-cartiĩaginous extremities. That of the chameleon is still more extensible,
                    and forms, by a peculiar arrangement of vessels, a cup-like extremity. The
                    tongue of the blind worm <hi rend="italic">(anguis fragilis)</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">amphisbaena</hi> is also bifid at the tip. The cartilaginous
                    fishes are void of tongue, while in the bony division of the class this organ is
                    represented by a hard protuberance, attached to the middle branchial bone.</p>
                <p>In some of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> however, the tongue is not
                    exclusively muscular. In the singularly long, extensible, and tortuous tongue of
                    the giraffe, Sir Everard Home describes a peculiar arrangement of vessels, which
                    he represents as a substitute for muscular motion. Though Sir Everard docs not
                    appear to understand the exact nature of this arrangement of vessels, all the
                    circumstances tend to •show that it is that denominated erectile. These vessels,
                    from the account given, are large, numerous, and communicate freely; and it
                    would be impossible to discover the reason of such a vascular system, unless for
                    some purpose of this description. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> Comp.
                    Anat.) When the tongue is protruded it becomes perfectly black or bluish-black,
                    evidently from the injection and detention of the blood in its elongated and
                    anastomosing veins. By means of this mechanism the giraffe not only elongates
                    the tongue to the distance of about twenty inches or two feet beyond the mouth,
                    but twists it round the soft leafy twigs of the trees on which he feeds. It is
                    not improbable that a similar vascular arrangement exists, though in less
                    degree, in the tongue of the deer, and in the long projectile tongue of the
                    animals of the ant-eater tribe, as the <hi rend="italic">Tamanoir,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Tamandua, &amp;c.</hi></p>
                <p>The erectile arrangement is still more distinctly pre- . sented in the tongue of
                    the chameleon. The researches of Mr Houston of Dublin show that the tongue of
                    this animal consists of two parts,—a prehensile, which is anterior, and provided
                    with a glandular apparatus for secreting the viscid fluid by which its tip is
                    covered, and insects are entangled; and an erectile, which is posterior between
                    the prehensile and the hyoid bone, in the form of a trellis-work of innumerable
                    minute anastomosing bloodvessels, not very dissimilar to those of the cavernous
                    body in animals generally, and inclosing a central tube connecting the
                    prehensile portion to the hyoid bone. The effect of this arrangement is, that
                    when the vascular network is injected with blood, the anterior part of the
                    tongue is rapidly darted out at the insects on which the animal lives. The
                    injection of these vessels, and the consequent projection of the tongue, is not
                    independent altogether of the will of the animal; for the veins by which the
                    blood is returned pass through a slit in the tendon of the internal
                    cerato-maxillary muscles, which are always contracted in order to protrude the
                    hyoid style, and thereby tend, by compressing the veins, to inject the erectile
                    part, and project the’ tongue. <hi rend="italic">(Trans.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >P.</hi><hi rend="italic">I. Acad.</hi> 1828, and <hi rend="italic">Dublin
                    Hospital Reports,</hi> vol. v. p. 487.) The same arrangement is in all
                    probability found in several of the lizards, the tongues of which, like that of
                    the chameleon, are darted out suddenly, and become of a dark-blue colour at the
                    moment of projection.</p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the tongue is invested by a
                    papillated muco-villous membrane, in which the papillae are of the same general
                    characters as in man—granular, mushroom-like, or fungiform, tubercular or
                    calycoid, and conical or acuminated. The only differences consist in the size
                    and abundance of the fungiform <hi rend="italic">papillae,</hi> in the number of
                    the calycoid and the mode of their arrangement, and in the shape of the conical
                    papillae and the mode of their termination. In the Ruminants especially, the
                    conical papillae are numerous, long, slightly incurvated, and each terminating
                    in a horny but flexible style slightly incurvated backwards. The tongue of the
                    dolphin and porpoise, examined even by the microscope, presents no distinct
                    conical papillae, but is covered by minute eminences, each penetrated by a small
                    aperture.</p>
                <p>In the tongue of the dog <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> there is a ligamentous
                    substance extended longitudinally from the hyoid bone to the tip of the member.
                    This, which has been vulgarly distinguished by the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >worm</hi> of the tongue, and has been absurdly supposed to be the seat of
                    hydrophobic <hi rend="italic">rabies,</hi> is merely a central pillar of support
                    for the muscular fibres to act with greater steadiness and effect, and which
                    enables the animal to protrude and expand the tongue in lapping water or other
                    fluids better than he could have otherwise done. A similar central ligament is
                    found in the opossum.</p>
                <p>The tongue of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is generally more or less horny,
                    and almost cartilaginous. That of the woodpecker and wryneck is peculiar in
                    consisting of two parts,—a basilar or posterior, loose and fleshy; and an
                    anterior projectile, long, smooth, acuminated, and covered laterally with four
                    or five stiff spines directed backwards, which make the organ a sort of barbed
                    arrow. The soft, loose, or basilar part of the tongue contains the aperture of
                    the glottis; and the surface is covered with minute spines pointed backwards,
                    and each of which is placed in the centre of a fleshy <hi rend="italic"
                    >papilla.</hi></p>
                <p>As a prehensile organ of very singular construction, the trunk of the elephant
                    deserves particular notice; and it cannot be more conveniently introduced than
                    under the present section, since it is used not only to convey food, but drink,
                    into the mouth. The trunk may be described as a cylindrical tubular organ,
                    consisting of integument, a sort of fibro-cartilage, muscles, fat, and a
                    membrane of villous character internally. This tube contains two long canals
                    continued from the nostrils, parallel to the axis of the trunk, and separated
                    throughout by a partition of adipose substance about two fifths of an inch
                    thick. From the extremity to the middle part of the intermaxillary bone, in
                    which the tusks are fixed, these canals are nearer the anterior-superior than
                    the posterior-inferior part of the tube, the latter wall being thickest; and
                    their diameter is the same throughout. At this part they undergo a sudden
                    incurvation, approaching the anterior surface of the intermaxillary bone, and
                    form a semicircular bend with the convexity turned forwards. Here also they are
                    so narrow that, without a muscular effort on the part of the animal to dilate
                    them, fluids could not ascend beyond this point; and hence this forms the only
                    valvular contrivance, either to impede the progress of fluids upwards, or to
                    propel them downwards, at the will of the animal.</p>
                <p>Above this curvature each canal is dilated before the upper part of the
                    intermaxillary bone, and again is contracted where it bends back to enter the
                    bony nostril; and the curvature is protected before by the nasal cartilage,
                    which is oval, convex in the male, and flat in the female.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095925?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5925-0028"/>
                <p>Both canals are lined by a dry, greenish-yellow coloured membrane, marked with
                    superficial intersections <hi rend="italic">(rugae),</hi> inclosing rhomboidal
                    spaces, and some venous branches.</p>
                <p>Though the muscular <hi rend="italic">fasciculi</hi> of the trunk are numerous,
                    they may be referred to two orders,—those forming the substance or inner part of
                    the organ, and those by which it is invested. The former, which are transverse,
                    and cut the <hi rend="italic">axis</hi> in different directions, consist of
                    numerous small muscular packets proceeding in various directions, some running
                    from the inner membrane to the circumference of the tube, others directly from
                    right to left, and others crossing the two former obliquely. All these little
                    muscles are inclosed in cellular tissue, containing white homogeneous fat; and
                    all of them terminate in slender tendons, some of which cross the layers of the
                    longitudinal muscles in their course to the external covering, while others are
                    attached to the internal membrane. Cuvier calculates the number of these minute
                    transverse muscles in the trunk of the elephant to be not fewer than 30,000 or
                    40,000. (Plate XXXVĲ. fig. 13.)</p>
                <p>The longitudinal muscles, which are external, may be distinguished into anterior,
                    posterior, and lateral bundles. The first extend from the anterior surface of
                    the frontal bone, above the nasal bones and cartilages, in parallel bundles,
                    connected by tendinous intersections downwards on the trunk. The posterior
                    extend from the posterior surface and inferior margin of the intermaxillary
                    bones, and form two layers which meet on the median line along the lower surface
                    of the trunk. The lateral muscles form two pairs, one of which, descending
                    between the anterior and posterior muscles to the middle of the trunk, may be
                    regarded as a continuation of the orbicular muscle of the lips, or the
                    representative of the <hi rend="italic">nasalis labii superioris</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> while the other, which is attached to the anterior margin
                    of the orbit, and is expanded over the root of the former, may be supposed to
                    correspond to the <hi rend="italic">levator</hi> of the upper lip.</p>
                <p>The whole of these muscles are supplied by a very large branch of the
                    infraorbital or second branch of the trifacial nerve, which, entering on each
                    side between the lateral and superior muscle, is distributed to the whole of the
                    trunk.</p>
                <p>With such a construction, it is not difficult to understand the numerous motions
                    of the elephant’s trunk. While the longitudinal muscles are employed either to
                    shorten the tube, to bend it upwards or downwards or to the side, or by means of
                    the tendinous intersections to give it peculiar inflections, it is manifest that
                    the transverse ones, which act as antagonists to the longitudinal, may also
                    either dilate or close the canals, or incurvate or alter the direction of
                    particular parts.</p>
                <p>The foot of the <hi rend="italic">Lacerta Gecko</hi> and the house-fly presents a
                    prehensile apparatus of peculiar construction for .walking along surfaces, in
                    opposition to the action of gravity. In the former animal the plantar surface of
                    each toe presents sixteen transverse slits, leading into an equal number of
                    pouches, which by means of appropriate muscles are capable of forming an equal
                    number of <hi rend="italic">vacua,</hi> so that the atmospheric pressure is
                    employed with muscular effort to support the animal in his unnatural position. A

                <p>CHAP. IV.—COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE ORGANS OF</p>
                <p>VOICE.</p>
                <p>Under this head our limits allow us to mention very few circumstances.</p>
                <p>In the American long-tailed monkeys <hi rend="italic">(sapajous)</hi> the
                    cuneiform cartilages form, by means of adipose cellular tissue, before the upper
                    extremity of the ventricle of the <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> a large
                    cushion like a spherical segment, which, touching that of the opposite side,
                    causes the air to whistle through the canal in its course to the mouth, and
                    occasions the flute-like voice of some of these animals, as the weeper <hi
                    rend="italic">(s. apella)</hi> and the capuchin <hi rend="italic">(s.
                    capucina).</hi> In the howler <hi rend="italic">(s.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >seniculus),</hi> so remarkable for its morning and evening yelling, though the
                    larynx is similar in general characters to that of the common <hi rend="italic"
                    >sapajou,</hi> in having the two rounded cushions before the ventricles, the
                    hyoid bone is arched in the form of a spherical chamber, with a large
                    quadrilateral aperture, and each ventricle opens into a membranous sac, lying
                    between the <hi rend="italic">epiglottis</hi> and the adjoining wing of the
                    thyroid cartilage. The air, which passes between the vocal chords, is therefore
                    partly impelled into this osseous and elastic cavity of the hyoid bone, and
                    probably by its resonance in this situation gives the voice of these animals the
                    deep-toned howl by which they are known in the American forests.</p>
                <p>Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> in the dog the cuneiform cartilages
                    are large, the arytenoid small, the vocal chords well marked, and the ventricles
                    deep. In the feline tribe the anterior ligaments, though destitute of cuneiform
                    cartilages, are thick, and separated from the back of the epiglottis by a broad,
                    deep furrow. The posterior ligaments, though neither free nor sharp-edged, are
                    distinguished from the anterior by an appearance of greater firmness, more
                    regular fibres, and by an intermediate furrow. The approximation of the anterior
                    ligaments towards the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi> forms a sonorous vault, in
                    which the air may be forcibly vibrated by the posterior. In the bear the
                    cuneiform cartilages assume the shape of styles, and their posterior extremity
                    forms a distinct eminence, not above, but without the arytenoid cartilages,
                    while the ventricles are merely deep fissures.</p>
                <p>The kangaroo has neither cuneiform cartilage, anterior ligament, nor ventricle;
                    and it may even be said to be void of vocal chord, while the margins of the <hi
                    rend="italic">glottis</hi> are much separated in the middle. This arrangement
                    appears to indicate that the animal is almost destitute of voice. In the
                    opossum, in which there is merely a small inferior ligament susceptible of
                    tension, voice is limited to a whistling sound.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> in which the cuneiform cartilages
                    are completely concealed by the mucous membrane, there is neither superior
                    ligament nor proper ventricle; but an aperture in the lateral wall of the
                    laryngeal membrane, above the vocal chord, leads into a large, oblong, sinuous
                    cavity, situate between this membrane and the thyroid cartilage, and covered
                    chiefly by the thyro-arytenoid muscles, by which it may be compressed; and above
                    the anterior commissure of the vocal chords, or below the base of the <hi
                    rend="italic">epiglottis,</hi> is an aperture on the mesial plane, leading into
                    a cavity below the vault formed by the anterior margin of the thyroid cartilage.
                    This cavity, which may be named the infrathyroid, is superficial in the horse,
                    and its aperture is large; while in the ass, with a small, round aperture, the
                    cavity is large, capacious, and globular in every direction, and allows the
                    latter animal to make his voice re-ecħo in the singularly harsh sound
                    denominated the <hi rend="italic">bray.</hi> Conversely, though the lateral
                    cavities are equally large in both animals, the apertures in those of the ass
                    are small, round, and situate nearer ∖ <hi rend="italic">hz. epiglottis</hi>
                    than the vocal chord, while those of the horse are large, oblong, and situate
                    immediately above the vocal chord on each side. On the latter peculiarity
                    appears to depend the neigh of the horse.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> we recognise neither vocal chords nor
                    <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> that is to say, an aperture variable in size ac
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095938?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5938-0029"/>
                    cording to the will of the animal; but the superior part of the <hi
                    rend="italic">trachea,</hi> which represents the larynx, forms a hollow pyramid
                    or funnel, rising into the posterior part of the nostrils, in which only it
                    opens, while on the sides is left a passage for the food. This pyramidal funnel
                    is formed by an elongated triangular cartilage, corresponding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">epiglottis,</hi> attached by membrane to the arytenoid cartilages,
                    which also take the shape of scalene triangles, with the small side connected to
                    the cricoid cartilage. Strictly speaking, therefore, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cetacea</hi> have no larynx, and probably no vocal organ; and the superior part
                    of the <hi rend="italic">trajchea,</hi> with the nostrils, serves merely to
                    admit the atmospheric air for the purposes of respiration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> are distinguished by possessing not only a <hi
                    rend="italic">glottis</hi> or laryngeal aperture similar to that of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> at the upper end of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >trachea,</hi> but a second, denominated the inferior <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">larynx,</hi> at the lower end, near its
                    bifurcation. The former, which is composed of four cartilages, or six, according
                    as the cricoid consists of one or three pieces, on the middle of the
                    posterior.part of which is a small round bone, articulated with two oblong
                    longitudinal bones, parallel, and forming between them in the posterior wall of
                    the windpipe a longitudinal slit, susceptible of approximation by means of
                    muscles, is intended merely to regulate the admission of air into the windpipe,
                    or its expulsion from that tube, and to close more or less accurately its
                    superior orifice.</p>
                <p>The inferior larynx consists of a membrane projecting from each side of the
                    inferior aperture of the <hi rend="italic">trachea.</hi> This aperture is
                    divided into two, occasionally by an osseous anterior-posterior middle bar,
                    occasionally by the angle at which the two bronchial tubes unite. Since the
                    first bronchial arc has the same curvature as the last tracheal ring, the second
                    and third, which are arcs of larger circles, are less convex without, but more
                    prominent within, than the former. Over this prominence the tracheobronchial
                    membrane forms a fold, which, half closing on each side the inferior tracheal
                    aperture, forms a plate susceptible of vibrating by the motion of the air, and
                    producing sound. This apparatus, which constitutes what is named the <hi
                    rend="italic">inferior larynx,</hi> or rather <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> is
                    of two kinds, one void of proper muscles, the other provided with muscles.</p>
                <p>In the former kind of larynx the state of the glottis is altered only by those
                    muscles which depress and elevate the trachea. The depressors are two pairs, the
                    sternotracheal and the glosso-tracheal, the latter attached to the bifurcated
                    bone and <hi rend="italic">trachea.</hi> There are no proper elevators; but the
                    windpipe is raised by the mylo-hyoid muscle through the ligaments which connect
                    the hyoid bone to the superior larynx. In the quiescent or relaxed state, and
                    while the trachea is depressed, the bronchial rings approximate, and the second
                    and third even gliding below the first, the <hi rend="italic">glottis</hi> may
                    be elongated. When the trachea is elevated by these pairs of muscles, the <hi
                    rend="italic">bronchi</hi> are at the same time dragged upwards, and the second
                    and third arcs are separated from the first; and while the external prominence
                    of the glottidal membrane diminishes in length, its tension is augmented. These
                    forms of larynx without proper muscles may yet be subdivided into two sorts, as
                    they have or have not lateral pouches, membranous or osseous. These are observed
                    in the male duck <hi rend="italic">(anas)</hi> and the merganser <hi
                    rend="italic">(mergus),</hi> but never in the female; and to this perhaps the
                    harsh and deep tone of the voice of the male bird is to be ascribed. The larynx
                    without muscles and without pouch is observed in all the gallinaceous order
                    without exception.</p>
                <p>The forriιs of larynx provided with proper muscles may be distinguished into
                    three subdivisions.</p>
                <p>The first, which has only one proper muscle on each side, is observed in the
                    whole of the falcon <hi rend="italic">genus,</hi> e. g. the eagle, hawk, falcon,
                    buzzard, sparrow-hawk, and goss-hawk; in the owl <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>
                    and the majority of the waders and swimmers, as the heron, bustard, woodcock,
                    lapwing,, rail, coot, gull, cormorant, and some of the passerine birds. In these
                    birds, in which the motions of the lower ]arynx are necessarily limited, the
                    voice is not variable or extensive in its notes.</p>
                <p>The second form of <hi rend="italic">larynx</hi> has three pair of proper
                    muscles, a <hi rend="italic">constrictor</hi> of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis,</hi> an auxiliary constrictor, and a <hi rend="italic">laxator</hi> or
                    opener of the glottis. This kind of larynx is observed in the whole of the
                    parrot <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> and psittacoid birds generally, as the
                    toucan, macaw, calao, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>In the third kind of musculo-membranous <hi rend="italic">larynx</hi> there are
                    no fewer than five pair of muscles, the longitudinal <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator</hi> of the demiannular cartilages, the posterior <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator</hi> of the same cartilages, the small <hi rend="italic">levator,</hi>
                    the oblique <hi rend="italic">levator,</hi> and the transverse <hi rend="italic"
                    >levator.</hi> This quinque-muscular larynx is found not only in all the birds
                    properly named whistlers or warblers, as the nightingale, hedge-sparrow,
                    blackbird, thrush, goldfinch, lark, linnet, canary, chaffinch, &amp;c., but in
                    others whose tones are more monotonous, as the swallow, sparrow, stork,
                    crossbill, &amp;c., and even in some the tones of which are harsh and positively
                    disagreeable, <hi rend="italic">e. g.</hi> the jay, magpie, crow, raven,
                    &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The differences remarked in the notes of these three divisions of birds with the
                    quinque-muscular larynx depend not so much on anatomical peculiarities as on the
                    <hi rend="italic">timbre</hi> of their larynx, and on the mobility of the <hi
                    rend="italic">trachea</hi> in relation to the larynx, and on the tracheal
                    membrane having dilatations and contractions.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the inferior larynx of birds is to be regarded in three lights:
                    1⅛Z, As the reed of a wind-instrument, like a hautboy or clarionet, in which the
                    notes vary as the lower glottis varies in its position to the windpipe; 2&lt;∕,
                    as an instrument susceptible of uttering different tones, according to the
                    distance between the mouthpiece and vent, or as the windpipe is elongated or
                    shortened; and, 3&lt;Z, as an instrument capable of uttering different notes by
                    varying the diameter of the mouth-piece, or as the superior <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis</hi> is widened or contracted.</p>
                <p>The only bird in which the inferior larynx is wanting is the vulture.</p>
                <p>The vocal organ of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> consists of the
                    superior larynx only, analogous to that of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia.</hi> This is a cartilaginous apparatus, composed in general of five
                    distinct pieces at least in the large individuals of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Saurial</hi><hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> as the crocodile and alligator, and
                    forming a broad cavity behind, before a narrow slit, bounded by two vertical
                    pillars. The <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> however, is entirely membranous;
                    and there are neither vocal chords nor ventricles. There are nevertheless two
                    muscles, one for opening and another for shutting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >glottis.</hi> When these act, and the air is made to vibrate against the
                    anterior pillars, it gives a slight whistling sound only. In the iguana,
                    tupinambis, lizard, tortoise, and serpent, the arrangement of parts is nearly
                    the same; and these animals, therefore, can utter only slight hissing sounds. In
                    the chameleon the pillars are furnished with a tense, vibrating membrane, a
                    fleshy tubercle which contracts the <hi rend="italic">glottis,</hi> and a
                    membranous pouch opening below, between the lower laryngeal cartilage and the
                    first tracheal ring. In the frog tribe, so remarkable for their croaking noise,
                    the vocal chords are large and prominent. The males have also two membranous
                    pouches, opening by a small aperture, not in the larynx, but deep in the lateral
                    part of the mouth. When the frog croaks these pouches are inflated, and swell
                    the skin on each side below the ear. Though these sacs are wanting in the female
                    frog, and toad both male and female, as well as the tree-frog, there is beneath
                    the throat a single pouch on the median plane.</p>

                <p>CHAP. V.—COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY.</p>
                <p>A general view of the nervous systems in different classes of animals shows that
                    the only common part is an azygous tubercle, situate at the anterior extremity
                    of the spinal chord, connected by means of two lateral bundles or peduncles to
                    the rest of the system. This mass, which corresponds to what is denominated the
                    <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> in man, is connected in the vertebrated
                    red-blooded animals with several pairs of tubercles, forming generally a larger
                    mass than itself, and connected to the rest of the system by two longitudinal
                    bundles or limbs, which mingle with and intersect those of the cerebellum. These
                    anterior-superior tubercles, which constitute the brain proper, present numerous
                    modifications in figure, disposition, and magnitude, and even in presence, in
                    the different orders of the animal world.</p>
                <p>In the vertebrated animals the brain or central part of the nervous system
                    consists of the vertebral or funicular portion, named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spinal chord,</hi> and the cranial or cephalic portion, properly denominated
                    the brain.</p>
                <p>The funicular portion has the shape of a <hi rend="italic">cylinder</hi>
                    flattened on its superior or dorsal and inferior or sternal surfaces. It
                    consists of two similar chordiform productions, united on the mesial plane, and
                    marked at the line of junction by linear longitudinal furrows, of which the
                    superior is most deep and distinct. This, however, which was observed by Blasius
                    in several animals, is denied by Bellingeri, who asserts, from various
                    observations, that though in some parts the superior furrow penetrates more
                    deeply than the inferior, in the general course of the chord the latter is the
                    deepest. <hi rend="italic">( De Medulla</hi><hi rend="italic">Spinali

                    Bellingeri, Aug. Taurinorum, 1823.) This discordance appears to depend on the
                    circumstance that the sternal or inferior furrow is in truth deeper and more
                    distinct in man, the monkey tribe, and a few <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi>
                    than the dorsal; whereas in most others/ as the coati, raccoon, horse, &amp;c.
                    the dorsal furrow is of the same depth as the sternal; and in the mole, murine,
                    and leporine <hi rend="italic">genera,</hi> it is deeper and more distinct than
                    the sternal. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> and the cartilaginous <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the sternal furrow is deepest; in Reptiles the
                    dorsal and sternal are nearly equally deep; and in the osseous <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the dorsal is the deepest. On each side of the
                    chord, also, there is a slight longitudinal depression commonly called the
                    lateral <hi rend="italic">(sulcus lateralis).</hi></p>
                <p>The breadth and thickness of the spinal chord vary in different regions. The
                    lower cervical portion is in general the broadest and thickest; at the upper
                    dorsal region it is somewhat more slender, becoming thicker again at the lower
                    dorsal region; and after again becoming more slender in the lumbar region, it is
                    expanded into a filamentous brush-like termination of different lengths in
                    different classes, and even in different orders. These enlargements at the
                    superior dorsal and lumbar regions are believed by Serres to correspond with the
                    origins of the thoracic and pelvic extremities; and each swelling he represents
                    to predominate over the other, as the animal habitually employs the one or the
                    other kind of members. It is remarkable in illustration of this principle, that
                    in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> which are void, of pelvic extremities,
                    the lumbar enlargement is wanting; and in the amphibious <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia,</hi> the pelvic extremities of which are feeble, this enlargement is
                    also inconsiderable.</p>
                <p>The spinal or funicular brain consists of white cerebral matter on the surface
                    and gray matter in the centre, the former being most abundant, unless in the
                    sacral region, where both are nearly equal in quantity, or the gray rather
                    predominates. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the gray matter is in
                    greater proportion to the white than in the other three classes, in which the
                    white matter progressively augments.</p>
                <p>The sternal and dorsal longitudinal lines indicate the original formation of the
                    chord in two lateral portions, with an intermediate cavity denominated the
                    spinal canal. This exists only during the formation of the chord in the human
                    foetus, in some of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> when adult, and in the
                    other three classes. Its disappearance in the human foetus, and in that of
                    various <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> is represented by Serres to depend
                    on the progressive deposition of gray cerebral matter on the inner or central
                    surfaces of the component pillars of the chord. Though obliterated in man, in
                    whom the gray matter is abundant, it is not hermetically sealed in the monkey
                    tribe, in which some traces of it are left. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Amphibia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> it is larger than in the
                    monkey tribe; its diameter augments in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi>
                    feline, canine, and ursine, in which the gray matter is thinner than in the
                    former; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> it is said to be largest
                    of all among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia.</hi> Lastly, in the birds,
                    reptiles, and fishes generally, in which the gray matter is scanty and the white
                    predominates, the spinal canal is large and distinct.</p>
                <p>The lateral regions of the spinal chord are connected with a double series of
                    nerves by means of two rows of nervous filaments, an anterior and posterior,
                    separated by a longitudinal membrane of fine white tissue, with a serrated or
                    festooned border. This membrane, which is named the denticulate, is the same in
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds.</hi> That
                    these nerves do not issue from the spinal chord, must be inferred not only from
                    the phenomena attending the original developement of the nervous system, but
                    especially from what is observed of their comparative size, and that of the
                    chord in the inferior classes. In that of fishes especially, while the chord is
                    small and slender, and by no means fills the vertebral canal, it is remarkable
                    that the nerves which supply the voluntary muscles are exceedingly large. Thus,
                    in many both of the cartilaginous and osseous divisions, as the sturgeon,
                    dog-fish, ray, wolf-fish, cod, &amp;c. the nerves which supply the pectoral fins
                    are large, broad chords, two or three of which seem to contain more substance
                    than the whole spinal chord itself.</p>
                <p>The chord is expanded at its cephalic end into a thick eminence denominated the
                    spinal bulb, the surface of which presents three pairs of eminences. These
                    eminences are developed in various degrees in the different classes and orders.
                    In some of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the anterior pyramids or
                    pyramidal bodies are more distinct than in man, for instance the ape tribe, the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea, Carnivora,</hi> Ruminants, and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi> They are small in most Birds, all the Reptiles,
                    and the Cartilaginous <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi> In the osseous division
                    they assume the appearance of two parallel chords at the base of the brain. The
                    olivary bodies, less prominent in the ape than in man, are still less so in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> and progressively through the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphibia, Carnivora,</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,
                    Rodentia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Insecti-vora,</hi> and the other three
                    great classes of vertebrated animals. Conversely, the restiform bodies or
                    posterior pyramidal eminences, from man through the ape tribe, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea, Amphibia,</hi> to the Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Carnivora,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> increase in size.</p>
                <p>Though the brain of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> presents the same
                    parts, and is arranged nearly in the same order, as that of man, it varies in
                    its proportions to the rest of the body; in its proportions to the <hi
                    rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> and spinal bulb; in general figure; in the
                    presence, absence, and number of convolutions; in the configuration of its
                    central surface; in the communication of its central with its external surface;
                    and in the manner of its connections with the cerebral nerves. As it is
                    impossible in this sketch to examine all <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193095964?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-5964-0031"/> these
                    circumstances fully, we shall confine our attention to the notiee of a few
                    only.</p>
                <p>It is not easy to ascertain the proportion of the mass of the brain to that of
                    the rest of the body. Excluding as mueh as possible the ordinary sources of
                    fallacy, in small animals the brain is proportionally larger; yet in this
                    respect man is surpassed only by a small number of animals, habitually lean, and
                    with little musele, as bats, small birds, &amp;c. While the proportion of brain
                    in man to that of the whole person varies from a 22d to a 35th part, that of the
                    monkey tribe varies from a 22d to a 42d part; and in the baboon it is only the
                    104th part of the body. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> have in general the largest proportion of brain,
                    and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> the smallest; and while the hare
                    has a brain about the 300th part of the size of the body, that of the elephant,
                    the most sagaeious of animals, is about the 500th part the size of his body. It
                    is also remarkable, that while the brain of the horse is only a 400th part of
                    the size of his body, that of the ass amounts to a 254th part. The Reptile brain
                    becomes excessively small, that of the turtle being rather more than the 5000th
                    part the size of his body; and in some of the Fishes, not all, it appears to
                    attain the maximum of decreasing proportion, that of the tunny being so small as
                    the 37,000th part of his body, while the brain of thė earp is so large as to
                    approach the proportion of the elephant. It may be doubted whether, under sueh
                    circumstances, any precise conclusions can be drawn from results so variable and
                    so little to be expected.</p>
                <p>The proportional weight of the brain to that of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cerebellum</hi> is, excepting in the ease of one speeies of ape, the <hi
                    rend="italic">saimiri,</hi> greater in man than in any other animal. The ox is
                    equal to man in this respeet, and the dog approaches him. The animals most
                    remote are the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> as the beaver, rat, and
                    mouse, &amp;e.</p>
                <p>The convolutions, which are so numerous and so deep in man, diminish both in
                    number and size in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Carnivora,</hi> and are nearly obliterated in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia.</hi> In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ungulated</hi>
                    animals, however, and especially in the Ruminants and the horse, the
                    convolutions are numerous; and even in the dolphin among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi> they are numerous and deep. In all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> is
                    foliated.</p>
                <p>On the whole, the peculiar character of the brain of man and the ape family
                    consists in the existence of the posterior lobe and digital eavity. The brain of
                    the Zoo-PHAGA is remarkable for the small size of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nates</hi> or anterior pair of the bigeminous eminences in proportion to the
                    <hi rend="italic">testes</hi> or posterior pair. In the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Rodentia</hi> the organ is distinguished for the large size of the <hi
                    rend="italic">nates,</hi> and the want or superficial nature of the
                    convolutions. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ungulated</hi> division of animals,
                    <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> the
                    brain is remarkable for the large size of the <hi rend="italic">nates</hi>
                    combined with the number and depth of the convolutions; while that of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> is remarkable for its height and breadth, and the
                    want of olfactory nerves. It is further to be observed as a general distinction
                    between herbivorous and carnivorous or zoophagous animals, that in the former
                    the <hi rend="italic">nates</hi> are larger than the <hi rend="italic"
                    >testes,</hi> whereas in the latter the <hi rend="italic">testes</hi> are
                    largest. Lastly, Man and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> are the only
                    animals whieh possess genuine olfactory nerves. In the other quadrupeds they are
                    represented by the mammillary processes of the ancients; and in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cetacea</hi> they have not yet been unequivocally
                    demonstrated.</p>
                <p>The brain of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> is at onee recognised by consisting
                    of six distinet tubercles, two representing the cerebral hemispheres, two
                    representing the optic eminences, one the cerebellum, and one the bulb of the
                    chord. The hemispheres are void of convolutions, but the cerebellum is marked by
                    transverse parallel striae corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">lamince</hi>
                    of the mammiferous brain. There is neither middle band <hi rend="italic">(corpus
                    callosum),</hi> vault, nor <hi rend="italic">septum.</hi> The ceiling or vault
                    of the aqueduct or passage from the third to the fourth ventriele is not, as in
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> surmounted by the bigeminous eminences,
                    but is merely a thin plate corresponding to the valve. Eaeh optic eminence
                    contains a cavity eommunieating with the others by the Sylvian aqueduct. The
                    anterior eminences <hi rend="italic">(corpora striata)</hi> are not striated
                    with alternate white and gray matter, as in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia.</hi> Between the anterior and the optie eminences are four rounded
                    tubercles, best seen in the ostrieh, which are to be regarded as entirely
                    heterologous to the structure of the mammiferous brain, and connecting the
                    cerebral structure of <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> with that of Reptiles and
                    Fishes, in which also these tubercles are observed.</p>
                <p>The Reptile brain is smooth and uneonvoluted. The optie eminences, which are
                    situate behind the hemispheres, are uncovered, and contain a ventriele
                    communicating with the third. At the extremities of the latter are the anterior
                    and posterior commissures, but there is neither soft commissure nor bigeminous
                    eminences. The hemisphere presents an anterior eminence, which, however, in the
                    brain of Birds is unstriated. The eerebral valve is, like that of <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> unsurmounted by bigeminous eminences.</p>
                <p>In the elass of <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> the structure becomes still more
                    simple. The tubercles of which the brain consists are plaeed in a row; and their
                    increase in number only demonstrates the decomposition of the organ, and its
                    resolution into simple integrant parts. The two representing the hemispheres are
                    ovoidal, unconvoluted, and contain a ventriele, in which is seen the eminence
                    analogous to the striated bodies. The optic eminences, situate beneath the
                    hemispheres, though small, contain eaeh a eavity, as in the two oviparous
                    classes already noticed. Lastly, there are in several <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera,</hi> under the eommon vault of the hemispheres, occasionally two,
                    occasionally four tubercles, variable in shape and proportions, but which would
                    be analogous to the bigeminous eminences, were they not, like those already
                    mentioned in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds,</hi> situate before and above the optie
                    chambers. In the cartilaginous fishes, in which these tubercles are not
                    observed, the anterior or striated eminences are obliterated. The <hi
                    rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> does not cover the fourth ventriele.</p>
                <p>Behind the <hi rend="italic">cerebellum</hi> are two tubereles, which in the ray
                    give origin to the fifth pair, and are very distinet in the pike, trout, salmon,
                    and pereh. These tubereles are peculiar to this class.</p>
                <p>The eavities in the interior of the optie eminences in Birds, Reptiles, and
                    Fishes, are observed in the foetal brain of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> during its early growth.</p>
                <p>It is almost superfluous to mention, that, in the two warm-blooded classes,
                    Mammalia and Birds, the brain, with its investments, fills completely the
                    cranial and vertebral cavities. In the Reptiles, however, in which the brain
                    does not approach the cranial walls, we remark the first departure from this
                    arrangement; and in the Fishes it is so completely violated that the brain and
                    chord oceupy but a small proportion of the eranio-vertebral cavity; and between
                    the former and the osseous walls there is a quantity of fine but very loose
                    filamentous tissue, containing in its cells a large quantity of pellueid fluid.
                    Though this arrangement gives this the appearance of a white jelly-like
                    substance; it is not gelatinous, as is generally represented, but merely a
                    pellucid fluid, sometimes pale straw-coloured, occasionally with a reddish tint,
                    contained in numerous eommunieating eavities of a tissue which appears to repre∙

                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pia</hi><hi rend="italic">mater</hi> in the reptiles and
                    fishes is reduced to a filamento-vascular web, accompanying the
                    blood-vessels.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">dura mater</hi> undergoes some peculiar modifications in
                    different orders. In the duckbill a bony plate is contained between the <hi
                    rend="italic">laminae</hi> of the falx; and the same structure is found in the
                    porpoise, perhaps in the other <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea.</hi> An osseous <hi
                    rend="italic">tentorium</hi> with a quadrangular aperture is found in the coaïta
                    and marten, and the feline and ursine families; and an osseous partition
                    consisting of three parts is found in the dog, horse, Cape ant-eater <hi
                    rend="italic">(orycteropus),</hi> the wombat, and the seal. The bony <hi
                    rend="italic">tentorium</hi> îs also found in the woodcock and others of the
                    feathered class. In the red but cold-blooded animals the <hi rend="italic">dura
                    mater</hi> forms neither falciform nor tentorial process.</p>
                <p>On the nerves or ramified chords of the nervous system a few words must suffice.
                    In fishes the tenth or pneumogastric consists not of a common trunk, but of
                    three orders of filaments, the first and largest of which are distributed to the
                    gills, and correspond to the pulmonary nerves of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi>; the second, slender, are distributed to the muscles of the
                    tongue and the surface of the <hi rend="italic">oesophagus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and the third terminate in a large nerve which traverses the body
                    longitudinally immediately beneath the lateral line. The phrenic nerve is
                    wanting in birds, reptiles, and fishes.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca</hi> the nervous system consists of a number
                    of whitish cerebral masses distributed in different parts of the body, with one
                    or two more conspicuous than the rest, and supposed therefore to represent the
                    brain, placed transversely over the oesophagus, which it encompasses with a
                    nervous collar.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Articulata</hi> the nervous system consists of two
                    long chords extending along the belly, and expanded at various intervals into
                    gangliform knots or enlargements. The first of these, which is situate on the
                    oesophagus, rarely exceeds the others in size. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophytes</hi> hitherto examined the nervous system assumes either a radiated
                    or an arborescent form.</p>

                <p>COMPARATIVE ANATOMY OF THE ENTROPHIC ORGANS.</p>

                    TEETH.</p>
                <p>Though genuine teeth are found in three classes of animals only, viz. the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles,</hi> and the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> yet all the orders of these classes are not
                    provided with teeth. Thus, among the first class, the ant-eater tribe, the
                    pangolin, the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> and the whales—among the second the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cheloniads</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> and among the third the sturgeon—are
                    altogether destitute of these organs. In all the invertebrated classes, the
                    jaws, when present, are provided with notches varying in number. The <hi
                    rend="italic">echinodermata</hi> alone have genuine teeth, inserted in a
                    mechanical apparatus very different from ordinary jaws.</p>
                <p>Though in general structure the teeth of the lower animals resemble those of man,
                    in some respects they differ Considerably. These varieties consist either in
                    some change or modification of the constituent parts of the teeth, or in the
                    addition of some other substance to those parts.</p>
                <p>The first variety to be noticed is of the former description.</p>
                <p>Though in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Qüadrumana</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga</hi> the bony matter of the teeth is quite similar to that of man, in
                    Other orders this substance appears in the form of a very hard, compact, and
                    more regularly fibrous substance than bone, and to which the name of ivory <hi
                    rend="italic">(ebur)</hi> is applied. It is chiefly in the canine or tearing
                    teeth that this substance is found to represent the bony pillar of the teeth;
                    and it is principally among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> and some
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Amphibia</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cetacea,</hi>
                    that this change is observed.</p>
                <p>The ivory of the elephant is the most tender, and that which most rapidly becomes
                    yellow on exposure to air. It is readily distinguished from the ivory of other
                    animals by the curve lines which radiate from the centre to the circumference of
                    the tooth in various directions, and which form by intersection regular
                    curvilinear lozenges.</p>
                <p>The ivory of the hippopotamus is greatly harder and whiter, and is on that
                    account preferably employed for the preparation of artificial teeth. A
                    transverse section of this substance shows <hi rend="italic">striae</hi>
                    extremely delicate and regular. In this animal, also, not only the canine but
                    the incisor teeth consist of this substance. The tusks of the Ethiopian boar <hi
                    rend="italic">(sus</hi><hi rend="italic">AEthiopicus)</hi> consist óf ivory
                    similar to that of the hippopotamus. In those of the ordinary boar, though no
                    <hi rend="italic">striae</hi> are recognised, there is sometimes a mixture of
                    brown substance disposed in layers. The ivory of the teeth of the morse, though
                    void of <hi rend="italic">stnae,</hi> is compact and susceptible of polish
                    nearly as brilliant as that of the hippopotamus; and its character is, that the
                    central pillar of the tooth consists of minute round grains, indiscriminately
                    aggregated, like pebbles in puddingstone. The axis or pillar of the molar teeth
                    of this animal, which are without internal cavity, consists of similar minute
                    grains. The ivory of the dugong is homogeneous and without <hi rend="italic"
                    >striae.</hi> That of the teeth of the white whale or cachalot resembles the
                    bone of human teeth in its satin-like appearance. The ivory of the tusk of the
                    narwal is very compact and homogeneous in appearance.</p>
                <p>The most singular structure of teeth among quadrupeds is observed in those of the
                    Cape ant-eater <hi rend="italic">(orycteropus).</hi> The teeth of this animal,
                    which have the appearance of two cylinders conjoined, consist of an infinite
                    number of minute straight parallel tubes, so that their transverse section
                    resembles that of a rush. As these tubes are closed only at the triturating
                    surface, it is there only that the tissue of the tooth is compact; and when the
                    enamel is worn, the upper orifices of these tubes begin to be exposed. There is,
                    therefore, no general cavity in the interior of the tooth. These teeth are also
                    void of root. A similar tubular structure is observed in the two molar teeth of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ornithorhyncus,</hi> and in the teeth of some fishes.</p>
                <p>The enamel <hi rend="italic">(lamella</hi><hi rend="italic">vitrea,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">cortex</hi><hi rend="italic">striatus)</hi> presents peculiarities
                    in the lower animals, as well as the bone of the tooth.</p>
                <p>While the enamel of the human tooth is confined to the crown, in several of the
                    lower animals, as the morse, it envelopes the tooth all round; and in the molar
                    teeth of this animal, which, indeed, are void of cavity, it is thicker under the
                    root than at the crown. A similar arrangement is observed in the old or adult
                    teeth of the cachalot, which, when their cavity is obliterated by the full
                    deposition of osseous substance, are also covered with enamel below.</p>
                <p>The texture or constitution of the enamel is best seen in the grinders of the
                    elephant. The section of a tooth in the germ exhibits fibres similar to those of
                    asbestos or fine velvet. The fracture of the enamel is more distinctly fibrous
                    than that of the bone, and the fibres are everywhere perpendicular, or nearly
                    so, to the surface of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193095990?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-5990-0033"/> the tooth. The hardness of this substance may be
                    inferred from the fact that it strikes fire with steel. These component fibres,
                    however, are not always rectilineal. Most frequently they describe curves with
                    the convexity of incurvation towards the crown and the concavity towards the
                    root. This arrangement at least is observed in the ruminants. The distinction
                    between the enamel and bony matter is recognised by a gray line, and another
                    whiter which belongs to the latter substance.</p>
                <p>The enamel varies chiefly in thickness in different animals. The tusks which
                    project from the mouth are generally observed to be less white, less hard, and
                    more similar to bone or ivory than the other teeth; and on this account,
                    probably, the existence of enamel has been denied in the tusks of the elephant.
                    It is nevertheless certain that the external layer of these tusks presents
                    radiating fibres, though it is by no means so hard, or possesses the same grain,
                    as the enamel of the other teeth. Enamel is more apparent, though thinner, in
                    the tusks of the morse, dugong, and boar; and it is quite as distinct in those
                    of the hippopotamus as in the other teeth of that animal. Lastly, the enamel of
                    the teeth of the cachalot, which is very thick, shows in its section only <hi
                    rend="italic">striae</hi> parallel to the surface of the osseous substance.</p>
                <p>Teeth may be distinguished according to the mode in which their component tissues
                    are arranged into three sorts. Isŕ, When the enamel invests the axis all round,
                    and does not penetrate the latter, the tooth is said to be <hi rend="italic"
                    >simple (dens simplex).</hi> Such is the character of the human teeth, and those
                    of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and Zoo- <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >pπaga,</hi> and several other animals, and all the reptiles. <hi rend="italic"
                    >[ 2d,</hi> When the enamel is folded as it were round the bony part, but
                    without inclosing it, so that the latter forms a continuous band several times
                    folded on itself, and sections of the tooth in every direction divide repeatedly
                    the component substances, the tooth is said to be compound or complex <hi
                    rend="italic">(dens multiplex</hi><hi rend="italic">vel compositus).</hi> A good
                    example of this structure is seen in the grinders of the elephant. <hi
                    rend="italic">3d,</hi> When the base or root of the tooth is simple, and the
                    folds of the enamel and bone penetrate only to a certain depth, they are said to
                    be semicompound. Examples of this modification of arrangement are seen in the
                    grinders of the ruminating animals.</p>
                <p>In the compound, and part of the seπιicompound teeth, the enamel is covered by a
                    third substance; and as the latter is arranged, especially in the former sort,
                    so as to leave intervals between it and the next layer of enamel, this substance
                    serves to fill all these intervals, and consolidates the component lobes of the
                    tooth even before their osseous parts are united below. This substance, which is
                    denominated by Cuvier <hi rend="italic">cement,</hi> by Tenon <hi rend="italic"
                    >cortex</hi><hi rend="italic">osseus,</hi> and by Blake <hi rend="italic"
                    >crusta</hi><hi rend="italic">petrosa,</hi> though less firm than either bone or
                    enamel, is dissolved by acids more slowly than the former, and sooner becomes
                    black in the fire. In the teeth of the elephant and <hi rend="italic"
                    >cabiai</hi> it forms half their mass at least. In most <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera</hi> it presents no apparent organization, and resembles a sort of
                    crystalline tartar incrusted on the tooth. In the cabiai, however, it presents
                    numerous pores very regularly arranged. Tenon was of opinion that it arose from
                    ossification of the membrane which enveloped the tooth; blake ascribed it to
                    deposition from the opposite surface of the enamel membrane; but Cuvier
                    ascertained that it is deposited by the same membrane and the same surface as
                    the enamel. This accurate observer found, on inspecting the germs of the teeth
                    of the elephant, that when the internal membrane of the dental capsule has
                    deposited the enamel, it undergoes a change of structure, and becomes thick,
                    spongy, opaque, and reddish, to furnish the cement, which is then deposited, not
                    in regular crystalline fibres, but in random drops.</p>
                <p>The teeth of the Reptiles consist of hard, compact, osseous matter, invested by a
                    thin covering of enamel, and without cement.</p>
                <p>The teeth of Fishes vary much in structure. They are either siiŉple or compound.
                    The simple teeth are those which consist of bone invested by enamel. They may be
                    distinguished into two species, according to their mode oí attachment. The first
                    are the simple teeth, which are not implanted in <hi rend="italic">alveoli,</hi>
                    but merely attached to the gum, or fixed by articulation to the jaw, as those of
                    the shark tribe; the second are simple teeth growing in alveolar cavities, as is
                    observed in the majority of fishes, the pike, dory, &amp;c. The simple teeth
                    attached to the gum are chiefly distinguished by their fibres intersecting in
                    the manner of the cancellated tissue of bones, and being therefore at first
                    light, porous, and spongy, and becoming afterwards uniformly hard and compact
                    like ivory.</p>
                <p>The compound teeth, which consist of an infinite number of minute tubes mutually
                    aggregated and invested by a common covering of enamel, form plates of different
                    sizes, adhering to the bones of the jaws or palate by an intermediate membrane
                    only. In some they affect the disposition of the quincunx; in others they occupy
                    the whole breadth of the upper jaw at least, as in the ray as seen on the small
                    scale, and in the same manner in larger fishes; others are in straight
                    transverse bars; others assume the shape of a circular segment, or the figure in
                    heraldry denominated the chevron.</p>
                <p>In the wolf-fish the jaws are provided with eminences composed of fibres or tubes
                    proceeding from the base to the circumference, and which are connected to the
                    jaw by a substance more spongy than the rest of the bone.</p>
                <p>After their first formation the teeth retain nearly their original shape in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoophaga,</hi> man, and the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quad-rumana.</hi> In the two latter only their crowns begin to be worn,
                    rendering the incisor and canine less pointed by the use of food partly
                    vegetable; but in the zoophagous tribes they undergo no detrition whatever. In
                    the herbivorous animals, however, the crown begins to undergo detrition more or
                    less rapidly; and in no long time the superior layer of enamel is entirely worn
                    off, and the surface of the tooth exposes the succession of bone or ivory,
                    enamel, and cement. These substances are well seen in the teeth of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Roüentia,</hi> for instance the hare; those of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> as the elephant; the Ruminants, as the stag,
                    sheep, and ox; and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solldungula,</hi> as the horse. In
                    all these animals the enamel, which is hardest, forms prominent lines or ridges;
                    while the bone and cement are indicated by depressions.</p>
                <p>This detrition, which is purely mechanical, might proceed to such an extent in
                    the herbivorous quadrupeds as to destroy the whole of the crown of the
                    tooth,'and leave the process of mastication to be performed by the jaws only. It
                    appears to be chiefly to obviate this inconvenience that the dentition of the
                    elephant, the Ethiopian boar, and perhaps all the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Pachydermatλ,</hi> is conducted in a successive manner through a series of six
                    or eight sets of teeth at least. In the former animal, in which this process has
                    been best observed, and was ably explained many years ago by Mr John Corse Scott
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1799), each half-jaw, whatever it contains,
                    exhibits at one time only one complete grinder and part of another behind it,
                    the prominent parts of which are placed obliquely to the horizon, forming an
                    inclined plane, so that the anterior parts are worn before the posterior. The
                    anterior complete one, which is employed in mastication, undergoes progressive
                    detrition till its anterior portion is worn down to the level of the jaw. In
                    this state the fangs of the anterior part of the tooth begin to diminish,
                    rendering the tooth narrow before; while the crown of the posterior<pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096003?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6003-0034"/>
                    begins to be worn, and undergoing the same detrition, the posterior fangs also
                    begin to give way. While this process, however, is advancing, the posterior
                    tooth, of which only the anterior part was appearing above the gum, gradually
                    rises, with its crown forming a plane inclined from before backwards, similar to
                    that of the anterior grinder. When this posterior tooth has been raised
                    sufficiently to allow its anterior margin to be used in mastication, the residue
                    of the anterior tooth drops out altogether, and the posterior one continues to
                    rise and advance rapidly, until it is completed, when it is found to be much
                    larger than the previous tooth, and to consist of a greater number of plates of
                    ivory and enamel <hi rend="italic">(denticuli).</hi> In no long time this new
                    tooth, which undergoes the same process of detrition, is succeeded by another
                    one, the anterior margin of which rises first behind the posterior one of its
                    predecessor, and which passes through the same stages of growth, detrition, and
                    shedding. This process is repeated at least seven or eight times, and each
                    succeeding tooth is larger, and contains a greater number of ivory and enamel
                    plates than its predecessor. The elephant has thus 7 or 8 grinders in each
                    half-jaw, or 28 or 32 grinders respectively; yet there are never more than one
                    tooth and part of another, or at most two, that is, eight teeth in the upper and
                    lower jaws, at the same time. Though the disappearance of the fangs of the
                    anterior tooth is ascribed to absorption—which indeed is a good general name—yet
                    the true reason is the fact that the maxillary or dental vessels of the elephant
                    are unable to sustain more than one tooth in each half-jaw at once; and that
                    since these vessels gradually transfer their blood to the new tooth, while those
                    of the old one shrink and are obliterated, the new tooth grows as the old one is
                    actually dehcmatised or atrophied. The order in which the teeth of the elephant
                    succeed each other is nearly the following. The first or milk grinder, composed
                    of 4 eburneo-vitreous plates <hi rend="italic">(denticuli),</hi> cuts the gum
                    eight or ten days after birth, is well formed in six weeks, and completely out
                    in three months. The second, which consists of 8 or 9 plates, is completely
                    exposed at the age of two years; the third, consisting of 12 or 13 plates, at
                    six years. The fourth to the eighth grinder consist of plates varying in number
                    from 15 to 23; but the period at which these teeth appear has not yet been
                    determined. This process has been shown to have taken place also in the gigantic
                    fossil animal named the <hi rend="italic">mastodon.</hi></p>
                <p>A similar process of displacement and renovation takes place in the poison-teeth
                    of serpents, and in the teeth of the shark, <hi rend="italic">diodon,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">tetraodon</hi> tribes. In the wolffish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(anarrhicas lupus)</hi> the teeth are shed along with the spongy membrane in
                    which they are contained, exactly as the horns of the stag.</p>
                <p>In the horse, in which the process of dentition has been carefully observed, it
                    is usefully employed to determine the age of the animal. The milk incisors
                    appear at the end of 15 days; the four middle ones, or the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nippers,</hi> are shed at 30 months; the four following ones at 42 months; and
                    the four external, or the comer teeth, at 54 months. The permanent corner teeth
                    do not grow so quickly as the other incisors; and by these especially the age of
                    the horse is determined. At first they scarcely rise above the jaw. Their middle
                    then presents a hollow filled with blackish tartar, the margins of which are
                    worn down as the tooth rises from the gum, and is rubbed against the
                    corresponding one; and it diminishes progressively from 54 months to 8 years,
                    when it is altogether obliterated. The hollow of the other incisors is
                    obliterated at a later period than that of the corner ones; and the age of the
                    animal is then estimated from the length of the incisors, which continue to
                    increase.</p>
                <p>The first two molar teeth appear in each jaw and on each side about the 8th day,
                    the next at the 20th, and the complementary or small anterior grinder about the
                    5th or 6th month. The first posterior molar appears about the 11th month, and
                    the second in the 20th. At the 30th or 32d month the first two milk grinders are
                    shed, the third in the 3d year; and about the 5th or 6th year the last posterior
                    grinder appears. The milk grinders are longer from before backwards than the
                    permanent ones, which are themselves contracted in this direction, as they are
                    pressed by the posterior grinders; from which it results that the dental crowns
                    of young horses are oblong, while those of the old are quadrangular.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the teeth are always implanted in the
                    jaw-bones, and never, as in other animals, in the tongue, palate, &amp;c. The
                    only exception to this rule is the <hi rend="italic">echidna.</hi></p>
                <p>The three kinds of teeth, incisor, tearing, and grinder, are found together only
                    in Man, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi> the Zoop∏AGA, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi> except the elephant and two-horned
                    rhinoceros, in the hornless Ruminants, and in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Solidungula</hi>; but, of all these animals, in man only are the three forms of
                    teeth arranged in an uninterrupted series, and in such a manner that those of
                    the lower jaw are applied to those of the upper. In one other animal only, now
                    extinct, the <hi rend="italic">anoploťherium,</hi> is this continuity of
                    arrangement observed.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Zoophaga,</hi> and all those in which the canine are larger than the other
                    teeth, there is a gap on each side of the jaw to receive the canine of the
                    opposite one. In the ursine genus there is a large empty space behind each
                    canine tooth. In the hedgehog, shrew, phalanger, and tarsier, in which the
                    canine are shorter than the other teeth, a space is left between them and those
                    opposite. In the maki tribe, proper bat, colugo, and camel, there is a large
                    interval between the upper incisors. Lastly, the Ruminants want the incisors of
                    the upper jaw, and the morse those of the lower.</p>
                <p>Some animals provided with the three classes of teeth lose the incisors at a
                    certain age; for instance several of the bat tribe, and the Ethiopian hog. Other
                    Mammalia have only two sorts of teeth, for instance incisors and grinders,
                    separated by an interval without canine, as the wombat and all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in which there are only 2 incisors in each jaw;
                    the kangaroo, which has two below and 6 or 8 above; and the cavy or <hi
                    rend="italic">hyrax</hi> genus, which have 2 above and 4 below. The elephant has
                    grinders and two tusks planted in the superior intermaxillary bone, but no
                    inferior incisors or canine teeth.</p>
                <p>Animals may possess grinders and canine teeth without incisors, as the sloth
                    tribe and the dugong. The grinders, which are most essential, are most rarely
                    wanting; and when others are deficient these are present, as in the armadillo
                    tribe, the <hi rend="italic">orycteropus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                    >ornithorhyncus,</hi> two-horned rhinoceros, and lamantin. The jaws of the
                    dolphin are provided with uniform conical teeth all round, while the cachalot or
                    white whale has them in the lower jaw only. In the narwal there are only two
                    long spiral tusks implanted in the intermaxillary bone, and of these one is
                    often wanting.</p>
                <p>Lastly, teeth are entirely wanting in the ant-eater tribe, pangolin, and <hi
                    rend="italic">echidna,</hi> which are therefore arranged among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata.</hi> In the whale the teeth are represented by plates
                    of the laminated, fibrous, bluish substance distinguished by the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">whale-bone.</hi></p>
                <p>§ 2. <hi rend="smallcaps">organs of insalivation.</hi></p>
                <p>Under this head ought to be noticed the modification which the salivary glands
                    undergo in the lower animals. Our limited space, however, obliges us to proceed
                    immediately to notice the peculiarities of the other divisions of the alimentary
                    canal.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096016?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6016-0035"/>
                <p>§ 3. (ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, AND INTESTINAL TUBE.</p>
                <p>The muscular tissue of the oesophagus consists, in most of the Mammalia, of
                    spiral fibres twisted in two opposite directions, the external from before
                    backwards, the internal from behind forwards. This arrangement, which was first
                    observed in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ruminantia,</hi> was supposed to explain
                    the process of rumination. This opinion, however, is refuted by the fact that
                    the arrangement is not confined to this order, but is very general among the
                    zoopha~ fous and other animals which do not ruminate. In the angaroo the
                    direction of these fibres is, as in man, transverse in the internal layer, and
                    longitudinal in the external.</p>
                <p>The oesophageal mucous membrane is covered by epidermis, which extends to the
                    cardiac opening of the stomach in man, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Quadrumana,</hi>
                    and all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Zoopha-ga.</hi> This membrane, as well as the
                    mucous, is thrown, by the action of the muscular tunic, into longitudinal folds,
                    which are effaced only when the oesophagus is distended. In the tiger, lion, and
                    lynx, there are large transverse valvular folds, and smaller ones in the civet
                    and couguar— an arrangement connected probably with the carnivorous habit.</p>
                <p>The stomachs of the lower animals vary considerably in shape, in the insertion of
                    the oesophagus, in the disposition of their muscular tunics, and in the
                    simplicity or complication of their cavities. These characters it is impossible
                    in such a sketch as the present to consider in detail; and we shall confine our
                    attention to those peculiarities which are most striking in the digestive organs
                    of the animal world.</p>
                <p>The stomachs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> may be distinguished into
                    the simple and compound. Those of man, the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Quad-rumana,</hi> zoophagous and most of the herbivorous tribes, belong to the
                    former order. This simple form of stomach, however, may be generally
                    distinguished into two parts, a cardiac and a pyloric, more or less separated
                    from its other by a central transverse contraction of its annular muscular
                    fibres. This is particularly seen in the horse, man, murine family, and many
                    other animals which occasionally feed both on animal and vegetable matter. In
                    the human stomach this contraction is represented in Plate XXXVI. fig. 4. In the
                    porcupine, however, there are three pouches. This contraction depends on a
                    strong annular band of muscular fibres at this part of the organ. In the pure
                    carnivorous animals, however, as the feline family, the annular fibres, which
                    are very thick, are nearly equally so from the cardiac to the pyloric end.</p>
                <p>The compound stomachs, or those which contain more cavities than one, are found
                    in the sloths, and the ruminant and cetaceous animals chiefly.</p>
                <p>In the first tribe the stomach of the <hi rend="italic">Unau,</hi> or two-toed
                    sloth, is two-fold. The first cavity is large and globular, but tapering behind
                    into a conical appendage, separated by a semilunar fold; while a large cul de
                    sac on the left of the <hi rend="italic">cardia</hi> opens into a canal which
                    proceeds at first backwards, and then turning to the right, enters the second
                    cavity by a narrow aperture. The second, which is small, tubular, and folded
                    under the former from left to right, is distinguished by a semilunar fold into
                    two halves, the first of which opens into a small cul de sac on the right side
                    of the first cavity. The inner membrane of both cavities is smooth, and without
                    <hi rend="italic">villi.</hi> A similar arrangement is found in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ai,</hi> or three-toed sloth, with this exception, that the
                    appendage of the second gastric cavity is divided into three compartments by two
                    longitudinal bands. This canal seems analogous to the arrangement of the
                    ruminating stomachs, in so far as it may allow the alimentary matters to pass
                    occasionally from the oesophagus directly into the second stomach.</p>
                <p>The stomach of the <hi rend="italic">hyrax,</hi> ashkoko, or Cape cavy, also
                    consists of two pouches, separated by a middle partition, in which there is an
                    aperture for mutual communication. In the hippopotamus the cardia communicates
                    with three pouches, two of which only are cognizable without, and with a long
                    tubular bowel, the interior of which is divided across by several valvular
                    folds.</p>
                <p>In the kangaroo the stomach receives the oesophagus near its left extremity,
                    which is small and bifid (Plate XXXV. fig. 8); and forming a larger cavity on
                    the right, passes upwards, making a turn, and crosses to the left before the
                    oesophagus, makes another turn, and again crosses the mesial plane to the right,
                    where it terminates in a tapering cavity at the pylorus. In this course it
                    presents internally a longitudinal band <hi rend="smallcaps">(l, l, l),</hi>
                    extending all round to near the pyloric end, and crossed by valvular membranous
                    folds, which divide the cavity into cells not unlike those of the colon,
                    especially in the horse. The mucous epidermis is continued from the oesophagus
                    over the space marked <hi rend="italic">c, c.</hi></p>
                <p>The stomach of the Ruminants consists of four distinct but communicating
                    cavities. The first, denominated the Paunch <hi rend="italic">(×ofKιa, rumen,
                    penula,</hi><hi rend="italic">ingluvies;</hi><hi rend="italic">la panse,</hi><hi

                    double),</hi> is a large bag occupying the left side of the abdomen chiefly,
                    marked externally by two saccular appendages, and separated within into four
                    parts. (Plate XXXV. fig. 1, A, A, <hi rend="smallcaps">a, a.)</hi> Its inner
                    surface, upon which the epidermis is continued, is occupied by flat <hi
                    rend="italic">papillae.</hi> By a pretty wide aperture <hi rend="smallcaps">(b,
                    b),</hi> with rounded margins, this communicates with the second cavity named
                    the Kings-hood (%sx^υpαλoi, <hi rend="italic">reticulum,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >le</hi><hi rend="italic">bonnet),</hi> which is distinguished by the rhomboidal
                    and polygonal cells, into which its inner membrane is moulded. An aperture at
                    the further end of this (c) leads into the third or smallest cavity, termed the
                    Maniplies (sχ∕voς, <hi rend="italic">omasum,</hi><hi rend="italic">le
                    feuillet),</hi> from the numerous concentric crescentic folds formed by its
                    inner membrane (fig. 2, <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >p).</hi> These folds amount to about 40 in the sheep and 100 in the ox. The
                    smallest of them, between the aperture from the second into the third cavity,
                    are puckered or collected towards their further end by a transverse membranous
                    fold, which acts as a valve to the aperture between this and the fourth cavity.
                    This one, generally named the Red <hi rend="italic">(yw&lt;srξpv,
                    abomasum,</hi><hi rend="italic">la caillette),</hi> is of an elongated pyriform
                    shape, slightly incurvated on itself (fig. 2, <hi rend="smallcaps">d),</hi> and
                    is marked internally by longitudinal folds (p) incurvated according to the
                    curvature of the cavity itself, and terminating near the pyloric end in <hi
                    rend="italic">rugae</hi> or irregular duplicatures <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >(r).</hi> This is the structure of the gastric cavities in the ox.</p>
                <p>In the camel, dromedary, and lama, the stomach is equally complicated, though the
                    structure is a little different. In the first of these animals, which may be
                    taken as an example of the others, the Paunch or first cavity is a large bag,
                    divided into two compartments on the posterior part; by a strong band passing
                    from the right side of the cardiac orifice longitudinally downwards <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">(l,l,</hi> fig. 3), and forming one border of a groove leading
                    to the orifice of the second. From the left margin of this band proceed eight
                    muscular bands, nearly at right angles, and intersecting with others, form
                    cellular cavities on the left side of the paunch <hi rend="smallcaps">(n)</hi>;
                    while on the right side there are similar cells, though smaller, and wholly
                    unconnected with the longitudinal band. From the left margin of the cardia, in
                    like manner, proceeds a broad muscular band <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ,</hi> fig.

                    Kingshood, after which it takes another direction <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ,</hi>

                    terminates (c, fig. 4). The Red or fourth chamber is much the same as that of
                    the bullock <hi rend="smallcaps">(d, p, r,</hi> fig. 5), and the only
                    peculiarity is, that after terminating in (∏) the pylorus, it opens in a small
                    cavity (o) which leads into the duodenum (∆).</p>

                <p>From this description, for the particulars of which we are indebted to the
                    accurate account of Sir E. Home, it results that the stomach of the camel
                    differs from that of the ox and other horned ruminants chiefly in the possession
                    of the quadrilateral cells in the second stomach. Into these the water is
                    conveyed by the animal when drinking, and in these it remains. By the action of
                    the muscular band <hi rend="smallcaps">(μ),</hi> the aperture between the Paunch
                    and Kingshood is opened, and the water is directed into it so as to fill its
                    cells. When these are filled the surplus runs off into those of the first
                    stomach, where at least those on the left side of the long band may be regarded
                    as part of the general cellular structure. These cells are represented of a
                    large size in fig. 5, in which they appear like oblongs with rounded corners.
                    They are always larger on the left side of the band, in the Paunch, than those
                    in the second stomach.</p>
                <p>Both in the bullock and in the camel, and in all the Ruminants, the first and
                    second stomachs only are covered by mucous <hi rend="italic">epidermis.</hi></p>
                <p>In the Cetaceous animals similar complication of the gastric cavities is
                    observed. In the bottle-nose porpoise, which may be taken as an example, the
                    oesophagus, which is large and capacious, terminates in <hi rend="italic">a</hi>
                    spheroidal or ovoidal flask-like bag (fig. 6, <hi rend="smallcaps">a, a)</hi>
                    with an aperture a little below the cardiac, consisting of rose-like annular
                    folds, and leading into a second cavity. This, which corresponds to the ruminant
                    kingshood, is nearly spherical in shape (fig. 7, <hi rend="smallcaps">b),</hi>
                    and presents valvular folds more circular than in the ruminants, and intersected
                    by others so as to give it the honeycomb appearance characteristic of this
                    cavity. From this another aperture leads into the smallest cavity of the three
                    (c, fig. 7); and thence into the fourth, which is long, cylindrical, and
                    slightly incurvated. The third cavity is remarkable for presenting in its inner
                    membrane numerous apertures of mucous glands.</p>
                <p>Birds are distinguished by possessing a stomach consisting of three cavities. The
                    first is the crop, which may be regarded as a mere expansion of the oesophagus,
                    and confined chiefly to land birds. It is filled not only with food, but with
                    small stones; and its chief purpose seems, by mechanical comminution, to supply
                    the place of the teeth in dividing the granular aliment, and bruising or killing
                    the animals swallowed. It is found chiefly in the granivorous birds. It is
                    wanting in the ostrich, in the piscivorous birds, and most of the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Grallae.</hi></p>
                <p>The second is the glandular crop or subsidiary stomach <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ventriculus</hi><hi rend="italic">succenturiatus, bulbus glandulosus),</hi> a
                    mem-brano-glandular sac, which may be also regarded as an oesophageal
                    dilatation. It is larger when the crop is wanting; and though, when conjoined
                    with it, it is always very glandular, and may be therefore regarded as a
                    chemical solvent of alimentary substances, it appears to supply the want of the
                    crop, which is certainly chiefly a mechanical apparatus. The glandular crop or
                    subsidiary stomach .is remarkable for the number and size of the glandular
                    bodies contained between its mucous and muscular tunics. These glands, though
                    variable in shape, are generally conical; and some consist of several glands
                    conjoined in one common peduncle (Plate XXXVI. fig. 3). All of them are hollow,
                    and secrete a fluid which is discharged by one or more minute apertures, and
                    which is of essential importance in the solution of the food. In some instances,
                    as in the American ostrich (fig. 2), they are few in number, and occupy only a
                    small part of the posterior wall of the oesophagus.</p>
                <p>The gizzard or proper stomach of birds may be considered as a horny mucous
                    membrane, somewhat cartilaginous, .continuous with that of the oesophagus, and
                    covered by two strong thick muscles, the fibres of which converge to a point.
                    (Plate XXXVI. fig. 1.) In the carnivorous and piscivorous <hi rend="italic"
                    >genera</hi> of birds, especially those in which the crop is wanting, the
                    gizzard loses its muscular character, and is converted into a membranous
                    pouch.</p>
                <p>The stomach of <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> does not present those
                    dilatations observed in <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi>; and when it changes its
                    diameter or capacity, it is only progressively and insensibly. Its general
                    diameter, nevertheless, is proportionally larger than in the two classes already
                    noticed. Most generally without <hi rend="italic">cul de sac,</hi> its shape is
                    spheroidal, more or less oblong; its membranous walls are thin and transparent;
                    its muscular layer almost imperceptible; the cellular identified with the mucous
                    tissue; the situation of the <hi rend="italic">cardia</hi> indeterminate; and
                    the <hi rend="italic">pylorus,</hi> without valve, is distinguished by a simple
                    tapering contraction of the gastric walls, and the appearance of the structure
                    proper to the intestines.</p>
                <p>In this class of animals, further, digestion appears to be less regulated by
                    fixed principles than in the other two. It is evidently not confined exclusively
                    to the stomach. The oesophagus of the turtle is provided with numerous large,
                    firm, pointed processes, which in all probability contribute to the mechanical
                    division of the food, so much the more requisite as the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Cheloniad Reptiles</hi> are toothless. Except in the crocodile, the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Sau-rial</hi> Reptiles are destitute of large arch or proper
                    cardiac cavity. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> or Serpentine Reptiles
                    the stomach has the figure merely of a dilated sac between the oesophagus and
                    intestines, and presents no curvature. It is probably in connection with this
                    modification of structure that we find animals remain for days in the oesophagus
                    of serpents; and this tube appears to be to a certain extent capable of
                    digesting aliment as much as the stomach. The best mark of distinction in such
                    circumstances is the cessation of <hi rend="italic">epidermis.</hi></p>
                <p>In no class of animals does the stomach vary more in shape, structure, and
                    situation, than in <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi>; and perhaps the general
                    character of the alimentary canal in this class is most justly given by
                    representing it as deviating from those attributes of regularity which we find
                    in the higher classes. While in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> it is always distinguished by its spheroidal or
                    pyriform enlargement between two tapering extremities, and by being much more
                    dilated than any other part of the alimentary canal, in the Reptile class it
                    begins to part with this character; and it loses it altogether in the Fishes. In
                    most of the finny tribes it is often not more capacious than the oesophagus; and
                    it is distinguished from this tube only by the villous character of its internal
                    membrane. In general, also, the situation of this pyriform dilated sac is
                    transversely across the body in the Mammifėrous class. In the feathered tribes
                    this character also is slightly set aside, and partly from the alteration in
                    shape, partly from that of position, the stomach occupies less of the transverse
                    diameter than of the longitudinal extent of the body. Among the Reptiles this
                    character, though still retained in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ciieloniad,</hi>
                    and even in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial,</hi> is gradually enfeebled in the
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi>; and in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi>
                    it may be said to be entirely obliterated, since the organ occupies much more
                    longitudinal extent than transverse width of the body.</p>
                <p>The first character of the alimentary tube of fishes is the width or capacity
                    combined with shortness of the oesophagus. The latter character is manifestly
                    associated with the absence of lungs and consequent want of chest; so that
                    between the throat and abdominal cavity, the interval, which corresponds only to
                    the space occupied by the heart, is extremely abridged. The oesophagus consists,
                    as in the other classes, of a mucous membrane surrounded by a muscular tunic;
                    but the mucous membrane is distinguished by the firmness and whiteness of its
                    corion, which in some <hi rend="italic">genera</hi> approaches to the
                    consistence of horn or cartilage, and by the presence of conical <hi
                    rend="italic">pa-piĩloe,</hi> sometimes of great hardness, and which appear to
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096042?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6042-0037"/>
                    act mechanically on the food. It is almost superfluous to notice the facility
                    which the large capacity of this tube affords fishes for swallowing their prey.
                    Most of them ’ are voracious in the extreme; and it is not uncommon to find the
                    stomach and oesophagus crammed to the throat.</p>
                <p>The figure and position of the stomach of Fishes are so variable, that it is
                    difficult to give a character of general application. Though in many <hi
                    rend="italic">genera,</hi> especially of the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Jugulares,</hi> it consists of a cylindrical sac with a slight dilatation
                    immediately below the <hi rend="italic">cardia,</hi> in others it is oblong
                    ovoidal, as the ray and shark tribe; and in others, as the sole, dory, and flat
                    fishes generally, it is orbicular. In the sturgeon it consists of a cylindrical
                    tube incurvated twice on itself. In none is there more than one <hi
                    rend="italic">cul de sac,</hi> the depth of which varies as the part
                    corresponding to the <hi rend="italic">pylorus</hi> is more or less remote from
                    the <hi rend="italic">fundus.</hi> When the limits of the stomach are
                    indistinct, the situation of the cardia įs equally so. In the lamprey <hi
                    rend="italic">(petromyzon)</hi> and pen-fish <hi rend="italic"
                    >(syngnathus</hi><hi rend="italic">pelagicus)</hi> the whole tube is of a
                    -uniform size from the mouth to the anus; and much the same may be said of the
                    carp genus. The genera in which it forms a distinct dilatation or cul de sac are
                    chiefly the following; the eel <hi rend="italic">(muraena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >anguilla),</hi> conger <hi rend="italic">(ni.</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    rend="italic">Bagre.</hi> In the anableps the dilatation disappears; and in the

                    it is a large sac incurvated in an arch-like bend.</p>
                <p>The intestinal canal in most of the Mammalia is very similar to that of man; and
                    the chief differences of different orders and genera are found in the difference
                    of longitudinal extent either of the whole intestinal tube or the comparative
                    lengths of its several parts.</p>
                <p>From the time of Grew to that of Cuvier, and most <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi>
                    modern anatomists, it has been a point of some importance to determine the
                    length of the intestinal tube in relation to that of the body. This comparative
                    length, which is greatest in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> diminishes
                    successively in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds, Reptiles,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Fishes.</hi> It has been occasionally stated by different
                    anatomists, that the intestinal tube is longer, <hi rend="italic">coeteris
                    paribus,</hi> in granivorous than in carnivorous animals, and conversely. When
                    we come, however, to compare the different lengths of this tube in the several
                    tribes, we find that this statement demands modification. In the ape family its
                    length varies from 5 to 8 times that of the body; in several of the <hi
                    rend="italic">lemur</hi> tribe from 4 to 6 times, the smaller length being in
                    this case compensated by the size of the <hi rend="italic">ccecum</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and in others of the lemur tribe, <hi rend="italic">e.
                    g.</hi> the <hi rend="italic">lori,</hi> the intestine is only three times the
                    length of the body. Among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera</hi> there are two
                    examples of very great contrast in this respect. While the intestine of the <hi
                    rend="italic">noctula</hi> or great bat <hi rend="italic">(vespertilio</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">noctula,</hi> Lin.) is the shortest of all the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> and scarcely does more than exceed the length of
                    the animal’s body, that of die roussette <hi rend="italic">(pteropus)</hi> or
                    East India bat, which lives chiefly on vegetable matter, is at least 7 times
                    longer than its body. A similar instance of the meeting of extremes is found in
                    the Marsupial order, in which the marmoset and cayopollin have intestines only
                    2⅜ times longer than the body, while that of the phalanger is more than 11 times
                    longer. In the plantigrade or ursine family, which occasionally live on
                    vegetable matters, the proportional length approaches to that of the ape.</p>
                <p>In the carnivorous animals the intestine, though generally short, varies from 3
                    times to 8 times the length of the body. The former is the proportion in the
                    lion, wild cat, ocelot, couguar, and weasel; and the latter in the hyena. Some
                    of them also vary among themselves. Thus the intestine of the wild cat is
                    greatly less than that of the domestic animal. The proportion is very great
                    among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia,</hi> in several of which it is 8,
                    10,12, or 16times longer, as in the agouti, than the body of the animal. Among
                    the murine tribe, however, it undergoes a diminution. Among the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Edentata,</hi> again, especially the sloth tribe, it diminishes
                    very much, being only about 3∣ times longer than the body in the <hi
                    rend="italic">Ai</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Unau.</hi> This brevity is so much
                    the more extraordinary that these animals are void of caecum, and live on
                    vegetable matters; but, in all probability, the duplicature of the gastric
                    cavities· in some degree compensates this deficiency.</p>
                <p>The intestinal tube attains its greatest proportional length in the Ruminant
                    animals, being at least 11 times longer than the body, as in the goat, and 28
                    times longer in the ram. This immense length is supposed to compensate the
                    absence of dilatation in the large intestines, and the small size of the caecum.
                    In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> again, which are remarkable for
                    the large size*of the caecum, the length of the intestine diminishes much, being
                    8 times longer than the body in the zebra, 9 times in the ass, and 10 times in
                    the horse.</p>
                <p>Lastly, it is a singular circumstance, that in different species of the same
                    genus the comparative length varies much. We have already noticed the difference
                    between the length of the intestine in the wild and in the domestic cat. The
                    wild and tame boar is a similar instance of the same, the intestine being only 9
                    times longer than the body in the former, and so much as 13∣ times in the
                    latter. It is possible that such differences may depend on the different habits
                    of the animal in his wild and domestic condition. This explanation, however, is
                    totally inadequate to account for the difference in the comparative length of
                    the intestinal tube in the Asiatic and African elephant, being 10 times longer
                    than the body in the former species, and only 7 times in the latter. The same
                    may be observed of two animals very closely allied, if not of the same <hi
                    rend="italic">genus,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">echidna</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">ornithorhyncus.</hi> The intestine of the former animal is 7 times
                    longer than his body, while that of the latter is only 5 times.</p>
                <p>In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> generally the intestine is shortest among
                    those genera which prey on animals and fish; it varies from twice to five times
                    the length of the body. In the gallinaceous and passerine birds, which live on
                    grains, it is always longer and more capacious than in those which live on
                    animal substances. In the cassowary, which is granivorous with a short
                    intestine, the intestine is divided by contractions into distinct pouches, to
                    compensate for the brevity of the tube. It must be remarked, nevertheless, that
                    in several birds which prey on fishes, * the intestinal tube is proportionally
                    longer than in those which feed only on grain; and the proportional length is
                    not diminished in birds living indiscriminately on animal and vegetable
                    aliment.</p>
                <p>The intestinal tube of the Reptiles is still shorter than that of Birds, and
                    often it does not exceed twice the length of the body. It is longest in the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,</hi> and shortest in the <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Ranine</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpent</hi> tribe. In the tadpole,
                    however, a singular peculiarity is observed. The intestinal tube of the tadpole
                    of a frog is nearly ten times longer than the space between the muzzle and the
                    vent <hi rend="italic">(anus)</hi>; whereas, after the animal has become a frog,
                    the intestine is only twice as long as this space.</p>
                <p>In the class of Fishes the intestinal tube is still shorter and more direct in
                    its course to the vent or outlet. In a few which live chiefly on marine
                    vegetables, for instance some of the <hi rend="italic">chaetodon genus,</hi> it
                    is about six times longer than the body of the animal; and in a few of the carp
                    <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> (viz. <hi rend="italic">cyprinus</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">capaeta)</hi> it amounts to ten or twelve times longer than the
                    body. In others, however, of the same genus, for instance the <hi rend="italic"
                    >cyprinus</hi><hi rend="italic">nιursa,</hi> it is scarcely as long again,
                    showing here once more an instance of the conjunction of extremes not easily
                    explained.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096055?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6055-0038"/>
                <p>In most vertebrated animals the intestinal tube may be distinguished by natural
                    marks into two divisions, one extending between the pyloric end of the stomach
                    to a part <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> of the tube, where it becomes wider and
                    more capacious; the other from this to the vent or outlet. In some instances,
                    however, this distinction is very obscurely and imperfectly marked. In the <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Mammalia,</hi> in which-the distinction is observed, it is
                    indicated by one or more appendages, which, if large, are denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">caeca,</hi> and if slender and long, are termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >vermiform, processes.</hi> Man, the ourang, and the wombat <hi rend="italic"
                    >(phascolomys),</hi> are the only animals which are possessed at once of <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum</hi> and vermiform appendage. In the other genera of the
                    ape tribe, in the maki of the <hi rend="italic">lemur,</hi> in the colugo among
                    the <hi rend="smallcaps">Chiroptera,</hi> the ichneumon, many of the carnivorous
                    tribe, the opossum and kangaroo, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> except
                    the dormouse, the Cape ant-eater, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata</hi>
                    except the hyrax, the Ruminants, <hi rend="smallcaps">Solidungula,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Amphibia,</hi> there is only a caecum without vermiform
                    process. The caecum is wanting in the sloths, the bat tribe, the Ursine except
                    the ichneumon, the marten, pine-marten, weasel, &amp;c. the dormouse, and all
                    the Cetaceous animals.</p>
                <p>The presence of caecum or vermiform process, however, is not necessary to
                    distinguish the canal into two portions. The inner or mucous surface of the <hi
                    rend="italic">ileum</hi> is always villous and uniform; and the whole intestine,
                    except its superior or pyloric portion, is convoluted in proportion to its
                    length, and moves about freely in the abdominal cavity; whereas the colon is
                    more or less fixed at different points, it is shorter and more capacious, andits
                    inner membrane is merely mucous without long <hi rend="italic">villi.</hi> A
                    mark equally general is the semilunar duplicature of mucous membrane placed
                    between the ileum and colon, and named the <hi rend="italic">ileocolic</hi>
                    valve. In the sloth and armadillo tribes, which want caecum and vermiform
                    process, this and the slight difference of diameter are the only marks of
                    distinction between the ileum and colon. In all the other <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >Mammalia</hi> which are destitute of caecum the whole tube is of the same
                    calibre, occasionally diminished towards the vent; and the division into <hi
                    rend="italic">ileum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> is no longer
                    cognizable.</p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> with one caecum, it appears in the
                    form of a production from the large intestine beyond the part at which it
                    receives the <hi rend="italic">ileum;</hi> and though variable in its diameter
                    and structure, it bears a general resemblance to the colon in these respects. In
                    herbivorous animals, and even in some that are omnivorous, as the ape and lemur
                    tribes, it is generally large and puckered by tendinous bands. To this, however,
                    an exception is observed in the Ruminants, in which the caecum is moderate in
                    size and unpuckered. It is small and unpuckered in the kangaroo-rat and wombat;
                    while, conversely, in the colugo and brown phalanger, which are believed to be
                    chiefly zoophagous, it is very large and puckered.</p>
                <p>In the zoophagous animals generally both the <hi rend="italic">colon</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum</hi> are of small calibre, little different from that of
                    the <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and both the colon and
                    caecum are destitute of cells or compartments. In herbivorous and several
                    omnivorous animals, on the contrary, the inner surface of the colon is divided
                    by longitudinal and transverse bands into a number of cells or compartments. .
                    From this rule, however, there is an exception in the wombat, kangaroo, and the
                    Ruminants. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Rodentia</hi> the colon is cellular at
                    its commencement only.</p>
                <p>In birds the canal is provided with two <hi rend="italic">caeca,</hi> one on each
                    side, not far from the vent. In the omnivorous and granivorous these <hi
                    rend="italic">caeca</hi> are generally long and capacious. While they are very
                    large in the nocturnal predatory birds, they are either obliterated or wanting
                    in the diurnal predatory birds, in the green woodpecker, the lark, and the
                    cormorant. In the heron, bustard, and grebe, there is a single small one; in the
                    cassowary two very slender; and in the merganser, diver, &amp;c. they are short
                    and thick.</p>
                <p>In all birds the short bowel between the insertion of the, <hi rend="italic"
                    >caeca</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">cloaca</hi> is a little wider and more
                    capacious than those between the <hi rend="italic">pylorus</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">caeca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and this is the only
                    circumstance which indicates in this class the distinction of the tube into <hi
                    rend="italic">ileum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">colon.</hi></p>
                <p>In the reptiles the intestinal tube is generally void of <hi rend="italic">caeca
                    or</hi> appendage; and the only distinction consists in the one part of the
                    tube, which is long and slender, being joined to another which is short and
                    thick, and in the presence of a semilunar membranous fold at the point of
                    insertion. In the <hi rend="italic">iguana</hi> alone has a genuine <hi
                    rend="italic">caecum</hi> been observed.</p>
                <p>The distinction into small and large intestine, or <hi rend="italic">ileum</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">colon,</hi> is still less obviously observed in the class
                    of fishes. It sometimes happens that the difference of capacity is inverted, and
                    that the calibre of the portion which terminates at the vent is actually smaller
                    than that of the part connected with the stomach. This arrangement is observed
                    in the ray, shark, sturgeon, and even the bichir; in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >syngnaťhus,</hi> trunk-fish, and <hi rend="italic">balista.</hi> In other
                    instances the diameter is the same throughout; and the only distinction is
                    derived from the anatomical characters of the inner membrane. In the lamprey,
                    sea-devil, rough star-gazer, radiated sole, <hi rend="italic">holocentrus
                    sago,</hi> carp tribe, <hi rend="italic">mormyrus,</hi> and mullet, it is
                    impossible to distinguish the intestine into large and small.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes</hi> resemble <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptiles</hi> in
                    being destitute of <hi rend="italic">caecum</hi> at the junction of the small
                    and large bowel. In many of them, howe-⅛r, there is attached to the intestine,
                    somewhere below the <hi rend="italic">pylorus,</hi> a variable number of small
                    intestines terminating in blind ends, similar in size and structure to the
                    intestine with which they communicate. These tubes, which have been not very
                    happily named <hi rend="italic">pyloric</hi> appendages <hi rend="italic"
                    >(appendices pyloricae),</hi> in so far as they are most frequently connected
                    rather with the part of the bowel corresponding to the duodenum, vary in number
                    from 2, 4, 6, or 8, to 80 or 180 in some genera, and even their number is not
                    the same in different species of the same genus. Thus, while there are 6 in the
                    smelt <hi rend="italic">(salmo</hi><hi rend="italic">eperlanus),</hi> there are
                    68 in the s. <hi rend="italic">lacustris,</hi> and 70 in the salmon <hi
                    rend="italic">(s.</hi><hi rend="italic">salar).</hi> In like manner, though
                    there are 18 in the anchovy, <hi rend="italic">(clupea</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >encrasicolus),</hi> there are 24 in the herring <hi rend="italic">(c.
                    harengus),</hi> and fourscore in the shad <hi rend="italic">(c. alosa).</hi> In
                    some, as the cod and pollach, they consist of several large trunks ramified into
                    numerous small ones.</p>
                <p>These appendages, however, are wanting in the cartilaginous fishes with free <hi
                    rend="italic">branchiae,</hi> in most of those with fixed <hi rend="italic"
                    >branchiae,</hi> in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Apodes,</hi> and in several of the
                    thoracic and abdominal order. In the sturgeon and some others they are
                    represented by a series of communicating cavities inclosed in the intestinal
                    membrane, which is covered by a cellulo-muscular tunic and peritoneum (Plate
                    XXXVI. fig. 5), and which assumes the external appearance of a pancreas.</p>
                <p>Among the cartilaginous fishes the brevity and directness of the intestinal tube
                    is compensated by a peculiar disposition of the intestinal mucous membrane. This
                    consists in part of the membrane projecting like a broad fold or process from
                    the inner surface of the intestine, and winding round from the pyloric to the
                    anal or lower extremity (fig. 7 and 8). This, which is denominated the spiral
                    valve, may be easily understood from these figures, which represent the
                    arrangement as it is observed in the shark. In the sturgeon, in which it is
                    found in the last portion of intestine (fig. 6), its peculiarities have been
                    described by the writer of this article in the <hi rend="italic">Wernerian
                    Transactions,</hi> vol. vi.</p>
                <p>In all the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> the intestinal tube terminates in a
                    distinct bowel denominated the <hi rend="italic">rectum,</hi> the mucous
                    membrane of which is continuous with the skin at the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096068?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6068-0039"/> anus. This
                    rule can scarcely be said to be violated in the case of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >echidna</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ornithorhyncus,</hi> in which there is an
                    aperture at the lower part for the urine and the semen of the male and the <hi
                    rend="italic">ova</hi> of the female. These anomalous and singular animals form
                    a transition to the mode in which the intestinal tube terminates in the three
                    genuine oviparous classes. In <hi rend="smallcaps">Birds, Reptiles,</hi> and
                    most of the cartilaginous <hi rend="smallcaps">Fishes,</hi> the intestinal tube
                    terminates in an outlet common to it with the urinary organs, denominated
                    generally the <hi rend="italic">cloaca.</hi> In the sturgeon, however, it has
                    been shown, in the paper already mentioned, that there is a distinct urinary
                    outlet; and that consequently this animal cannot be said to have a <hi
                    rend="italic">cloaca.</hi> In the greater part of fishes, while there is one
                    vent for the excrement, there is another common one for the urine, the <hi
                    rend="italic">ova,</hi> and the spawn.</p>
                <p>On the subject of the liver, spleen, and pancreas, it is impossible to enter with
                    any interest in this sketch.</p>

                <p>The Mammalia and Birds agree in having a heart consisting of two pairs of

                    The Eustachian valve is often wanting in the Mammalia. It is wanting, for
                    instance, in the lion, bear, and porcupine; while it is broad and muscular in
                    the seal, and assumes a spiral direction along the upper walls of the right
                    auricular sinus in the elephant.</p>
                <p>It was at one time imagined that the aquatic <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi>
                    were distinguished from the terrestrial by the <hi rend="italic">foramen
                    ovale</hi> being open and forming a communication between the two auricles.
                    This, however, is a mistake, at least in the adult animal; for neither in the
                    otter, the seal, nor the porpoise or dolphin, did Cuvier find this aperture
                    pervious; and it may be inferred, that when it is open, it is an anormal remain
                    of the fetal structure. In the <hi rend="italic">ornithorhyncus,</hi> also,
                    according to Sir Everard Home, it is impervious. In the porcupine and elephant,
                    in which there are two anterior <hi rend="italic">venae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cavae,</hi> the blood of the left anterior <hi rend="italic">cava,</hi> which
                    opens in the sinus near the aurico-ventricular aperture, is conveyed directly
                    into the right ventricle.</p>
                <p>The reptile heart, the first in the cold-blooded division, varies somewhat in the
                    several tribes. In the first three, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Cheloniad,
                    Saurial,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial∕</hi> it consists of two
                    auricles and one ventricle, divided in some instances into communicating
                    chambers. In the Batrachoid family, on the contrary, it always consists of one
                    auricle and one ventricle, the interior of which is unilocular or undivided. In
                    several of the Turtle tribe, among the first family, the ventricle consists of a
                    pulmonary chamber, in which the blood is more particularly directed to the
                    pulmonary artery, and a general or aortic chamber, which is above, and from
                    which the blood is conveyed into the aorta. In the crocodile the ventricle is
                    divided into three chambers, communicating by several apertures. One is inferior
                    and to the right, and communicates with the right auricle by a large aperture
                    provided with two valves. On the left, and before, is the second chamber,
                    receiving the orifice of the left descending aorta. Behind is an aperture
                    leading into the smallest chamber of the three, situate at the middle of the
                    base of the heart, and receiving the common trunk of the pulmonary arteries. The
                    left chamber is above. In the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Serpentine</hi> family the ventricle is divided into two
                    chambers, a superior and inferior, separated by an imperfect partition, which
                    allows the two to communicate.</p>
                <p>The heart of the finny tribes is as simple as that of the Ranine reptiles, which
                    indeed constitutes the preparatory step in the descending scale of organic
                    forms. It consists, as in these animats, of two chambers only, an auricle and
                    ventricle. The former receives the blood from the body at large, and transmits
                    it to the ventricle, which is almost in all cases unilocular. From this a single
                    vessel conveys it, not to the body at large, but to the gills, from which it is
                    again collected by several branchial veins.</p>
                <p>Of the blood-vessels of the four vertebrated classes it is superfluous to speak
                    in any detail.</p>
                <p>The most remarkable circumstances are the minute subdivisions which in some
                    classes the arteries undergo previous to final distribution. In the Ruminants,
                    and several of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Pachydermata,</hi> the branches of the
                    carotid artery, instead of uniting by the communicating vessels, are subdivided
                    into a great number of minute vessels, which form round the pituitary gland a
                    communicating plexus, denominated by the ancients <hi rend="italic">Pete</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mirabile.</hi></p>
                <p>In the slow lemur <hi rend="italic">(lemur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >tardigradus)</hi> Sir A. Carlisle found the subclavian artery, after entering
                    the axilla, divide into 23 arterial cylinders of equal size, and the iliac on
                    the brim of the pelvis into at least 20 equal-sized tubes, which in both cases
                    surrounded the principal artery, reduced to a small vessel, and, proceeding
                    along the extremity, were distributed chiefly to the muscles. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1800.) A similar arrangement, carried to a still greater
                    extent, was found in the <hi rend="italic">Ai</hi> or three-toed sloth, in which
                    the axillary and iliac arteries were divided into about 60 or 65 cylindrical
                    parallel tubes. In the slender lemur <hi rend="italic">(Lemur loris)</hi> these
                    vessels are subdivided into 4 or ô only.</p>
                <p>In Fishes in which the unilocular ventricle sends its blood to the gills only,
                    the heart is pulmonary, and the arterial system is destitute of central
                    impulsive organ. In the sturgeon, which is one of the best examples of the
                    distribution of the arterial system in the finny tribes, the blood, which is
                    distributed in the <hi rend="italic">branchiae</hi> by the large artery, is
                    collected in numerous vessels, which may be regarded as analogous to the
                    pulmonary veins of the warm-blooded classes, but which have thick <hi
                    rend="italic">parietes</hi> like arteries; and these uniting, form a large
                    vessel, which is lodged in a cartilaginous canal formed by the continuous bodies
                    of the <hi rend="italic">vertebrae.</hi> This vessel is further void of
                    compressive or elastic tunics, and the blood moves through it as through an
                    immovable and inelastic tube. From its sides, however, a series of arterial
                    vessels issue, which forthwith assume the usual characters of arterial tubes. In
                    many other fishes the <hi rend="italic">parietes</hi> of the large artery adhere
                    in part to the semi-osseous canal in which it is lodged.</p>
                <p>SECT. II. THE ORGANS OF AERATING CIRCULATION.</p>
                <p>The lungs of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> are in all essential points
                    perfectly similar to those of the human subject.</p>
                <p>The lungs of Birds differ chiefly in not presenting distinct lobules, in having
                    the air-vessels larger and more distinct, in the branchial tubes not becoming
                    quite so small, and in terminating not alone in the pulmonic vesicles, but in
                    perforated parts of the surface of the lungs, which lead into large air-sacs,
                    communicating with all parts of the body, and forming an accessory lung. In the
                    ostrich, which may be taken as a general example, there are four of these cells
                    or aerolabous sacs. The first, which is anterior, extends from the <hi
                    rend="italic">apex</hi> of the chest to the iliac bones, between the first ribs
                    and heart above, and between the lower ribs and a cell which surrounds the
                    intestines. It is divided into four chambers, the first two communicating with
                    the lungs by large apertures, while the fourth opens in the iliac bones. Behind
                    this large sac are two small ones, between the iliac bones and the peritoneal
                    sac. Before it is another small one occupying the lateral regions of the <hi
                    rend="italic">apex</hi> of the chest, and communicating with sacs in the <hi
                    rend="italic">axillae</hi> and neck. Besides these, the stomach, liver, heart,
                    and intestines are surrounded by sacs. All of these communicate by saccular
                    processes with the cavities of the bones. By this peculiar arrangement <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Birds</hi> possess the greatest extent of respiratory surface
                    of all classes of animals.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096081?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6081-0040"/>
                <p>The lungs of Reptiles are distinguished by consisting of large sacs, subdivided
                    by membranous partitions into polygonal cells, which again are subdivided by
                    smaller slips into smaller cells. In these cells the bronchial tubes are not
                    ramified, but divide abruptly in them at the surface of the lung. Some idea of
                    this arrangement may be obtained from the lung of the ordinary land-tortoise <hi
                    rend="italic">(Testudo</hi><hi rend="italic">Groeca,</hi> Plate XXXVII. fig. 1).
                    The sacs or large cells are smaller and more numerous in the turtle (fig. 2);
                    but the general disposition is much the same.</p>
                <p>The young of the Batrachoid family, and several of the water-lizard tribe, are
                    provided with fimbriated or ciliated processes attached to the neck, and which
                    are in all respects similar to the gills of fishes. These gills disappear as the
                    animal grows; and when it assumes the true ranine or reptile character,
                    vesicular lungs like those of other reptiles, and which had continued in a
                    hitherto latent and rudimental state, are developed, and the animal breathes as
                    others of the same tribe.</p>
                <p>A peculiar form of respiratory organ is found in the lamprey or seven eyes, and
                    the two species of hag-fish, <hi rend="italic">(Myxine,</hi> Lin.; <hi
                    rend="italic">Gastrobranchus,</hi> Bl.; and <hi rend="italic">Gastrobraιιchus
                    Dombey).</hi> The former has on each side seven apertures leading into
                    cylindrical tubes, in which the branchiae are contained. (Plate XXXVII. fig. 3.)
                    In the two species of hag these tubes are dilated into ovoidal cavities, in
                    which the water is received, and on the membrane of which the branchial vessels
                    are distributed. In this respect, therefore, the hag-fish approaches to the mode
                    of respiration among the cephalopodous <hi rend="smallcaps">Mollusca,</hi> in
                    which the <hi rend="italic">branchiae</hi> are inclosed in a cavity. Lastly, in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Aphrodite</hi><hi rend="italic">aculeata,</hi> which may
                    be taken as an example of the respiration of worms, there is a series of tubes
                    like <hi rend="italic">tracheae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bronchi,</hi>
                    proceeding from the surface to the interior, and in which the water containing
                    the air requisite for respiration is received. (Fig. 6.)</p>
                <p>SECT. III.—SECRETORY ORGANS.</p>
                <p>Under this head ought to be described the urinary organs of the four vertebrated
                    classes. Those of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> agree in consisting of
                    kidneys more or less tabulated, ureters or excretory tubes, a reservoir or
                    urinary bladder, and a urethra opening on the same mucous surface with the
                    organs of generation. In the three oviparous classes considerable changes are
                    made. Though in Birds and Reptiles the glandular organs denominated kidneys are
                    left in the shape of aggregated glands with the two excretory tubes, the bladder
                    is withdrawn, and the ureters open in the <hi rend="italic">cloaca.</hi> The
                    only apparent exceptions are the ostrich and cassowary, in which the <hi
                    rend="italic">cloaca</hi> is so organized that it may serve as a bladder or
                    temporary receptacle of the urinary secretion. In the Reptiles the presence of
                    this organ is variable, being found in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Che-loniad</hi>
                    and <hi rend="smallcaps">Batrachoid</hi>; and the iguana, tupinambis, chameleon,
                    stellio, and dragon, among the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saurial</hi> tribe; but
                    wanting in the crocodile, lizard, <hi rend="italic">agami,</hi> gecko, and the
                    whole <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophidial</hi> tribe. In Fishes it is not less
                    variable. While the ray and shark tribe are destitute of bladder, and the
                    ureters terminate in a <hi rend="italic">cloaca,</hi> this receptacle exists in
                    the sea-devil, lump-fish, globe-fish, and others of the cartilaginous
                    division.</p>
                <p>A peculiar secreting organ, deserving notice, is the poison gland of the
                    poisonous serpents. It is a glandular body situate on each side above the upper
                    jaw, behind and below the eyes, with a considerable cavity, which opens into a
                    tang excretory tube, lying along the outer surface of the upper jaw, and opening
                    in the tubular tooth, represented at fig. 17 and 18; and which is movable in an
                    articulation, and may be erected, as in fig. 18, or depressed, as in 16, at the
                    will of the animal. The poisonous serpents are therefore distinguished from the
                    innocuous by the presence of the erectile movable tubular fangs. Fig. 15 is the
                    head of the innocuous, and 16 of the poisonous serpent.</p>
                <p>PART III.—REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS.</p>
                <p>Under this head we mention only the nipple-bag <hi rend="italic"
                    >(marsupium</hi><hi rend="italic">mammillare),</hi> or secondary uterus of the
                    Marsupial animals (Plate XXXλ <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> II. fig. 7); the
                    nipples (fig. 8); and the manner in which the foetal animal, in a very imperfect
                    and embryal form, becomes attached by the mouth to the nipples (fig. 10). The
                    <hi rend="italic">Marsupium,</hi> therefore, ought to be regarded, not as a mere
                    pouch in which the young may take refuge after they are grown, but as a
                    subsidiary <hi rend="italic">uterus,</hi> combining the character of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Mammoe</hi> of the other orders. «</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="smallcaps">Mammalia</hi> are peculiar in possessing a <hi
                    rend="italic">uterus.</hi> In the other classes this organ is withdrawn, and the
                    ovary (fig. 11) and oviduct alone are left. In the ovo-viviparous animals, as
                    the ovo-viviparous shark, the oviduct (fig. 12) resembles that of the common
                    fowl. In the lower classes the ova are hatched out of the body entirely.</p>
                <p>In the space assigned to this article, it was impossible to treat fully of a
                    subject so extensive as the structure of the animal world; and while the author
                    has arranged its divisions in such a manner as to show in what order it may be
                    most easily and advantageously studied, he has introduced only those topics
                    which are most indispensable, and most require illustration. For more complete
                    details, therefore, he r ’ efers the reader to the following works.</p>

                    of organs as they ascend, from the lowest to the highest classes, diminishes its
                    general interest. 4. <hi rend="italic">Lectures on Comparative Anatomy, in which

                <p>VEGETABLE ANATOMY.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">All</hi> the plants which collectively form the vegetable
                    kingdom have been arranged under two great divisions. , Those which possess
                    visible organs of reproduction, as stamens and pistils, have been termed <hi
                    rend="italic">phoenogamous,</hi> and constitute the first 23 classes in the
                    sexual system of Linnaeus; while those in which the reproductive organs are
                    either obscure or have not yet been discovered, have been termed <hi
                    rend="italic">cryptogamous,</hi> and form the 24th class of that system.
                    Humboldt estimates the total number of known species at 44,000; of which 38,000
                    belong to the former division, and 6000 to the latter. Μ. Brogniart, jun.
                    supposes the present known Flora to embrace 50,350 species, of which 10,200 may
                    be considered as cryptogamous, and 40,150 species as belonging to the
                    phaenogamous division. On the present occasion we propose to describe the
                    structure of those plants only which are included in the division of
                    phaenogamous plants.</p>
                <p>Of the vast number of plants which cover the surface of our globe, it belongs to
                    the botanist to describe the external forms in such manner as may serve to
                    discriminate species, and assign to each its place in a methodical system of
                    arrangement: it is the province of the anatomist to demonstrate, by dissection,
                    their internal structure, so as to prepare the way for a rational explanation of
                    their functions. In pursuing this object we may examine successively each of the
                    parts as they severally present themselves to view; or we may, in the first
                    place, study the elementary organs common to all plants, and then consider how
                    their combinations form the different parts of vegetables. The former method is
                    the <hi rend="italic">analytic,</hi> and was necessarily that of the first
                    observers; but, now that all the different parts are recognised as being formed
                    out of the same elementary organs, we gain, both in conciseness and clearness,
                    by adopting the latter or <hi rend="italic">synthetic</hi> mode.</p>
                <p>We shall accordingly describe, first, the elementary organs, and the primary
                    textures which they form; and proceed afterwards to the consideration of the
                    individual members and more complex organs of the plant. These elementary organs
                    have been denominated vessels and cells; and they form, either singly or
                    conjointly, what are called the vascular system and cellular tissue of plants.
                    Their combination gives rise to certain textures, which appear in the well-known
                    forms of skin, of bark, and of wood. On these we shall bestow the appellation of
                    common textures, and exhibit a general view of their structure and disposition
                    in the several parts of the vegetable body. A brief description of some minuter
                    parts, as of hairs and glands, will terminate this division of the subject.</p>
                <p>In the second part we shall begin with a description of the general structure of
                    <hi rend="italic">seeds,</hi> and afterwards treat more particularly of those
                    bodies under the two great divisions of <hi rend="italic">monocotyledonous</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">dicotyledonous</hi> seeds, tracing also the changes of
                    form and of structure which they exhibit in their evolution and progress to the
                    state of the mature plant. The structure of the <hi rend="italic">mature
                    plant</hi> itself will next claim our attention; and we shall accordingly
                    exhibit the anatomy of its several members, as of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >trunk,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">branch,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >root,</hi> in their more remarkable varieties and forms. After this, the
                    structure of the organs that spring from these several members, as <hi
                    rend="italic">buds</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bulbs, leaves, flowers,</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">fruits,</hi> will be separately and distinctly examined; and
                    having thus followed the progressive changes of form and of structure exhibited
                    in the-several stages of vegetable existence, we shall terminate our
                    descriptions by anatomical representations of the organs in which the seed was
                    produced, and the series of appearances successively displayed in its
                    formation.</p>
                <p>Through the whole of the descriptive detail we shall adhere as closely as we can
                    to the language of demonstration; supporting and illustrating our
                    representations of structure by continual reference to figures, selected in
                    great part from authors of repute, and in some instances from dissections made
                    by ourselves. We are aware, that of many reputed anatomical facts very different
                    representations have been given, all equally professing to rest on microscopical
                    observation. In such circumstances, we can do no more than report concisely the
                    statements of different observers; but shall dwell chiefly on those descriptions
                    and representations which seem best entitled to credit, and appear most
                    conformable to the analogies of other organized structures.</p>
                <p>When we consider the immense number of species that compose the vegetable
                    kingdom, and call to mind that in form, in size, and in structure, each species
                    differs from every other through every period of its existence, it must appear
                    altogether impracticable to describe and delineate any considerable number.
                    Fortunately, however, these diversities arise not from differences in the
                    elementary organs, but chiefly from their varied proportion, disposition, and
                    texture. In numerous species the disposition of the internal organs is very
                    similar, where the external form and texture widely differ. In other instances
                    the arrangement and composition of the internal parts vary not less than that of
                    the external figure. Of these varieties we shall exhibit different examples.</p>
                <p>In describing individual parts or organs, we might have brought many concurring
                    examples, and exhibited many similar representations, to confirm the views of
                    structure under consideration; but, in general, we have dwelt only on one or two
                    examples, and these we have selected from plants which are either important in
                    themselves, or whose structure has been most satisfactorily displayed, or which
                    seemed to afford the best illustration of the peculiarities we were engaged in
                    describing. From one example clearly given, the reader will readily apprehend
                    the nature of analogous structures, and escape the perplexity and fatigue which
                    unnecessary repetitions might occasion.</p>
                <p>Instead, also, of describing the vegetable at one or two stationary points of its
                    existence, in some of which its size is so minute as to be scarcely capable of
                    demonstration, we have followed it through the several stages of its growth. In
                    this way we really study it as a living body, continually exerting its
                    vegetative powers, and daily exhibiting the most striking variations in external
                    form, and frequently in internal structure. We hope thus to have conferred an
                    interest on the descriptive part, which may in some measure relieve the
                    unavoidable dryness of anatomical details; to have exhibited, in some instances,
                    clearer views of vegetable organization; and to have given a continuity to the
                    subject which isolated dissections, ata few stated periods, could not alone have
                    bestowed.</p>
                <p>It remains only to add a few remarks on the nomenclature employed in the present
                    article.</p>
                <p>In the description of external parts we have adhered chiefly to the Linnaean
                    nomenclature; but some of the terms employed by Linnaeus, in relation to
                    anatomical structure, are exceedingly vague and inappropriate; others <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096107?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6107-0042"/> are
                    manifestly erroneous, and, however well suited to the purposes of botany, are
                    not at all to be tolerated in any thing that aspires to correct anatomical
                    description.</p>
                <p>In the anatomy of seeds we have adopted many of the terms employed by Gaertner,
                    in his excellent work <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Fructibus et
                    Seminibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum,</hi> most of which had previously
                    been used by Malpighi and Grew.</p>
                <p>Thus, in every instance, we have exercised our own judgment in the selection of
                    terms, and, where it seemed necessary, have subjoined the synonyms of different
                    writers. Though we presume not to say that we have uniformly chosen the best, we
                    trust they will always clearly express the idea we designed to convey; and that,
                    in general, they have been used in one and the same sense, and in no other.
                    Except in one or two trivial instances, we have not ventured to introduce new
                    terms, but have studiously sought to avoid it, retaining even an inappropriate
                    expression, sanctioned by use, if it did not, at the same time, lead to
                    ambiguity, or convey an idea evidently false; and we have in general resisted
                    that torrent of new and barbarous terms, founded often on fancied refinements
                    and pretended discoveries, with which several continental writers have of late
                    attempted to deluge this branch of science.</p>
                <p>PART I.</p>
                <p>OF THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF THE ELEMENTARY ORGANS AND COMMON TEXTURES OF
                    VEGETABLES.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.</p>
                <p>OF THE ELEMENTARY ORGANS.</p>
                <p>Before we proceed to describe the structure of the individual parts of
                    vegetables, it may be useful to exhibit a general view of the elementary organs
                    of which they seem to be composed. Such a view will prepare the reader for
                    understanding more clearly the descriptive language hereafter to be employed,
                    and will even much abridge the extent to which that description must otherwise
                    be carried.</p>
                <p>Every one is familiar with the natural division of plants into herbs and trees,
                    and is aware that, how different soever they may appear in form and texture,
                    they all possess, in common, certain parts or members which we name the root,
                    the trunk, and the branches, from which proceed the leaves, the flowers, the
                    fruits, and seeds. Infinitely varied as these several parts are, in figure,
                    size, and texture, they .all originate from a few constituent or elementary
                    organs, whose situation, proportions, and combination, give rise to all the
                    diversity that we see. “Upon the anatomical analysis of all the parts of a
                    plant,” says Grew, “I have certainly found, that in all plants there are two,
                    and only two, organical parts essentially distinct, viz. the pithy part and the
                    ligneous part.” <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 19.) <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ii</hi> And as every part hath two, so the whole vegetable,
                    taken together,” he adds, “is a composition of two only, and no more. All
                    properly woody parts, strings, and fibres, are one body; all simple barks,
                    piths, parenchymas, and pulps, and, as to their substantial nature, peels and
                    skins, are all likewise but one body; the several parts of a vegetable differing
                    from each other only by the various proportions and mixtures, and variated pores
                    and structure, of these two bodies.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 47.) In
                    the anatomical descriptions of Malpighi, the Compound structure is resolved, in
                    like manner, into two constituent parts, called by him the ligneous and
                    utricular portions. To these parts may be assigned the general appellations of
                    the <hi rend="italic">Vascular System</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cellular
                    Tissue</hi> of plants, the description of which shall form the first subjects of
                    consideration.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> I.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Vascular System.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> I.—
                    <hi rend="italic">General Characters of the Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>By the vascular system may be understood, in a general sense, all those parts of
                    a plant which .do not exhibit the form either of membrane or of cells. It
                    constitutes almost the entire bulk of the more solid parts of trees, and by Grew
                    and Malpighi was denominated the ligneous body, in contradistinction to the
                    cellular tissue which accompanies it, and which forms by far the largest portion
                    of many herbaceous plants. To common observation, a piece of dry wood appears to
                    be a mass of solid fibres, that is, a series of particles arranged in a filiform
                    figure, and destitute of any continuous canal. Thus Tournefort and others
                    considered the ligneous parts of a plant to be a mass of minute solid filaments,
                    placed parallel to each other, like the threads in a skein of silk, between the
                    interstices of which the sap ascended; but the anatomical researches of Grew
                    conducted him to a different conclusion. “If it be asked,” says he, “what all
                    that part of a plant, whether herb or tree, which is properly called the woody
                    part—what all that is? I suppose that it is nothing else but a cluster of
                    innumerable and most extraordinary small vessels or concave fibres.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 20.) Malpighi held similar opinions
                    concerning the vascularity of plants, which was farther attested by the
                    microscopical observations of Hooke and Leeuwenhoeck. Du Hamel, though he admits
                    that, under maceration, the parts of plants seem capable of indefinite
                    subdivision, yet, from many circumstances, avows his conviction of their
                    vascularity; and Hedwig maintains that the oldest and most compact plant is but
                    a congeries of vessels and cells, which have nothing of the character of a
                    fibrous solid, except in the thin membranous coats by which they are formed. <hi
                    rend="italic">(De Fibroe Vegetab. Ortu,</hi> p.17.)</p>
                <p>Few circumstances have contributed more to perplex and retard our knowledge of
                    the structure of plants, than the vague and erroneous nomenclature that has been
                    employed to designate their constituent organs, more particularly in relation to
                    the vascular system. Thus the several terms filaments, fibres, strings, threads,
                    and nerves, which, in their ordinary acceptation, are understood to express a
                    solid substance, have been constantly made use of in describing the tubes or
                    vessels of plants. The same organs, however, even by the same writers, are
                    frequently called tubular bodies, ligneous tubes, concave fibres, ducts, canals,
                    arteries, veins, and vessels. In our future descriptions we shall employ the
                    term vessel in a generic sense, to express all the diversity of names just
                    enumerated; and the different kinds or species of vessels we shall hereafter
                    attempt to discriminate by appropriate appellations.</p>
                <p>Vessels, as we have said, exist in almost every part of a plant. In the higher
                    orders of animals the fluids contained in the vessels are conveyed to a central
                    reservoir called the heart, from which they are again sent out to all parts of
                    the body. Near to this reservoir the veş- <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096120?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6120-0043"/> 'sels are few
                    in number and large in size; and they gradually lessen in size and increase in
                    number as they recede from it. In plants there is no such reservoir, but the
                    fluids which enter by innumerable mouths at the root are at once distributed
                    equally through all parts of the vegetable that are fitted to receive them.
                    Hence in plants there is little variation in the diameter of the vessels; and
                    their general figure is therefore cylindrical.</p>
                <p>From the extreme minuteness of the vessels, it is scarcely possible to compute
                    their number with accuracy. By driving off their fluids without destroying their
                    figure, as is done in the preparation of charcoal, Hooke numbered in a line,
                    ∙⅛th part of an inch long, not fewer than 150 vessels; therefore, in a line an
                    inch long, there must be 2700, and in a surface of a square inch, 7,290,000
                    vessels; <hi rend="superscript"> il</hi> which would seem incredible,” says he,
                    “were not every one left to believe his own eyes.” These facts he verified by
                    other observations on decayed wood, in which the vessels were empty; and also on
                    petrifactions of ligneous bodies, in which the places of the vessels were very
                    conspicuous. In very close and dense wood, as that of guaiacum, the vessels were
                    still more minute than in the examples just quoted. <hi rend="italic"

                    part of a square inch, Leeuwenhoeck reckoned 20,000 vessels; so that in an
                    oak-tree of no more than one foot in circumference, or about four inches in
                    diameter, there will be found, according to his computation, 200,000,000 of such
                    vessels. <hi rend="italic">(Select Works, translated by Hoole,</hi> vol. i. p.

                    j⅛th of an inch in diameter; and as his instrument magnified 290 times, the true
                    diameter must be reckoned the 3480th part of an inch, which would give for the
                    square inch 12,110,400 vessels. In certain plants, however, the vessels are
                    large enough to be discerned by the naked eye, and in some cases they acquire a
                    large size.</p>
                <p>The vessels of plants do not, like those of animais, exist single, but are
                    collected into fasciculi or bundles, which, however, have often the appearance
                    of single vessels. In the stems of herbs, and in roots, Grew discovered each
                    small fasciculus to be composed of from 30 to 100, or sometimes many hundred
                    vessels. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 20.) The direction of
                    these fasciculi in the trunk is generally perpendicular, but in other parts
                    their course is often oblique, and in their smaller ramifications they produce
                    all sorts of figures. In herbs the fasciculi are more or less numerous, and
                    placed often at considerable distances from each other, exhibiting the
                    appearance of small columns dispersed through the cellular tissue: in other
                    instances they are much more numerous, but destitute of any symmetrical
                    arrangement; while, in trees, they are disposed regularly around the axis,
                    presenting in their transverse section the well-known appearance of concentric
                    circles in the wood.</p>
                <p>In some parts, where the fasciculi stand at a distance from each other, some
                    vessels often quit one parcel to unite with another, and return afterwards to
                    that which they had previously left. In this manner they are said to ramify, and
                    frequently, by their ramification, a reticulated appearance is produced, as
                    occurs especially in the bark and leaves. In the wood of the trunk, where they
                    stand collaterally in a perpendicular direction, they very seldom, if ever, run
                    into one another, but keep, says Grew, like.so many several vessels, all along
                    distinct; as, by cutting, and so following any one fasciculus, may be observed.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 20.) In branches and roots, though
                    the direction of the fasciculi be changed, they seem only to break into smaller
                    parcels, and run side by side, never inosculating with each other, nor being
                    ramified, so as to be successively propagated one from another, as in the
                    vessels of animals. Neither, adds he, are they wound together like threads in a
                    rope, but are only contiguous or simply tangent, like the several cords in the
                    braces of a drum. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 66.) Even in the
                    leaf, where the vessels seem to ramify out of greater into less, as in the
                    arteries of animals, yet, if the skin and pulp of the leaf be removed, and the
                    vessels laid bare, it will appear that they are all of the same size everywhere
                    in the leaf, and all continued through it, as distinct tubes, like the several
                    threads in a skein of silk. The distribution of the vessels is not effected,
                    therefore, by their ramifying out of greater into less, but by the division of a
                    greater fasciculus into several smaller fasciculi, till at last they come to be
                    single. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 155.)</p>
                <p>It may be doubted whether, when the vessels of different fasciculi come into
                    contact, they ever actually unite and are lost in each other, forming that kind
                    of connection which is called inosculation or anastomosis. Grew strenuously
                    contends against any such connection of the vessels in any part of the plant.
                    “On a superficial view, indeed, the vessels of the leaf,” says he, “seem to be
                    inosculated, not only side to side, but the ends of some into the sides of
                    others: but neither is this ever really done, the lesser fasciculi being only so
                    far diducted as to stand at right angles with the greater; but they are never
                    inosculated, except end to end, or mouth to mouth, after they are come at last
                    to their final distribution.” <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p.
                    155.) Malpighi, however, from the fact of the alternate separation and
                    conjunction of the vessels, and from analogy with what occurs in the animal
                    system, speaks always of the anastomosis of the vessels, but he nowhere gives us
                    any thing like proof of the fact; and Du Hamel, from actual dissection of
                    several fasciculi, regards them in their union as resembling more the nerves
                    than the blood-vessels of animals. When, indeed, we consider the extraordinary
                    minuteness of the vessels, and the circumstance of their possessing nearly the
                    same size in every part, there is no room for that continual ramification out of
                    one into another, and consequent diminution of diameter, that occur in the
                    vessels of animals; and the immensity of their number, together with the endless
                    separations and re-unions which their fasciculi make, seems calculated to fulfil
                    the purposes of less general distribution in the plant, which successive
                    division and perpetual anastomosis effect in the animal system.</p>
                <p>Another general circumstance in the vessels of plants is, that we do not discover
                    in them any structure which has the true nature and use of valves, similar to
                    what is met with in the veins and absorbent vessels of animals. Dr Hooke could
                    never observe in their canal any thing that had the appearance of valves. <hi
                    rend="italic">(AIicrographia,</hi> p. 116.) Did such a structure exist, the
                    absorption of nutrient matter from the lobes of the seed, and its conveyance, in
                    a backward course, to the embryo, could not, says Grew, have place; neither
                    could the root, as it often does, grow upward and downward both at once. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants.)</hi> If the piece of a root of elm-tree be
                    cut in autumn, the juices, says Du Hamel, are found to escape indifferently at
                    either end, as the one or the other is alternately held downward; a
                    circumstance, he observes, inconsistent with the opinion of Mariotte, who
                    maintained the existence of valves. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tom. i. p. 56.) It is well known, also, that many
                    plants may be made to grow in an inverted position, so as to put forth leaves
                    and flowers from their roots; and large trees have been <pb break="no"

                    juices received through the extremities of their ingrafted branches, after all
                    connection between the earth and the roots had been cut off. In general, indeed,
                    the extreme minuteness of the vessels seems almost to preclude the possible
                    existence of valves in their canal; but in some instances, where the vessels in
                    aged trees have become enlarged, membranous productions have been found to
                    occupy their cavities, which some have alleged to perform the office of valves.
                    They occur, however, only at an advanced period of growth, and form no necessary
                    part of the structure of the vessel, and, instead of promoting, contribute only
                    to obstruct the course of the fluids.</p>
                <p>Thus far with regard to the general nature of the vessels of plants: let us next
                    discriminate their several species or kinds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Common
                    Sap-Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>To ascertain the kinds and situation of the vessels of plants, various means have
                    been employed. The plant has been dissected both in its dry and recent state;
                    the natural qualities and movements of its fluids have been observed; and its
                    vessels have been filled with coloured liquors, by causing it to vegetate in
                    them. By the combined use of these several means, many important particulars
                    have been ascertained; but it must be acknowledged that the question is still
                    beset with doubts and difficulties, and that, with relation to it, great
                    diversity of opinion continues to prevail. A concise statement of the facts
                    ascertained with respect to the movements of the vegetable fluids may perhaps
                    contribute to define the situation and kinds of the vessels that convey
                    them.</p>
                <p>It has been proved that, early in spring, before the leaves appear, a watery
                    fluid rises abundantly in the woody part of the trunk of trees, and continues
                    visibly to ascend to the very extremity of the branches, until the leaves are
                    developed, when, to appearance, it ceases to flow, and can no longer be
                    collected by perforating or tapping the tree. This fluid has been shown to
                    ascend through the wood, and to rise, in general, most abundantly through its
                    youngest or outmost circle; but in trees whose vessels have not been obstructed
                    from age or other causes, it rises through every circle to the very pith, and,
                    as far as can be judged, in all the vessels that compose those circles. At this
                    early period of vegetation no fluid is found in the bark, nor between it and the
                    wood, nor in the pith; but the vessels of the bark are perfectly dry. These
                    facts are deducible from observations on the natural flow of the fluids by Grew,
                    Du Hamel, Walker, and others; and are supported by various experiments of Μ. de
                    la Baisse, Bonnet, Reichcl, and others, made by causing plants and parts of
                    plants to grow in coloured liquors, in which the vessels of the wood alone
                    became filled; but no tinge of colour was communicated to those of the bark. To
                    these vessels the several names of lymph-ducts, sap-vesşels, ligneous tubes,
                    ascending and adducent vessels, have been applied: we shall in future denominate
                    them <hi rend="italic">sap-vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>The vessels which thus form the mass of wood have by some writers been
                    distributed into different kinds, and supposed to exercise very different
                    functions. At certain periods of vegetation they appear empty; and hence
                    Malpighi supposed two species of vessels to exist in the wood, one destined to
                    carry sap, and the other to convey air: to these latter, from their supposed
                    office, he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">tracheae,</hi> and from their
                    structure called them spiral vessels. (<hi rend="italic">Anatom. Plantar.
                    Idea,</hi> p. 3.) Grew also believed these empty tubes to be air-vessels, but
                    admitted that at certain seasons they carried sap. At an early period, however,
                    Ray maintained that the vessels thus supposed to convey air were truly
                    sap-vessels; and Du Hamel, in common with Grew, admitted that they carried sap
                    in spring. Hill considered them altogether as sap-vessels; and Reichel, Hedwig,
                    and others, by filling them with coloured fluids, proved that such was their
                    true office. On the other hand, no experiments, says Ludwig, have yet shown that
                    there exist in vegetables vessels destined to convey only air; and in this
                    opinion subsequent writers, with few exceptions, have acquiesced. It will,
                    however, be convenient to treat of their general nature and form under the
                    distinct appellations of <hi rend="italic">sapvessels</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiral vessels,</hi> by which they are commonly known.</p>
                <p>By Grew and Malpighi the common sap-vessels were regarded as entire tubes, having
                    no apertures but in&lt; the direction of their length. Grew represents a single
                    vessel as having the appearance exhibited in fig. 1, Plate XXXy∏L, the aperture
                    or canal of which is not visible unless highly magnified, as in fig. 2.
                    According to Malpighi&lt; these vessels send off numerous capillary filaments to
                    the] cellular tissue, so that the cells are surrounded by a plexus of vessels,
                    as is particularly seen in the pith of elder and some others; and these
                    ramifications, he adds, spring probably from the perpendicular vessels both in
                    the bark and wood. <hi rend="italic">(Anatom. Plantar,</hi> p. 29. Lugd. Bat.
                    1688.) These lateral ramifications were observed also by Leeuwenhoeck in a piece
                    of fir-wood newly felled. Of ∣ this wood he procured a longitudinal section, so
                    extremely thin that he could see distinctly the particles of fluid moving in the
                    vessels, as represented in the upper portion of fig. 3, Plate XXXVIII.; while
                    lower down, on many parts of these vessels, small points or dots were visible,
                    which he at length discovered to be round apertures; and as he did not see these
                    apertures in any other parts than those in which he had separated the horizontal
                    cellular tissue from the perpendicular vessels, he concluded that, at these
                    points, these two organs were connected. He farther separated two of the vessels
                    from the remainder, and through the microscope they appeared as in fig. 4; but
                    the “engraver,” he adds, “said that he could not possibly draw all the jagged
                    parts that he saw; and we both of us perceived, in the broken membrane or coat
                    of the tube, many excessively minute vessels, which, by reason of their
                    smallness, he was unable to express in the drawing.” <hi rend="italic">(Select
                    Works of Lceuwenhoeck,</hi> by Hoole, vol. i. p∙ <hi rend="superscript"> 12</hi>

                <p>It may however be said, that this communication between the vessels and cells is
                    maintained not by ramifications from the vessels, but through apertures or pores
                    in their sides; and, accordingly, many appearances have been remarked as
                    existing on the sides of the vessels, of which different authors have given very
                    different representations, and which some have regarded as pores. Thus, on the
                    vessels of the fir Malpighi observed certain dotted appearances, which he
                    describes as roundish tubercles, and which were so numerous that they appeared
                    to cover the vessels. On the vessels of the elm, the beech, and the willow,
                    Leeuwenhoeck saw similar particles, which resembled small globules. <hi
                    rend="italic">(SelectWorks,vo</hi> ∖ <hi rend="italic">.</hi> ii. p.I.) Dr Hill
                    describes the vessels of the alburnum, or newly formed wood of the willow, as
                    connected with each other by a flocculent interstitial matter. When, by long
                    maceration, this matter is detached, the vessels then exhibit a dotted
                    appearance; and, if examined by a highly magnifying power, these dots, according
                    to him, are so many oval swellings, and each has, as it were, a mouth. Through
                    these mouths, which he represents as innumerable, and <pb break="no"

                    all parts of the vessels, he conceives the fluids to be discharged into the
                    cellular tissue. <hi rend="italic">( On the Construction of Timber,</hi> p. 18.)
                    In fig. 5, Plate XXXVΠI., is a representation of these vessels connected by
                    flocculent matter, with their extremities collapsed from the escape of their
                    juices, and their sides sprinkled with the little mouths which he mentions.
                    These mouths, if they exist at all, are probably not pores in the sides of the
                    vessels, but the little apertures seen by Leeuwenhoeck, and produced by the
                    separation of the cellular tissue while the parts are still young and tender.
                    The same author, speaking of the vessels of the mature wood of the pear, states
                    them to be close canals, as in fig. 6, with no lateral apertures in them.</p>
                <p>A still later writer, Μ. Mirbel, declares, that not fewer than fĵve species of

                    tubes, cleft tubes, tracheae, mixed tubes, and vessels <hi rend="italic">en
                    chapelet,</hi> from their supposed resemblance to a string of beads. Of these
                    several species we have given representations in figures 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and
                    12, Plate XXXVIII. The first species, or porous tubes, according to this writer,
                    exist in every part of the plant where the sap moves with freedom. Their sides
                    are covered with small eminences or projections, in the centre of which is to be
                    found a small pore. <hi rend="italic">(Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">de la

                    >Végétale,</hi> p. 107.) Improving a little on Hill, he represents these pores
                    not as promiscuously placed, but as ranged in transverse lines (fig. 7); and
                    through them he conceives the fluids of the plant to percolate, not, however,
                    into the cells only, but out of one layer of tubes into another, in a lateral
                    direction. In this manner he conducts the fluids from the centre to the
                    circumference of the wood, and at length, by a route not so easily followed,
                    contrives to get them into the vessels of the bark, the sides of which he
                    declares to be perfectly entire, and alike destitute of pores and clefts. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 297.)</p>
                <p>Several writers have sought to discover these alleged pores in the sides of the
                    vessels. With Malpighi, some regard the appearances observed not as pores, but
                    as elevations on the surface of the vessels; others, as particles contained
                    within them. Under a very highly magnifying power, Kieser thinks he has, in some
                    vessels, detected the existence of pores; while Μ. Dutrochet pronounces the same
                    objects to be corpuscles, filled with nervous matter; and De Candolle suggests
                    the probability of their being small glands, destined in some way to contribute
                    to the nutrition of the plant. These different opinions, formed on viewing the
                    same objects, sufficiently manifest the difficulty and uncertainty of
                    microscopical observations made with highly magnifying powers, as was long since
                    pointed out by Hooke, who first applied the microscope to the examination of the
                    structure of plants. “Of such minute objects,” says he, “there is much more
                    difficulty to discover the true shape by an instrument than by the naked eye;
                    the same object quite differing in one position to the light, from what it
                    really is and may be shown to be in another. In some objects,” he adds, “it is
                    exceedingly difficult to distinguish between a prominency and a depression,
                    between a shadow and a black stain, or a reflection and a whiteness in the
                    colour; and the transparency of most objects renders them yet more difficultthan
                    if they were opaque.” <hi rend="italic">(Micrographia,</hi> Preface.)</p>

                <p>Various as have been the opinions of writers respecting the <hi rend="italic"
                    >common</hi> sap-vessels of plants, they have differed yet more in their views
                    concerning the position, number, size, structure, and uses of those which have
                    been denominated <hi rend="italic">spiral.</hi> The common fathers of Vegetable
                    Anatomy, Grew and Malpighi, who at the same time, but in different countries,
                    prosecuted their inquiries without any knowledge of or communication with each
                    other, are nearly of one opinion on all the more important points in relation to
                    these vessels. Later writers have differed alike from them, and from each other,
                    on almost every point. As the subjectis of fundamental importance in the economy
                    of vegetables, we shall endeavour to set before the reader the leading facts and
                    opinions concerning it; to canvass their relative merits; and deduce from the
                    whole such conclusions as seem most nearly to approach the truth.</p>
                <p>Malpighi describes spiral vessels as existing in the ligneous parts of all
                    plants. He called them <hi rend="italic">spiral tubes,</hi> because, when
                    extended, they were resolved, not into separate rings, but into a single zone,
                    which might be drawn out to a great length. In general they form continuous
                    tubes, but are sometimes contracted at regular distances, so as to resemble
                    somewhat a series of oblong cells. One of these contracted spiral vessels, as
                    delineated by Malpighi, is represented in fig. 17, Plate XXXVΠI., at the
                    extremity of which the spiral filament is in part drawn out; and similar
                    appearances of the spiral structure are exhibited in figures 9 and 10, by
                    Mirbel. In herbs, according to Malpighi, these spiral vessels constantly
                    accompany the common sap-vessels, and are ensheathed by them; in shrubs, they
                    occur in every part of the wood, single or in clusters; and in trees, an
                    intermixture of spiral vessels with the common sap-vessels is observed in every
                    part of the wood. In the fir, they are found immediately beneath the bark, and
                    are so numerous as to constitute the chief bulk of the wood. They exist with the
                    sap-vessels in the petioles and ribs of the leaf, and likewise in the petals of
                    the flower. In the roots they are also met with, and in some roots are so
                    abundant, as to exceed in bulk all the other parts. They exist, he adds, in
                    every part of the plant except the bark; and are annually formed with the
                    alburnous vessels of trees. <hi rend="italic">(Anatom. Plantar,
                    passim.)</hi></p>
                <p>From the writings of Grew we collect also that spiral vessels exist in every part
                    of a plant except the bark. In the root they are numerous, of very various size,
                    and their bore is generally larger than that of the common sap-vessels. In the
                    trunks both of herbs and trees they are equally visible, and in position, size,
                    and number, subject to great variation. Sometimes they are collected into
                    fasciculi, at other times they are disposed in rays, and in other instances they
                    are arranged in a circular form: they stand sometimes next to the pith, in other
                    instances next to the bark, and in other cases again they alternate with the
                    common sap-vessels in every part of the wood. They have a more ample bore than
                    the common vessels, and vary in size to at least twenty different degrees. In
                    the leaf they always accompany the sap-vessels, and both in its petiole and ribs
                    are constantly surrounded or ensheathed by them. They have a similar position in
                    the petals of the flower, and in the vascular parts of the fruit. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants, passim.)</hi> Hence, then, it appears, from
                    the dissections of Malpighi and Grew, that, in every plant in which vessels are
                    to be seen, and almost in every part of it, spiral vessels abound; they exist,
                    however, only in the <hi rend="italic">ligneous portion,</hi> or that part in
                    which the sap <hi rend="italic">ascends,</hi> and are never to be found in the
                    bark.</p>
                <p>By Du Hamel, the spiral vessels, supposed to con-&lt; vey air, are described as
                    existing in the leaves and the <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> flowers, the
                    petals of which are almost wholly composed of them. In the herbaceous portion of
                    young branches <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096159?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6159-0046"/> they are also well seen; which portion afterwards
                    becomes ligneous; so that it cannot be doubted that they exist in the wood,
                    though he could never discover them but in young branches. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tom. i. p. 42.) If, however, all
                    the empty vessels seen in a transverse section of the wood be deemed
                    air-vessels, and all air-vessels have a spiral structure, then, says this
                    author, they would, in many plants, form a great part of the ligneous body. From
                    these large vessels, however, he has seen, in autumn, fluids to escape; so that
                    they are not properly air-vessels, or, as Grew observed, they sometimes carry
                    sap. They are not to be found in the bark.</p>
                <p>Under the common name of sap-vessels, Hill delineates all the varieties of
                    vessels that constitute the wood; they are largest in the outer circles, smaller
                    in the others; they contain, says he, in spring and at midsummer, a limpid
                    liquor; but at all other seasons they appear empty, and have therefore been
                    erroneously deemed air-vessels. He says nothing of their spiral construction;
                    but describes the vessels which form the chief mass of the wood as possessing
                    solid and firm coats, forming an arrangement of plain and simple tubes, as in
                    fig. 6, Plate XXXVIII., resembling those of the alburnum, except that they have
                    no mouths in their sides. <hi rend="italic">( On the Construction of
                    Timber,</hi> p. 8 and 19.)</p>
                <p>Μ. Reichel maintains the existence of spiral vessels in almost all parts of the
                    plant. By causing plants to vegetate in coloured fluids, he traced them from the
                    roots, through the trunk and branches, to the extremity of the leaves, and into
                    all parts of the flower,—as the calyx, the petals, the style, the stamens, and
                    the anthers. In fruits and in seeds, and in the radicle and plume of the latter,
                    they were equally apparent. The coloured liquors, as they rose, communicated a
                    tinge to the cellular tissue of the wood, as was previously observed by De la
                    Baisse; but no trace of colour was ever observed either in the bark or pith,
                    which therefore contain no spiral vesśels. He considered the spiral vessels as
                    the organs everywhere conveying nutrient matter to the plant, and as having no
                    title to the appellation of air-vessels. <hi rend="italic">(En-cyclop.</hi><hi

                    288.) Similar experiments of Hedwig and others confirm these facts as to the
                    general distribution of the spiral vessels, and their bearing to every part the
                    fluids absorbed by the roots.</p>
                <p>We have already enumerated the five different species of vessels which Mirbel
                    regards as constituting the woody part of plants. According to him, true spiral
                    Vessels (which he continues to denominate <hi rend="italic">tracheae)</hi> are
                    not to be found in the root, but only in the trunk and the parts which are
                    produced from it. Even in the trunk they are to be found only around the pith,
                    and never in the exterior ligneous layers. He admits that they exist in all soft
                    and succulent parts, and that coloured fluids rise in them as well as in the
                    other varieties of vessels; but they never are to be found either in the bark or
                    pith. <hi rend="italic">(Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">de la Théorie</hi><hi

                <p>According to Μ. Kieser, spiral vessels are found in all the more perfect plants,
                    from the earliest period of their existence; and in all parts of them, except
                    the bark and pith. They vary much in size, and in aged plants are frequently
                    obstructed by a species of vesicle, which originates from the interior sides of
                    the vessels. According to him, nothing but air is found in their cavity, though,
                    in the wood of guaiacum, he has seen all the spiral vessels, in common with the
                    cellular tissue, completely filled with resinous matter. He does not know the
                    anatomical relation subsisting between the spiral vessels and the other organs;
                    but thinks it proved that no direct communication exists between them and the
                    cells. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ľ Organisation des
                    Plantes,</hi> 1814, p. 116, 117.) Lastly, Μ. de Candolle admits the existence of
                    spiral vessels in the wood of the trunk, but not of the roots; and, with Kieser,
                    regards them as conveying only air. <hi rend="italic">( Organographie</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Végétale,</hi> tome i. p.* 39.)</p>
                <p>From the combined observations of all the preceding writers, with the exception
                    of MM. Mirbel and de Candolle, we learn that spiral vessels exist not only in
                    every part of the trunk, but in the root, and in every other part of the plant
                    except the bark and the pith. From the actual presence of sap in these vessels
                    early in spring, and again in autumn, and from the entrance of coloured fluids
                    at all seasons, we also learn, that their true office is not to convey air, as
                    Malpighi and others formerly, and Kieser and others more recently, maintain; but
                    to carry sap. Are we therefore to regard them as a species distinct from the
                    common sap-vessels, or are both to be held merely as varieties of one common
                    kind? This question may receive some illustration from a little farther inquiry
                    into the formation and structure of the sap and spiral vessels.</p>

                    and Spiral Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>Malpighi seems to have regarded the common sapvessels as being formed of a series
                    of small vesicles or cells, mutually opening into each other. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. Plantar.</hi> p. 28.) In this instance he appears either to have
                    mistaken a series of elongated cells for vessels, or to have conceived that the
                    contractions, occasionally formed in the vessels themselves, afforded evidence
                    of their having been constructed originally by cells. Grew, on the other hand,
                    considered these vessels to be composed of straight fibres, placed parallel to
                    each other, so as to form a cylindrical tube. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 112.) Leeuwenhoeck held them to be composed of two fine
                    transparent coats, formed of other vessels excessively minute. <hi rend="italic"
                    >( Select Worhs,</hi> vol. i. p. 11.) And Du Hamel, by submitting thin layers of
                    wood to long maceration, obtained bundles of longitudinal fibres of extreme
                    minuteness, by which he considered the lymphatic vessels of the wood to be
                    formed. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i.
                    p. 32.) Hill describes the alburnous vessels as being formed of the same
                    material as the cells, and to collapse when emptied of their fluids. In one
                    instance, where a strong light was made to penetrate the vessel, it appeared as
                    if composed of numerous cells; but on farther examination, these seeming
                    divisions altered their places, and were found to proceed from portions of
                    watery sap still retained in the vessel. This appearance, as he properly
                    observes, may be a very necessary lesson against hasty judgments. <hi

                <p>According to Μ. Mirbel, “the entire mass of the plant is nothing but cellular
                    tissue, the cells of which differ only in form and dimensions.” The cells and
                    vessels are thus considered to be formed out of one and the same membranous
                    tissue. In forming cells, this membrane is supposed to dilate in every
                    direction: in producing vessels, it increases only in length. <hi rend="italic"

                    Organisation</hi><hi rend="italic">Végétale?)</hi> The manner in which he
                    supposes the vessels to be formed out of the primitive membrane is very
                    fanciful; and he is probably right in thinking that “no one before himself had
                    formed a similar conception of vegetable organization.”</p>
                <p>Concerning the structure of the <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> vessels, opinions
                    have varied still more than in relation to those just considered. Malpighi
                    describes them as composed of <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096172?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6172-0047"/> -a thin pellucid plate, of a silvery colour,
                    somewhat broad, and which, being placed spirally, and united at its edges, '
                    constructs a tube. When this tube is drawn out, it does not ^separate into
                    distinct rings, but is resolved into a continuous spiral zone. At particular
                    places these vessels are sometimes contracted, so as to exhibit the appearance
                    of oblong cells opening into each other, as in fig. 17, Plate XXXVIII. In size
                    they greatly surpass the ordinary sapvessels; and their canal is then frequently
                    occupied by membranous vesicles, which nearly fill their cavity. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anal. Plantar,</hi> p. 3-26.) These vesicles were also observed
                    by Leeuwenhoeck, and their appearance, in the transverse section of an enlarged
                    vessel, is represented in fig. 25.</p>
                <p>According to Grew, the thin plate that forms the spiral vessel is not flat, and,
                    instead of being single, consists of two or more round filaments or threads,
                    placed collaterally, but perfectly distinct. These component filaments he
                    regards as united by other smaller transverse filaments, and the thin plates
                    which they form by their connection constitute the spiral vessel,—“as if we
                    should imagine,” he adds, “a piece of fine narrow riband to be wound spirally,
                    and edge to edge, round a stick, and the stick being drawn out, the riband to be
                    left in the figure of a tube, answerable to a spiral vessel.” As, however, the
                    riband is composed of numerous threads, placed parallel to each other, so is the
                    plate that forms the spiral vessel; and it is according to the greater or less
                    delieaey of the vessel examined, and the manner of its dissection, that it
                    appears to be constituted either of a flat plate or a round filament. The
                    spiration of the filaments he considered to be made in the root from right to
                    left, and in the trunk from left to right. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 73 and 117.)</p>
                <p>- The opinion of Du Hamel with respect to the construction of these vessels was
                    very similar to that of Grew, and he employed the same analogy of a riband ,
                    twisted round a stick to illustrate it. Hedwig gave a very different account of
                    them. He considered the spiral vessel to be composed of two distinet parts; one
                    a membranous canal conveying air, and the other a spiral tube rolled round it,
                    by which the fluids were conveyed. The spires of the tube, in some instances,
                    are represented as close; in others they are separated, and the intervening
                    portions of the membranous canal exhibit a dotted appearance. He considered all
                    the sap-vessels, from their first formation, to possess this compound structure,
                    and, by a series of changes, which he professes to describe, to be ultimately
                    transformed into the solid fibre of the wood. <hi rend="italic">(De. Fïbrae
                    Vegetal). Ortu,</hi> p. 25.) Others, also, have believed the spiral vessel to be
                    formed of a membranous tube, but have denied that it conveyed air; and the
                    spiral tube of Hedwig they have regarded as a solid filament. From the different
                    appearances which they exhibit, MM. Treviranus and Bernhardi distinguish several
                    varieties of spiral vessels; as does also Μ. Kieser, whose account of these
                    vessels is not only the most elaborate, but that probably which approaches
                    nearest to truth. We shall therefore subjoin a brief abstract of his
                    observations on the structure of these vessels, and more particularly on the
                    series of <hi rend="italic">transformations</hi> which they seem to undergo.</p>
                <p>The construction of these vessels Μ. Kieser professes to have studied with the
                    greatest eare, and to have established incontestably the following points.
                    Sometimes, says he, only one fibre, sometimes many, go to form the spire of a
                    vessel. These fibres are commonly round, sometimes a little flattened, and are
                    twisted spirally about an empty space, so as to form a tube. The spiral fibres
                    in young plants, and sometimes in mature ones, are in close contact; in other
                    instances they are separated, and the interstices are then occupied by a dotted
                    or punctuated membrane, as is very frequent in trees; or sometimes they are
                    connected by ramifications which proceed from the spiral fibres themselves. From
                    the minuteness of the spiral fibre, it is difficult to decide whether it is a
                    solid or tubular body, and often, from the same cause, to pronounce whether it
                    is round or flattened.. It is transparent, has considerable consistence and
                    tenacity, and in some plants appears to possess elasticity.</p>
                <p>The number of fibres that form the spire of a vessel is very various; sometimes,
                    as before remarked, there is only one, but more often several, which are twisted
                    in the same plane and the same direction. He has seen nine fibres thus united;
                    and when unrolled, the spires of the vessels then seem to form a kind of riband.
                    When many fibres are employed to form a spire, they always run parallel, and do
                    not cross; so that the side of the vessel has never more than the thickness of a
                    single fibre. At their first formation the fibres are not united; it is only in
                    more advanced age that they become united, either by ramifications from their
                    edges, or by a peculiar membrane. The direction of the fibre in twisting is
                    sometimes from right to left, and sometimes the contrary. The size also is very
                    various. In young plants it is very small, so that a millimetre comprises the
                    diameter of 2600 of these fibres; and in some instances they have little more
                    than half that size. In older vessels they have a larger size. Between the knots
                    of the trunk they are simple, and do not ramify; but in the knots they undergo
                    great changes of form, and are variously ramified and combined.</p>

                    the Spiral Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>It was the opinion of Grew, that the “common sapvessels begin to be formed in
                    spring, but the spiral vessels not till the end of summer, at least not till
                    about that time do they appear.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p.
                    131.) Malpighi also describes these vessels as gradually appearing in the
                    alburnum, and augmenting in size in every successive ring of wood; an
                    observation made also by Grew, who describes the “spiral vessels as being
                    amplified in each annual ring, so as to form a vessel of a wider bore.” These
                    facts indicate that the spiral vessels, after their formation, undergo
                    considerable changes in the progress of vegetation, or, to use the language of
                    Grew, that <hi rend="superscript"> ¢</hi> ‘ they are postnate, and seem produced
                    by some alteration in the quality, position, and texture of their fibres.”</p>
                <p>In treating of the transformations or metamorphoses of the spiral vessels, Μ.
                    Kieser illustrates his ideas by a series of dissections of the stem and root of
                    the gourd <hi rend="italic">(cucurbita</hi><hi rend="italic">pepo),</hi> made
                    apparently with great care. These designs occupy several plates of his work; and
                    being taken from different parts of the same plant, at different stages of its
                    growth, and viewed with the same magnifying power, they show the progressive
                    changes in form and appearance of these vessels as the plant increases in age.
                    Μ. Kieser exhibits corresponding vertical and horizontal sections of the same
                    parts; but our object will be answered by copying only certain portions of the
                    vertical sections.</p>
                <p>The ligneous portion of the stem of the gourd possesses ten bundles of vessels,
                    symmetrically disposed around the pith, and standing at unequal distances
                    between it and the bark. In fig. 13, Plate XXXVIIL, we have copied the
                    representation of a vertical section of the vessels in one of these bundles,
                    taken from a portion of the plant near the summit of its stem, and made with the
                    aid of a microscope magnifying 130 times. The number of vessels in each bundle
                    at this period is said to vary from three to five. They are constructed of one
                    or more fibres, placed <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi><pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096185?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6185-0048"/> contiguous to
                    each other, and twisted into a spiral form, producing a round cavity within.
                    These are called <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> spirals. They are found in every
                    young plant, and in the newly formed parts of old ones. Their size is smaller
                    than that of the other varieties to which they give origin. The number of fibres
                    in each spire varies from one to nine; and they are the only variety met with in
                    some of the inferior vegetables.</p>
                <p>The nextfigure(fig. 14, Plate XXXVIII.) exhibits a similar section of the vessels
                    of the same plant at the internodial space below. Of the four vessels contained
                    in this bundle, the outer one, α, is larger than the rest, but its spires are
                    contiguous, as in those of the former figure: the inner one, <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> is formed of a series of rings, disposed in a perpendicular line. These
                    rings are very like the spires of the preceding variety, and often combined with
                    them in the same vessel. They are sometimes separated from each other only by a
                    space equal to their own diameter; in other instances to eight or ten times that
                    distance, forming then the substratum of the next variety. In their present form
                    they constitute the <hi rend="italic">annular</hi> spiral; and in herbaceous
                    plants occupy frequently the same position as the simple spiral, that is, next
                    to the pith.</p>
                <p>From the two simple varieties of form just described, other more complex forms
                    are produced, as the plant advances in age. In the next section, made still
                    lower down on the same plant, the vessels exhibit the forms represented in fig.
                    15 of the same plate, which brings the third variety of spiral vessel into view.
                    The exterior vessel, <hi rend="italic">b</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi>
                    of this fasciculus, or that nearest to the bark, is of much larger size: its
                    spires, represented by the white lines in the figure, are separated to nearly
                    equal distances from each other, and the intervening spaces are filled up with a
                    membrane, sprinkled over with small obscure points or dots, constituting the <hi
                    rend="italic">punctuated</hi> spiral vessel. In this variety the rings are never
                    contiguous. Such vessels occur only in the more advanced age of herbaceous
                    plants, but are said to be original formations in the alburnum of trees: they
                    acquire a much greater size than the two former varieties, especially in the
                    stem; but do not become so large in the root. In herbs they occupy a position
                    exterior to that of the two preceding varieties; but in trees the largest
                    vessels of the annual layers are nearer to the pith. The three other vessels in
                    this figure are simple spirals, in part unrolled.</p>
                <p>The spiral fibre in these vessels is of various size, being largest in the
                    greatest vessels: it is sometimes so small as to be scarcely visible. It is
                    often difficult to determine whether its form is spiral or annular: for the most
                    part it is spiral in herbs, and annular in trees. The membrane which connects
                    the spires or rings in this variety is not visible in young vessels, but appears
                    in more mature age. It is at first transparent, but becomes opaque from age. In
                    this punctuated variety of vessel the spires cannot be unrolled without tearing
                    the connecting membrane. As to the points· or dots observed on this membrane,
                    they have been taken by some for pores on its surface; by others for clefts
                    produced by the joining of the spires. They are clearly not clefts, says Μ.
                    Kieser, and it is against the supposition of their being pores that their
                    position has a relation always to the spires, and not to the adjoining cells. In
                    the vessels of some plants, as in those of the French bean, when magnified 400
                    times, these points, fig. 21, α, seem as if pierced by a hole exceedingly small;
                    but in other instances they are quite dark, and similar to those found on the
                    membranous productions that fill the cavity of aged vessels, where there is not
                    the smallest reason for considering them as pores. There seems a great analogy
                    between these connecting membranes and those which thus fill the cavity of aged
                    vessels. In some instances the size of the dots is large, and they appear
                    transparent at the centre; in others the dots are extremely small. Their form is
                    oblong, and they are ranged generally in determined lines, parallel to the
                    direction of the spires.</p>
                <p>In the next vertical section of a fasciculus of vessels, taken from about the
                    middle of the stem of the same plant, all the peculiarities of size and form are
                    still more distinctly seen. Of the twenty-three vessels which appeared in the
                    horizontal section of a fasciculus at this period of growth, six only were
                    apparent in the vertical section, and are exhibited together in fig. 16, Plate
                    XXXVIII. Of these, the first two, or outer ones, are by much the largest, and
                    belong to the punctuated variety. A portion of the anterior wall of these two
                    vessels has been removed by the sections at <hi rend="italic">I, I,</hi> so that
                    the inner surface of the posterior wall is brought into view; and in the former
                    vessel, <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> a portion of the posterior wall itself has
                    also been carried away. In both vessels the spiral fibre, indicated by the white
                    line, is prominent in the section; and in the second, <hi rend="italic">e,</hi>
                    it is unrolled at <hi rend="italic">m, n,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> where, at
                    <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> it is seen single, transparent, and round, while at
                    <hi rend="italic">n</hi> it is united with the punctuated membrane that connects
                    the spires, and has a flat or riband-like form. The third vessel, <hi
                    rend="italic">f,</hi> of this fasciculus is also of the punctuated class, and
                    the three last, <hi rend="italic">g,</hi> A, «, are simple spirals; the last of
                    all, <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> being in the progress of formation, and its
                    spires not yet brought into a state of contiguity.</p>
                <p>There is a fourth variety of vessel that is said to have the same origin as the
                    last, being formed in part by spires or rings, but the separations between which
                    are filled up, not by membrane, but by small productions or ramifications from
                    the spires or rings themselves; and these ramifications are often so implicated
                    as to form a net-work; whence the names of <hi rend="italic">ramified scad
                    reticulated</hi> spiral vessels. Like the former variety, they do not exist in
                    the young plant, but are formed gradually in a more mature age, and by the same
                    series of actions; that is, the spires or rings, which were at first contiguous,
                    separate at a later period, and the intervals are filled up by ramifications
                    from the spires themselves. At first these ramifications are few, as in the
                    vessel, α, fig. 21, when they are termed <hi rend="italic">ramified</hi>
                    spirals; and as these ramifications increase, the vessel becomes reticulated, as
                    exhibited at the letter c, fig. 20. They are found but in few plants, and ap-∙
                    pear to differ from the punctuated variety chiefly in the position of the rings,
                    which are more or less obliquely placed, and at different points send off one or
                    more branches.</p>
                <p>In his ninth plate, Μ. Kieser has given similar representations of the vessels of
                    the same plant, as they appear from sections made near the root. The fasciculus
                    at this part of the stem contained twenty-nine vessels, as seen in the
                    horizontal section, of which only eight were visible in the vertical section.
                    These retained nearly the characters of those given in the preceding section,
                    fig. 16; but exceeded them in number and size. The large ones, situated next the
                    bark, were of the punctuated class, while the smaller ones, next the pith, were
                    simple spirals. In fig. 18 we have copied the three smaller vessels. In one of
                    these, <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> which belongs to the punctuated variety, the
                    interior of the vessel is nearly filled up with small portions of punctuated
                    membrane, produced from the inner wall of the vessel itself, as is still more
                    clearly seen in horizontal sections of similar vessels in fig. 25. The two
                    vessels <hi rend="italic">p, q,</hi> of fig. 18, are the youngest, and consist
                    only of the simple spiral fibre; the last, it is said, being composed of two
                    such fibres, which, in consequence of the transpa <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096198?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6198-0049"/> rency of the
                    posterior wall of the vessel, appear to cross each other.</p>
                <p>But Μ. Kieser has not confined his examination to the stem of this plant. In his
                    tenth plate he has given similar sections of a portion of the root. The piece of
                    root he examined presented, in the horizontal section, four fasciculi, each of
                    which contained about thirty-seven vessels, varying in size; the larger ones
                    being placed exteriorly, and the smaller ones towards the centre of the root.
                    The cells of this part were small, and nearly of the same size and form
                    throughout, differing much from the varying size and form of the cells in the
                    stem. Of the thirty-seven vessels before mentioned, only ten were retained in
                    the vertical section, all of which belonged to the punctuated variety. Of these,
                    two had united so as to form but one cavity; and two others were filled up with
                    membrane. In fig. 19 we have copied the appearance of three of these vessels.
                    One of these, indicated by the letter <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> is from the
                    middle of the figure, and its size is intermediate between those on each side of
                    it. A portion of its anterior wall has been carried away in three places, which
                    brings the inner side of the posterior wall into view. The vessels <hi
                    rend="italic">s t</hi> of the same figure are the smallest, and situated at the
                    centre of the root: all the three belong to the punctuated variety, no simple or
                    annular spirals being found at this period in the root.</p>
                <p>In the knots of plants the vessels undergo great changes of form, the larger
                    vessels being contracted in different parts, and giving off productions or
                    ramifications which form new vessels, and give to the whole a very irregular
                    appearance, as may be seen in the upper part of fig. 20, taken from the
                    appearance of the vessels in the knot of the balsam <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Impatiens</hi><hi rend="italic">Balsamina</hi><hi rend="italic">L.).</hi> In
                    this figure Μ. Kieser has also given an ideal representation of the various
                    metamorphoses already described, viz. of the annular vessel intĢ the simple
                    spiral, and of that into the other varieties: thus the letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> represents the rings of the annular vessel, which at <hi rend="italic"
                    >b</hi> begin to form the spiral: at <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the simple spiral
                    passes into the ramified variety, and this again, at <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>
                    into the reticulated vessel: at e the vessel becomes contracted at different
                    parts, as previously observed by Malpighi, fig. 17, and by Mir-bel, fig. 11 and
                    12. This latter author called this the vessel <hi rend="italic">en
                    chapelet,</hi> from its resemblance to a string of beads. From these vessels go
                    off the bran ehe <hi rend="italic">sfff,</hi> to form the ramified spirals of
                    the knot. In fig. 12 of the same plate Μ. Mirbel has given a similar ideal
                    representation of the five <hi rend="italic">species</hi> delineated by him in
                    figs. 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11; but they do not carry with them the same evidence of
                    accurate observation as the several <hi rend="italic">varieties</hi> indicated
                    in the alleged transformations of Kieser.</p>
                <p>Such is the account given by Μ. Kieser, of the development and appearances of the
                    vessels in herbaceous plants, and of the successive changes in character which,
                    m the progress of growth, they undergo. All the figures except the last are
                    taken from dissections of the same plant, beginning with that part of the stem
                    which was of latest growth, and proceeding in succession to the parts of earlier
                    growth, or older formation. At first the vessels are comparatively few in
                    number, of nearly uniform size, and belong to the varieties of annular and
                    simple spiral: at a later period those first formed become augmented in size,
                    and assume the characters of punctuated and rami? fied vessels; they are now
                    also removed farther from the centre, and their place is supplied by new vessels
                    of simpler forms. With the age of the plant, they all continue to increase in
                    size and number, and to acquire the new characters which distinguish the Several
                    varieties in the manner already described.</p>
                <p>In the early growth of trees, the formation and development of vessels go on at
                    the centre, adjacent to the pith, in the same manner as in herbs; but at a later
                    period, when the additional growth is made at the circumference of the tree, the
                    first formation of vessels must occur in the alburnum, and the subsequent
                    changes of character be effected in the several layers of wood; which
                    accordswith the fact that spiral vessels are rarely to be detected in the
                    alburnum, but are found with all their different characters, and of all sizes,
                    in the several layers of wood, as may be seen in all the transverse sections of
                    wood delineated by Grew, Malpighi, and others. In truth, the descriptions of
                    Kieser with respect to the structure and transformations of the spiral vessels
                    accord, in most respects, with the opinions of Grew, as briefly stated, page 47
                    of this article, and as may be farther seen by referring to pages 73 and 177 of
                    Grew’s <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Plants.</hi></p>
                <p>It is further to be remarked that, in these representations of Kieser, which
                    exhibit all the vessels visible in all parts of the stem and root of this plant,
                    only <hi rend="italic">one kind</hi> of vessel is described, which at different
                    periods of growth assumes different forms; that no vessel answering to the
                    common or lymphatic vessel of authors is mentioned; and consequently, that all
                    the vessels described, however differing in size and external character, are in
                    truth but varieties of one common kind. Calling to mind also that, in the
                    earliest production of leaves and of flowers, and even of stamens and pistils,
                    vessels either possessing the <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> character, or
                    capable of assuming it, are everywhere met with,—that they occur also in the
                    stem adjacent to the pith in succulent plants, and in the alburnum of trees, and
                    every successive ring of wood produced from it—in short, in every part and
                    portion of the plant, except the bark and pith,—and believing, as we do, in
                    those changes of form suggested by Grew, and subsequently demonstrated by
                    Kieser,—we are led to the general conclusion that only <hi rend="italic">one
                    kind</hi> of vessel exists in the ligneous portion of other plants, as well as
                    in that of the gourd; and that in different plants, and in different
                    circumstances and conditions of vegetation, this vessel is capable of assuming
                    the different forms, sizes, and characters, which have led many writers to
                    describe these organs as constituting different species, and serving different
                    uses.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle, in his late work on the Organography of Plants, seems also to
                    reject the separate existence of the ordinary sap-vessels or lymph-ducts of
                    authors, and to consider, with Kieser, all the vessels collectively to possess a
                    spiral character, which appears under five different forms in the vessels
                    severally named <hi rend="italic">tracheae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">simple</hi>
                    spirals, <hi rend="italic">annular</hi> spirals, <hi rend="italic"
                    >punctuated</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reticulated</hi> spirals, and the vessels

                    rend="italic">Végétale,</hi> tome i. p. 32.) Without deciding positively in
                    favour of Kieser’s views, he admits that the different orders of vessels have
                    among them very intimate relations; and in favour of the opinion that they are
                    really modifications of each other, he alleges that al mb st all these orders
                    exist together in certain classes of plants, and are wanting altogether in
                    others. Still, though he has no theoretical objection to make to these alleged
                    transitions of form, he has never been able to verify them by actual
                    observation, and thinks the facts require further investigation. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 48, 51.) With respect to the existence of pores in
                    the spiral vessels, as alleged generally by Mirbel, and even occasionally by
                    Kieser, but denied by a great number of observers, Μ. de Candolle has been led
                    by his own observation to entertain doubts, and to believe that what has been
                    regarded as a pore is a luminous point, such as is exhibited by bubbles of air
                    in water, when placed under the microscope. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p.

                    structure of plants seem to us to have drawn attention more from their novelty
                    than their value. He criticises the opinions of Mirbel in relation to the
                    structure of the vessels, and says that those denominated by that author <hi
                    rend="italic">porous</hi> tubes, are altogether destitute of pores, but have
                    corpuscles adhering to, or rather implanted in their sides, on which aeeount he
                    calls them eorpuseuliferous tubes. <hi rend="italic">(Recherches</hi><hi

                    manner the traeheae are said to have similar corpuscles attached to their sides,
                    but which adhere only weakly, and form no necessary part of the organization.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.)</hi> With respeet to the uses of these two kinds of
                    vessels in the wood, he considers the corpusculiſerous tubes to be the eanals by
                    which the sap <hi rend="italic">ascends</hi> from the roots; while the spiral
                    vessels, or traeheae, convey not air, but a diaphanous liquid, prepared in the
                    leaves, and which descends, by the spiral vessels, to impart its vivifying
                    influence to all parts of the plant. (7Z&gt;iW.p. 29-31.) No direct
                    communication, it is said, exists between the cells and vessels which compose
                    the vegetable texture; they are only contiguous. Fluids, nevertheless, are
                    transmitted from one to the other; not however through holes or passages
                    expressly designed for that purpose, as Mirbel contends, but through
                    intermole-cular spaces, left between the integrant globular molecules, of which
                    the organic solids are composed. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 47, 48.)</p>
                <p>Such is an outline of the different opinions that have been held regarding the
                    <hi rend="italic">structure</hi> of the sap-vessels. Differences not less great
                    still continue to exist with regard to their <hi rend="italic">uses.</hi> Our
                    reasons have been already given for coinciding in opinion with those who hold
                    the vessels to be the proper channels in which the sap is conveyed. Μ. Kieser,
                    however, contends that the spiral vessels of the wood are always empty, or
                    contain only air, and considers them, with Malpighi, to be organs by which air
                    is conveyed. To this opinion Μ. de Candolle also inclines, though he admits that
                    in some cases they may eonvey lymph. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi>
                    tome i. p. 61.)</p>
                <p>Those physiologists who thus oppose the opinion that the vessels carry fluids,
                    suppose the sap to be conveyed by certain minute channels, said to exist between
                    the cells. The place of these alleged channels is marked out in a section of
                    cellular tissue (fig. 29, Plate XXXVΠL) taken from Μ. Kieser, in which the blaek
                    points at the angular junctions of the cells are said to denote them: from their
                    position they have obtained the name of <hi rend="italic">intercellular
                    canals.</hi> By many, however, the existence of sueh spaces at the angles of the
                    cells is denied; and, indeed, when we contemplate the various size and form of
                    the cells, the different degrees in which they are filled with fluid or solid
                    matters, and consequently the greater or less degree of compression which these
                    alleged intercellular spaces must undergo, we ean hardly admit the sufficiency
                    of sueh minute, tortuous, and precarious channels to convey the ascending sap
                    with that force and velocity which the experiments of Hales and others have
                    proved it to possess. On the other hand, no direct communication between the
                    spiral vessels of plants and the external atmosphere, similar to that which
                    occurs between the traeheae of insects and the air, has been shown to exist; and
                    the total absence of spiral vessels in the bark, where they would be near to the
                    atmosphere, and their presence in the root, where they are almost beyond its
                    influence, are alike repugnant to the notion that they exercise a respiratory
                    function. Lastly, the absence of sap in these vessels at certain seasons, on
                    which alone the notion of their being <hi rend="italic">traeheae</hi> or
                    air-vessels was founded, depends, as we have seen, on the period at which the
                    examination is made; for at certain periods they have been found filled with
                    sap; and at all periods, when in aetive vegetation, they will absorb and eonvcy
                    coloured fluids. It should also be borne in mind that the respiratory function
                    in vegetables is performed, not by the trunk, but by the leaves.of the
                    plant.</p>
                <p>Dismissing then these notions concerning the uses of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >spiral</hi> vessels, and adhering to the opinion, that in all their variety
                    they serve the office of conveying sap through the plant, we shall conclude this
                    branch of the subject with a brief notice of their modes of <hi rend="italic"
                    >termination.</hi></p>
                <p>If we begin at the root, we may consider these vessels as terminating at that
                    part, by continuation of canal, in the capillary <hi rend="italic">absorbents of
                    the rootlet.</hi> As, further, the vessels of plants, like those of animals, are
                    the only organs which eonvey the materials out of which not only the fluid, but
                    the solid parts of the plant are formed, it may, in a general sense, be said
                    that their modes of termination are as numerous as the kinds of distinct parts
                    or organs which the vegetable system contains. Henee, therefore, as the cellular
                    tissue of plants contains various matters often precisely similar to those which
                    exist in the vessels, it may be inferred that the vessels have a termination in
                    those organs; and this inference may perhaps carry more weight with many than
                    the attempts before related of Malpighi and Leeuwenhoeek to demonstrate it
                    anatomically. Another termination of these vessels must be in certain minute and
                    ill-defined organs called <hi rend="italic">glands,</hi> which separate from the
                    mass of fluids peculiar secretions; and a fourth mode may, in the leaves, be in
                    other vessels which carry baek the juices from those organs. The last and fifth
                    mode of termination is into transpiring or exhalent organs, by which a certain
                    portion of the contents of the vessels is discharged: so that in plants the
                    sap-vessels terminate externally at one extremity in absorbents, by which fluids
                    are received; and at the other in exhalents, by which these fluids are in part
                    discharged.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> VI.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Proper
                    Vessels.</hi></p>
                <p>By observation of the natural flow of the sap, combined with the results of
                    experiments made with coloured liquors, we have endeavoured to determine the
                    situation and kinds of vessels by which it is conveyed in the wood. The same
                    method will best assist us in ascertaining the nature and place of the vessels
                    met with in the bark.</p>
                <p>It was before stated, that, early in spring, the sap of plants rises through the
                    wood alone, and that no fluid whatever is then to be found in the bark. At a
                    later period, however, the case is completely reversed; for the vessels of the
                    wood no longer appear to carry sap, and those of the bark then become abundantly
                    supplied with it. This difference is very dearly and concisely stated by Grew.
                    “The sap,” says he, “in many plants, as the vine, aseends visibly through the
                    wood for a month, in March and April, and rises through every ring of wood to
                    the very centre, yet at the same time there ariseth no sap at all out of the
                    bark, nor between it and the wood.” “But late in spring,” he continues, “and in
                    summer, the sap is no longer visible in the wood, but is abundant in the bark,
                    in the inner margin adjacent to the wood.” Du Hamel, too, remarks, that when the
                    lymph rises abundantly through the wood in spring, the bark is dry, and adheres
                    to the wood, and no sap then issues from it, nor from between it and the wood;
                    but, later in the season, he adds, the bark yields abundance of sap. These
                    statements have been verified by the multiplied observations of various

                <p>But why is the sap thus present only in the wood at its first rising in spring
                    Why at a later period does <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096224?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6224-0051"/> it cease to be visible in that part? And how and
                    why does it afterwards find a passage into the bark? Some observations of Du
                    Hamel, Hales, and Walker, point, we think, to the true cause. In spring, says Du
                    Hamel, when the sap rises vigorously, the buds have not appeared; when they
                    begin to open, the sap then flows less freely; and when the leaves are fully
                    developed, then the flow of sap entirely ceases. Dr Hales also remarks, that,
                    towards the end of April, when the young shoots come forth, and the surface of
                    the vine is greatly increased by the expansion of the leaves, the sap then
                    ceases to flow in a visible manner till the return of the next spring. All
                    bleeding trees, he adds, cease to bleed as soon as the young leaves begin to
                    expand enough to perspire plentifully, and draw off the redundant sap. The bark
                    of oak, too, separates easily when lubricated with sap; but before the leaves
                    appear and perspire, the bark will no longer run (as they term it), but adheres
                    most firmly to the wood. <hi rend="italic">( Vegetable Statics,</hi> 3d edit. p.
                    126.) In like manner, in an experiment of Dr Walker, a birch-tree bled from
                    every perforation in its trunk, and from every cut extremity of its branches,
                    until vernation or budding began; then thcbleedingwas almost immediately
                    checked; and when the young leaves had pushed beyond the <hi rend="italic"
                    >hy-bernaculmn,</hi> the bleeding entirely ceased. <hi rend="italic">(Edin.
                    Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. i. p. 31.)</p>
                <p>It is however certain, that though the sap was no longer visible in the wood
                    after the leaves were developed, it continued nevertheless to rise through it;
                    for in no other way could the leaves obtain the large portion of fluid which it
                    is known that they constantly discharge by transpiration; and coloured fluids
                    manifest their presence in the vessels of the wood, as well after as before the
                    development of the leaves. The leaves, therefore, must be regarded as the organs
                    which, by their perspiration, draw off, as Dr Hales observes, the redundant sap;
                    and hence, in an experiment where a notch was cut two or three feet above the
                    lower end of a stem, though a great quantity of sap passed by the notch, yet was
                    it perfectly dry; because, stfys he, “the attraction of the perspiring leaves
                    was greater than the force of trusion from the column of water.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Vegetable Statics,</hi> p. 111.)</p>
                <p>Not only, however, does the development of the leaves render the sap no longer
                    visible in the wood, but they also appear to be the organs by or through which
                    it finds its way to the bark. In all the experiments just recited, the bark
                    continued dry until the sap disappeared from the wood; in other words, until it
                    was drawn off by the leaves; and then, and not till then, the bark became moist,
                    and continued laden with sap through the rest of the summer. Now, as it has been
                    before shown that no sap enters the bark by the roots, nor gets into it directly
                    from the wood, there is no other known channel by which it can be conveyed,
                    except through the leaves; and these, therefore, necessarily appear to be the
                    organs by which it is apparently carried off from the wood, and by or through
                    which it at the same time finds its way to the bark.</p>
                <p>This inference appears to follow, not only from the fact of the bark continuing
                    dry until the leaves are developed, but from the circumstance that it is again
                    rendered dry after having become moist, if these same leaves be removed. If,
                    says Du Hamel, we remove the leaves of a young tree when in full sap, and whose
                    bark is easily detached, ill a few days after the same bark will adhere as
                    closely to the wood as it commonly does during winter. This direct connection
                    between the leaves and bark is also well illustrated in an experiment of Hales,
                    employed by him for a very different purpose. From two thriving shoots of a
                    pear-tree he cut, in several places, half an inch of the bark off all round.</p>
                <p>All the ringlets of bark between these incisions had a leaf-bud upon them except
                    one, and all but this one ringlet grew and swelled at their bottoms till August;
                    and the larger and more thriving the leaf-bud was, so much the more did the
                    adjoining bark swell. <hi rend="italic">( Veg. Statics,</hi> p. 149.) Mr Knight
                    also found the bark of the vine to become shrivelled and dry when the leaves
                    were stripped off; but in those parts in which it communicated directly with the
                    leaves, it continued moist and flourishing. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi>
                    1801, p. 335.)</p>
                <p>By connecting, therefore, the circumstances attending the flow of sap with the
                    development of the leaves, we gain satisfactory reasons for all the apparent
                    anomalies observed to attend its course. Early in spring, before the appearance
                    of the leaves, no natural outlet for the escape of the rising sap exists, and
                    therefore, when the vessels arc cut or perforated, they readily pour out their
                    sap, or bleed; but late in spring, and in summer, when the leaves are developed,
                    the more watery parts of the sap are thrown off by transpiration; and while this
                    process proceeds, the fluids do not accumulate in such quantity in the minute
                    vessels of the trunk as to be effused or bleed through their cut or perforated
                    sides. A cold day, however, or a moist and still atmosphere, by checking
                    transpiration from the leaves, restores more or less the propensity to bleeding
                    from the trunk; and in autumn, when fructification begins, and vegetation makes
                    a pause, the same disposition to bleeding recurs in the trunk, from the check
                    imposed on the more active powers of growth.</p>
                <p>It is further evident, that, when the vessels of the bark become supplied with
                    fluid, they cannot have derived it immediately from those of the wood, since, in
                    these different parts, the fluids have frequently no sort of agreement in
                    properties. Thus, Grew remarks, that almost all plants, late in spring, and in
                    summer, bleed from their bark; and the sap has cither a sour, sweet, hot,
                    bitter, or other taste. At this period the bark of the vine yields a sour sap;
                    but, “what is vulgarly called bleeding in the vine is,” he adds, “quite another
                    thing, both as to the liquor which issueth, and the place whence it issues; that
                    is, it is neither a sweet nor a sour, but a tasteless sap, issuing, not from any
                    vessels in the bark, but from the air-vessels of the wood.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 125.) Malpighi, also, was well aware of the
                    difference in the qualities of the sap, and thought every plant possessed its
                    peculiar sap; but he has not so accurately defined the situation of the vessels
                    that contain it. Du Hamel, however, points out distinctly the difference of
                    quality in the sap of the bark and wood. In the bark of some plants it is white,
                    in others red, and in others yellow. It is in some instances milky, in others
                    resinous, and in others gummy. In many plants it has a sweet taste, in some it
                    is caustic, and in others insipid. It has sometimes much odour as well as
                    flavour, and frequently it is destitute of both. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 68.)</p>
                <p>But if the qualities of the sap in the bark be thus different from those of the
                    sap in the wood; if these peculiar qualities are detected in it only after the
                    development of the leaves, and the leaves be the organs by which alone the sap
                    can be conveyed from the one part to the other; then it seems to follow that the
                    sap must acquire these new properties in the leaves during its transmission
                    through them. Malpighi remarked the existence of this altered sap in the leaves,
                    and held them to be the organs which prepared nutrient matter for the plant; and
                    Dr Darwin, by immersing plants of spurge in coloured liquors, not only saw, as
                    others had previously done, the red fluid ascend through the leaf, but another
                    fluid, of a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096237?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6237-0052"/> white colour, returning at the same time from the
                    extremities of the leaf, and descending into the petiole. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Botanic Garden,</hi> vol. i. notes, p. 450-53.) This same returning fluid Mr
                    Knight observed in similar experiments on branches of the apple and
                    horse-chesnut trees, and even traced it through the petiole into the inner bark,
                    by the vessels of which it seemed to be conveyed to the extremities of the
                    roots. <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1801.) The motion, therefore, of the
                    sap in the bark is not that of <hi rend="italic">ascent,</hi> as Grew and
                    Malpighi and many others have believed, but of <hi rend="italic">descent,</hi>
                    as the observations and experiments of Μ. de Sarrabat, Du Hamel, Knight, and
                    others, abundantly prove. To these vessels of the bark Grew assigned particular
                    names, according to the apparent quality of the fluid they conveyed. Malpighi
                    gave them the general appellation of <hi rend="italic">vasapeculiaria,</hi> from
                    their containing a fluid different from the common sap. By others they have been
                    called <hi rend="italic">cortical vessels,</hi> a term, however, not applicable
                    to many tribes of vegetables which are entirely destitute of bark. Lastly, Du
                    Hamel and others denominated them <hi rend="italic">proper vessels,</hi> which
                    term differs but slightly from the appellation of Malpighi, and, though not very
                    precise, is that we shall continue to employ.</p>
                <p>From regarding the newly formed vessels of the wood as part of the bark, Grew
                    uniformly represents the bark 'as possessing two distinct species of vessels, in
                    which he has been since followed by several other writers; but the vessels which
                    he calls <hi rend="italic">lymphoeducts</hi> belong rather to the wood, so that
                    we may regard him as describing only one species of <hi rend="italic">proper
                    vessels.</hi> In herbs, these vessels stand sometimes in distinct parcels or
                    columns; sometimes they are disposed in a ring; sometimes they have a radiated
                    position; and sometimes they are more intermixed with the sap-vessels, and seem
                    to alternate with them. In trees, the vessels of the bark are more distinct, and
                    have a much more regular appearance. They are commonly postured near the inner
                    margin of the bark, and, when viewed in a longitudinal direction, seem collected
                    into fasciculi, which are more or less numerous, and the component vessels of
                    which continually diverge and join with others, so as to form a reticulated
                    appearance, as in fig. 24, Plate XXXVIII. Of these reticulated fasciculi, many
                    layers’ exist in an old tree; and to these layers the thickness of the bark is
                    chiefly owing. As they proceed inward, the direction of the fasciculi is less
                    oblique, so that near to the wood they are almost straight. Hence the spaces
                    formed by the reticulations are very unequal, often large in the exterior part
                    of the bark, and diminishing in size towards the wood: they are. everywhere
                    filled with cellular tissue. Such is a general description of the situation of
                    the <hi rend="italic">proper vessels of</hi> the bark, as given by Grew,
                    Malpighi, and Du Hamel.</p>
                <p>The vessels which thus form the vascular portion of the bark appear to differ but
                    little in <hi rend="italic">structure</hi> from the more simple vessels of the
                    wood. Grew considered them to possess a similar structure, from believing them
                    to be formed by the inner bark at the same time with the vessels of the wood;
                    and therefore, he adds, “they may be reasonably thought similar in the bark and
                    wood.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 112.) Malpighi regarded them
                    as simple tubes, containing sometimes peculiar juices; but advances nothing
                    particular respecting their structure. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p.
                    3.) Μ. Mirbeľs opinion deserves some notice, inasmuch as he declares the
                    structure of these vessels to differ entirely from all those of the wood. Their
                    sides, says he, are perfectly entire; they have neither pores nor clefts, and
                    may therefore be deemed simple tubes. <hi rend="italic">(Exposit.</hi><hi

                    kind is represented in Plate XXXVIII. fig. 22; and in fig. 23 a fasciculus of
                    the same vessels magnified is given as delineated by Μ. Mirbel. A re-, mark also
                    of Hill, if it be deemed to rest on correct ob-' servation, is entitled to great
                    attention. “The vessels of the bark that form the fasciculi are not,” says he,
                    “united to each other, but are connected with the cellular tissue at numerous
                    places; and, when separated from it, there appear on the sides of the vessels
                    small oval depressions, dotted as it were with pin-holes.” <hi rend="italic">(
                    On the Construction of Timber,</hi> p. 28.) These appearances he regards as of a
                    glandular nature, but their description corresponds better with that of
                    Leeuwenhoeck respecting the lateral ramifications from the vessels of the wood;
                    and they may probably be the points at which communication is effected between
                    the vessels and cells.</p>
                <p>The cause of the reticulated appearance· which the vessels of the bark exhibit in
                    trees, is doubtless to be attributed, as we think Du Hamel somewhere remarks, to
                    their peculiar mode of growth. A new layer of cortical vessels is every year
                    added to. the inner surface of the bark, as well as a new layer of ligneous
                    vessels to the outer surface of the wood; so that, as Grew observes, the new
                    matter of the tree is every year distributed two contrary ways,—one part falling
                    outward towards the bark, and the other part retaining its situation inward to
                    constitute the wood. At first the newly formed cortical vessels are straight,
                    and stand parallel, likç those of the wood; but, by the continual growth of the
                    new parts formed between the bark and the wood, the older vessels of the bark
                    are gradually forced, outward; and being thus every year disposed around a large
                    cylinder, are necessarily more and more separated from each other, and produce
                    at length that-net-like form which we .observe them to possess. The newly formed
                    vessels of. the wood, on the other hand, retain their original position,· and
                    therefore preserve their parallelism, seldom or never exhibiting those flexures
                    and reticulations so common to the vessels of the bark.</p>
                <p>In the bark, as well as in the wood, the vessels are I found to possess different
                    sizes. In the pine, vessels containing turpentine are represented by Grew, which
                    are very much larger than the common sap-vessels, and are surrounded by smaller
                    ones, exactly as the large spiral tubes of the wood are said to be enshcathed by
                    the common sap-vessels. The milky juice of a species of sumach is contained in
                    very large vessels, disposed so as to form a ring, and each large vessel is
                    surrounded by many smaller ones. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> tab.
                    20.) The appearance of these large vessels in one species of pine is well
                    represented by Hill, and the account he gives of their formation is probably
                    correct. In this tree <hi rend="italic">(pinus orientalis),</hi> some of these
                    vessels form oval openings, large enough to admit a straw; these openings occupy
                    the centre of the bark, and are surrounded by a ring of smaller vessels. As
                    their contents are soluble in alcohol, it is easy to obtain them empty. In
                    fig.26, Plate XXXVIII., the vessels of this tree, as they appear in the bark,
                    are displayed; the woody portion of the tree having been scooped away, so that
                    the longitudinal aspect, as well as the transverse sections of them, is
                    exhibited. From a strict inquiry into their nature, Dr Hill concluded that these
                    larger vessels were originally the same as those of the smaller fasciculi in the
                    bark of the same tree; “so that if we conceive one of these smaller fasciculi
                    opened in its centre, and the vessels driven every way outward, till they are
                    stopped by the substance of the bark, we shall have an idea of the structure of
                    this large vessel, which is nothing more than a great cylindrical hollow formed
                    in the centre of such a fasciculus.” (Hill <hi rend="italic">on the Construction
                    of Timber,</hi><pb break="no" facs="nls:193096250?mode=fullsize"

                    viscid juices that these enlarged vessels are formed; and where the juices do
                    not concrete, it is probable that, as the vessels annually recede from the
                    centre, they suffer a reduction in size from the continued effects of
                    desiccation and compression to which they are exposed.</p>
                <p>The foregoing varieties appear alone entitled to the appellation of the <hi
                    rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> of the bark. In many tribes of vegetables,
                    however, as will afterwards be shown, no distinction of bark and wood exists;
                    but one uniform distribution of vessels extends from the centre to the
                    circumference of the plant. Such plants have also their <hi rend="italic">proper
                    vessels,</hi> but the place and disposition of these vessels are not so
                    precisely ascertained. From the mode in which their growth is accomplished, as
                    well as from observation of their structure, it may be inferred that their <hi
                    rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> are distributed through the whole substance of
                    the plant, accompanying in every part the sap-vessels. In some plants possessing
                    this arrangement of parts, such as different species of. wheat,∙Malpighi <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. Plant.</hi> tab. 4, fig. 15) describes and delineates a <hi
                    rend="italic">vas proprium</hi> as forming a part of each fasciculus of vessels;
                    and a similar intermixture, of the two kinds must, we conceive, exist in all
                    similaŗ structures.</p>
                <p>Even in many plants possessing a distinct bark, vessels containing proper juices
                    are found in the wood. In every circle of wood, from the inmost that surrounds
                    the pith, to the outmost in contact with the bark, vessels containing a gum,
                    turpentine, or some other concrete or coloured juice, hιay frequently be found.
                    Malpighi conceived 4hem to exist in all plants, though, from the nature of their
                    fluids, they could not always be distinguished; and he believed them to afford a
                    highly perfect juice for the nutrítion-oî.the plant. According to Grew, “the
                    turpentine vessels that are scattered up and down the wood of the pine and fir
                    are the self-same which did once appertain to the bark; but being pinched up by
                    the wood, they are become much smaller pipes.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 115.) Du Hamel also regarded them as similar to those of the·
                    bark, but rendered much smaller by compression. In the ,pine and fir they are
                    disposed circularly around the axis, much like, the sap-vessels, and alternate
                    with them. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tħme

                <p>In <hi rend="italic">Piscidia erythrina,</hi> the proper juices are of a scarlet
                    colour, and the vessels that contain them are therefore readily discerned
                    wherever they exist. This plant has been selected by Hill to demonstrate the
                    position of these vessels. In the bark they are collected into fasciculi, all
                    the vessels of which contain coloured juices, and are disposed in a ring on the
                    inner margin of the bark. Within this ring stands the alburnum, through the
                    substance of which many smaller red vessels are distributed; and similar red
                    vessels are more sparingly seen in every layer of wood, particularly in that
                    which envelopes the pith. <hi rend="italic">( Construction of Timber.)</hi></p>
                <p>Now the red vessels thus observed in the wood of the above-mentioned plant must
                    either have been formed in the situations they occupy, or transported from some
                    other place. The latter supposition is inadmissible, inasmuch as the wood of
                    trees is formed by layers of new vessels superimposed on one another; and no
                    removal of the old vessels, nor reproduction of new vessels within the old
                    layers, ever takes place; consequently no actual transposition of vessels could
                    occur, nor could new vessels be developed in the wood after it had been
                    completely formed. Ifi however, an alternate deposition and absorption of matter
                    go on into and from the cells, it is possible that the vessels might in this way
                    become filled with a matter different from that which they originally possessed;
                    but in the case before us, a readier explanation presents itself. The new matter
                    of the wood is formed at the same time, and in the same place, as that of the
                    bark; and through this new woody matter the red vessels were dispersed as well
                    as in the bark. Consequently every addition made to the ligneous layers would
                    furnish some vessels that contained these proper juices; and this, being
                    annually repeated, would exhibit that intermixture of proper vessels with
                    sap-vessels which is observed in all the ligneous layers of this and many other
                    trees. Hence these <hi rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> of the wood must be
                    held to retain the position in which they were originally produced, and cannot
                    be said to have approached nearer to the centre, but only, by the addition of
                    new layers exterior to them, to be placed farther from the circumference of the
                    tree. As Grew, therefore, held the alburnum to be a part of the bark, he might
                    correctly say that these vessels “did once appertain to it.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> VII.— <hi rend="italic">Of Collections of the
                    Proper Juices in the Cellular Tissue.</hi></p>
                <p>Besides this accumulation of the proper juices in certain vessels of the wood, it
                    frequently happens that depositions of similar matter occur in all parts of the
                    cellular tissue of plants. In the bark of the oak and poplar, and of other
                    trees, resinous concretions are often found in the cells; they are situated
                    irregularly, and, according to Malpighi, are observed even in very young bark.
                    Sometimes the cells containing milky and resinous juices are so postured in the
                    bark, says Grew, as to form cylindrical channels, which are neither parallel nor
                    anywhere inosculated, but run, with some little obliquities, distinct from one
                    another. They appear to be formed out of the cells, and are not bounded by any
                    walls or sides proper to themselves, but only by those of the cells. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 112.) They are often short and tortuous,
                    always isolated; and are sometimes placed irregularly, at others disposed in a
                    circular form. They occur sometimes in the pith, and possess very different
                    sizes and figures. They have frequently been deemed a species of <hi
                    rend="italic">proper vessels,</hi> from the mere circumstance of their
                    containing similar juices, and from possessing sometimes an elongated form; but
                    they are organs which, neither in form nor in function, bear any resemblance to
                    vessels. Mirbel proposes to name them <hi rend="italic">secretory canals,</hi>
                    and Μ. Link <hi rend="italic">cellular reservoirs</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi>
                    the term certainly most generally applicable, and involving no hypothesis
                    respecting either their formation or functions.</p>
                <p>The manner in which these cellular reservoirs, may be produced in the bark òr
                    pith is readily explained, on the supposition that a communication everywhere
                    subsists between the vessels and the cells. One set of vessels has been shown to
                    receive and carry sap to the leaves, and another to bring it back from them to
                    the bark; and these two sets of vessels are everywhere in their course
                    surrounded by cellular tissue. Hence the cells in every part may receive a
                    portion of the fluid which the vessels are employed to convey. Thus in herbs,
                    the cells both of the bark and pith are filled with fluid, which led Grew to
                    believe that the sap was actually transmitted through those organs; but at the
                    same time he delivers facts which, even in his own opinion, prove that it is
                    derived directly from the vessels. Not only in herbs, but “in every annual
                    growth, whether of a sprout from a seed, of a sucker from a root, or of a scion
                    from a branch, the pith is always found the first yeaŗ full of sap; but in the
                    second year the same individual pith always becomes dry, and so it continues
                    ever after. One cause whereof is, that the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096263?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6263-0054"/> lymphaeducts
                    of the bark being the first year adjacent to the pith, they do all that time
                    transfuse part of their sap into it, and so keep it always succulent. But the
                    same lymphaeducts the following year are turned into wood, and the vessels which
                    are then generated and carry the sap stand beyond them in the bark; so that the
                    sap, being now more remote from the pith, and intercepted by the new wood,
                    cannot be transfused with that sufficient force and plenty as before into the
                    pith, which, therefore, from the first year always continues dry.” <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 124.)</p>
                <p>All that is here said respecting the transfusion of the common sap from the
                    vessels into the cells as it ascends through the wood, is equally applicable to
                    the <hi rend="italic">proper juices</hi> as they descend through the bark.
                    During the first year of growth, both the sap and proper vessels are adjacent to
                    the pith as well as to the bark, and each order may· therefore transfuse its
                    fluids into the cells of either. The common sap, from retaining its fluidity, is
                    frequently removed by absorption, and the cells that contained it appear empty
                    and dry; but where the proper juices arc transfused, and become viscid or
                    concrete, they are retained, and appear in different quantities and forms both
                    in the bark and pith, according to the nature and properties of the fluids from
                    which they are derived, and the texture and situation of the tissue into which
                    they are poured.</p>
                <p>To these collections of the <hi rend="italic">proper juices</hi> in the cells of
                    the cellular tissue may be referred the opinions of those who describe them as
                    existing sometimes in vacuities between the cells. Grew had remarked the
                    occasional presence of these juices in cylindrical channels formed by these
                    vacuities, to which Μ. Treviranus has given the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >intercellular canals.</hi> According to him, these canals not only contain the
                    proper juices, but convey them to all the cellular parts of plants, and are the
                    true <hi rend="italic">proper vessels</hi> of the bark. We before saw that Μ.
                    Kieser, after making the wood to consist almost entirely of spiral vessels,
                    destined only to convey air, supposed the sap to be carried by these same
                    intercellular canals. (Kieser, <hi rend="italic">Mém. sur</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >ľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Organisât,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes,</hi> p.
                    36.) With Μ. Treviranus, he also considers them as the real <hi rend="italic"
                    >proper vessels</hi> of the bark, by which alone the juices are conveyed. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 86.)</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle considers the proper juices to possess no special organ for their
                    conveyance, but to nestle in the cavities that surround them, and form sacs or
                    reservoirs of various size and form. He distinguishes several kinds of these
                    reservoirs, which vary with the figure of the containing sac. Thus, what others
                    call “proper vessels,” he designates by the names of tubular and fascicular
                    reservoirs. In this, however, he appears to confound the <hi rend="superscript">
                    ti</hi> proper juices,” destined immediately to the functions of nutrition and
                    growth, with various fluid or solid matters, either simply deposited in the
                    cellular tissue, or that have undergone subsequent alteration by the agency of a
                    secreting organ. The reservoirs of the proper juices, and the juices themselves,
                    are, he says, readily seen in many families of dicotyledons; but have not been
                    observed with certainty, either in monocotyledonous or acotyledonous tribes. <hi
                    rend="italic">( Organog. Veg.</hi> tome i. chap. 11.) The reason of this seems
                    to be, that in dicotyledons the bark, in which the proper juices are seen, is
                    distinct from the wood, in which the common sap flows; and the colour,
                    consistence, and qualities of the two' fluids, therefore, at once point out
                    their respective places; but in plants belonging to the two latter tribes there
                    is no proper distinction of bark and wood; and the two orders of vessels, as
                    shown by Malpighi in the instance of wheat, are associated together through the
                    whole substance of the plant, which renders the discrimination of their common
                    and proper juices more difficult.</p>
                <p>Besides two orders of vessels existing in the ligneous part of trees, Μ.
                    Dutrochet describes a particular form of cell, which, in the wood, serves only
                    as a receptacle for fluids; but to which, in the bark, he assigns a vascular
                    function. This is the elongated cell observed by Malpighi, and represented by
                    him in fig. 18, Plate XXXIX. Μ. Dutrochet, from the resemblance which its figure
                    is said to bear to a spindle, has given it the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >clostre;</hi> and his representation of it is given in fig. 17, Plate XXXIX.
                    These elongated cells form what Kieser and others have called the ligneous
                    fibres. By Μ. Du-trochet they are regarded as reservoirs of the nutrient juices,
                    and as containing secretions which impart solidity to the wood. In the bark,
                    however, these same clostres are declared to be the organs in which the
                    elaborated sap is contained, and by which įt is transmitted to the roots to
                    furnish the materials of their growth. The clostres, which thus convey the
                    nutrient matter, ought not, he adds, to be confounded with the “proper vessels,”
                    which are the true secretory organs. These vessels are tubes of greater diameter
                    than the clostres, and contain various cxcrementitious substances, as resin,
                    &amp;c. in different plants. <hi rend="italic">(Recherches Anatomiques,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi> p. 36, 37.) According to Μ. Dutrochet, therefore, the
                    elongated cells and vessels which exist in the bark and wood exercise functions
                    precisely opposite; for whilst in the wood the corpusculiťerous vessels convey
                    the sap, and the cells are reservoirs for containing it, in the bark the cells
                    are the organs which transmit the elaborated sap, and the vessels those in which
                    the excrementitious matters are contained.</p>
                <p>In our view, these notions are the reverse of fact, since we consider the
                    vessels, both in the wood and the bark, as the organs by which the fluids are
                    conveyed, and the various forms of the cellular tissue as the general
                    receptacles into which they are in part deposited: they may, however, in some
                    instances be retained in the vessels themselves, as well as in the cells.</p>

                <p>Connected with the vessels that distribute the fluids through organized bodies,
                    is another system of vessels, by which extraneous matter is taken -up to support
                    the growth of parts, and supply the waste occasioned by the exercise of the
                    various functions. To these vessels anatomists have given the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">Absorbents.</hi> The function which they perform is carried on
                    either from the external surface, or from some internal part of the body; and
                    its exercise, in animal bodies, may be distinguished into three kinds or stages.
                    The first is that in which new or extraneous matter is taken up and added to the
                    system, as in the absorption of substances from the skin, or of chyle from the
                    intestines; the second is that in which substances previously separated from the
                    fluids by secretion, but without becoming organized, are again taken up by the
                    absorbents, and reconveyed into the blood-vessels, as in the absorption of milk,
                    bile, and fat; the third kind is that in which the secreting organs themselves,
                    and successively all the solid parts of the body, are removed by the action of
                    the absorbent vessels. By plants this function is exercised to less extent, and
                    seems to comprise only the first two kinds or degrees of it, viz. the primary
                    absorption of extraneous matter, and the reabsorption of certain secreted
                    matters; but in them there <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096276?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6276-0055"/> does not appear any power of re-absorbing what
                    has once formed an organized part of the system. Hence the formation of
                    organized parts in plants is not accompanied, as in animals, by the unceasing
                    removal of old particles; but the particles which have once become organized
                    continue permanent until removed by some cause or process foreign to the living
                    powers of the plant. When once, therefore, the organs of plants have become
                    mature, they are exposed to decay only from the operation of foreign causes, and
                    cannot be mined from within by that gradual loss of balance between the
                    secreting and absorbing functions which the advances of age bring on the animal
                    system. Neither, in the vegetable system, can the removal of organized parts
                    under disease, any more than in health, have place; and, consequently, the
                    several modes or stages of ulcerative absorption, so finely illustrated by the
                    researches of Mr Hunter, belong not to the economy of plants.</p>
                <p>As the function of absorption is thus of more limited extent in plants than in
                    animals, so may we expect to find the arrangement of organs destined to its
                    exercise. In the more perfect animals, the absorbent vessels are quite distinct
                    from those which carry blood, are provided everywhere with glands, and, like the
                    veins, are furnished with valves. From their beginnings, in all parts of the
                    body, to their termination, they continually unite with one another, until,
                    after a long course; they form at length two trunks, which deliver their
                    contents into the large veins near the heart. As no common reservoir exists in
                    plants, there is no such single point to which their absorbed fluids require to
                    be carried. Hence their absorbents seem everywhere to have a very short course,
                    to form no union with one another, but to deliver their contents at once into
                    the sap-vessels adjacent to them. They appear to be destitute alike of glands
                    and valves, and indeed, in an anatomical view, they can scarcely be considered
                    distinct from the sap-vessels, but may rather be deemed ramifications from them;
                    so that although we grant, with Grew, that the ordinary sap-vessels do not
                    ramify one out of another, yet they certainly send off those fine ramifications
                    which, from their office, we denominate the absorbents of plants.</p>
                <p>In the root, the absorbents are capable of being demonstrated. When a plant is
                    immersed in coloured fluids, many of its capillary absorbents become tinged
                    through their whole course to their termination in the sap-vessels, proving them
                    to be simple ramifications from these vessels themselves. A further proof of the
                    identity öf these two systems is derived from the fact, that any part of a
                    sapvessel is not only capable of emitting capillary absorbents from its sides,
                    but of exercising itself an absorbent function, whenever its cut extremity is
                    brought into contact with a fluid. These absorbents are formed very speedily and
                    in great multitudes on the roots of annual plants; and even in perennial plants
                    they appear, like the leaves, to suffer an annual decay, and to be reproduced
                    with the return of vegetation.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle describes a structure as existing at the extremities of the roots
                    and of the pistil, and also on the outer coat of seeds, which possesses a
                    peculiar aptitude for absorption. To this structure he gives the name of
                    spon-giole: it is composed of small round cells, and in roots is situated at all
                    their fibrous extremities. The entire body of each radical fibril is indeed made
                    up of an analogous cellular tissue; but it is the extremity alone which actually
                    absorbs, and which therefore possesses <hi rend="italic">a</hi> peculiar
                    absorbent or hygroscopic power. The pistillary spongioles are in like manner
                    situated at the extremity of that organ, and absorb the fecundating liquor. The
                    third variety, or seminal spongioles <hi rend="italic">(spongiolae</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seminales),</hi> are placed on the surface of the grain,
                    apparently with great regularity; and by them the absorption of moisture is
                    effected. Not only water, but coloured liquors, are absorbed by these
                    spongioles, though the molecules of such liquids never enter the ordinary pores
                    of plants, which pores must be infinitely greater than the apertures with which
                    the spongiolcs may be furnished. This is the more remarkable, says Μ. de
                    Candolle, when we call to mind that these colouring molecules traverse the
                    compact and almost stony coats of seeds, and yet do not enter leaves whose
                    tissue is so lax, and which are visibly furnished with pores that have the power
                    of absorbing water when in contact with it. <hi rend="italic">( Organog.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Végétale,</hi> tome i. chap. 7.)</p>
                <p>But plants absorb fluids by other parts of their surface as well as by the roots.
                    This absorbing power extends, in some of the lower tribes, over the entire
                    surface of the vegetable, which is destitute of any organ analogous to a root;
                    in other instances, where the roots are small and the soil arid, the plant
                    derives almost all its moisture by the absorption of dews through the leaves.
                    The experiments of Bonnet show that all leaves, both those of herbs and of
                    trees, when brought into contact with water, are capable of absorbing it, and
                    that the moisture thus absorbed is communicated through the vascular system of
                    the leaf. The leaves of herbs he found to absorb nearly alike from either
                    surface; but those of trees absorbed best by the lower surface. The petiole and
                    larger riblets appeared to absorb much less than the other parts of the leaf. So
                    great and general is this absorbing power, that vegetables, says he, may be said
                    to be planted in the air, nearly as they are in the earth, the leaves being to
                    the branches what the capillary rootlets are to the roots. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>What then are the organs by which this function is carried on in the leaf? Μ.
                    Bonnet imagined the vessels of the leaves to receive their fluids through the
                    pores adjacent to them; and that the leaves, which had only few pores, possessed
                    but little absorbent power. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 20, 22.) He
                    thought, also, that the hairs frequently distributed over the leaf attracted
                    moisture, and might even act as absorbents; though he admits that many leaves
                    which have only slight inequalities on their surface, without hairs, exercise an
                    absorbent function. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 47.)</p>
                <p>This subject has been since investigated by Μ. de Candolle, whose researches
                    appear to confirm the aecount of Bonnet as to the absorbing power of the pores.
                    According to him, these pores are found on all parts of the leaf except the
                    riblets, which have none, but are covered with hairs. At the mouth of the pore a
                    vascular net-work is always to be found, which he regards as a production from
                    the larger vessels of the leaf. He asserts that pores are found only in those
                    parts where vessels go to terminate, and not in others; and that in trees this
                    structure oceurs chiefly on the lower surface of the leaf, while in herbs it is
                    equally seen on both surfaces. The stem in general has few or no pores, except
                    where it is soft and herbaceous; and even then the pores occur only in the
                    deeper green furrows, not on the prominent lines which bound them, and are
                    usually covered with hairs. No pores are to be found on roots or bulbs or fleshy
                    fruits, but most of the organs above ground are more or less furnished with
                    them. Exposure to the air seems necessary to their formation; for plants, or
                    parts of plants, that live beneath water or earth, are destitute of pores, but
                    acquire them if brought into the free air. Exclusion of light prevents also the
                    formation of pores; and hence etiolated plants are not furnished with them. <hi

                    facs="nls:193096289?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6289-0056"/> istence of
                    pores in leaves agreed with the results of Bonnet’s experiments on the absorbing
                    power of their surfaces; and when we consider that all plants and parts of
                    plants secluded from the air are at the same time destitute of pores, and of the
                    power of absorbing by their surfaces, it may be inferred that the organs of
                    absorption on the external surfaces of plants are the minute vascular
                    productions which, in tender and succulent parts exposed to the air and light,
                    everywhere perforate the cuticle, and form in it those innumerable orifices
                    which we denominate pores.</p>
                <p>But the function of absorption in plants is not confined to the taking up of
                    extraneous matters. Many facts prove that, in every part where active vegetation
                    exists, <hi rend="italic">internal absorption</hi> is continually going on. The
                    organs by which this absorption is immediately performed cannot, perhaps, from
                    their extreme delicacy and minuteness, be rendered capable of anatomical
                    demonstration; but certain facts which occur in plants, coupled with certain
                    analogies derived from other organized textures, must, we think, carry complete
                    conviction of their existence. In almost every part, and on every surface of
                    animal bodies, the vessels which exercise absorption may be traced; but the
                    mouths or orifices by which they actually absorb are scarcely ever to be seen.
                    In one instance only, viz. in the intestines, have they been followed to their
                    beginnings, and discovered in the act of exercising their appropriate function.
                    (Gordon’s <hi rend="italic">System of Human Anat.</hi> vol. i. p. 70.) But
                    though their orifices remain in other parts undiscovered, no anatomist hesitates
                    to admit their existence when he sees the canals of the vessels themselves laden
                    with blood, or milk, or bile; and seeing them thus to convey fluids whose colour
                    manifests their presence, he equally believes them capable of absorbing and
                    conveying other fluids, though they may not be visible to the eye. Believing
                    further, that no solid part of the body, nor even fluid part that has been
                    deposited in close cavities, can be removed in a natural manner from its place,
                    but by the agency of these vessels, he comes to regard the simple fact of the
                    disappearance of such solid or fluid part as sufficient evidence of its
                    absorption.</p>
                <p>Now the facts and analogies on which <hi rend="italic">internal</hi> absorption
                    rests in the vegetable system are precisely of the same nature, and the evidence
                    of its existence is scarcely less complete. In every part of the cellular tissue
                    of plants various substances have been found which must have been primarily
                    derived from the vessels, the only organs which furnish new materials to the
                    plant. These substances, however, often disappear from the cells, and are again
                    to be detected in the vascular system. Thus, in the seed, as will afterwards be
                    shown, the cells of the cotyledon contain a solid unorganized matter, which
                    could have been originally deposited in them only by means of the vessels.
                    During germination, this solid matter is rendered fluid, disappears from the
                    cells, and is again to be traced in the vessels on its way to afford nutriment
                    to the radicle and plume. We say, then, that this unorganized matter must have
                    been taken up from the cells of the cotyledon, and conveyed into the vascular
                    system, by the agency of absorbent vessels, which, it is probable, are
                    distributed everywhere on the inner surface of these cells; just as, in the
                    animal system, absorbent vessels are considered to take up the fat from the
                    inner surface of the cells in which it is deposited, and convey it into the
                    vessels of the animal.</p>
                <p>This alternate absorption and deposition of the nutrient matter of seeds is
                    sometimes strikingly displayed in the growth of potatoes. It frequently happens
                    that potatoes lying in a damp cellar put forth shoots which grow to a
                    considerable size, without the access of any foreign agents except heat, water,
                    and air. On these shoots young bulbs, as large as the eggs of pigeons, are
                    sometimes to be found, and the substance of the old bulb has in great part
                    disappeared. In such cases, the matter from the cells of the old bulb must be
                    considered as removed by absorption, and conveyed into the vessels of the shoot,
                    where it was in part employed in forming the new organs of the young bulb, and
                    in part deposited, to experience, perhaps, in some future growth, similar
                    successions of removal and deposition. In the living parts of perennial plants,
                    also, nutrient matter appears to be alternately deposited and absorbed from the
                    cells during the active periods of vegetation; and in the cellular tissue of
                    herbaceous plants a similar deposition and absorption of fluids seems to be
                    frequently taking place; so that, in all the vegetating parts of plants, these
                    alternate functions of secretion and absorption are more or less constantly
                    exercised.</p>
                <p>A good illustration of the manner in which these functions are alternately
                    exercised is afforded by an experiment of Μ. de Candolle. The parasitic plant
                    called misletoe draws its nourishment, as is w ell known, from the tree on which
                    it grows. Μ. de Candolle placed a branch of an apple-tree, bearing a stalk of
                    misletoe, in an infusion of cochineal for five days. He then dissected it, and
                    observed the coloured liquor to have risen through the wood and alburnum of the
                    apple-branch, and reached the place of junction between it and the misletoe,
                    which it strongly reddened; and from thence it penetrated into the woody part of
                    the misletoe. There did not, however, appear to be a true anastomosis between
                    the vessels of these different plants; but, at the base of the misletoe, where
                    the parts were so deeply reddened, a minute cellular structure was observed.
                    Into these cells the vascular system of the apple appeared to deposit its sap,
                    and from them the capillary absorbents of the misletoe, distributed upon the
                    cells, seemed, like the ordinary absorbents of roots, to take it up. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém. de ľlnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 370.) From these and many
                    similar facts it may be inferred, that absorbents, communicating with the
                    vessels of the plant, exist in every part, and that the removal of all secreted
                    matters from the cells and other close cavities of the vegetable, when effected
                    by the living powers of the plant, is accomplished, as in animal bodies, by the
                    exercise of an absorbent function.</p>

                <p>But from their external surface, and from the same parts as we have seen to
                    exercise an <hi rend="italic">absorbent</hi> function, plants, in certain
                    circumstances, give off a large quantity of fluid by <hi rend="italic"
                    >transpiration;</hi> and the organs by which this function is performed seem,
                    from many considerations, to be the same as those by which, under other
                    circumstances, absorption is accomplished. This function of transpiration is
                    common to all terrestrial plants, and, with few exceptions, all are more or less
                    furnished with pores; hut it does not occur in aquatic plants, according to De
                    Candolle, which are destitute of pores. Fleshy leaves and fruits, and the petals
                    of flowers, which have buj,few pores, transpire little; and etiolated plants,
                    which.are' destitute of pores, do not transpire at all. On the contrary,
                    herbaceous stems and plants, which have numerous pores, throw off most fluid by
                    transpiration. This general agreement between the existence of pores and the
                    exercise of the transpiratory function leads to the presumption that they are
                    the orifices through which the fluids are discharged; and if it be admitted that
                    these pores are situated at the extremity of the fine ramifications that come
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096302?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6302-0057"/>
                    ’ off from the vessels, their fitness for such an office cannot be denied.
                    Comparing these facts regarding transpiration with those previously stated
                    concerning absorption, Μ. de Candolle is led to conclude that the pores on the
                    surfaces of plants are the organs by which these functions are alternately
                    carried on, according to the existing condition of dryness or humidity in the
                    surrounding atmosphere-</p>
                <p>Repulsive as this conclusion may at first seem to our ordinary conceptions of
                    organized bodies, yet there are many circumstances in the structure and habits
                    of plants that give to it great probability; so much so, that we ourselves had
                    long since reached the same point by a route different from that pursued by Μ.
                    de Candolle. It is highly probable that the exhalents of the leaves are simple
                    ramifications from the larger vessels, like the capillary rootlets; and as they
                    have no valves in their canal, there is no mechanical impediment to their
                    exercising an inverted action. The sap-vessels themselves readily absorb even
                    coloured fluids when inverted; and though their exhalent terminations are too
                    fine to receive such fluids, yet why may they not, like the trunks from which
                    they spring, be capable of taking up ordinary fluids in that manner? The fluids
                    absorbed through the leaves must at once enter the sap-vesśels, for there is no
                    common reservoir to which they can first be carried; and it is extremely
                    improbable that, from the same parts of the same vessels, exhalents and
                    absorbents, capable of exercising only opposite functions, should at the same
                    time arise. In the animal system the exhalents spring from arteries, and the
                    absorbents terminate in veins; but in the less complex structure of plants it
                    seems demonstrable that both orders of vessels must at once communicate with the
                    same sap-vessels. It is therefore more probable to suppose that, instead of two
                    distinct orders of vessels, as in animals,, one only should be provided,
                    capable, under different circumstances, of exercising different functions. This
                    vicarious office of the organs under consideration leads to no confusion in its
                    exercise; for the condition of the atmosphere, which favours transpiration, is
                    that which removes from the leaves the power of absorption; and, on the
                    contrary, absorption occurs only in a humid atmosphere, when, as Hales has
                    shown, little or no transpiration takes place.</p>
                <p>Besides exhalation carried on through visible pores, plants, like other bodies,
                    lose their humidity by simple evaporation. This evaporation seems to go on in a
                    moderate degree under favourable circumstances by day and by night, and is quite
                    distinct from the copious transpiration that is carried on by the agency of
                    solar light through the pores. That the pores are exhaling organs, was an
                    opinion first advanced by Hedwig, and subsequently illustrated *by De Candolle,
                    Sprengel, Link, and Rudolphi. <hi rend="italic">(Organog.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Végétale,</hi> tome i. p. 86.) In like manner, though absorption may be carried
                    on in certain circumstances through the pores of leaves, yet there are plants
                    which largely imbibe water, but in which few or no pores have been detected.
                    Thus, fleshy leaves which have lost their moisture quickly regain it either when
                    plunged in water or exposed to rain, though they possess but few pores; and’;
                    Hie aquatic algae, says Μ. de Candolle, evidently imbibe water over their whole
                    surface, though they are wholly destitute of pores. He supposes that, beside the
                    ordinary pores which may be readily seen, plants may be furnished with others
                    that are invisible from their extreme minuteness. By such pores we might account
                    for the loss of weight which plants destitute of visible pores gradually undergo
                    when exposed to the free air, and also for the increase of weight which mosses,
                    and other plants equally destitute of pores, rapidly acquire when plunged in
                    water. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 88.)</p>
                <p>The view thus presented of the <hi rend="italic">external</hi> absorbent and
                    exhalent vessels may probably be extended to the' minute vascular productions
                    which seem everywhere toļ spring from the vessels <hi rend="italic"
                    >internally.</hi> If secreting and ab- <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> sorbing
                    vessels be held to exist in every part of the plant, ∣ they must everywhere
                    communicate with the vascular system; for it is from the vessels of this system
                    that the matter of their secretions is primarily derived, and it is into the
                    same vessels that, in many cases, these secretions are subsequently returned.
                    Nor does the exercise of the two functions of secretion and absorption in plants
                    present. any apparent obstacle to the supposition of their being performed at
                    different times by the same organs. Thus, when nutrient matter is deposited in
                    the cellular tissue of the seed, it is destined only for a future use; and the
                    purpose of nature would be defeated were an absorbent function to be at the same
                    time employed for its removal. On the other hand, when this matter is again
                    taken up during the germination of the seed, no secreting function seems then to
                    be exercised in that part; for the organ itself, in many seeds, gradually
                    wastes, and no fresh matter is deposited in it. Even when the, cotyledon to a
                    certain extent augments in size, its nutrient matter is continually drawn off
                    for the support of the, radicle and plume, and no fresh matter of the same kind
                    seems to be then deposited; so that the same vessels which formerly exercised
                    the function of secretion may, without disturbing the economy of the plant, be
                    now employed in the exercise of absorption. As thus the two functions do not
                    require to be performed in the same part at the same time, they may, if nothing
                    else forbid, be exercised at different times by the same organs. In the animal
                    system, where the organs themselves are removed, secreting and absorbing vessels
                    must necessarily co-exist; and to maintain the integrity of parts, their
                    functions must proceed at the same time, and to a certain extent balance each
                    other; but as no similar operations appear to be carried on in the vegetable
                    system, no such complex organization is required to sustain them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italic">Description and Structure of the Cells.</hi></p>
                <p>The elementary organ denominated <hi rend="italic">cellular tissue</hi> may: be
                    said to consist of a membranous substance, disposed into a great number of small
                    circumscribed cavities, connected with each other, and arranged in rows or
                    suites, generally in a direction opposed to that of the tubes, which represent
                    the vascular system. From Grew it received the appellation of <hi rend="italic"
                    >parenchyma,</hi> a term still often used in describing different parts of this
                    tissue; by Malpighi, it was called the <hi rend="italic">utricular
                    substance</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and it owes, we believe, its present name
                    to Μ. du Hamel.</p>
                <p>The cavities which distinguish its construction were: called indifferently bags
                    or bladders, pores and cells, by Grew; by Malpighi, utricles; by others,
                    vesicles; and more commonly cells. The form of these cells varies so much, not
                    only in different plants, but in different parts of the same plant, as to have
                    authorized, in. some degree, these different appellations. The tissue which they
                    constitute enters into the composition of every organ in the more perfect
                    plants. Of many herbaceous plants it forms the chief portion, and some of the
                    lower tribes of vegetables, as the algae, lichens, mushrooms, &amp;c. are said
                    to be wholly composed of it; in other words, no vessels can be <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096315?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6315-0058"/> actually
                    demonstrated in them. In most cases it contributes greatly to modify the form of
                    organs, and adds always to their bulk and strength. Nothing can exceed the
                    diversity of appearance in figure, bulk, and texture, which it exhibits in the
                    several parts, circumstances, and conditions in which it is placed. It
                    represents sometimes a lax cellular substance, all the parts of which are
                    succulent and transparent; in other instances it is compressed into a solid,
                    opaque body, retaining but faint traces of its former cellularity; and in
                    others, again, it is spread out into a most thin and delicate membrane, in which
                    the cellular character is wholly lost. It everywhere envelopes and holds
                    together the vascular system, and seems to be the général receptacle of almost
                    all the vegetable secretions.</p>
                <p>The figure of the component cells of this tissue is exceedingly various.
                    Sometimes they have nearly a globular or spheroidal shape; in other instances
                    they are angular, and exhibit in their section a greater or lesser number of
                    sides and angles, being in a few examples triangular; in others square, but more
                    commonly hexagonal, the figure which collections of soft cells, mutually
                    impressing each other, seem naturally disposed to assume. This form is
                    represented in the transverse section of cells, fig. 28, Plate XXXVIII.; they
                    seem in this figure, and in most of those given in different works, to possess
                    double sides; but, as Μ. Kieser has remarked <hi rend="italic">(Mém. sur</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Organisât.</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Plantes,</hi> p. 91), this appearance is produced by the borders of the
                    subjacent cells being seen through the transparent sides of the superior layer.
                    In Plate XXXIX. fig. 16, is a representation of a transverse slice of the
                    cellular part of sugar-cane, drawn from nature, and so thin as to exhibit only
                    one layer of cells, in which the sides appear distinctly single; but, in a
                    thicker slice of the same plant, fig. 21, comprehending more than one layer, the
                    double appearance becomes very evident.</p>
                <p>The size of the cells varies not less than their figure in different plants and
                    in different parts of the same plant. In one of the plates of Grew they are
                    represented as possessing twenty different sizes, from that of a minute pore, to
                    the size of a common pea. Hooke examined them in cork, and in the pith of many
                    plants. In cork he reckoned several lines of these cells or pores, as he calls
                    them, and found there were about sixty placed endwise in one eighteenth part of
                    an inch, or somewhat more than a thousand in the length of an inch; and,
                    therefore, in a square inch above a million, and in a cubic inch above 1200
                    millions. <hi rend="italic">(Micrographia,</hi> p. 114.) In this substance the
                    cells are not visible by the naked eye, but become very distinct when highly
                    magnified. In most plants, however, they are readily visible, and their
                    appearance is familiar to every one.</p>
                <p>When viewed in a longitudinal section, their hexagonal form is much less
                    distinct, and is sometimes wholly lost. In fig. 22, Plate XXXIX., is a series of
                    single columns of the cells of sugar-cane, in which each cell is, to appearance,
                    bounded only by four sides. Similar representations are given by Hooke of the
                    cells in cork, and by Kieser in most of the figures which exhibit longitudinal
                    sections of the cellular tissue; but in some instances the hexagonal form is
                    visible even in these sections. In fig. 23 of the 'βame plate we have given, in
                    outline, the appearance of two series of columns of these transparent cells, in
                    which one series is seen behind the other, and gives somewhat of the confused
                    double appearance exhibited in the transverse section, fig. 21.</p>
                <p>The nature of the matter contained in the . cells of tlιis tissue varies
                    according to the part in which it exists, and the peculiar powers of the plant.
                    Both Hooke and Grew remarked, that in the pith and bark of succulent plants the
                    cells were often filled with aqueous juices, and in the same plant, at other
                    periods, they appeared empty, or filled only with air. In the seed, the cells of
                    the cotyledons contain minute unorganized particles, which, at a future period,
                    serve as nutriment for the young plantule. Other particles of still smaller
                    size, of a resinous nature and a green colour, exist in other parts of this
                    tissue, and bestow on the plant its verdure. In every part of the plant these
                    cells are also the occasional receptacles of the peculiar fluids which both the
                    sap-vessels and the proper vessels convey; and hence various gummy and resinous
                    substances, corresponding in quality to the fluids previously existing in the
                    vascular system, are frequently detected in them. In the pulp of fruits, the
                    various acid, saccharine, and austere juices that we meet with, are contained in
                    different modifications of this tissue; and it is into its cells that the
                    osseous secretions, which constitute their shells and stones, are made. These
                    facts prove not only the great importance of this tissue in the construction of
                    the vegetable organs, but the active share it bears in the economy of their
                    functions; and demonstrate likewise an universal communication between the
                    vessels and the cells.</p>
                <p>The sides of these cells, when emptied of their contents, and viewed through the
                    microscope, appear to be formed by a very fine transparent membrane, which some
                    maintain to be everywhere entire, and others to be perforated with pores. The
                    same sources of error exist here as before noticed in similar microscopical
                    observations on the vascular system; and, accordingly, the respective disputants
                    maintain, with equal confidence, the same opinions with regard to the porosity
                    or non-porosity of the cells, as they had previously held concerning the
                    vessels. We must therefore call in the aid of other means besides those of the
                    microscope, for determining the important fact whether the cells have or have
                    not any direct communication with each other.</p>
                <p>Dr Hooke examined the films or sides of the cells of cork, of the pith of elder,
                    and of many other plants, for' the very purpose of discovering whether any
                    direct communication existed between them; but <hi rend="superscript"> ζζ</hi>
                    each cavern or cell,” says he, “is distinctly separate from the rest, without
                    any kind of hole in the encompassing films nor could he, with his microscope,
                    nor by his breath, nor by any other way that he tried, “discover a passage out
                    of one of those cavities into another.” <hi rend="italic">{Micrographia,</hi> p.
                    116.) Dr Grew describes the little cells or bladders that compose the bark of
                    roots as possessing a spheroidal shape in most plants. When viewed with the
                    microscope, their sides are as transparent as water; and “none σf them,” he
                    adds, <hi rend="superscript"> ζζ</hi> are visibly pervious from one into
                    another, but each is bounded within itself.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 64.) Both Hooke and Grew, however, believed a communication to
                    exist between the cells, from the fact of their containing liquor; and Malpighi
                    held the same opinion from similar considerations; but they nowhere describe the
                    mode or structure by which they conceived it to be accomplished.</p>
                <p>Later writers have not only adopted this opinion, but professed to demonstrate
                    the. structure by which the communication is maintained. Μ. Mirbel describes the
                    sides of the cells as composed of an extremely thin, colourless, and transparent
                    membrane, which is commonly perforated with pores, the diameter of whose
                    aperture is not perhaps the 300th part of a millimetre. These pores are ranged
                    generally in transverse series, and through them, it is said, the cellular
                    tissue both receives fluids. from the vessels, and transmits them very slowly
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096328?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6328-0059"/>
                    through its cells. <hi rend="italic">(Exposition</hi><hi rend="italic">de la
                    Théorie,</hi> &amp;c. p. 105.) Μ. Sprengel and some others adopt this view of
                    the porosity of the cells; but it is denied by Link, Treviranus, and Kieser. The
                    latter author declares, that notwithstanding all that has been said concerning
                    the pores in the sides of the cells, his observations, made with the greatest
                    care and exactness, have not enabled him to discover the slightest trace of
                    them. The sides of the cells, he adds, are always formed by a membrane extremely
                    thin, but altogether smooth and uniform; and the cells themselves have never an
                    open communication with each other. (Kieser <hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi

                <p>If, then, no pores exist in the sides of the cells for the reception and
                    transmission of the fluids they contain, some other means must be provided for
                    the accomplishment of these objects. Μ. Link, accordingly, supposes the juices
                    to pass from one cell to another by <hi rend="italic">transudation.</hi> Μ.
                    Rudolphi thinks that a <hi rend="italic">decomposition of the fluid</hi> is
                    effected by the cells themselves, during which it is transmitted through their
                    sides; and Μ. Dutrochet calls in the aid of electrical agency. To us there occur
                    no probable means of accomplishing these operations, consistently with the
                    integrity of the cellular structure, but the exercise of those alternate
                    functions of secretion and absorption which, from so many other considerations,
                    we have supposed to be carried on in every living part of the vegetable
                    system.</p>
                <p>Another question of importance in relation to the sides of the cells is, whether
                    they are single or double; that is, whether each cell has a side of its own, or
                    whether one side is in every position common to two cells. Mirbel •asserts the
                    former, and Kieser maintains the latter opinion. In fig. 29, Plate XXXVIII., is
                    an outline representation of these double sides as given by Kieser. From the
                    extreme thinness of the membrane, it is very difficult, he says, to distinguish
                    this double structure; but where the cells are large, and a glass that magnifies
                    highly is employed, each partition that separates two cells is distinctly seen
                    to be composed of two membranes, which are sometimes separated about the middle
                    of the partition, and united towards the angular points. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ĭ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Organisai.</hi><hi rend="italic">des Plantes,</hi> p. 91.) MM. Amici,
                    Dutrochet, De Candolle, and others, support this opinion. (See <hi rend="italic"
                    >Organog. Veg.</hi> tome i. p. 21.) The existence of this double structure
                    receives some countenance from the fact observed in the construction of the
                    honeycomb by the late Dr Barclay, who says that each side of every cell in the
                    comb is composed of two plates, or is double. (<hi rend="italic">Wernerian
                    Transactions,</hi> vol. ii.) It may still, however, be more properly said, that
                    each side of every cell is truly single, and is rendered double only by coming
                    into contact with the corresponding side of an adjacent cell.</p>
                <p> When the cells have a regular hexagonal figure, and arc equally distended with
                    their appropriate juices, there is no reason to suppose that any vacuities are
                    left between their sides or angles. Mathematicians have long since demonstrated
                    a regular hexagon to be one of those figures that completely fill up a given
                    space; and that no vacuities can exist either about its sides or its angles.
                    Where, however, the cells deviate from this regular figure, and more or less
                    approach to a spherical form, vacuities or interstices may readily be conceived
                    to occur. These vacuities are said to have been first noticed by Grew and
                    Leeuwenhocck, and afterwards by Μ. Trevira-ríus, who describes them as
                    interstices left between the cells in their mutual approximations towards each
                    other. Fie gave them the name of <hi rend="italic">intercellular canals,</hi> as
                    already stated.</p>
                <p>On the'other hand,' MM. Mirbel and Rudolphi altogether deny their existence; but
                    Μ. Kieser contends strenuously for it. -He describes them as small interstices
                    situated at the angles of the hexagonal cells, and formed not by any sides of
                    their own, but by the mutual approach of three contiguous cells, and possessing,
                    therefore, a prismatic form. These interstices he conceives to exist at every
                    angle, and thus every cell to be surrounded by them. In fig. 29, Plate XXXVIIL,
                    the blaek angular points denote their place. By their conjunction with each
                    other they form a canal, which, when the hexagonal figure is perfect, and the
                    cells are ranged horizontally, extends both in a longitudinal and transverse
                    direction; and when the cells are placed obliquely, the canals have a similar
                    direction. Their size varies according to that of the cells, by the sides of
                    which they are constructed; they contain and convey the proper juices in the
                    bark, but in the pith are often dry; and their course is said to terminate only
                    with that of the cells themselves, at the surface of the plant. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">l</hi><hi

                    >Organisat. des Plantes,</hi> p. 104.) Such are the organs which, as we have
                    seen, Μ. Kieser considers to convey both the sap and the proper juices in
                    plants. That in some circumstances they may exist, and become reservoirs of the
                    sap or other juices, seems highly probable; but of the impropriety of ascribing
                    to such casual productions the performance of the primary functions of the
                    vegetable system, we have already spoken.</p>
                <p>The cellular tissue, as described above, is that form of it which must be
                    regarded as the most perfect. From various causes, however, it is subject to
                    great alterations. In herbs, and in the pith and succulent parts of trees, the
                    cells preserve their original form and appearance for a considerable time; but
                    by the growth of the other parts, and consequent extension and compression they
                    experience, they acquire in the bark and wood an elongated figure, and this both
                    in a transverse and longitudinal direction. In the latter case they surround and
                    connect the layers of vessels with each other, constituting what has been named
                    the <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> of the bark and wood. In this form their
                    size is often greatly reduced, their cavities sometimes obliterated, and their
                    cellular character altogether effaced. In other instances traces of a cellular
                    structure are occasionally visible, appearing in detached portions among the
                    perpendicular vessels. In some plants the cells become elongated in a
                    longitudinal direction, and yet preserve their capacity nearly unchanged. It was
                    probably this form of cell that led Malpighi to regard sometimes as a vessel,
                    what, in reality, appears to be only a series of elongated cells. To his
                    representation of these cells, as given fig. 18, Plate XXXIX., we have before
                    referred. Μ. Kieser considers these elongated cells as forming the ligneous
                    fibres of the wood, and that the bark is almost entirely formed of them. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic">sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ľ
                    Organisat∙des Plantes,</hi> p. 99, 101.) These cells, he says, were originally
                    round; but in trees they become so much lengthened as to exhibit the form of a
                    tube. It is easy, however, he adds, to detect transverse partitions in these
                    seeming tubes, which, having often a diagonal direction, give to these cells the
                    form of a double pyramid with sharp points. The membrane which forms these cells
                    is, in all trees except the <hi rend="italic">Coniferae</hi> and some others,
                    smooth, without pores, and transparent. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 299.)
                    To these organs Treviranus gave the name of fibrous utricles; by De Candolle
                    they are called tubulated cells; and Dutrochet, from their spindle shape,
                    denominates them, as we have seen, <hi rend="italic">clostres.</hi> His
                    representation of them, fig. 17, Plate XXXIX., corresponds with the foregoing
                    description of Kieser.</p>
                <p>From suffering compression in a transverse direction, the cells have frequently
                    their longer diameter thrown <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096341?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6341-0060"/> into that position, and thus extend from the
                    centre to the circumference of the plant. This position, as will afterwards be
                    shown, was fully noticed by Grew and Malpighi. Leeuwenhoeck also observed it,
                    but mistook the cells thus elongated for vessels, and considered their
                    partitions as valves,—errors which Μ. Kieser, as well as others, duly points
                    out. In this transverse direction the tissue forms partitions more or less large
                    between the vessels, as will afterwards be shown; and by the obliteration of its
                    cells it is frequently reduced to the condition of a solid membrane.</p>
                <p>Besides these more constant and necessary changes in the figure and character of
                    the cellular tissue, it often suffers others of a more casual and accidental
                    nature. In the pith, as the plant grows up, divers ruptures, says Grew, occur,
                    oftentimes very regularly, and observed constantly in the same species of plant.
                    These ruptures are sometimes prolonged, so as to form a tube of considerable
                    length. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 120.) Others have observed
                    similar canals in the pith, formed not by sides of their own, but by those of
                    the adjacent cells, and very various in size and form. They have been called <hi
                    rend="italic">lacunae,</hi> or reservoirs, contain a variety of substances, and
                    sometimes, especially in aquatic plants, only air. As we have seen the cavities
                    of the larger spiral vessels to be filled with vesicles, so the larger cells of
                    the pith, according to Grew, frequently contain smaller ones, or are divided by
                    cross membranes. A similar observation is made by Kieser, who likewise remarks
                    that, in the empty cells of <hi rend="italic">Calla</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >AEthiopica,</hi> he has sometimes seen small round-headed bodies, supported on
                    little peduncles, which spring from the sides, and point towards the centre of
                    the cells. Small crystallized bodies are also occasionally found in the cavities
                    of the cells, and within the intercellular canals. <hi rend="italic">(Mém.

                    cellular tissue, by which its cells are converted into receptacles and
                    reservoirs of the proper juices of the plant, we before discoursed when treating
                    of the proper vessels. To such an extent does this change sometimes proceed,
                    that, in aged oaks, and, according to Kieser, in guaiacum, and probably in many
                    other plants, the whole cellular tissue becomes filled with these secreted
                    matters, and the distinctive characters of the cells, and almost of the vessels
                    themselves, are obliterated and lost.</p>
                <p>CHAP. II.</p>
                <p>THE ANATOMY IN GENERAL OF THE COMMON TEXTURES OF VEGETABLES.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Preliminary Observations.</hi></p>
                <p>The elementary organs, whose description has so long occupied our attention,
                    form, either singly or by their combination, all the other parts of plants. Some
                    of the lower tribes of vegetables consist entirely of cellular tissue, in which
                    no vessels are at any period to be seen; and, even in the higher orders, many
                    parts exhibit no appearance of a vascular structure. There can be little doubt,
                    however, of the existence of such a structure, since, physiologically speaking,
                    we can form no just conception of the growth of an organized body, without
                    associating with it the existence of a vascular system. In all plants the pith
                    consists of a cellular tissue alone. In herbaceous plants this tissue forms
                    their greater portion; but in trees the number of vessels is so great as to
                    constitute the chief bulk of the plant. To certain forms of these elementary
                    organs, whether existing singly or in combination, we have given the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">common textures,</hi> because they are very generally to be found
                    in all plants, and in almost all parts of them, howsoever varied in quantity,
                    proportion, and arrangement. These textures are familiarly known under the names
                    of cuticle or skin, of bark, of wood, and of pith; to which may be assigned the
                    general appellations of the cuticular, the cortical, the ligneous, and medullary
                    textures.</p>
                <p>All the several textures just enumerated are readily distinguished by their
                    different places and characters in the section of most arborescent plants, in
                    which they commonly appear well defined, and perfectly distinct from each other.
                    In many plants, however, both herbs and trees, this distinction of parts is not
                    preserved; but, with the exception of the cuticle, all the other textures are
                    blended together through the entire substance of the plant, as was long since
                    noticed both by Malpighi and Grew. “In the stalk of maize or Indian wheat,” says
                    Grew, “the work of nature appears less diversified; in which, although there are
                    the same parenchymous and ligneous parts as in all other plants, yet is there
                    neither bark nor pith, the vessels being dispersed and mixed with the
                    parenchyma, from the circumference to the centre of the stalk.” “The like
                    structure,” he adds, “may also be seen in the sugar-cane and some other plants.”
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 104.) Similar observations were made
                    by Malpighi, not only on different species of wheat and sugarcane, but on ferns
                    and palms. “In ferns,” says he, “the vascular fasciculi are numerous, but placed
                    without order, and are everywhere sustained by the intervening cellular tissue,
                    the cells of which are sometimes much smaller than the orifices of the vessels
                    themselves.” <hi rend="italic">Anat. Plantar.</hi> p. 24, 25.) This structure is
                    represented in the transverse section of the sugar-cane, Plate XXXIX. fig. 25;
                    and in a similar section of the palm, fig. 26 of the same plate.</p>
                <p>This variety of structure, thus clearly described, and distinctly delineated in
                    the works of Malpighi ancl Grew, has likewise been noticed by Μ. Desfontaines.
                    Vegetables, according to him, may be distinguished into two divisions: Is/,
                    Those which have no distinct concentric layers, whose solidity decreases from
                    the circumference towards the centre, and whose pith is interposed among the
                    vessels, and does not extend in divergent rays: <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi>
                    Vegetables which have distinct concentric layers, whose solidity decreases from
                    the centre towards the circumference, and whose pith is contained in a
                    longitudinal canal, and extends in divergent rays. The former structure he
                    considers as peculiar to plants whose seeds are monocotyledonous, and the latter
                    as belonging to those which have dicotyledonous seeds. <hi rend="italic">(Mém.
                    de ľlnstitut. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 478.)</p>
                <p>This opinion, though partly correct, is not universally applicable. That many
                    plants which spring from monocotyledonous seeds are destitute of concentric
                    layers, and have’ no distinct bark or pith, is certain; but it is not less
                    certain that many herbaceous plants, which are produced from dicotyledonous
                    seeds, are pretty much in the same condition, being equally destitute of
                    concentric layers and of divergent rays, and in which the bark and the pith must
                    be regarded as one continuous structure. On the other hand, some
                    monocotyledonous plants, as Μ. Desfontaines admits, may deviate a little from
                    the prescribed conditions. In a paper on the organization of such plants, Μ.
                    Mirbel, who regards this doctrine as the most important step made of late years
                    in Vegetable Anatomy, says, nevertheless, it would be erroneous to assert that
                    they have never a bark. In several species of plants he produces examples to the
                    contrary; and adds, that in Some instances their diametral growth goes on at the
                    cir <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096354?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6354-0061"/> cumference, which would seem to approximate them
                    to dicotyledons. As, however, there is no appearance of divergent rays, or of
                    concentric layers, these examples are considered by him rather to confirm than
                    overturn the theory of Μ. Desfontaines. <hi rend="italic">(Annales du
                    Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii.
                    p. 67.) But if in this theory its second division embrace only those plants in
                    which the concentric layers are perfect, and divergent rays exist, then it
                    excludes a great number of herbaceous plants, whose seeds have two cotyledons;
                    and if the absence of these regular layers, and of divergent rays, serve as a
                    passport to the first division, then many of these same plants must be admitted
                    among those whose seeds, have but one cotyledon. The theory of Μ. Desfontaines,
                    therefore, rests on too partial an observation of the structure of plants.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Pith or Medullary Texture.</hi></p>
                <p>The pith (medulla) of plants, when present, occupies the centre of the stem,
                    where it is commonly surrounded by a circle of vessels which construct for it an
                    appropriate canal. In the succulent shoots of trees, its proportion to the other
                    parts is generally large; but it diminishes as the tree advances in age, and is
                    frequently entirely obliterated. Where the vessels of the wood are few in
                    number, as in herbs, only a few fasciculi are seen to surround the pith, and the
                    intervening spaces are occupied by a boundary of thickened cellular tissue. In
                    some plants, again, no pith whatever exists, but the stem is hollow or tubular.
                    In other instances, and especially in roots, the centre of the stem is occupied
                    by vessels; and in others, both cells and vessels, promiscuously blended
                    together, constitute the centre of the stem.</p>
                <p>In those plants where the pith is present, and possesses its most perfect form,
                    it is seen to be composed entirely of cellular tissue, possessing often very
                    different shades of colour, but, in its anatomical characters, resembling
                    exactly the description already given of that tissue. Its bulk in different
                    plants is exceedingly different, as are also the form and size of its cells. It
                    is frequently entirely insulated by the surrounding vessels, but is often
                    continuous with the cellular tissue of the bark. Its cells contain, especially
                    in the early age of the plant, aqueous fluids, which afterwards disappear, and
                    then the cells become fi∏cd only with air. The “proper juices” of the plant may
                    also be sometimes detected in the cells of the pith. Of the ruptures produced in
                    it by desiccation and other causes, we have already spoken in discoursing of the
                    cellular tissue: they occur particularly in succulent plants, where the cells
                    are large, and their sides thin; so that as the plant advances to maturity, the
                    pith breaks and shrinks up, making the trunk a pipe. (Grew’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >Anatomy of Plants.</hi> p. 129.) We have also noticed the fact, that, within
                    the cavities of the larger cells of the pith, new vesicular productions are
                    sometimes found.</p>
                <p>Grew speaks of the existence of vessels in the pith of certain plants, as in that
                    of the fig and the pine; but he adds, that they are usually so postured as to
                    form a ring about its margin. <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p.
                    119.) They are doubtless to be considered as enlarged <hi rend="italic">proper
                    vessels,</hi> which made a part of the first ligneous circle, and have retained
                    therefore nearly the situation in which they were originally formed. Hence, as
                    he observes, they are of divers kinds, answerable to those of the bark,
                    containing in the fig a milky juice, and in the pine a resinous substance.
                    Similar vessels, containing a “proper juice,” were observed also in the pith of
                    elder by Malpighi, who seems to regard such appearances as common where .the.
                    contained juice concretes or possesses a dark colour. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 4.) It is probable, however, that the organs here considered to
                    be vessels may in some cases be cells, into which these juices have been poured;
                    but where real vessels of this kind are found, they are not to be considered as
                    a part of the original structure of the pith, but occurring only in consequence
                    of the changes which the vegetable body undergoes in the progress of its
                    growth.</p>
                <p>The general ∙ nature of the pith is thus clearly announced by Grew. “Although,”
                    says he, “it have a different name from the <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> in
                    the bark and the <hi rend="italic">insertions</hi> in the wood, yet, as to its
                    substance, it is the very same with them both; whereof there is a double
                    evidence, viz. their continuity and the sameness of their texture so that all
                    these parts are “one entire piece of work, being only filled up in divers
                    manners with the vessels.” <hi rend="italic">(Anatomy of Plants,</hi> p. 119.)
                    This continuity of the pith with the cellular tissue, of the bark, by means of
                    the insertions or transverse ranges of <hi rend="italic">utriculi,</hi> as he
                    calls them, is also adduced by Malpighi as evidence of the similarity of their
                    nature, and of the pith being, as it were, an intercepted portion of the bark
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 4, 30); an opinion which seems
                    abundantly confirmed by the intermixture of the medullary and cortical textures
                    in many plants, in which, as already remarked, the distinctive characters of
                    bark and pith are alike lost, and the entire stem exhibits only one uniform
                    appearance of structure.</p>
                <p>The term <hi rend="italic">medulla,</hi> employed by the ancients to note this
                    texture, derived its origin, no doubt, from the resemblance which the pith in
                    the centre of trees bore to the marrow in the bones of animals; and as the same
                    term, in animal anatomy, was incorrectly employed to express alike the marrow in
                    the bones and the nervous substance in the vertebral column, so the same
                    latitude of signification has been extended to the vegetable system. Hence, as
                    Malpighi remarks, the medulla in vegetables was regarded as analogous in its
                    nature to the brain of animals,—a doctrine which even later writers have
                    continued to espouse. It is not our present intention to describe the uses of
                    the pith, but only to remove erroneous opinions concerning its nature, and
                    restore to it that just anatomical character long since assigned it by Malpighi
                    and Grew, and which some writers have of late put forth as a considerable
                    novelty.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Wood or Ligneous Texture.</hi></p>
                <p>Immediately surrounding and enveloping the pith is the part called the wood <hi

                    It is essentially composed of vessels and of cellular tissue, but combined in
                    such an infinite variety of proportions, and exhibiting such a boundless
                    diversity of forms, that it is difficult to seize even its more general
                    features, without the risk of extending our description beyond the limits which
                    our plan necessarily prescribes.</p>
                <p>Except in those vegetables in which no .vessels have been hitherto demonstrated,
                    but in which they must nevertheless be presumed to exist, this texture may be
                    considered to form a part not only of every plant, but of all its organs; for
                    into whatever part fluids are conveyed, vessels must be sůpposed to extend; and
                    wherever vessels are present, cellular tissue is to be found: hence, in its
                    distribution, it may be considered the most universal of all the textures. In
                    trees, the vessels, as we have frequently remarked, are very numerous, and, when
                    viewed in a transverse section, are seen to be disposed in layers or concentric
                    circles around the axis, and to stand also in <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096367?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6367-0062"/> lines or
                    radii, diverging from the centre of the tree. (See fig. 4, Plate XL.) Between
                    each line or ray of vessels a thin partition of cellular tissue is interposed,
                    which extends in the direction of the ray, through the entire substance of the
                    wood. At certain distances, varying in different trees, thicker transverse
                    portions of the same substance are placed, and are readily distinguishable in
                    almost every species of wood. Between each layer that is annually added to the
                    wood, and each of the smaller layers that go to the formation of the larger one,
                    cellular tissue seems also in some trees to be longitudinally interposed; so
                    that it is probable that in both directions each fasciculus of vessels is
                    intercepted by cellular tissue, and that in such trees no two fasciculi are on
                    any side in immediate contact with each other. It is even probable that the
                    individual vessels which contribute to form the fasciculi are themselves
                    connected by intervening cellular tissue, which acts like the <hi rend="italic"
                    >neurilema</hi> that holds together the filaments of the fasciculi in the
                    nerves, or the cellular substance that connects the primary filaments in the
                    muscular fibres of animals. In this manner, the whole vascular system of the
                    plant is everywhere connected and held together by cellular tissue. Of this
                    tissue, and the different figures its cells acquire, from the different modes
                    and degrees of compression to which they are exposed, we have already
                    spoken.</p>
                <p>In many trees, however, as palms, the vascular fasciculi, though numerous, are
                    much less abundant than in the examples just referred to. They are consequently
                    placed at a greater distance from each other, and, not being disposed in regular
                    lines, do not constitute that radiant appearance so common in ordinary trees,
                    but are promiscuously dispersed through the cellular tissue. (See fig. 26, Plate
                    XXXIX.) As this tissue itself is not, from the same causes, compressed either in
                    the direction or to the extent before described, the smaller membranous
                    partitions that divide the vascular radii from each other are not produced;
                    neither, for similar reasons, is there any distinct appearance of the larger
                    partitions that, at certain distances, intersect the diameter of other trees.
                    The cellular tissue, therefore, in such plants, retains more of its primitive
                    character, and appears everywhere to surround the vascular fasciculi, but
                    nowhere to be so compressed as to form solid partitions between them. In some
                    plants which possess this structure, as the sugar-cane (fig. 25, Plate XXXIX.),
                    the cells indeed retain their perfect forms; and even the fasciculi of vessels,
                    though standing at considerable distances from each other, have towards the
                    centre of the plant a symmetrical arrangement. This latter circumstance is
                    observable in many other plants, which have even fewer vessels than the
                    sugar-cane; so that it is probable that, in the first instance, it takes place
                    in all; and that the irregular position of the vessels in the palm and similar
                    trees, particularly towards their circumference, proceeds from the peculiar
                    modes of their growth, and are not a primary condition of their structure. This
                    intermixture of the vessels and cells in the plants now under consideration
                    extends from the circumference to the centre, so as to constitute their entire
                    bulk, to the exclusion of bark and pith; unless we choose rather to say that in
                    such plants the medullary, ligneous, and cortical textures, are all blended
                    together.</p>
                <p>* In other examples the vessels form a still smaller portion of the ligneous
                    texture, consisting only of a few fasciculi, which stand at considerable
                    distances from each other, the intervening spaces being occupied by'cellular
                    tissue, which forms the chief bulk of the plant. (Fig. 15, Plate XXXIX.) Though
                    few in number, the vessels, however,' are symmètrically disposed, and iń the
                    same species preserve always the same position, the fasciculi being placed at
                    the same relative distance from each other and from the common centre of the
                    pith. Sometimes, instead of a few solitary fasciculi, they consist of several
                    ranges, forming an imperfect sort of concentric layers; and in such examples the
                    ligneous texture is commonly separated by distinct but irregular marks from the
                    two other textures. In these plants the cellular tissue preserves its
                    characters, and exhibits no appearance of divergent rays.</p>
                <p>The three modes of arrangement above described appear to constitute the chief
                    varieties of structure in the ligneous texture; but in each variety, and through
                    every stage by which they graduate into one another, the greatest diversity of
                    forms prevails. Each species of plant has its peculiar <hi rend="italic"
                    >internal structure,</hi> as well as its <hi rend="italic">external</hi> form;
                    and this seems to be in a great measure determined by the number of vessels that
                    enter into its composition, and their peculiar mode of arrangement. If the
                    vessels are few, the cellular tissue is large in proportion, and its characters
                    are distinct and well preserved ;—if they are numerous, and disposed in rays,
                    the tissue is compressed in various directions, loses more or less completely
                    its cellular character, and forms alike those divergent rays or transverse
                    partitions already so often noticed, and those thin membranous expansions or <hi
                    rend="italic">fasciae</hi> which, both in the bark and wood, are seen sometimes
                    to cover the vessels in a longitudinal direction. Though the whole of the
                    ligneous texture is thus made up of vessels and cells, variously formed and
                    blended together, yet many writers speak of ligneous fibres, which some describe
                    as consisting of vessels, others of cells, and others of an assemblage both of
                    cells and vessels.</p>
                <p>The manner, too, or rather the place, in which the vessels are developed, in
                    perennial plants, will greatly contribute to vary the appearance of the ligneous
                    texture. In those trees whose diameter is annually increased by the formation of
                    new vessels around the cylinder of older wood, the new parts must necessarily
                    present in their longitudinal section the appearance of annual layers
                    superimposed on one another, and, in their transverse section, that of
                    concentric circles; but in palms and similar trees, where the development of new
                    parts seems to be accomplished in a different manner, their appearance, under
                    similar sections, may be expected to be different.</p>
                <p>In a longitudinal section of the palm, says Μ. Desfon-i taines, we discover an
                    assemblage of large ligneous fibres <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> (that is,
                    vascular fasciculi), solid, smooth, and flexible; and these are composed of
                    others still smaller, which are firmly united together: they mostly run parallel
                    to the axis of the trunk, from the base to the summit, without interruption; but
                    some proceed obliquely, and cross the others at angles more or less sharp. (See
                    fig. 2^, Plate XXXIX.) In a transverse section of the same stem, continues the
                    author, we remark neither concentric circles nor transverse partitions; but the
                    fasciculi of vessels, placed without order by the side of each other, are
                    enveloped by the cellular tissue, which fills up all the intervals: they
                    sensibly approach each other, harden and diminish in size in proceeding from the
                    centre to the circumference (see fig. 26, Plate XXXIX.); so that the stem has
                    much more strength and solidity near the surface than in the interior,—an
                    organization quite distinct from that of ordinary trees.</p>
                <p>The cause of this diversity of structure seems to be amply accounted for by the
                    different modes in which! the growth of these trees is accomplished. When the
                    seed of a palm is sown, the leaves, says Μ. Desfontaines, successively develope
                    and augment in number for four or five years; the neck of the root augments in
                    the same proportion; the bulbous part, formed by the re-union of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096380?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6380-0063"/> the petioles
                    of the leaves, increases insensibly; its solidity augments, and at length the
                    stem rises above the earth with all the size it ever acquires. Its figure is
                    cylindrical from the base to the summit; and if the diameter be measured at
                    different epochs, it will be seen, as Kaempfer had already remarked, not to
                    increase. The palm, therefore, is a regular column, whose summit is crowned with
                    leaves, disposed above each other circularly: those which grow in spring shoot
                    always from the top; the older ones, placed below, dry, and when they fall leave
                    circular impressions, which furrow the surface of the stem, and mark its years
                    until it has ceased to grow.</p>
                <p>If next we examine the interior, we discover, as Μ. Desfontaines thinks, the true
                    reason why the stem rises in a column, and does not, like other trees, yearly
                    augment in size. This was done by Μ. Daubenton, who states that every leaf of
                    the date-palm, in proceeding from the bud, is formed by a prolongation of the
                    vascular fasciculi and cellular tissue which exist in the trunk of the tree, as
                    is apparent in the petiole of the recent leaves, and of the dried ones that
                    adhere to the trunk. The elongation of the trunk is produced, therefore, by the
                    leaves which annually proceed from it; and as the parts which form these leaves
                    spring from the centre, they always, as they shoot, force the older leaves
                    outwards. Hence, therefore, as the augmentation of these trees originates at the
                    centre, all the parts capable of displacement must be pushed outwards, just as
                    the new layers of bark and wood, formed annually in ordinary trees, force
                    outward the older layers of bark exterior to them.</p>
                <p>In these latter trees, continues Μ. Daubenton, the recession of the bark has no
                    limits so long as new parts continue to be formed beneath it, because the new
                    cortical layers are flexible, and the older ones readily break and give way; but
                    in the palm the substance of the trunk has more compactness as we approach the
                    circumference, and, at a certain point of density, it no longer yields to the
                    central force of the interior parts; so that when this point is reached, no
                    further enlargement takes place; and hence the date-palm scarcely exceeds ten
                    inches diameter. It is for similar reasons that the trunk of the date-palm is of
                    the same size through its entire length; for, in proportion as the tree rises,
                    the exterior parts of the trunk lose successively their flexibility; and when
                    they have acquired a certain degree of density they no longer yield to the force
                    from within; and as this is equally the case in all parts, the trunk is
                    necessarily of the same size throughout. <hi rend="italic">(Mėm. de ľlnstit.

                <p>It is further evident that, in this mode of growth, no appearance of concentric
                    circles, similar to those of ordinary trees, can have place; for, by the growth
                    at the centre, the exterior vessels are continually displaced from their
                    original positions, are more and more compressed as they are forced towards the
                    circumference, and present in their transverse section that irregular
                    distribution which they have been described to possess. Hence the cylindrical
                    figure and the absence of concentric layers are as necessary consequences of the
                    mode of growth in these trees, as the presence of those layers and the conical
                    figure are of the mode of growth in ordinary trees. The greater solidity of the
                    parts at the circumference is clearly to be ascribed to the same cause; and even
                    the want of regular transverse partitions must in part also have, a similar
                    origin, and be ascribed, perhaps, in part to the smaller number of vessels which
                    these plants possess, as well as to their irregular distribution. From this
                    difference in their mode of growth, these two great divisions have received
                    different names: those which, like our ordinary trees, augment in size by the
                    deposition of new matter near the surface, are named Exogenous; and those which,
                    like palms, grow from within, ' Endogenous.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Bark or Cortical Texture.</hi></p>
                <p>This texture, in its component parts, resembles that of the wood, being made up,
                    like it, of vessels and cellular tissue intimately connected with each other.
                    Its structure, as a distinct texture, is best characterized in the bark of
                    ordinary trees, as it is there separated, in a great measure, from the ligneous
                    texture. As in these plants a new layer of vessels is annually made to the wood,
                    so a similar but much thinner layer is yearly added to the bark, to which the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">liber</hi> has commonly been applied. These vessels
                    are at first straight, and run parallel to the axis of the trunk; but, by the
                    successive formation of new layers beneath them, they are gradually forced
                    outward, become separated more and more from each other, and, touching in a few
                    points only, exhibit at length a reticulated figure (see fig. 24, Plate XXXVΠL),
                    the meshes of which yearly augment in size, from the greater space over which
                    they are continually spread.</p>
                <p>Between the vessels thus annually formed, a considerable portion of cellular
                    tissue is interposed, which, in the young and succulent state of parts,
                    contributes chiefly to the thickness of the bark. This tissue is variously
                    compressed by the vessels, so as to form <hi rend="italic">transverse</hi>
                    partitions between them, which, in the vine, the oak, and many other trees, as
                    both Grew and Malpighi remarked, are seen to be continuous with those of the
                    wood; and in this way the two textures are united together. In the expressive
                    language of Grew, the bark, therefore, does not “merely surround the wood as a
                    scabbard does a sword, or a glove the haņd, but is truly continuous with it, as
                    the skin of the body is with the flesh.” In the willow and other trees, when
                    full of sap, the bark is so easily separated that it seems to have no connection
                    with the wood; but this is supposed by Grew to arise merely from the extreme
                    fineness and tenderness of the vessels that are annually formed in that part,
                    and which on that account oppose no obstacle to the separation. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 129.) It is probable, however, that the
                    cellular tissue forms the only direct connection between the cortical and
                    ligneous textures; and that, if a vascular communication exist, it is only, as
                    in all other cases, through the medium of that tissue.</p>
                <p>Besides the transverse compression which the cellular tissue experiences from the
                    vessels, it is compressed in: the opposite direction by the formation of the new
                    layers of bark and wood beneath the older bark. These in the progress of their
                    growth exert an expansive force outwards, so that the cells of the tissue are
                    made to assume an oblong or flattened form in the direction of the vessels of
                    the trunk, or sometimes to form a thin <hi rend="italic">fascia</hi> upon the
                    vessels, in which the cellular character is nearly or entirely obliterated. It
                    is by the continued exertion of this force acting on the exterior and desiccated
                    layers that these, latter ultimately crack, producing figures of different
                    sizes, which have frequently the shape of rhombs, the fissures of which
                    represent, according to Grew, the position and track of the vessels in their
                    reticulations. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 129.) The spaces or
                    meshes formed by these reticulations are always filled up by cellular tissue,
                    which, in the opinion of Malpighi, originates from the vessels themselves.</p>
                <p>Both in the vessels and cells of this texture, collections <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096393?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6393-0064"/> of the “proper
                    juices” frequently occur; especially in plants in which these juices are of a
                    viscid nature, and disposed to concrete; as was before remarked, when treating
                    of the proper vessels. Similar collections of matter, originally existing in the
                    bark, are likewise met with in every layer of wood, and even in the pith of
                    certain trees. It is only in plants in which the “proper juices” are coļoured,
                    or disposed to concrete, that this intermixture of the cortical and ligneous
                    textures has been traced through the whole substance of the tree; but it is
                    probable, from the conjunction of the vessels of the bark and wood at the period
                    of their formation, that it is common to other plants, the nature and properties
                    of whose juices afford no clew to its detection.</p>
                <p>In most herbaceous plants, the cortical texture is not so clearly distinguished
                    from the ligneous, since in them the greatest variety obtains both in regard to
                    the number and relative position of the sap and “proper vessels ;” and very
                    frequently the cellular tissue is quite continuous and of uniform appearance
                    through the entire substance of the plant. In general, however, the sap-vessels
                    occupy the inner place, and are surrounded by the “proper vessels,” disposed
                    either in rings or distinct fasciculi, more or fewer in number. Sometimes the
                    sap-vessels seem to be placed exterior to the others; and hence it is difficult
                    to discover the true place of the “proper vessels” in such plants, unless the
                    nature of their juices conduct to it. From the position of the vessels,
                    therefore, it is often difficult to define the boundaries of the cortical and
                    ligneous textures; and, for the reason already assigned, the cellular tissue
                    rarely affords much assistance. According, however, to the number and
                    disposition of the vessels, this tissue, even in these plants, suffers a certain
                    degree of compression, so as to form thickened boundaries around the fasciculi,
                    or sometimes large transverse partitions, which communicate with those of the
                    wood, in which, though the figure of the cells is more or less altered, the
                    cellular character is usually preserved.</p>
                <p>In other plants, the intermixture of “proper vessels” with those that carry sap
                    seems to be general through the whole plant; and consequently no distinction can
                    be made between the ligneous and cortical textures. In such plants the “proper
                    juices” must be considered to exist in every part; and accordingly Malpighi, as
                    we before remarked, points out a <hi rend="italic">vas proprium,</hi> or “proper
                    vessel,” as accompanying every fasciculus of vessels in different species of
                    wheat. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 24.) From the similarity of
                    structure in palms, and especially from their mode of growth, there can be
                    little doubt that a similar intermixture of the two kinds of vessels prevails
                    everywhere in them; and with respect to these plants, what has already been said
                    of the construction of the ligneous texture, is equally applicable to that of
                    the bark.</p>
                <p>We have thus given a very brief and general view of the principal textures that
                    enter into the construction of plants, and pointed out the more prominent
                    diversities of character and appearance which they exhibit, as well in their
                    simple as in their more complex forms, and as they exist either separately or
                    variously intermingled together. Our descriptions have been confined entirely to
                    the trunk or stem; but, with slight variation, they are applicable; equally to
                    the root and branch, in which a similar combination of the elementary organs
                    obtains. In the root, however, they commonly exist in a more compressed and
                    compacted form, so that the ligneous texture is seen chiefly to predominate,
                    frequently to the entire exclusion of the pith, and often in great part also to
                    that of the cellular portion of the bark. This, however, is not universal,
                    especially in annual plants, some of which, as the carrot and others,
                    particularly in a cultivated state, are distinguished by the very large portion
                    of cellular tissue which enters into the construction of the cortical texture.
                    Of the modifications of these several textures, as they exist in leaves and
                    other organs, we shall have occasion to speak when we come to treat of them
                    individually.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Connection subsisting between the Vessels and Cells in
                    the several Textures.</hi></p>
                <p>In our discussion of these several textures, we have noticed only in a general
                    way the direct means by which the vessels and cells that construct them are
                    connected with each other; but, when treating of the sapvessels, of the
                    absorbent vessels, and of the cellular tissue, we endeavoured to show that an
                    universal communication obtains between these elementary organs, and
                    consequently inferred that some mode of connection, by which it can be
                    accomplished, must have place. Grew considered the vascular and cellular parts
                    to be connected with each other, not only by the transverse partitions of
                    cellular substance that intercept the vessels, but “<hi rend="italic">ļìer
                    mini-mas partes</hi><hi rend="italic">organicas</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    that is to say, the parenchymous fibres are wrapped round about the vessels, or
                    at least interwoven with them, and with every fibre of every vessel, as in very
                    white ash or fir wood may be observed.” <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi>
                    p. 121.) These fibres Grew elsewhere considers as vessels, and consequently must
                    be regarded as maintaining a vascular connection between these organs. In a
                    description of the young branches of chesnut and oak, Malpighi delineates minute
                    filaments springing on every side from the vessels of the wood, and continued
                    into the adjacent cellular tissue <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 27);
                    but he does not state whether they are to be regarded as vessels or simple
                    fibres. He elsewhere describes minute vessels as surrounding the cells of the
                    trunk like a network, and thinks it probable that the cells of the transverse
                    septa are similarly furnished with vessels. In the cells of the pith of elder
                    <hi rend="italic">(sambucus),</hi> and of some other plants, the vessels are
                    very abundant, and in every case are probably derived from the straight ligneous
                    fibres (vessels) both of the bark and wood. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p.
                    29.) Indeed he held it probable that the nutrient fluids moving through the
                    vessels were in all parts poured into the cells, and there undergoing a certain
                    preparation, were afterwards mixed with more recent juices, and with them taken
                    up and applied to the support of the young buds and leaves. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.</hi> p. 30.) This doctrine has since been held by Darwin and Knight, and
                    it necessarily supposes a vascular connection between the vessels and the cells,
                    by which the functions both of secretion and absorption can be performed. The
                    microscopical observations of Leeu-wenhoeck, already noticed, supply further
                    evidence in support of this opinion.</p>
                <p>In the hypothesis of Mirbel both cells and vessels are considered as formed out
                    of one and the same membrane. He rejects, therefore, the aid of all intermediate
                    organs as necessary to connect them together, and supposes a communication to be
                    everywhere maintained between the vessels and cells, by the medium of pores in
                    their sides. As, however, these pores are nowhere proved to have existence but
                    in the imagination of the author, we may altogether reject their agency in
                    maintaining a communication between the vessels and cells of plants. In the
                    opinion of Μ. Kieser, the conjunction of the cells with the vessels is extremely
                    simple, the sides of the cells, says he, being contiguous to the sides of the
                    vessels. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi

                    mere contiguity of parts does not amount to connection, much less does it afford
                    any information concerning the actual commuhica-tion<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096406?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6406-0065"/> that exists
                    between these organs. In addition, therefore, to connection by cellular
                    substance, it seems abso- 'lutely necessary to suppose also the existence of a
                    vascular structure, which shall at once serve as a medium both of connection and
                    communication.</p>
                <p>Before concluding this branch of the subject, we may observe that the structure
                    <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the cellular tissue, and its relation to the vascular
                    system in plants, appear, in many points, to resemble that of the adipose cells,
                    and their relation to the vascular system of animals. These cells are described
                    as minute close cavities, possessing no apparent communication with each other;
                    and within them adipose matter is alternately deposited and removed. Now the
                    deposition of this matter could only be accomplished by secreting vessels which
                    terminated in the cells, and its removal be effected by absorbents which
                    originated from them; and accordingly both blood-vessels and absorbents are
                    found to be present in this texture; but neither the secreting nor absorbing
                    orifices have ever been actually observed. Within the cells of the cellular
                    tissue of plants the alternate deposition and removal of various matters are not
                    less certain; and in the germinating seed the matter that actually existed in
                    the cells is found afterwards in the vessels. We are led, therefore, or rather
                    we arc driven, not only by the direct exclusion of all other alleged means of
                    communication, but by a close analogy in the exercise of these animal and
                    vegetable functions, to conclude, that secreting and absorbing vessels must be
                    employed to deposit and remove the secreted matter from the cells of plants, in
                    the same way as they are considered to effect similar depositions and removals
                    of adipose matter from the cells of animals: and as this alternate function
                    seems to go on in every part of the plant capable of active vegetation, it may
                    further be inferred that a vascular communication exists between the vessels and
                    cells in all parts of the vegetable system.</p>
                <p>By means of this general communication between the vessels and the cells, we are
                    enabled to assign satisfactory reasons for some puzzling phenomena, which have
                    occurred in relation to the movements of the sap. It is by this alternate action
                    of secretion and absorption that in young plants we must suppose the cells of
                    the pith, during the first year, to be filled with fluid, and to be rendered dry
                    for the most part ever after. In like manner, the surface of the bark in contact
                    with the wood appears in some trees, as the birch, to be rendered moist during
                    the rise of the sap in spring; which led Dr Walker and others to suppose that
                    the sap rose in part between the bark and the wood,—an opinion not at all
                    probable in itself, and certainly not supported by what is observed in most
                    other trees. The fact, however, is easily explicable, on the supposition that
                    the sap was transfused from the alburnous vessels of the wood, in the same
                    manner as, at a later period, it is secreted in the same part, but in a
                    different form, by the vessels of the bark, to form the new matter that is
                    annually added to the tree.</p>
                <p>That the sap of plants was capable of moving in a <hi rend="italic">lateral</hi>
                    direction, was inferred by Malpighi, from the fact that parts lived and grew
                    when the perpendicular vessels that supplied them with nutriment had been
                    destroyed. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 13.) The experiments of
                    Hales afford more decisive evidence regarding this lateral movement of the sap.
                    He cut two large gaps in the opposite sides of an oak-branch, at four inches
                    distance from each other, carrying the incisions down to the pith: the branch
                    nevertheless absorbed and perspired water, but only in half the quantity that
                    another similar but uncut branch did. In a branch of cherry-tree he made four
                    similar cņts down to the pith, at four inches distance from each other, and
                    opposed to the four points of the compass: the branch notwithstanding absorbed,
                    in forty-eight hours, twenty-four ounces of water. <hi rend="italic">( Veg.
                    Statics,</hi> p. 128, 3d edit.) And when similar incisions were made on branches
                    while still attached to the tree; their leaves continued green nearly as long as
                    those of other branches in a natural state; whence he justly inferred that, at
                    these gaps made in the branch, a lateral movement of the sap must have taken
                    place. Experiments of a similar nature have been made, and like results
                    obtained, by Mr Knight <hi rend="italic">(Phil. Trans.</hi> 1808); so that it
                    seems clear that in certain circumstances a lateral movement of the sap must
                    have place.</p>
                <p>In what manner, then, must we suppose this movement to be accomplished? Grew
                    supposed the cellular tissue, that stretches from the circumference to the
                    centre of the plant, to be the organ by which such a communication could be
                    maintained; but the impermeability of this tissue to fluids opposes such an
                    opinion. Malpighi thought the lateral communication to be made by an <hi
                    rend="italic">anastomosis</hi> of vessels; but in the vessels of plants no such
                    mode of communication appears to exist. From the ascent of the sap in branches
                    in which the vessels had been thus previously cut through, Mr Knight infers that
                    this fluid does not rise in the vessels at all, but is conveyed through the
                    cellular tissue. This opinion necessarily implies the permeability of this
                    tissue by fluids, which, as we have shown, is contradicted by direct experiment,
                    as well as by microscopical observation. Since, therefore, this lateral movement
                    of the sap cannot be accomplished, either by simple percolation through the
                    cells or vessels, or by direct anastomosis of the vessels with one another, no
                    other known means of effecting it remain, but those of alternate deposition and
                    absorption by the vessels into and from the cells. And if, as we have seen, the
                    sap-vessels of plants deposit coloured fluids in the cells, which the capillary
                    absorbents of parasitic plants are able to take up, there seems no reason for
                    denying to the vascular productions, which have been supposed everywhere to
                    spring from the perpendicular vessels, a like capacity of absorbing fluids from
                    the adjacent cells. These fluids must, however, in all cases, have been
                    deposited before they could be absorbed; and, by the alternate exercise of these
                    functions, there is no difficulty in conceiving how a lateral movement of the
                    sap might be accomplished in parts where, by the incision of the vessels, a stop
                    was necessarily put to its perpendicular ascent.</p>

                    the Skin.</hi></p>
                <p>The skin, rind, cuticle, or epidermis, as it has been variously named, is the
                    last of the common textures that remains to be described. It is the general
                    envelope which invests all parts of the plant and all its productions, being
                    equally common to the trunk and branches, the root, the leaves, the flowers, and
                    the fruit; but in these different parts, and even in similar parts of different
                    plants, it exhibits the greatest diversity of appearance and form.</p>
                <p>In herbaceous plants, and in the young shoots of those; which are arborescent, it
                    resembles a thin membrane, but∣ is generally thicker on the stem than on' the
                    roots or leaves. In some leaves, however, it is thick and dense, as is the case
                    also in several fruits, and is thereby fitted ι to resist the effects of too
                    rapid desiccation. On the upper surface of some leaves, on many fruits, and on
                    roots, it is an entire membrane, destitute of any apertures <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096419?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6419-0066"/> or pores; but
                    on many stems on the under surfaces of leaves, and sometimes on the upper, it is
                    frequently furnished with numerous pores, often visible to the naked eye, and
                    with other luminous points of smaller dimensions, which Du Hamel also regards as
                    apertures. It is readily separable from the bark in recent and succulent parts,
                    or after maceration in water; and in certain leaves it is very completely
                    separated by a species of caterpillar, named by Reaumur the <hi rend="italic"
                    >miner.</hi> It appears then to be a thin transparent membrane, often destitute
                    of colour, and deriving, therefore, its appearance from the colour of the parts
                    beneath; but both in leaves and flowers it is often itself coloured. It is
                    frequently seen to extend in all its dimensions, in common with the parts it
                    covers. Very often, too, as will be noticed hereafter, its surface is covered
                    with hairs; and sometimes small follicles or utricles are met with, which
                    exercise a glandular function.</p>
                <p>The characters above enumerated belong chiefly to the cuticle in its young and
                    succulent state. In perennial plants it commonly possesses others that are quite
                    dissimilar. It is of a different colour not only on different trees, but on
                    different parts of the same tree. It is white and shining on the trunk of the
                    birch, and browner on the branches; greyish on the plum-tree; red and silvery on
                    the cherry; green on the young branches of the peach; and ash-coloured on the
                    larger branches. In these and many other instances it does not, says Du Hamel,
                    merely participate in the colour of the body it covers, but contributes itself
                    to give colour to the exterior bark; for when it is stripped off, the substance
                    below has frequently a different colour. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 10.) By the gradual enlargement of the
                    trunk it is stretched and dried, and at length loses its vitality, and, as well
                    as the bark beneath, is variously cracked and broken. Before this happens,
                    however, it often undergoes considerable extension in all its dimensions,
                    enlarging in breadth, and stretching longitudinally over the young shoots. This
                    expanded state is particularly remarkable in certain fruits, in which, when they
                    enlarge slowly, the cuticle is extended without rupture to a very large size;
                    but if the expansion be very rapid, as after considerable rains, the cuticle
                    then gives way. In certain trees the cuticle is more susceptible of expansion
                    than in others; and in very vigorous trees it breaks more slowly than in those
                    whose growth is languishing, although these latter push forward more slowly than
                    the former. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 11.) In some vigorous trees of this
                    description it altogether resists rupture; and in this state the tree is often
                    said to be hide-bound or barkbound.</p>
                <p>In most instances the cuticle, when taken from young branches, appears to consist
                    of a single layer; but on the branches of many species, says Du Hamel, after one
                    plate or layer has been removed, another may be seen beneath, which resembles
                    the former in its texture, but is much thinner and more green and succulent.
                    From the birchtree he has removed more than six layers, very thin and very
                    distinct from each other, and is of opinion that more might still be separated.
                    Sometimes the original cuticle seems to be entirely thrown off, and the exterior
                    eovering is formed by a portion of the cellular tissue of the bark. Grew thinks
                    that this substitution takes place annually, the older skin being cast off, like
                    the skin of an adder, by the generation of a new one beneath. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 114.) Du Hamel describes also the existence of small
                    leaflets or scales, which are continually detached from the cuticle of some
                    trees; and these he considers to be as constantly replaced, by the formation of
                    new ones beneath them.</p>
                <p>• Concerning the regeneration of the. cuticle on parts from which it has been
                    removed, Du Hamel observes, that when the wound is covered with waxed cloth, a
                    new cuticle is promptly formed without any separation of a portion of the bark
                    beneath. When the exterior portion of the bark is removed with the skin, the
                    inner part of it is equally capable of regenerating a cuticle; but if the wound
                    be not protected from the air, a certain degree of exfoliation first occurs,
                    and, under the decayed parts, a new skin forms. Even where the bark of a
                    cherry-tree was entirely removed from the trunk, he found that the wood was
                    capable of regenerating a new bark and cuticle, if the parts were properly
                    protected from the air. This cuticle did not originate from that which remained
                    on the roots and branches, but was reproduced in isolated portions on different
                    parts of the trunk; it continued, however, after the lapse of fifteen years,
                    always different from that of the natural growth. In other instances, he adds,
                    the cuticle does not seem to be regenerated at all. He remarks certain analogies
                    to exist between the cuticle in some plants and in animals. In both, he adds, it
                    seems in certain circumstances capable of great extension; inboth it is easily
                    regenerated, and that too in isolated portions, and not by continuity of organs,
                    as is common in other instances; and in both, lastly, it is perpetually
                    obliterated, and continually and imperceptibly renewed. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,
                    des</hi><hi rend="italic">Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 11.)</p>
                <p>With respect to the nature of the cuticle, very different opinions have been
                    advanced, and still continue to prevail. Are we to regard it as a peculiar
                    organ, formed immediately by the proper exercise of the vegetative functions, or
                    is it produced in a sort of secondary manner, by some changes induced on some
                    previously constructed organ? Grew asserted it to be sometimes original, and in
                    some instances produced out of the exterior layer of the cortical texture
                    beneath it; and this first view of its origin seems to be generally supported by
                    the descriptive character which has been assigned to it. Its co-existence with
                    the first traces of vegetable organization, its continued growth and expansion,
                    and its subsequent regeneration after removal, all seem to favour its primary
                    and independent origin, which is also supported by investigations into its
                    minute structure. Mirbel, however, and some other writers, after Hill, have
                    regarded it, in all cases, not as an original membrane, but formed by the
                    exterior sides of the common tissue of the plant; and where there is no
                    separation of these sides in the form of a membrane, such plants are held to be
                    destitute of a cuticle. <hi rend="italic">(Exposiŧ. de ľ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Organisât.</hi><hi rend="italic">Végét.</hi> p. 103.)</p>
                <p>Another question relating to this organ is, whether it must be considered a
                    simple membrane of uniform structure, or a compound of two distinct parts, like
                    the true skin and the cuticle in animals. Grew seems to have regarded it as a
                    simple body, but constructed both of vessels and cells, the cells being
                    continuous with those of the bark. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p.
                    62.) Such, too, seems to have been nearly the opinion of Malpighi, who describes
                    it as constructed of horizontal ranges of cells, but often delineates
                    reticulations of vessels as constituting a part of its structure. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 2, 19.) In the birch, the plum, the
                    cherry-tree, and others, Du Hamel declares the component fibres of the cuticle
                    to possess a direction transverse to that of the trunk; but this is not general.
                    In the birch-tree the fibres seemed to be placed parallel to each other, and to
                    be connected together by lateral fibres; but he could see nothing of the
                    vesicular structure of Malpighi and Grew, and therefore regards the structure of
                    this texture to be altogether fibrous. <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des</hi><hi

                    thin plate of parchment, and perforated by imperceptible pores, which give issue
                    to the insensible transpiration. Its structure he regards as unknown, but
                    considers it capable of regeneration. (Jfe⅝. ¢fe <hi rend="italic">ľlnstit.

                <p>Μ. Kιeser, who professes to have studied this texture with great attention,
                    adopts nearly the opinion of Grew, pronouncing the cuticle to be constructed of
                    a very fine cellular tissue, and of extremely minute vessels which run through
                    its whole extent. These vessels form an exceedingly delicate and subtile
                    net-work, the meshes of which possess very different forms, and their vessels
                    terminate at the orifice of a pore. His observations were made on the cuticle of
                    leaves. On the inferior surface of the leaf of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Amaryllis</hi><hi rend="italic">formosissima</hi> (fig. 14, A, Plate XLI.),
                    magnified 260 times, these vascular meshes of the cuticle have an elongated
                    hexagonal form; and four of their vessels proceed always to terminate at the
                    orifice of the little oblong aperture or pore situated at their junction. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Canna</hi><hi rend="italic">Indica,</hi> the vessels of the meshes
                    on the lower part of the leaf, which thus terminate in the pores, are said to
                    originate from a fasciculus of the spiral vessels that ramify through the leaf,
                    as is represented at <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> in fig. 14, B, Plate XLI.; and
                    within the areas of the larger meshes a still finer net-work of vessels is seen.
                    On the inferior surface of the leaf of a species of fern, the vessels of the
                    cuticle, instead of forming meshes of different figures, exhibit the appearance
                    of sinuous lines, which run in every direction through the cuticle. See fig. 15,
                    Plate XLI. which represents the central part of the little adjoining leaf,
                    magnified 130 times. These sinuous vessels often join, and, after making a
                    half-circle, terminate by one extremity in the minute pores everywhere spread
                    over the leaf, and by the other in the larger vascular fasciculi that ramify
                    through it. At the letter <hi rend="italic">b',</hi> in this figure, the
                    hexagonal cells that construct the parenchyma of the leaf are distinctly visible
                    through the vascular sinuosities of the cuticle. It was by the examination of
                    this leaf that Μ. Kieser was first enabled to discover the origin and
                    termination of the vessels that construct the cuticle, having in all his
                    previous investigations examined the cuticle in its separated state, after it
                    was detached from its connection with the other organs; but the researches made
                    on this leaf rendered every thing clear. (<hi rend="italic">Mém. sur</hi><hi

                <p>The vascular net-work of the cuticle, thus described by Μ. Kieser and others, had
                    been regarded as a deception by Μ. Krocker, who considered these reticulated
                    figures as no part of the real structure of the cuticle, but merely as the sides
                    of the subjacent cells; in which opinion Sprengel, Link, Jurine, and Mirbel,
                    concurred; but Μ. Kieser, in opposition to this opinion, maintains that, in the
                    fern and other leaves, the real cellular structure of the parenchyma is seen
                    entire through the vascular reticulations of the cuticle, with the meshes of
                    which the sides of the subjacent cells do not anywhere coincide. He observes
                    that these cells are commonly much smaller than the vascular meshes which cover
                    them; and that the vessels of these meshes may be traced, as before remarked, to
                    the larger fasciculi that construct the leaf. In the fern the vascular structure
                    of the cuticle is the same on both sides of the leaf, but the superior side does
                    not possess pores.</p>
                <p>A very different view of the structure of the cuticle was taken by the late
                    celebrated Μ. de Saussure. He regarded it not as a simple, but a compound
                    texture, consisting of a very delicate external pellicle or membrane, beneath
                    which was placed a net-work of very fine vessels. Γhe external membrane he
                    describes as perforated by pores of unequal figure, between which he observed
                    some opaque and tortuous filaments, disposed in a reticulated manner, each mesh
                    being formed by six filaments, four of which terminated at each pore. To this
                    arrangement of .filaments he gave the name of cortical net-work, and regarded it
                    as quite distinct from the cuticle that covered it. The meshes of this net-work
                    differ much in size and figure in different leaves; and, when minutely examined,
                    they are often seen to form junctions, but never to cross each other; whence he
                    was led to regard them as vessels derived from those of the expanded petiole,
                    and thus constituting a very fine vascular net-work. A similar structure was
                    observed in the petals of the flower. <hi rend="italic">(Encyclop. Method,</hi>
                    tome i. p. 67.)</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle considers the cuticle in certain parts to be a simple and proper
                    membrane; in other parts to be formed by layers of cellular tissue. The cuticle
                    of leaves, and probably of all annual shoots, appears to be formed of a layer of
                    flattened cells, differing in form and in other conditions from those of the
                    parenchyma of the leaf. It may be regarded in this state as a proper membrane.
                    When stripped off and examined by the microscope, it exhibits small spaces,
                    bounded by lines or rays, or a sort of net-work, the meshes of which have
                    different figures in different plants. The lines, says he, appear in the form of
                    single or double filaments, and may be considered hollow, and as forming a
                    system of cuticular vessels which terminate in the pores. In more advanced age,
                    and especially in the trunks of old trees, this primitive cuticle gradually
                    changes its character, and finally disappears. It is then succeeded by a thicker
                    membrane, which no longer exhibits the net-like figure of the former, and
                    appears evidently to be formed by the exterior cells of the cellular tissue,
                    which, by the combined effects of distention and desiccation, assume a
                    membranous appearance, to which the term <hi rend="italic">epidermis</hi> is
                    properly applicable. This epidermis may be considered single when composed of
                    one layer of cells, and double, triple, or multiple, when formed of two or more
                    successive layers. It is thus that Ulloa, in describing a tree in Peru, speaks
                    of having detached more than 150 epidermoidal layers, when he lost all patience
                    in counting them, seeing that he had not then reached to half the thickness of
                    the bark. A similar appearance is exhibited in the numerous layers that form the
                    epidermis of the white birch, amounting sometimes to 15 or 18 in advanced age,
                    and which ends by breaking into that cracked condition of the bark that presents
                    only discontinuous portions of white epidermis on the remnants of its cellular
                    envelope. At an early period the cuticle is most easily torn in a longitudinal
                    direction, which is that of its growth; but at a later period, when the
                    diametral growth has increased, the cells of the tissue are drawn out more in
                    that direction, and therefore more readily break transversely than in length.

                    Skin.</hi></p>
                <p>The pores of the cuticle, called sometimes cortical or miliary glands, sometimes
                    exhaling pores, sometimes cortical pores, and more lately, by Link and De
                    Candolle, <hi rend="italic">stomata,</hi> were first noticed by Grew, who
                    describes many orifices as existing on the leaves of different plants, which
                    vary in size, number, shape, and position. In the white lily they are of an oval
                    shape, of a white colour; and each is surrounded by a slender border. When
                    viewed through a good glass they appear as if standing about one sixth or one
                    eighth of an inch apart all over the leaf, but not arranged in any regular
                    order. In the pine, also, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096445?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6445-0068"/> they have an oval shape, but have no rising
                    border, and are arranged in lines from one end of the leaf to the 'other. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 153.) Hedwig considered the borders
                    mentioned by Grew as produced by a ring of one or more vessels, which terminated
                    in the pore. Ιhe number of pores he represents as exceedingly great. In the
                    square of a line of the cuticle of a bulbous lily he reckoned 577 pores.</p>
                <p>The characters and position of these pores or stomata have been further examined
                    by Μ. de Candolle on more than GOO plants. They occur most frequently on the
                    leaves, occupying both surfaces in some herbs, and in trees chiefly the inferior
                    surface. Stems in general have no pores, except, as in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gramineoe,</hi> where they are succulent, and have the character of leaves; or
                    where the plant is altogether destitute of leaves, as the Cactus. On the
                    prominent lines or vessels of the leaves and stems no pores are to be seen, but
                    only in the grooves or depressed surfaces of the parenchyma. They are never
                    observed on the root, not even on bulbous roots, where the scales of the bulb
                    are true leaves. The small leaflets called <hi rend="italic">stipulae</hi> and
                    <hi rend="italic">bracteoe</hi> sometimes have and sometimes have not pores. The
                    <hi rend="italic">calices of</hi> the flower in general have pores, but the
                    petals have not. Pericarps of a foliaceous consistence have pores: when fleshy,
                    they are destitute of them. The envelopes of the seed are destitute of pores,
                    but they are found on all seminal leaves that rise above the ground. The lower
                    tribes of vegetables, as the <hi rend="italic">fuci,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >musci,</hi><hi rend="italic">hepatic(e, fungi,</hi> &amp;c. are destitute of
                    pores.</p>
                <p>The occurrence of pores in those plants where they are found seems to be much
                    influenced by external circum- &gt; stances. They are never met with but on
                    vegetables, and those parts of vegetables that are exposed to the air; and
                    therefore the internal surfaces of many leaves that embrace the stem are without
                    pores, though on the external surfaces of the same leaves they are abundant. No
                    plant that is completely aquatic, nor any part of it that is habitually under
                    water, is provided with these organs; but the parts which rise above the water
                    are furnished with them. In <hi rend="italic">ranunculus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >aquaticus</hi> the leaves that are constantly under water are destitute of
                    pores, while those that float on the surface are provided with them, but only on
                    their superior face. Even leaves which do not naturally possess pores when under
                    water, acquire them if they are made to grow in air; and land plants, on the
                    contrary, when made to grow under water, may, by such treatment, be deprived of
                    their pores. Thus, the leaf of green mint, when growing in air, possesses not
                    fewer than 1800 pores on its lower surface; but if kept for a month under water,
                    its leaves fall, and the new ones that succeed are destitute of pores.</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> Light seems to be necessary also to the production
                    of pores, for etiolated plants do not possess them. When grown by the light of
                    lamps, the leaves possess a few pores; and, in all cases, the parts secluded
                    from light and air are destitute of these organs, but acquire them if they are
                    duly exposed. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. de īlnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 351.)</p>
                <p>This general account of the pores of plants is confirmed by the researches of Μ.
                    Rudolphi. In most herbaceous plants he found the pores to occupy both sides of
                    the leaf, but in trees only the inferior surface. They were not often met with
                    on the parts of the flowers, or on fruits; they were never seen on roots, nor on
                    the trunks of trees; nor ever on aquatic plants, except on such parts as were
                    raised above the water. The lower tribes of vegetables seemed to be universally
                    destitute of them; the leaves also of those plants that were covered thickly
                    with hairs on both sides had no pores. The form of the pores was commonly oval
                    or elliptical, but in a few instances square or rhomboidal. In size they very
                    much varied in different plants, but in the same plant the size was uniform. The
                    largest pores were seen on the leaf of the white lily,’ the smallest on that of
                    the French bean. (Kieser’s <hi rend="italic">Mém.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >sur</hi><hi rend="italic">ľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Organisât, des</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Plantes,</hi> p. 144.)</p>
                <p>Although the pores are generally dispersed over the parenchyma of leaves at
                    nearly equal distances, yet where the vessels run parallel, they are disposed in
                    one or more lines between them. Sometimes, again, they are collected into little
                    clusters, as in the leaves of <hi rend="italic">crassula</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >cordata,</hi> where the roundish dots or points, visible by the naked eye, are
                    clusters of pores or stomata. This appearance suggested to Μ. de Candolle the
                    idea that the stomata might be the orifices of vessels, as each of the little
                    points mentioned above is the termination of a fibre, which is itself a bundle
                    of vessels. This idea is further strengthened by the fact that these pores are
                    not found in plants that are destitute of vessels; and though he could never
                    trace the continuity of a vessel with a pore, yet Μ. Com-paretti assures us he
                    has seen the vessels terminate in them. Mirbel, on the other hand, considers the
                    pores to be the orifices of cells; and Kieser regards them as connected with the
                    intercellular canals. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. chap.
                    6.)</p>
                <p>Some have considered the pores as organs, by which the resinous or waxy matter
                    found on certain leaves is exhaled; others, as organs for the absorption and
                    transpiration of air or gas; and others, with more probability, as those by
                    which moisture is thrown off by the leaf. In support of this last opinion, it
                    may be stated that pores exist in all leafy parts that transpire, and are more
                    numerous in membranous leaves that transpire most, than in fleshy leaves which
                    transpire little. They are wanting altogether in aquatic leaves and in etiolated
                    leaves; also in fleshy fruits, in roots, and in the petals of flowers, which do
                    not transpire in any degree analogous to leaves. In darkness too, when
                    transpiration ceases, the pores are closed; and they again open and transpire
                    when light reappears, and especially in bright sunshine. It is always necessary
                    to distinguish the evaporation, more or less great, that goes on through the
                    tissue in all organs by day and by night, from the active transpiration which
                    occurs in sunshine, but only in organs furnished with pores, and which seems to
                    be executed by them.</p>
                <p>Besides transpiration, Μ. de Candolle believes that, in certain cases, the pores
                    may also serve for <hi rend="italic">absorption;</hi> but this he considers to
                    be rarely the case, and out of the natural course of vegetation; and that the
                    experiments which favour this opinion may be explained by the hygroscopic powers
                    of the vegetable tissue. He thinks the results obtained by Bonnet, who kept
                    leaves a long time in life by laying their porous surfaces on water, may be
                    explained by supposing this treatment to prevent decay by checking
                    transpiration, rather than by promoting absorption. <hi rend="italic">(Organog.
                    Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 87.) This suggestion will not, however, explain the
                    phenomena of an experiment continued for many years in the conservatories of the
                    Royal Botanic Garden here, under the care of Mr Macnab. He has kept a species of
                    fig <hi rend="italic">(ficus elastică)</hi> for several years fastened against
                    the wall, with its roots, stem, and branches entirely exposed to the air; and in
                    that situation it has not only lived, but actually grown in every part, so as to
                    have increased greatly in size, only by being thus kept in a warm and moist
                    atmosphere, and occasionally sprinkled with water.</p>
                <p>In addition to these visible pores, it is probable, says! Μ. de Candolle, that
                    the surface of vegetables is furnished! with others that are invisible, but so
                    small that with the strongest microscopes we are unable to recognise them: <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096458?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6458-0069"/>
                    their existence, therefore, can only be presumed from physiological phenomena.
                    Thus, a part of a vegetable destitute of pores loses weight when exposed to the
                    air, by the escape of the fluid it contained; or a portion of moss equally
                    destitute of pores, if placed in water, speedily acquires additional weight.
                    Whether these results are obtained through the medium of minute pores, or of
                    unorganized apertures, such as are admitted to exist between the molecules of
                    all matters,—and whether through the same pores or apertures a passage is
                    afforded to gases or other fluids, or to the oily or waxy secretions that cover
                    certain surfaces,—are questions, adds Μ. de Candolle, to which no answer can at
                    present be given. <hi rend="italic">(Oryanog. Vég.</hi> tome i. p. 88.)</p>

                <p>From the surface of the cuticle, in many parts of herbaceous plants, and in the

                    seen to spring. They possess very different forms, and vary likewise greatly in
                    texture. In a strict sense, they may be defined small filaments possessing
                    considerable stiffness, which project from the surface, and stand out pretty
                    erect. When they are very numerous, a little soft, and less erect, they take the
                    name of <hi rend="italic">villi</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> when still softer
                    and less numerous they are termed down <hi rend="italic">(pubes).</hi> Sometimes
                    this down is composed of long hairs nearly resembling wool, at other times it
                    approaches more to the character of cotton. When the hairs are stiff and ranged
                    along the edge of a surface, like the lashes of the eye, they are named <hi

                    they are produced to a greater length, as in the beard or awn of wheat, they
                    acquire the name of <hi rend="italic">barba</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                    botanists, who further distinguish them by various names, according as they
                    terminate in a single point, or are hooked, or forked, or branched, or
                    feathered, &amp;c. In some instances, instead of appearing like one continuous
                    substance, they are composed of many joints, or are said to be articulated. In
                    fig. 16 and 17, Plate XLI., we have copied from Du Hamel a few of the varieties,
                    both of single and jointed hairs; but the forms they exhibit are so numerous and
                    diversified, that we must refer to the writers on botany for minuter
                    information. In some examples the point of the hair is terminated by a small
                    rounded globulet, and sometimes by a fine filament, that seems to proceed out of
                    the hair.</p>
                <p>Some writers distinguish hairs into two general classes, —the glandular and
                    lymphatic. In the former class, the hair or filament is sometimes the excretory
                    duet of the small gland situated at its base; and in other instances, as in the
                    ehick-pea, the glandular or secreting organ is seated at the extremity of the
                    hair. The lymphatic class embraces a much greater variety of hairs, which differ
                    widely from each other in consistence, direction, and form. They spring only
                    from the parts of plants which are exposed to the air, and are not found,
                    therefore, on the parts concealed below the earth or in water: they are also
                    rare on plants that grow in the shade, are wanting altogether in <hi
                    rend="italic">etiolated</hi> plants, and are most abundant, in general, on
                    plants that grow in warm places, and are well exposed to solar light. With
                    respect to their seat or origin, as compared with that of the pores, although,
                    says Μ. de Candolle, these two kinds of organs appear sometimes mingled, yet
                    each has a determined place; for the pores are seated on the cellular or
                    parenchymatous parts, while the lymphatic hairs constantly spring from the
                    vascular or ligneous parts. Yet the hairs, he adds, are almost always placed on
                    the same surface as the pores; and hence the superior surface of the leaf, which
                    is commonly destitute of pores, has in general but few or no hairs. The pores,
                    as before stated, seem to be the true organs of transpiration; and the various
                    kinds of hairs serve to protect the plant against the excess of solar light,
                    against variations of temperature, against humidity, or sometimes against
                    insects. (<hi rend="italic">Organog. Vég.</hi> tome i. chap. 10.) Hairs, also,
                    of various kinds are met with on the different parts of the flower. These often
                    have the colour of the petals or other parts on which they grow, and are
                    distinguishable from the true lymphatic hairs, though sometimes associated with
                    them on the same organ.</p>
                <p>With regard to the structure of these minute bodies, little that is satisfactory
                    can be said. They seem to originate either directly from the cuticle or from the
                    cortical texture beneath it; but not often from the ligneous texture, except in
                    those instances where they are very long and rigid, as in the awns of wheat. Du
                    Hamel observes that almost all of them are implanted on small bodies, similar to
                    the bulbs whieh give origin to the hairs o'f animals. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 183.) They, commonly
                    resemble simple filaments, but often appear like elongated cells threaded on one
                    another, and, instead of terminating in a sharp point, end in a small papilla or
                    utricle, which yields in many instances a viscid or oily matter, or sometimes a
                    coloured liquor, which has led many to regard them as exercising a glandular
                    function.</p>
                <p>One species of these supposed glandular organs has been more particularly
                    examined, and their fluid analyzed, by Μ. Deyeux, who gives the following
                    account of it. Soon after the seeds of the chick-pea <hi rend="italic">(cicer
                    arietinum)</hi> are sown, its first leaves are seen to be covered with hairs, at
                    the extremity of each of which is a transparent globule, about the size of a
                    small pin-head, consisting of a fluid matter. It abounds most in mid-day, when
                    the air is warm and dry, and is scarcely perceptible at night, or when the air
                    is cold and moist; after rain, indeed, it does not again appear for two or three
                    days. When these fluid globules were removed in a dry day by blotting-paper,
                    they soon re-appeared; they were acid to the taste, reddened litmus paper, and
                    caused an effervescence in carbonate of potash when brought in contact with it.
                    He regarded them as composed of oxalic acid, the properties of which they
                    precisely resembled. <hi rend="italic">(Mém, de ľìnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p.

                <p>It is not easy to discriminate between some of the harder species of hairs,
                    described in the former article, and those to which the appellation of prickles
                    <hi rend="italic">(aculei)</hi> has been assigned. They are defined by Du Hamel
                    to be excrescences, often hard, and always terminated by a sharp point, which
                    are developed with the other productions of plants, but are not inclosed in
                    particular buds; so that they may for the most part be regarded as hard and
                    solid hairs. They spring equally from the stem, the branches, the petioles of
                    the leaves, and also from the leaves themselves in various plants; and' in the
                    chesnut and some others they are seen to cover the fruit. They are frequently
                    straight, but in the rose and many others are curved at the point, as in fig.
                    18, Plate XLI.; and, according to Malpighi, possess sometimes in this plant a
                    little head, which yields a viscid fluid.</p>
                <p>Regarding their structure, Grew remarked that they were connected only with the
                    skin or the bark, and he therefore named them <hi rend="italic">cortical,</hi>
                    to distinguish them from thorns properly so called, such as those of the
                    hawthorn, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096471?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6471-0070"/> which spring from the wood, and which he
                    denominates <hi rend="italic">ligneous.</hi> These latter, he adds, always
                    ascend, while the cortical thorns commonly point downwards. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 33.) In proof of their origin from the bark, Du Hamel
                    remarks, that if, after maceration in boiling water, the bark of such plants be
                    stripped off, all the prickles come away with it, and leave not the smallest
                    impression on the wood, nor even on the more interior layers of the bark itself.
                    When a section also is made of the branch and prickle, as in fig. 18, Plate
                    XLI., the wood <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and the pith <hi rend="italic">z</hi>
                    are both seen to have no connection with the prickle, but the inner layer <hi
                    rend="italic">x of</hi> the bark is interposed between the base of the prickle
                    and the wood. Γhe prickle does not, however, spring from the skin, for it is
                    formed of many layers like the bark. As the parts become more solid, it is less
                    freely supplied with juice, and therefore hardens and turns brown. <hi

                    Malpighi states, that beside the common prickles on the leaves, there are among
                    them others of a different description. They possess more of a ligneous
                    character, are hollow internally, and contain a juice which, when it gains
                    admission beneath the skin, excites itching and tumour. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 137.) Dr Hooke had previously given a much more minute account
                    of the sting of this plant. Almost every part of it, says he, is covered with
                    prickles like sharp needles. Each prickle consists of two parts, very different
                    in shape and quality from one another; one is shaped much like a round bodkin,
                    is very hard and stiff, exceedingly transparent and clear, and hollow from top
                    to bottom. When this bodkin is thrust into the skin, it does not at all bend;
                    but a certain liquor is then seen to move up and down in it, rising towards the
                    top, when the point is pressed down on the base. This base is formed by a little
                    bag, is more pliable than the bodkin part, and within it is a cellular
                    structure, which contains a thin transparent liquor (see fig. 19, Plate XLI.):
                    it is this liquor that rises in the tube, and, being deposited beneath the skin
                    after it is punctured, excites the irritation that succeeds. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The true thorn <hi rend="italic">(spina)</hi> derives its origin, as Grew
                    remarked, from the ligneous part of the plant, and in some plants is produced
                    from the degeneration of some other organ, as of the leaf, or even the branch
                    itself: we shall therefore defer the further consideration of its structure,
                    until we come to treat of that of the branch.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Glands of Vegetables.</hi></p>
                <p>Perhaps in the whole science of anatomy there is no word that has been employed
                    with such latitude of signification, and is therefore exposed to so much
                    ambiguity, as the term <hi rend="italic">gland.</hi> In animal anatomy it was
                    doubtless used at first to denominate certain organs, from the external
                    resemblance which they bore to certain fruits or seeds; and in that sense it is
                    still employed on several occasions. Afterwards it was understood to signify not
                    so much the external form as the internal organization, and was considered to
                    express a certain structure, by which alone the function of secretion could be
                    exercised; but it is well observed by Dr Thomson, in his valuable work on
                    Inflammation, that “the definition of a secreting glandular part must be taken
                    from its function, and not from its structure; for nothing can be more various
                    than the internal structure of those organs that are denominated glandular
                    secreting organs: they consist sometimes of convoluted vessels, sometimes of
                    follicles or small hollow bags, and sometimes of transparent membranes, in which
                    neither convoluted vessels nor mucous follicles can be perceived,’.’ <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lectures on Inflammation,</hi> p. 318.) Besides these mor <hi
                    rend="subscript"> c</hi> simple structures, it is well known that most of the
                    internal <hi rend="italic">viscera</hi> are likewise denominated glands, though
                    dif? fering in all their characters from those just mentioned.</p>
                <p>The ambiguity which thus prevails in animal anatomy,i in relation to the use of
                    the term gland, has been increased! tenfold in the applications that have been
                    made αf it <hi rend="subscript"> to</hi> t the organs of vegetables. It is
                    justly observed by Μ. de Candolle, in reference to this subject, that the
                    numerous approximations in structure between vegetables and animais have often
                    promoted our researches into the former but have sometimes led physiologists
                    astray, and int∏&gt; duced into the language of botany many inexact expres∙
                    sions. In animal anatomy the term gland is understood to express some organ that
                    exercises a secretory function; but in vegetable anatomy this term has often
                    been applied to bodies that are not known to be real secretory organs. Thus the
                    cells of the cellular tissue, which frequently contain resinous or oily matter,
                    have been sometimes named <hi rend="italic">cellular glands</hi><hi

                    is therefore deemed a gland; but. Linnaeus, with his usual disregard both of the
                    structure and function of organs, considers as a nectary, not only the body
                    which may secrete, but any other that may serve as a receptacle of the
                    secretion; and indeed is said to comprehend under this term all those bodies
                    which have no resemblance to the other parts of the flower, in whatever variety
                    of form they may appear, or whatever purpose they may serve. (Will-denow’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Botany,</hi> p. 87.) In some other instances the
                    term gland has been used, not to express the secreting organ itself, nor even
                    the receptacle of the secretion, but the solid excreted matter on the surface of
                    certain leaves; and others consider hairs, and every other protuberance that
                    projects from the surface, and contains a fluid different from the common sap,
                    as entitled to the distinctive appellation of gland.</p>
                <p>Amid such diversity of opinion concerning the structure, position, and function
                    of these minute organs, and. such vagueness in the methods employed to
                    characterize! them, it is extremely difficult to define their true nature, or
                    declare the principle on which this definition should proceed. The mere
                    existence of a fluid, distinct from the common sap in any organ, cannot be
                    considered as bestowing on it the title of gland, otherwise the greater portion
                    of some plants would come to be regarded as glandular: those varieties of
                    structure which exercise no secretory function may also be excluded from the
                    list of glands; and so likewise the hairs of plants, though containing peculiar
                    fluids, may be excluded, since these peculiarities appear to arise frequently
                    from circumstances foreign to the action of the organ itself; and even if they
                    do not, some specific variation of the general name they bear is preferable to
                    the employment of so ambiguous a word as gland. But where any organ is distinct
                    from the com· mon textures of the vegetable, and by the peculiarity of its
                    structure is fitted to produce those changes on the vegetable fluids which we
                    name secretion, it may be deemed a secreting organ. This secretory function,
                    however, may sometimes be exercised, as in animal bodies, by membranous
                    surfaces, and sometimes by small isolated bodιe⅛ to which, perhaps, may properly
                    belong the denomination of glands.</p>
                <p>But even though this method of defining glands were <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096484?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6484-0071"/> adoρted, it
                    still is a matter of no small difficulty to distingish their species by
                    appropriate appellations. In animal anatomy no settled rule obtains; but the
                    name of the gland is assigned from some accidental circumstance of situation,
                    figure, use, &amp;c. In vegetable anatomy the btanist, regarding glands only as
                    aiding the discrimination of species, refers commonly to their situation, and
                    speaks of foliaceous, stipular, or petiolar glands, according as they happen to
                    be seated on the leaves, the stipules, or the petioles. The anatomist imposes
                    names according to their forms, as they chance most to resemble a globule, an
                    utricle, or some other figure; and the physiologist is chiefly directed by ideas
                    which indicate their functions, disstinguishing them into mucous, oily,
                    resinous, or nectariferous glands, according to the nature of the fluid they
                    furnish. Of these different modes, that which proceeds on the apparent form,
                    where it can be discovered, seems the most precise; but as this cannot always be
                    accomplished, the situation of the organ, or the nature of the secreted fluid,
                    must occasionally be had recourse to.</p>
                <p>Of these bodies it is to be remarked that they differ in one respect from most of
                    the corresponding organs in aninimals, almost all of them being seated on the
                    <hi rend="italic">external parts</hi> of the plant, like several of the more
                    simple glandular bodies in animals. This arises from the greater simplicity of
                    vegetable organization, particularly as it regards the absorbent system, the
                    mode of growth, and the permanence of the organs produced; whence it happens
                    that the living parts of aged perennial plants are situated only at or near the
                    surface; and it is only in such parts that active secretory functions can have
                    place. Hence it is on .cculent stems, on leaves, flowers, and fruits, during the
                    active state of vegetation, that the glandular functions of vegetables must be
                    exercised; and which parts, therefore, are the appropriate seat of glands.</p>
                <p>In some leaves a secretory function extends over a great part of the surface, as
                    in some species of <hi rend="italic">Cistus,</hi> of sugar-maple, of larch, and
                    others enumerated by Du Hammel, on which various collections of saccharine,

                    and which, says he, are nothing but a gummy exudation. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Micrographia,</hi> p. 142.) Μ. Guettard has described not fewer than seven
                    species of glandular bodies on the leaves of different plants, to which he
                    assigned names, chiefly from the appearance of their form; these are the <hi
                    rend="italic">miliary,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">vesicular,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">squamous,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">globular,</hi> the <hi
                    rend="italic">lenticular,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">utricular,</hi> and the <hi
                    rend="italic">urccolar</hi> glands. Of these reputed species, those called
                    miliary are no longer held to be glands, but cuticular pores; and the squamous
                    species is found to be identical with the thin scale that covers the
                    fructification of ferns. Others add to this list the organ called nectary; but
                    the very vague notions entertained of its nature and use altogether preclude the
                    possibility of assigning to it any precise anatomical character.</p>
                <p>Other writers have proposed to reduce all the bodies: called glands to two
                    classes, the <hi rend="italic">cellular</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >vascular,</hi> according as they conceive them to be formed of cellular tissue
                    simply, or of this tissue and vessels combined. But such an arrangement would
                    lead us, in some instances, to confound the mere receptacles of secreted fluids
                    with the organs that secrete them,—would bestow a secretory function on organs
                    considered by these writers to be <hi rend="italic">non-vascular,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">—</hi> and convert the entire cellular tissue of the plant into a
                    simple glandular body. The glands of plants may indeed possess the form and size
                    of cells; but they are not, like cells, close cavities; they resemble more the
                    follicles and mucous glands of the animal system, and, from the nature of their
                    function, must always be regarded as vascular.</p>
                <p>Of organs so minute, and so very imperfectly known and characterized, nothing can
                    be attempted in the way of anatomical demonstration. This, however, is the less
                    to be regretted, as the glandular system in plants appears in general to be of
                    much less consequence in the vegetable than it is in the animal economy.</p>
                <p>PART II.</p>
                <p>THE ANATOMY OF THE INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS AND ORGANS OF VEGETABLES.</p>
                <p>In the preceding Part we have described, in general, the nature of the elementary
                    organs and common textures that compose the entire plant; and we come now to the
                    second division of our subject, viz. the description of individual members and
                    organs. Following the method of Grew, we shall first exhibit the anatomy of the
                    seed, and the changes of form and structure displayed in its evolution. We shall
                    next treat of the mature plant, and exhibit views of the more remarkable
                    varieties of structure observed in its several members, as the trunk, the
                    branch, and the root. The organs that originate from these members, as buds,
                    leaves, flowers, and fruits, will then be duly noticed; and we shall terminate
                    our descriptions by a brief exhibition of the formation and structure of the
                    vegetable <hi rend="italic">ovum</hi> in its progress towards the state of the
                    perfect seed.</p>
                <p>The limits within which, in a work like the present, we are necessarily
                    circumscribed, will render our view of these individual structures, when
                    compared with the immense variety that obtains in nature, exceedingly imperfect;
                    but our purpose will be accomplished if we succeed in exhibiting a correct and
                    tolerably comprehensive outline of the great features of vegetable organization,
                    as they are displayed in the individual parts and organs of the more perfect
                    plants.</p>
                <p>CHAP. I.</p>
                <p>THE ANATOMY OF SEEDS.</p>

                    Seeds.</hi></p>
                <p>The seed or egg of vegetables <hi rend="italic">(semen vel ovum)</hi> is formed
                    at the base of the pistil of the flower, in an organ called the ovary <hi
                    rend="italic">(ovarium),</hi> hereafter to be described. This organ takes the
                    name of pericarp when the seed is mature, and is then said to be formed of three
                    parts, enveloping each other. The outer membrane has been called epicarp, and
                    the inner one endocarp, between which the thicker portion, called sarcocarp, is
                    placed. In fleshy fruits, as the peach and apple, the sarcocarp is very thick,
                    and contains the matter which nourishes the seed. Interiorly, the pericarp is
                    cither simple or separated by one or more partitions into cells, which contain
                    the seeds. The seeds accordingly communicate with or are attached to the
                    pericarp, at the point of the seed named <hi rend="italic">hilum,</hi> from
                    which point the vesSels<pb break="no" facs="nls:193096497?mode=fullsize"

                    and are continued to its fleshy portion, which supplies the materials for its
                    growth. These vessels form the umbilical cord <hi rend="italic"
                    >(funiculus</hi><hi rend="italic">umbilicalis')</hi>; but sometimes, it is said,
                    this cord, from its extreme tenuity, or implication with other organs, cannot be
                    discovered. When the seed has attained to maturity, the umbilical cord dries up
                    and breaks, and the pericarp opens in various ways in different plants, to
                    permit the escape of t∣ħβ seed-</p>
                <p>• The seeds of different plants exhibit the greatest diversity in number, size,
                    and figure. Sometimes they are few, in other instances very numerous. In one
                    plant of white poppy Grew reckoned 32,000 seeds, and on the spike of a species
                    of <hi rend="italic">typha</hi> he numbered 40,176 seeds; so that, upon the
                    three spikes which one stalk of this plant bears, there are every year produced
                    more than 120,000 seeds. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 198.) In
                    figure the varieties in seeds are so numerous as to baffle description; and,
                    with respect to size, many are so minute as not to be visible to the naked eye,
                    and others so large as to reach several pounds in weight.</p>
                <p>The part at which the seed has separated from the ovary is indicated by a small
                    mark or scar, called by Malpighi <hi rend="italic">fenestra,</hi> by Linnaeus
                    <hi rend="italic">hilum,</hi> and by Gaertner <hi rend="italic">umbilicus.</hi>
                    In some seeds this scar is of considerable extent, and is the only mark that is
                    visible; in other instances there seems to be present a <hi rend="italic"
                    >foramen</hi> in addition to the scar. All seeds, says Grew, have their outer
                    coats open, either by a particular aperture, or by the breaking off of the cord,
                    or by the entrance of the cord into the substance of the seed, as in those which
                    have a shelly or stony covering. In the bean this aperture is placed on the
                    side, in the chesnut on the top, in the gourd at the bottom; and in each case
                    the point of the radicle is opposed to the aperture, and first pushes forth
                    through it. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> book i.) In many seeds,
                    however, the radicle is not thus opposed to the umbilicus, but, according to
                    Gaertner, is variously placed with regard to it; and in the seeds of the apple
                    and pear, Malpighi considers no proper umbilical aperture to exist, but only an
                    <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> to be formed by the relaxation of the tunics,
                    through which the radicle makes its way. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi>
                    p. 9.)</p>
                <p>There can be no doubt that, in every case, a connection subsisted between the
                    seed and the ovary during the formation of the seed; but this, in different
                    examples, may have much varied. In all cases an umbilical cord must have
                    existed, and appears, in many examples, from inspection of mature seeds, to have
                    been the only visible medium of connection. In the bean, however, besides the
                    umbilical cord there are marks of a connection also between the coats of the
                    seed and those of the ovary that contained it, so that the scar or cicatrix, in
                    that and similar cases, is distinct from the umbilical aperture. The scar is the
                    mark left by the separation of the tunics continued from the ovary; the foramen
                    is the aperture produced by the separation of the umbilical cord. It will be
                    afterwards stated that the outer coat of the seed appears always to have
                    originated from the inner coat of the ovary, so that it forms a sheath about the
                    umbilical cord. If, therefore, as in the bean, these coats are thick, and the
                    umbilical cord short, then traces of the separation, both of the coats and of
                    the cord, will remain on the seed; if, on the other hand, the coats are thin,
                    and the cord more elongated, this latter will be closely invested by the former,
                    and the umbilical scar will present the appearance only of a simple aperture, as
                    is common to many seeds.</p>
                <p>A late writer, Μ. Turpin, regards the umbilical scar as consisting of three
                    parts, viz. the proper cicatrix itself, in the centre of which he describes an
                    aperture through' which the nutrient vessels passed to the embryo; and near' to
                    it another smaller aperture, through which he believes the spermatic vessels to
                    have passed. The former he calls the <hi rend="italic">omphalode,</hi> the
                    latter the <hi rend="italic">micropyle,</hi> and declares that he observed it in
                    more than 1200 seeds. <hi rend="italic">(An. du</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">ďHist. Nat.</hi> tome vii. p. 199.)</p>
                <p>From the situation of the umbilicus, the several parts or regions of the seed
                    have been defined. They are six' in number. The part where the umbilicus itself
                    is placed is termed the <hi rend="italic">basis,</hi> and the point at the
                    opposite extremity the <hi rend="italic">vertex</hi> of the seed; the upper or
                    back part is named the <hi rend="italic">dorsum</hi> or back, and the part
                    opposite to it the <hi rend="italic">venter</hi> or belly; while the two lateral
                    portions are called the sides <hi rend="italic">(laterd).</hi> The point where
                    the umbilical cord is inserted into the inner coat has been named the <hi
                    rend="italic">inter-' nal umbilicus.</hi> This point usually coincides with that
                    of the external, but, from a change in the relative position of the parts during
                    their formation, this coincidence is not always to be observed. (Gaertner <hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">Fructibus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >et</hi><hi rend="italic">Seminibus</hi><hi rend="italic">Plantarum,</hi> vol.
                    i.)</p>
                <p>When examined in its mature state, the seed is found' to be composed of certain
                    coats or tunics, which inclose' a kernel or <hi rend="italic">nucleus,</hi> that
                    also consists of several distinct parts. At an early period of growth, while the
                    parts are still green and succulent, two coats are easily distinguished, as in
                    the transverse section of the bean (fig. 30, Plate XXXVIII.), in which the inner
                    coat <hi rend="italic">a</hi> appears much thicker than the outer, and thé
                    radicle <hi rend="italic">b</hi> is seen rising through it.</p>
                <p>When these coats are stripped off, the parts which form the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nucleus</hi> are brought into view. They con-' sist, in the bean and most other
                    seeds, of two distinct parts, the lobes or cotyledons, as they have been called,
                    and the radicle and plume. These several parts can be seen only by separating
                    the two lobes from each other, as is done in fig. 31, where the letters <hi
                    rend="italic">cc</hi> denote the cotyledons, <hi rend="italic">d</hi> the
                    radicle, and <hi rend="italic">e</hi> the plume. Such seeds as have thus two
                    cotý ±edons are named <hi rend="italic">dicotyledonous.</hi></p>
                <p>In many seeds, however, the part called cotyledon is single, and often bears but
                    a small proportion to the entire bulk of the seed. Seeds which have thus but one
                    cotyledon are named <hi rend="smallcaps">Monocotyledons</hi>; and to this
                    division the seeds of wheat, of barley, and of all the grasses belong.</p>
                <p>Many of the lower tribes of plants are entirely destitute of a cotyledon, and are
                    called <hi rend="smallcaps">Acotyledons.</hi> Some writers assert that some
                    seeds have more than two cotyledons, and such seeds they have denominated <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Polycotyledons;</hi> but others, again, choose to consider
                    these appearances not as distinct cotyledons, but only as deep fissures, or
                    divisions into two primary lobes; and hence conclude, that all seeds having a
                    cotyledon may be classed under the two divisions of mono and di-cotyledons.</p>

                    of the Coats of Seeds.</hi></p>
                <p>Having given this general view of the several parts that compose the seed, we
                    proceed now to a more particular description of their structure; and, as the
                    tunics come first into view, we shall begin with them. These tunics, in some
                    seeds, are two; in others, three in number. By Grew they were named coats or
                    covers; by Malpighi&gt; <hi rend="italic">secundinae</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and by Gaertner, <hi rend="italic">testa</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">interna.</hi> We shall speak of them in the
                    familiar terms of the outer, the inner, and the middle coats or tunics.</p>
                <p>The outer coat or <hi rend="italic">testa</hi> of Gaertner is described as a
                    constant and essential part of the seed. It existed before the period of
                    fecundation, and is sometimes the only apparent <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096510?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6510-0073"/> ∣, covering
                    possessed by the mature seed. Some seeds have indeed been considered to possess
                    no tunic whatever, and have therefore, says Gaertner, been named <hi
                    rend="italic">acocca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but in such seeds there
                    existed a coat before they arrived at maturity, and its apparent absence has
                    been inferred from its extreme thinness, or its condensation with the sides of
                    the surrounding ovary. <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Fructïb.</hi><hi rend="italic">et</hi><hi rend="italic">Seminib. Plantar.</hi>
                    vol. i. p∙ 132.) A distinguished botanist, however, Mr Brown, is said to have
                    discovered two examples of seeds absolutely destitute of a covering, from their
                    first appearance to their state of maturity. (Thomson’s <hi rend="italic">Annals
                    of Philosophy,</hi> vol. i. p. 310.)</p>
                <p>∣ In different seeds this tunic possesses a very different structure, being in
                    some thin and membranous; in others of a spongy or fleshy nature; and in others,
                    again, it approaches to the consistence of leather or bone. But how various
                    soever in this respect, it is always an entire tunic, and has no aperture but
                    that of the umbilical foramen. Its colour is usually deeper than that of the
                    other parts of the seed; and in this particular it presents every possible
                    variety. It has rarely any connection with the nucleus, except in some
                    monocotyledons. (Gaertner, vol. i. cap. 9.) With regard to its origin, Malpighi
                    describes it, in its earliest state in the almond, as derived from the ovary
                    itself, being composed of reticulated vessels, which spring from the surrounding
                    organ. In other instances it is thicker, and is distinctly seen to be cellular
                    as well as vascular; and in the bean and pea, little tubes are said by Malpighi
                    to originate from the cells, and terminate by open mouths on the surface. <hi

                <p>Both Malpighi and Grew discovered, in some instances, a very thin membrane to
                    cover this outer coat, which, according to Gaertner, may be found in most seeds,
                    if the parts be scrupulously examined. Its structure is sometimes membranous,
                    often downy, and sometimes mucilaginous; it possesses occasionally considerable
                    thickness, and at other times is a mere pellicle, and thence has been named <hi
                    rend="italic">pellicula.</hi> It covers the whole seed, and does not ever
                    separate spontaneously from it. (Gaertner <hi rend="italic">de Fructib.</hi>
                    &amp;c. vol. i. cap. 9.)</p>
                <p>Besides this pellicle, another fine tunic named <hi rend="italic">arillus</hi> is
                    sometimes observed on the surface of the seed, as in the seed of euphorbia. It
                    originates from the umbilical cord at the base, and extends more or less
                    completely over the body of the seed. Its structure is very various, being
                    sometimes soft and pulpy, at others thin and membranous, and in others forming a
                    husky covering. It forms, in some instances, only a loose and partial covering;
                    and in others it invests the seed so closely and completely, that it can
                    scarcely be distinguished from the outer coat itself. Both in figure and colour
                    it often varies greatly, but, like the pellicle before described, it is regarded
                    rather as an accessory than a necessary integument.</p>
                <p>To the exterior coat of the seed various appendages are sometimes attached, as
                    down, wings, spines, hooks, all designed either as a defence to seeds or to
                    facilitate their dispersion. They are distinguished and described by the
                    botanist, but are in general of too fine a texture to be made the subject of
                    anatomical demonstration.</p>
                <p>ſhe inner tunic <hi rend="italic">(membrana</hi><hi rend="italic">interna of</hi>
                    Gaertner) is a common but not constant part of the mature seed. It appears
                    sometimes to be wanting, when in reality it is present. During the formation of
                    the seed it is frequently so extenuated, or coalesces so completely with the
                    outer coat, that it cannot be properly distinguished. In its earlier state it is
                    represented by Grew as a very spongy and succulent body, and as thick and bulky
                    as one or the lobes itself; but it dries and shrinks up as the seed approaches
                    maturity, so that it is sometimes scarcely discernible. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    of Plants,</hi> p. 47.) In the seeds of mpst plants it closely invests the
                    nucleus, but is easily separable from the outer tunic. In those of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> where the bulk of the seed consists almost
                    entirely of unorganized matter, no separation of this tunic from the contained
                    parts occurs; but its inner surface is formed into a cellular tissue, in the
                    cells of which the nutrient matter is lodged. In other instances the inner
                    surface is prolonged into processes, which penetrate into the nucleus, and
                    intersect it in various directions.</p>
                <p>This inner tunic does not, like the former, exist before fecundation, but is
                    formed subsequently to it. It is composed of vessels and cellular tissue. The
                    cells are commonly larger than those of the outer coat. It has no aperture, says
                    Gaertner, not even an umbilical one; but resembles a shut sac, over whose
                    external surface the umbilical vessels creep, and open, in an insensible manner,
                    within its cavity. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructib. &amp;c.</hi> cap. 9.) The
                    distribution of the vessels throughout the whole of this coat Grew compares to
                    that in the leaf.</p>
                <p>Beneath this inner tunic Grew describes another fine membrane, which immediately
                    invests the lobes or cotyledons of the seed. In the bean it is exquisitely thin,
                    and so firmly continuous with the lobes, that some dexterity is required to
                    accomplish its separation. It is spread not only over the convex surface of the
                    lobes, but also over the inner or flat surfaces, where they are contiguous,
                    extending likewise over the radicle and plume, and so over the whole nucleus of
                    the seed. It does not, like the other tunics, cease to grow in germination, but
                    is augmented and grows with the organic parts. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> b. i. ch. 1.) This tunic may be regarded either as a covering to
                    the nucleus, or as an actual portion of it, as Gaertner, who speaks only of two
                    coats, seems to have considered it. It appears, however, more proper to regard
                    it as the inmost coat, and thus to conclude, with Grew, that the covers in most
                    seeds are three. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> b. iv. ch. 3.) The coat last
                    described must in that case be considered as the middle tunic, being situated
                    between the outer one and that which is continuous with the nucleus. In many
                    seeds, however, only two coats are distinctly visible.</p>
                <p>The foregoing tunics not only contain the nutrient matter, and afford a
                    mechanical protection to the organic parts, &lt; but seem fitted also, by their
                    chemical constitution, to resist the operation of agents that might otherwise
                    effect their decomposition, and that of the nucleus they inclose. From the
                    experiments of Fourcroy and Vauquelin, on the tunics of certain seeds that grow
                    in marshy situations, it appears that, besides the usual ingredients of
                    vegetable substances, there exists in them a compound, formed by a combination
                    of tannin with a peculiar matter of an animal nature, in union with a vegetable
                    acid. This combination of tannin with the matter just mentioned renders these
                    tunics insoluble in water, and enables them to resist putrefaction, although
                    buried for long periods in the moist earth. The tunics of those seeds which do
                    not possess this chemical constitution may, it is added, by their ligneous or
                    horny texture, or by the oily matter with which they are penetrated, present
                    similar obstacles to the action of decomposing agents. <hi rend="italic"

                    and cotyledons, together, in most instances, with the nutrient mat <pb

                    destined to support their future growth. The three former bodies are completely
                    organized, but the nutrient matter is wholly inorganic, varies greatly in
                    quantity and proportion in different seeds, and is very variously situated with
                    respect to the organized parts.</p>
                <p>These parts, which in the progress of their evolution give birth to the new
                    vegetable, derive their visible origin from a medullary point, that succeeds to
                    the act of fecundation. By some these organized parts have been called the <hi
                    rend="italic">corcuhιm,</hi> by others <hi rend="italic">embryo,</hi> by others
                    <hi rend="italic">foetus,</hi> and by others <hi rend="italic">plantula</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">seminalis.</hi> The primary point or particle from which they
                    originate may with propriety, says Gaertner, be termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >corculum,</hi> since it is the source and scat of vegetable life, and from it
                    the whole vascular system of the embryo proceeds. In some instances this
                    corculum increases so little as to be scarcely visible even in the mature seed,
                    or exhibits only a palish spot, which has been termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >cicatricula</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in others it forms a roundish radicle,
                    whose apex is free and rises above the nucleus, but whose base is firmly
                    connected with it; in others, again, the corculum is still more disengaged,
                    enlarging at each extremity, and producing at one end the radicle, and
                    separating at the other into the two lobes called cotyledons, between which the
                    first bud or plume of the future plant is situated. From this varying growth of
                    the corculum, an embryo, more or less perfect, is produced. When the embryo
                    presents only a mere germinating point, it is styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >imperfect</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> when it exhibits a simple radicle, it is
                    deemed <hi rend="italic">incomplete;</hi> when it possesses both radicle and

                    >;</hi> and when it consists of radicle, cotyledon, and plume, it is pronounced
                    <hi rend="italic">complete.</hi> (Gaertner <hi rend="italic">de Fructïb.
                    &amp;c.</hi> vol. i. cap. 13.)</p>
                <p>In the mature seeds of the less perfect plants the embryo is altogether invisible
                    until after germination, and even in many other instances its characters cannot
                    be accurately traced. Its general figure is determined by that of the radicle
                    and cotyledons, and is exceedingly various in different seeds. In size it ranges
                    from a minute point to that of a body of considerable magnitude. In consistence
                    it is almost always soft and herbaceous, but its radicle possesses sometimes a
                    ligneous hardness. No seed contains more than one embryo, except in cases of <hi
                    rend="italic">superfoetation,</hi> of which Gaertner saw one instance in <hi
                    rend="italic">Pinus</hi><hi rend="italic">Cembra,</hi> a seed of which contained
                    two embryos within one and the same cavity. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructïb.</hi>
                    &amp;c. vol. i. p. 168.) Malpighi also records a similar occurrence in a seed of
                    <hi rend="italic">Prunus Armeniaca</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and the seeds of
                    some <hi rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> as will afterwards be shown, are capable
                    of evolving an indefinite number of embryos. Every <hi rend="italic"
                    >complete</hi> embryo is said to consist of three distinct parts beside
                    cotyledons. These are the radicle, the stem, and the plume.</p>
                <p>The radicle <hi rend="italic">(radicula),</hi> called <hi rend="italic"
                    >rostellum</hi> by Linnaeus, is the most constant part of the embryo, being
                    found in some seeds in which no other trace of that body can be discovered. In
                    the seeds, however, of the less perfect plants, and even in those of some
                    monocotyledons, no radicle is visible antecedent to germination. In some rare
                    instances among dicotyledons, as in <hi rend="italic">nelumbo nucifera,</hi> no
                    radicle exists; but in germination the stem first rises upward, and afterwards
                    emits rootlets from its sides. <hi rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">ď Hist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii.)</p>
                <p>The size of the radicle is very various, and so also is its figure, being either
                    conical, cylindrical, filiform, or tubercular, &amp;c. It always, says Gaertner,
                    occurs solitary, except in <hi rend="italic">secale, triticum,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">hordeum,</hi> to which alone, of all known seeds, three, four, or
                    six radicles, properly formed, and distinct from each other, are furnished to
                    each embryo. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructïb.</hi> &amp;c. p.,169.) This plurality
                    of radicles in the <hi rend="italic">cerealia</hi> had before been remarked by(
                    Malpighi. Μ. du Hamel describes the seed of misletoe'' <hi rend="italic"
                    >(viscum</hi><hi rend="italic">album)</hi> as emitting numerous radicles like
                    those of wheat. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. de ľAcad. des Sciences,</hi> 1740.)</p>
                <p>The stem <hi rend="italic">(scapus)</hi> of the embryo is a continuation of] the
                    radicle, and connects it with the plume. It is frequently wanting altogether,
                    nor, when it is present, can we fix precisely on the point where the radicle
                    ends and the stem begins. What is called stem descends frequently into the
                    earth, and becomes a true root; so that every part of the embryo situated
                    beneath the cotyledons might without impropriety be denominated radicle. The
                    place of junction between the radicle and stem was called by Grew the <hi
                    rend="italic">coarcture,</hi> from its presenting often an evident degree of
                    contraction; but Μ. Bonnet and others have given it the more appropriate name of
                    the neck <hi rend="italic">(collum)</hi> of the seed.</p>
                <p>The plume <hi rend="italic">(plumula)</hi> is the first bud of the new plant In
                    seeds that possess but one cotyledon it is very generally wanting; and even in
                    those which have two cotyledons it is not unfrequently absent, or is at least
                    concealed within the stem. In most of the latter sort of seeds, however, the
                    plume is met with. It is placed on the top of the stem or radicle, and lies
                    between the cotyledons, by which it is variously compressed and folded on
                    itself. In the greater number of seeds it is not entire, but at its free end is
                    divided into several pieces, all closely couched together, like feathers in a
                    bunch, and thence called the <hi rend="italic">plume</hi> by Grew. In different
                    seeds its several little leaves vary much in figure, size, and number. The
                    structure both of the radicle and plume will be most advantageously displayed in
                    connection with that of the cotyledons.</p>
                <p>Of the organized parts of the seed, the organs called by ’ Grew <hi rend="italic"
                    >lobes</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dissimilar leaves,</hi> by Malpighi <hi
                    rend="italic">seminal leaves</hi> or cotyledons, remain to be described. The
                    cotyledons derive their origin from the embryo itself, of which they constitute
                    a part. The seeds, however, of some tribes of vegetables, as before remarked,
                    are held not to possess these organs; and in many others the mass of nutrient
                    matter has been confounded with them. When present they are either simple or
                    divided. The simple cotyledon is formed by the mere extension of the corculum,
                    and is in truth scarcely distinguishable from the stem itself. The double or
                    conjugate cotyledons are produced by fissures, which usually divide that part of
                    the embryo that is opposed to the radicle into two or more equal portions or
                    lobes. These lobes have at first the appearance of mere tubercles, and in many
                    seeds they retain this form unchanged; but in others they gradually expand into
                    <hi rend="italic">lamella</hi> or plates, which augment in size, and finally
                    exhibit the proper form of cotyledons. This form is very various, as likewise is
                    the size of these organs. Sometimes they are so small as to be scarcely visible,
                    and sometimes so large as to form the chief portion of the seed. Their substance
                    is either thin, or thick, or turgid. Their colour is commonly white, but
                    sometimes yellowish, purple, or green, the colour into which they all pass
                    during germination.</p>
                <p>Concerning the structure of the cotyledons, it may be said that, in the more
                    perfectly developed seeds, they are formed of cellular tissue, through which
                    vessels are everywhere distributed; and, as we have already remarked, they are
                    everywhere covered by a fine pellicle or coat, which prevents alike their
                    adherence to the plume and to each other. This cellular structure of the
                    cotyledon is well displayed by Grew (fig. 32, Plate XXXVIII.) in a slice of the
                    cotyledon of the recent bean; and it is easily seen in a thin slice of almost
                    any mature seed, if it be held <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096536?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6536-0075"/> . against the light after it has been soaked in
                    water. This 'cellular structure extends into the radicle and plume, but in much
                    smaller proportion, constituting, according to Grew, about three fifths of the
                    plume, five sevenths of the radicle, and nine tenths of the cotyledon.</p>
                <p>Through all the organs that compose the nucleus vessels are distributed, by the
                    medium of which a general communication is established among them. This vascular
                    system is likewise exhibited by Grew in the dissection of a bean (fig. 34, Plate
                    XXXVIII.), in which the vessels are seen to branch off on each side from the
                    radicle, and spread themselves by innumerable ramifications through the
                    cotyledons. From the radicle vessels also pass upwards to the plume. These
                    vessels of the radicle are visible when a transverse section is made through it,
                    as in fig. 33, α, Plate XXXVIII., in which they are seen to occupy the middle of
                    that body. When the section is made higher up at the neck of the embryo, as in
                    the same figure, <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> then the central trunk, surrounded by
                    several smaller fasciculi of vessels, passing to the different parts of the
                    plume, is still more clearly exposed. In many seeds, however, the organized
                    parts are so small that their general structure cannot be traced, except during
                    the progress of their germination. We shall therefore defer the description of
                    them till we come to treat of their evolution, and shall then also go more fully
                    into the structure of the parts just mentioned.</p>
                <p>Within the cells of the cotyledon, in many dicotyledonous seeds, the nutrient
                    matter destined to support the future growth of the embryo is entirely
                    contained. In other instances this matter is only in part received into those
                    organs; and in the <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe,</hi> and other monocotyledons,
                    it is often placed almost entirely exterior to the cotyledon. This matter is
                    produced from a clear liquor that is secreted in the tunic during the formation
                    of the seed. To this liquor Grew gave the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >albumen,</hi> from its likeness, not only in appearance, but, as he conceived,
                    in use also, to the white of egg in animals. By Malpighi this matter, considered
                    in connection with the tissue that contains it, is often called the flesh <hi
                    rend="italic">(card)</hi> of the seed; and from its being sometimes situated
                    around the embryo, it has been denominated <hi rend="italic">perisperm</hi> by
                    Μ. Jussieu. We follow Grew and Gaertner in the use of the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >albumen,</hi> meaning to express thereby, not the primaryanimal compound to
                    which chemists have of late assigned that term, and which is found but in few
                    vegetables; but that compound substance which, whatever be its situation,
                    quantity, or colour, constitutes the nutrient matter of the seed.</p>
                <p>This albumen is a very constant part of the mature seed, but its proportion in
                    some seeds is so extremely small, that the seeds in which it occurs have been
                    termed <hi rend="italic">exalbuminous</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and in a few
                    instances it seems to be entirely wanting. Its quantity, situation, and figure,
                    in different seeds, are subject to very great variation. In the seeds of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineoe,</hi> where the embryo acquires only a very small size,
                    the albumen constitutes almost the entire bulk of the seed, and is placed wholly
                    exterior to the embryo. In the <hi rend="italic">Leguminosoe,</hi> on the other
                    hand, the embryo is more completely developed, and the whole of the albuminous
                    matter is contained within the cotyledons. In beet <hi rend="italic"
                    >(beta),</hi> and many others, the albumen is partly received into the
                    cotyledons, and lies in part exterior to them; and where this occurs the embryo
                    sometimes encircles the albumen, and is sometimes encircled by it. In <hi
                    rend="italic">Rheum</hi> the embryo is placed in the centre of the albumen, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Rumex</hi> and some others it is applied on the side of it, in
                    <hi rend="italic">Atriplex</hi> the long cylindrical embryo surrounds the
                    albumen, in <hi rend="italic">B'óerhaavia</hi> the embryo and its cotyledons
                    cover entirely the granulated substance of the albumen. (Μ. Jussieu, <hi
                    rend="italic">An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">Hist. Nat.</hi> tome v. p. 224.) In the onion <hi
                    rend="italic">(allium cepa)</hi> the embryo makes several curves within the
                    substance of the albumen, and in dodder <hi rend="italic">(cuscuta)</hi> it is
                    twisted around it in a spiral form; so that the relative positions of the embryo
                    and albumen, as well as their quantity, proportion, and figure, are subject to
                    endless variation.</p>
                <p>But however much in these respects the albumen may vary, it is always contained
                    within an organized structure. Sometimes this structure is that of the
                    cotyledon, as already exhibited in the bean (fig. 32, Plate XXXVIII.), the cells
                    of which contain this albuminous matter. Where the albumen is placed exterior to
                    the embryo, as in the seeds of wheat, it is nevertheless contained in a cellular
                    tissue. This is exhibited in fig. 27, Plate XXXVIII., copied from Leeuwenhoeck,
                    in which cells of an hexagonal form are seen to be filled with the albuminous
                    particles that constitute the white matter or flour of that seed. This mealy
                    part of wheat he describes as consisting of minute globules, inclosed in a kind
                    of membrane so exquisitely thin as scarcely to be observed, within which the
                    globules are contained, as it were, in cells. The globules appeared to be of
                    different sizes, not perfect spheres, but having an indentation on one part,
                    which led him to suppose that they were not formed by simple accretion, but by
                    some mode of growth, and that “the membranes which inclose them in cells must be
                    provided with so many veins or vessels, that every particle of meal may have its
                    separate vessel.” He even conceived the globules themselves to be inclosed
                    individually in a thin skin or shell; but this opinion he never brought to
                    ocular demonstration. <hi rend="italic">(Select Works by Hoole,</hi> vol. i. p.
                    169.) Similar observations on the albuminous part of wheat have since been given
                    by Mirbel; and Kieser and others have delineated the globular particles
                    contained in the cotyledonous cells of the bean and other seeds; so that whether
                    the albumen be situated in the cotyledons, or be placed exterior to them, it is
                    in every case contained in a similar and distinctly organized structure.</p>
                <p>In consistence the albumen is said to be either fari-' naceous, fleshy, or
                    cartilaginous; and it may exist in ' various intermediate states. The
                    farinaceous kind is <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> readily reduced to powder,
                    and is dissolved by water into a viscous mass. The embryo is generally placed
                    exterior to this species of albumen, as in the <hi rend="italic">Gramineoe.</hi>
                    The fleshy albumen is more frequent. It is softer than the former, and dissolves
                    by water into a gelatinous mass. It is often entirely contained within the
                    embryo and its cotyledons, and yields the thick oil that is expressed from many
                    seeds. Lastly, the cartilaginous species has a horny consistence, is difficultly
                    soluble in water, and not easily reduced to powder. The embryo is never placed
                    exterior to it, and when it contains oil, this is usually very thin. (Gaertner
                    <hi rend="italic">de Fructib.</hi> &amp;c. vol. i. cap. 10.)</p>
                <p>In many seeds the albumen serves as a support and defence to the embryo, as well
                    as for nutriment. If it be re-' moved previous to germination, as was done by
                    Mirbel <hi rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi

                <p>Besides the albumen above described, Gaertner has re- <hi rend="superscript">
                    Ί</hi> vived the use of the term <hi rend="italic">vitellus,</hi> but employed
                    it to designate a very different part from that to which it was originally
                    applied by Grew. The latter made use of this term to designate the inorganic
                    matter of the mature seed, which in the early stage of its production he called
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096549?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6549-0076"/>
                    albumen <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> book ív. chap. 3); but it is
                    employed by Gaertner to indicate a small membranous body, which in many seeds is
                    placed between the embryo and albumen, and is closely connected with the former,
                    but separates easily from the latter. The figure of this small body is described
                    as being very various in different seeds. It is said not to rise out of the
                    earth during germination; but, like the albumen, seems destined to afford
                    nutriment to the embryo. In the <hi rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> it represents a
                    thin scale interposed between the albumen and embryo, to which, from its
                    shield-like form, he gives the name of <hi rend="italic">scutellum. (De Fructib.
                    Plantar,</hi> vol. i. cap. 11.) There can be no doubt that this scutellum of
                    Gaertner is the little “conglobate leaf” first observed in wheat by Malpighi,
                    and which later writers have denominated the cotyledon of that seed. In the next
                    section its form and situation will be clearly displayed.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> II.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Monocotyledonous Seeds, as displayed in
                    their Evolution.</hi></p>
                <p>All seeds have by some botanists been distinguished into such as possessed one or
                    more cotyledons, and such as were entirely destitute of them. In treating of
                    seeds under the two divisions of mono and di-cotyledons, we would not be
                    understood to deny the existence of seeds that possess more than two.</p>
                <p>Some seeds are so extremely minute, that, until lately, their existence was not
                    clearly ascertained; and it is only during their germination that their general
                    form and character can be detected. In many others, the organized parts are so
                    small as to be scarcely capable of demonstration, except by following the
                    progressive changes of form they exhibit in their evolution. We propose,
                    therefore, to select, from each of the two divisions of mono and di-cotyledonous
                    seeds, an example or two of the successive appearances displayed in their
                    evolution, which will, besides, form the best introduction to a knowledge of the
                    structure of the mature plant.</p>
                <p>In most of the monocotyledonous seeds the cotyledon does not appear above the
                    soil during germination, but is retained within the coats of the seed, and
                    consequently undergoes but little alteration in size. As an example of the
                    evolution of a monocotyledonous seed, we shall select that of wheat <hi
                    rend="italic">(triticum hibernum),</hi> because its development has been studied
                    with great care, and, in common with some others of the same natural family, it
                    exhibits some striking peculiarities, which add greatly to its productive
                    powers. The successive appearances exhibited in its evolution have been given
                    with great accuracy by Malpighi, who has carried its anatomy farther, in some
                    points, than most of his successors. In the earlier stages of growth, some very
                    accurate representations of it have also been given by Μ. Poiteau; and Dr Yule
                    has likewise obliged us with some valuable observations. From these different
                    authorities, confirmed generally by our own observations, we shall endeavour to
                    present a concise view of the structure and evolution of this very important
                    seed.</p>
                <p>If we take a grain of wheat, and examine its convex side, we observe, at its
                    base, a small oblong body (fig. 35, Plate XXXVIII.) lying in a semicircular
                    depression, which is well defined through the tunics that cover it. These tunics
                    are two in number; an outer one, to which the chaffy filaments at the vertex of
                    the seed are attached, and which readily separates when moistened; and an inner
                    one, which everywhere adheres closely to the cellular tissue that contains the
                    albumen. If these two tunics be raised and thrown back, as is done in fig. 36,
                    the little oblong body <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and its semilunar appendage'
                    <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> placed behind it, are brought into view; and,
                    together, they constitute the embryo.</p>
                <p>Let next a vertical section of another seed be made in the direction of the
                    furrow that runs along its flatter side, and let this section pass through the
                    embryo, as is represented in fig. 37: we then observe the seed to be composed
                    almost entirely of albumen <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> with which the embryo <hi
                    rend="italic">I,</hi> consisting of minute convoluted leaves, is in close
                    contact. The part of the embryo that is applied against the albumen is the
                    cotyledon, which on that surface is convex, and on the opposite one concave.</p>
                <p>In fig. 38, the entire embryo has been removed from its connection with the
                    albumen, and a front view of it, considerably magnified, is there given, in
                    which the letter <hi rend="italic">m</hi> denotes the cotyledon, in the
                    concavity of which the plume <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is lodged, and <hi
                    rend="italic">o</hi> indicates the protuberances from which the radicles
                    afterwards spring. If now this same embryo be reversed, as is done in fig. 39,
                    then the convex back of the cotyledon only is seen, with the extremity of the
                    principal radicle at the base. It is this side of the cotyledon that was applied
                    against the albumen; and its polished surface, says Μ. Poiteau, proves that it
                    nowhere adhered by any organic structure. Gaertner also remarks that the
                    connection between these parts is not organic, but merely superficial,—an
                    observation that is true as far as relates to the embryo itself and the
                    albuminous matter, but not as applied to the tunics which envelope them; for, at
                    the base of the seed, the inner membrane, which contains the albumen, appears to
                    be continuous, as Leeuwenhoeck remarked, with that which covers the cotyledon,
                    being reflected from the albumen over the cotyledon, much in the same way as the
                    <hi rend="italic">pleura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">peritonaeum,</hi> that line
                    the sides of the great cavities in animal bodies, are reflected over the <hi
                    rend="italic">viscera</hi> they contain. Such are the appearances presented by
                    this seed antecedent to germination: let us next follow it through the several
                    stages of that process.</p>
                <p>After a seed of this species has been in contact for 24 or 30 hours with the
                    humidity necessary to its germination, its embryo becomes swollen, and, when
                    removed from the other parts, and moderately magnified, presents the appearance
                    exhibited in fig. 40. In this figure the radicle is rendered more protuberant,
                    and the fine tunic that invests it has undergone an alteration, being changed
                    from a smooth, opaque, and solid texture, to one that is villose, transparent,
                    and cellular. A vertical section of the same] embryo, as exhibited in the next
                    figure (41), shows the elongation of the principal radicle <hi rend="italic"
                    >p,</hi> which caused the protuberance below, and the sprouting of the two
                    lateral radicles <hi rend="italic">p p,</hi> which push forth more slowly on the
                    sides. These three radicles soon force their way through the sac that envelopes
                    them, which then forms sheaths around their origins. In the same figure, the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">q</hi> denotes the plume, consisting of several
                    convoluted leaves, and resting on the cotyledon. In fig. 42 the appearance of
                    the seed, in a stage a little more advanced, is exhibited. The plume <hi
                    rend="italic">r</hi> is now seen to have risen above the cotyledon <hi
                    rend="italic">s,</hi> and the three radicles, surrounded at their origins by
                    their proper sheaths, have greatly increased in length, and in- <hi

                    of germination, he represents the plume of the embryo as beginning to <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096562?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6562-0077"/>
                    open, and the protuberances, whιeh indicate the eruption of the three radieles,
                    as beginning to form. The radicles at this period are completely enveloped in a
                    membranous sac or involucrum; and the body of the embryo is closely connected
                    with a “eonglobate farinaceous leaf, by which nutriment is administered.” This
                    conglobate leaf is the cotyledon before mentioned, and its connection with the
                    radicle and plume is well shown by Malpighi. In fig. 43, <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> he exhibits a front view of the radicle and plume, as they appear when
                    separated from the cotyledon; and at the letter <hi rend="italic">v</hi> of the
                    same figure a back view of the same body is displayed, in which the letter <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> points to the mark or scar that denotes the place of
                    separation. Malpighi believed these parts to be united with each other by a
                    little node, hereafter to be described; but it is by the medium of vessels that
                    this connection between the cotyledon and the other parts of the embryo is
                    maintained; and by this route alone can the nutrient matter or albumen be
                    conveyed through the cotyledon to the radiele and plume. To these vessels Μ.
                    Bonnet gave the distinctive appellation of <hi rend="italic">mammary</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">:</hi> the union they form between the different parts of the
                    embryo is so elose, that at this part, says Gaertner, the cotyledon, and
                    radicle, and plume, form one undivided body. (Gaertner <hi rend="italic">de
                    Fructïb. Plantar.</hi> vol. i. p. 149.)</p>
                <p>On the second day of germination the exterior tunĩe of the seed, according to
                    Malpighi, gives way; the plume rises upward; the radieles do not as yet pierce
                    their investing sac, but this sac is turgid with juice, and is covered
                    exteriorly by a fine white down: the cotyledon also, at this period, is rendered
                    moist.</p>
                <p>During the third day the cotyledon is quite turgid with juice; the plume is much
                    enlarged, and begins to look green; the three radicles have piereed the
                    enveloping sac, and are everywhere thickly covered with hairs; and above the
                    first two lateral radicles, two small protuberances, <hi rend="italic">y,
                    z,</hi> fig. 44, the origins of two more radicles, are now seen to emerge, while
                    the sae that envelopes them is observed sensibly to waste.</p>
                <p>When the third day has elapsed, the plume, inclosed in a fine transparent
                    membrane, is still more elevated, and acquires a greenish colour: the
                    protuberances of the two new radicles are more prominent, and the three former
                    radicles have greatly augmented; the cotyledon is much softer, and, as if milky,
                    yielding, when compressed, a white and sweetish liquor.</p>
                <p>After the completion of the fourth day, the plume, continuing to ascend, pierces
                    the membranous covering <hi rend="italic">a'</hi> (fig. 45), and pushes into day
                    a permanent leaf, green and convoluted, around which the membrane forms a
                    sheath. Inferiorly, the first three radicles have greatly extended, and the two
                    others, <hi rend="italic">b' b',</hi> are much increased: the outer coat of the
                    seed now begins to lessen, but still contains a sweetish liquor. Μ. Poiteau
                    gives a section of the entire plantule about this period of its growth,, which
                    agrees very exactly with the figure of Malpighi. In -this section (fig. 46) the
                    plume <hi rend="italic">d</hi> is seen to have pierced the nιembrane <hi
                    rend="italic">ď</hi> that formerly inclosed it; the albumen <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is diminished; the cotyledon J* <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> retains
                    its situation and form; and the five radicles <hi rend="italic">ġ d</hi> are
                    nearly of a length, and covered with hairs.</p>
                <p>About the sixth day the plantule, still invested by its sheath, begins to open
                    and expand; the seminal tunics shrink, and the surface of the outer coat is
                    corrugated. ∏ these tunics are eut open, the cotyledon within is observed in
                    some parts to be firmer than before, and has the appearance of a concave leaf;
                    but in other parts it is more vascular and filled with juice, especially in that
                    part near to the mammary vesşels.</p>
                <p>After the eleventh day these tunics still adhere to the plantule, but appear much
                    wasted, and the juice they contain is mixed with bubbles of air; while the stem
                    forming many knots, and the radicles emitting innumerable rootlets, continually
                    augment in size. Where the vegetation has been very active, the whole original
                    contents of the seminal tunics are by this time exhausted, and, when compressed,
                    they yield only a watery fluid.</p>
                <p>After the lapse of a month, when the parts already developed are still farther
                    advanced, new buds break out from the primary seat of growth and rise upward,
                    and new radicles push forth and descend. So readily are these radicles produced,
                    that sometimes, if the primary ones be removed, others in crowds spring forth;
                    at thé same time new buds or shoots, protected in their proper sheaths, arise
                    from the same part, and surrounding the primary plantule, are borne upward with
                    it. Of these appearances accurate delineations are given, and they may be
                    observed in every field of growing wheat.</p>
                <p>The foregoing descriptions of Malpighi are in general very correct, and his
                    figures, though somewhat rude, exhibit faithful delineations of the objects they
                    are destined to represent. In one or two points, however, he has fallen into
                    error, which, in the above statement of his opinions, to avoid confusion, we
                    corrected as we went along. Thus, though he distinctly points out the
                    “eonglobate farinaceous leaf” as the organ by which nutriment is administered to
                    the radicle and plume, he assigns to the sae that, in an early state, envelopes
                    the radicles, the function of <hi rend="italic">placentula,</hi> and even gives
                    to the exterior tunic of the seed the title of seminal leaf. The true cotyledon,
                    however, which never in this seed is produced into a seminal leaf, is the little
                    eonglobate body above mentioned; and the common tunies of the seed have no title
                    to the appellation of seminal leaves. To this cotyledon Gaertner, from its
                    shield-like form, gave, as before observed, the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >scutellum.</hi> He held it to be characteristic of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Gramineoe,</hi> and analogous to the organ to which, in some other seeds, he
                    gave the name of <hi rend="italic">vitellus.</hi><hi rend="italic">(De Fructib.
                    Plantar,</hi> vol. i. p. 139.) But later writers, as Jussieu, Smith, Brown, and
                    Poiteau, have all restored to it its proper office of cotyledon.</p>
                <p>Μ. Poiteau has gone even farther, and asserted the existence of a second
                    cotyledon in this seed, and in the oat, which he describes as situated directly
                    opposite to the former. <hi rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du
                    Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">ďHist. Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p. 388.) In this
                    instance, however, he has mistaken the rudiment of the second bud for a second
                    cotyledon, as Dr Yule ascertained by “tracing the growth of this supposed
                    cotyledon from its first becoming visible to its final development as a plant.”
                    (<hi rend="italic">Werner. Transac.</hi> vol. i. p. 594.) Μ. Mirbel considers
                    the sac that invests the plantule to be the cotyledon of this seed, and this
                    cotyledon to form the <hi rend="italic">first enslιeaihing leaf. (An.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d'Hisŧ. Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p.
                    148.) But, as already remarked, the cotyledon never in this seed rises out of
                    the tunics; and, as Dr Yule observes, differs totally in situation, structure,
                    and consistence, from the ensheathing leaf of the plantule.</p>
                <p>A very remarkable peculiarity in these plants is their great reproductive power,
                    as displayed in the indefinite number of new plants which we have seen to be
                    evolved from one primary seed. Malpighi not only observed this peculiarity, but
                    has described the structure from which it originates. He considered the radicle
                    and plume of the embryo to be connected with the cotyledon, not by the mammary
                    vessels, as we have stated, but by a little body which he called the <hi
                    rend="italic">umbilical node.</hi> In a section of the lower part of the stem of
                    the plantule, made after the third day of germination, he delineates this mode
                    as situ <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096575?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6575-0078"/> ated at the junction of the radicle and plume, as
                    represented by the letter Zt' (fig. 48, Plate XXXVIII.); and describes it as
                    solid exteriorly, and softer and more medullary within. If a section of the same
                    part be made on the fourth day, as in fig. 47, the stem <hi rend="italic"
                    >i'</hi> of the plantule will be seen, says he, to spring from, this node, from
                    which also the radicles equally take their origin.</p>
                <p>This peculiar property was also observed by Leeuwen-hoeck, though he seems not
                    clearly to have apprehended the nature of the organs from which it proceeded. In
                    the embryo of wheat he describes three points, from which not only three
                    distinct radicles spring, but they are also, he adds, “the beginnings of three
                    several spires or stalks of wheat; so that from every grain of wheat (which is
                    well worthy of observation) there will arise not merely a single stalk, but
                    three distinct ones, which are formed in the seed itself.” <hi rend="italic"
                    >Select Works by Hook,</hi> vol. i. p. 169: and in vol. ii. p. 289, are to be
                    found similar observations on the seeds of oats, barley, and rye.</p>
                <p>By Μ. Mirbel, the umbilical node of Malpighi is considered as a fleshy knot <hi
                    rend="italic">(un noeud charnu),</hi> by the medium of which the plume and
                    radicle are united. The lateral radicles which issue from it he regards as
                    distinct in their nature from the primary one, and as resembling those which
                    spring from knots in the stem; he therefore names them <hi rend="italic"
                    >articular</hi> roots, <hi rend="italic">les racines articulaires.</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">(An.</hi><hi rend="italic">du Mus.</hi><hi rend="italic">d’Hist.
                    Nat.</hi> tome xiii. p. 149.) According to Dr Yule, however, this fleshy knot is
                    to be considered as a <hi rend="italic">tuber,</hi> analogous to the tuberous
                    substance interposed between the bulbs and roots of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Lïliaceae</hi> and other monocotyledonous tribes; and which is destined to
                    produce an indefinite number of young plants, a greater or less number of which
                    are subsequently evolved by the joint agency of the roots and leaves. The <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ii</hi> articular roots” of Μ. Mirbel he regards as in
                    reality young plants, the roots of the <hi rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> being
                    invariably fibrous. It is by means of these lateral shoots and their <hi
                    rend="italic">tubera</hi> that bushes, consisting of from sixty to several
                    hundred stems, are sometimes seen to originate from one seed.</p>
                <p>The above important peculiarities in the germination of the seeds of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineae</hi> are very perspicuously displayed by Dr Yule in the
                    three figures which we have copied from his Memoir. In fig. 49, Plate XXXVIII.,
                    Dr Yule represents the embryo of wheat as it appears when detached from the
                    albumen, a short time after germination has commenced; the ascent of the plume
                    covered with its membrane, and descent of the three primary radicles, which have
                    pierced their containing sac, are clearly exhibited; and the letter Ä' points to
                    the little cotyledon placed at the junction of the two parts just mentioned. In
                    fig. 50 the germination of the same seed is shown in a more advanced stage; the
                    plume <hi rend="italic">ľ</hi> has now risen to a considerable height, and
                    pierced the investing membrane; and at <hi rend="italic">m!</hi> a second bud or
                    plume (which Μ. Poiteau mistook for a second cotyledon) is seen to shoot from
                    the tuber like the first. The letter <hi rend="italic">n'</hi> denotes the
                    seminal tunics. At a still more advanced period, four young plants, o'o'o'o',
                    fig. 51, of the second month, with their sheaths in part withered, are seen to
                    have sprung from the same part; but the two seminal tunics of the seed,
                    exhausted of their contents, still remain attached, as indicated by the letter
                    <hi rend="italic">pt. ( Wernerian Trans,</hi> vol. i. p. 589.)</p>
                <p>The description given above of the evolution of wheat is applicable, with little
                    variation, to the seeds of all the <hi rend="italic">cerealia.</hi> The seed of
                    the oat emits from four to six radicles, all of which break through their
                    enveloping sac at the same place, and thus appear to be contained in one sheath.
                    Such too is the case with barley, the plume of which extends beneath the seminal
                    tunics, and pushes out at the vertex of the seed.</p>
                <p>This peculiar constitution of the seeds above mentioned is attended with
                    important advantages in their culture, and explains the source of their great
                    productive power. A single grain of barley was observed by Du Hamel to have
                    produced 200 ears, each of which yielded 24 grains; so that one single seed
                    planted in a good soil has produced 4800 grains. Curtis and others, by
                    transplantation of the several plantules of wheat, obtained still higher returns
                    from single seeds. For the same reason, these plants are better enabled than
                    others to resist the injurious effects of accident or disease. If a seed, says
                    Dr Yule, be buried under a stone or lump of indurated clay, the seminal
                    plantules cannot shoot upward; but stems are then sent off in a horizontal
                    direction, until they can effect their escape upward. Sometimes it happens that
                    a small insect <hi rend="italic">(Musca</hi><hi rend="italic">pumilionis)</hi>
                    deposits its egg in wheat, and the grub is lodged in the very centre of the
                    stem, just above the root, by which the stem is invariably destroyed, and the
                    root so materially injured as to prevent its throwing out fresh shoots on each
                    side, or <hi rend="italic">stocking</hi> itself, as the farmers term it.
                    Nevertheless, the plants thus attacked are not permanently injured; for, in the
                    instance where these depredations occurred, the crop of wheat was good, and the
                    ears large and fine through the whole field; so that these injured plants, by
                    the production of lateral shoots, yielded an abundant crop. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Lin. Trans,</hi> vol. ii. p. 76.)</p>
                <p>In the germination of other monocotyledonous seeds a similar succession of
                    phenomena present themselves, with the exception of those which relate to the
                    multiplication of so many individuals from a single seed. In all, the radicle
                    first shoots forth, and the plume soon follows; the cotyledon is commonly of
                    small size, and is retained within the tunics. As the embryo grows, the albumen
                    is taken up and conveyed through the cotyledon to the young plantule; and before
                    the albumen is exhausted the embryo is enabled to draw its nutriment from the
                    soil in which it grows.</p>
                <p>In many instances it appears that the primary radicle of seeds, after a short
                    time, becomes dry and falls off, and is replaced by a great number of secondary
                    rootlets. Μ. Poiteau regards this last circumstance as common and peculiar to
                    monocotyledonous seeds. He has remarked it in many hundred palms, not one of
                    which had a descending or tap-rbot. No plant in the numerous family of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Lïliaceae</hi> is said to possess such a root. The radicle of the
                    <hi rend="italic">Cyperaceae</hi> does not, perhaps, perish so soon; but it does
                    not continue long. This premature and constant destruction of the radicle he
                    considers as the cause of the bulbs and truncations which occur, particularly in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Li∙ liaceae</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> for the lateral
                    roots not being capable of receiving all the descending sap, it collects at the
                    lower part of the stem, and occasions these different enlargements. <hi

                <p>The effects which thus succeed to the spontaneous destruction of the radicle
                    occur partly in other plants, in which the first radicle is naturally permanent,
                    if it be artificially removed. Du Hamel found that if the extremity of permanent
                    radicles were cut off, lateral rootlets were produced; that even mechanical
                    obstruction to the descent of the radicle frequently gave rise to divisions in
                    it, and the production of these lateral rootlets. He ascertained also, by
                    experiment, that roots extend invariably, not by an elongation of parts already
                    formed, but by new matter added to their extremities; and hence it is that
                    roots, whether ligneous or herbaceous, do not elongate if even the smallest
                    portion of their extremity be cut off. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Dicotyledonous Seeds, as displayed in their
                    Evolution.</hi></p>
                <p>From the greater number of seeds which have two cotyledons, the phenomena of
                    their evolution may be expected to exhibit at least as great variety, as those
                    of the division last described. In different species they differ in this respect
                    as much from one another as they do from monocotyledonous seeds. Some seeds of
                    this class raise their cotyledons above ground during germination; in others
                    these organs are wholly retained within the tunics. Of each of these modes of
                    evolution we propose to give an example, selecting, as before, those seeds which
                    have been most accurately observed; or which, by the forms they exhibit, seem
                    best calculated to illustrate the general laws by which their evolution is
                    accomplished.</p>
                <p>In the seeds of this division the embryo is commonly much more completely
                    developed than in those of the class last described, so that the several organs
                    of the plantule become distinctly visible. The radicle and plume are readily
                    distinguished, and the cotyledons are frequently so large as to form nearly the
                    entire mass of the seed. Within the cotyledons the albuminous matter provided
                    for the nutrition of the embryo during its evolution is often entirely
                    contained; and these organs, as before remarked, rise sometimes out of the
                    earth, increase greatly in size, and after a certain period decay. In other
                    instances no increase in size nor elevation above the surface occurs, but, like
                    the greater number of monocotyledons, they remain beneath the soil, and yield
                    gradually their nutrient matter for the support of the embryo. Even in plants of
                    the same natural order, the <hi rend="italic">Papilionaceae</hi> for example,
                    some, as <hi rend="italic">lupinus,</hi> says Dr Smith, raise their cotyledons
                    into the air and light; while others, as <hi rend="italic">lathyrus,</hi> retain
                    them under ground, concealed within the tunics of the seed. As an example of the
                    latter, we shall give from Malpighi an abridged account of the successive
                    appearances exhibited by the common pea <hi rend="italic">(pisum),</hi> which,
                    in its evolution, approaches in some respects to that of the seeds last
                    described.</p>
                <p>The figure and size of this seed are familiar to every one. After being placed
                    for a day in circumstances favourable to its germination, it is much increased
                    in size; its outer coat is rendered softer, and becomes more white and thin; the
                    umbilical aperture continues closed, but near to it an irregular opening or
                    laceration is visible. If the outer coat be now stripped off, the <hi
                    rend="italic">nucleus</hi> comes into view. It is seen to consist of two
                    distinct parts or lobes, which are the proper cotyledons of the seed. These
                    cotyledons are closely invested by the inner tunic; externally they have a
                    convex surface, but internally, where they are in contact, their surfaces are
                    nearly plain. Between them, in a small depression formed in their substance,
                    lies the plume: it is composed of a number of yellowish leaves folded on each
                    other, and bent inward, and is united by a little curved stem to a small white
                    conical body, the radicle. These appearances are exhibited in fig. 1, Plate
                    XXXIX., in which one of the cotyledons has been removed, so that the inner
                    surface of the other, together with the plume and radicle, is fully brought into
                    view: the letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> denotes the cotyledon, <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> the plume, and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> the radicle. This
                    radicle at its neck, or point of junction with the stem, sends off on each side
                    a little stalk or pedicle to each cotyledon. In the above figure one of these
                    pedicles has been cut through, and the other, that remains attached to the
                    cotyledon, is con-∣ cealed behind the plume. It is by these pedicles alone' that
                    the two cotyledons are connected with each other.</p>
                <p>When the second day of germination is completed, the: cotyledons are rendered
                    more tumid, the tunics give way, and the radicle begins to protrude. Soon after,
                    the cotyledons separate a little, and become somewhat concave internally. After
                    the third day the radicle has pushed out through the tunics; it is white, except
                    at its point, which is more deeply coloured, and it emits on all sides fine
                    capillary rootlets; the cotyledons are now farther separated, and by degrees the
                    stem of the embryo, with its curved plume, is disclosed.</p>
                <p>About the fifth day the stem <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> fig. 2, mounts upwards: it
                    is white, and bears on its summit the plume <hi rend="italic">e,</hi> still
                    curved, and now becoming green: the stem now also begins to exhibit the marks of
                    knots at particular parts: the radicle/is farther advanced, and small
                    protuberances, the origins of future rootlets, appear on it: the cotyledons <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> retain their place, are turgid and solid, and still
                    surrounded by the lacerated tunics.</p>
                <p>At the close of the seventh day the plantule is much more advanced: the knots on
                    the stem <hi rend="italic">h h,</hi> fig. 3, are quite distinct, and its apex is
                    furnished with broad green leaves, but which are not as yet unfolded. The
                    substance of the cotyledons is still solid, and when compressed yields a
                    bitterish juice: the radicle is much elongated, and has emitted numerous
                    rootlets.</p>
                <p>After the ninth day the plantule is completely formed: its stem <hi rend="italic"
                    >i,</hi> fig. 4, is now erect, and the leaves of the plume <hi rend="italic"
                    >k</hi> are expanded: the cotyledons <hi rend="italic">I</hi> are reduced in
                    size: and the radicle <hi rend="italic">m,</hi> or root as it may now be termed,
                    with its numerous rootlets, is greatly augmented. Every part of the plantule
                    except the cotyledons continues daily to increase: at the end of a month these
                    organs are still found to adhere; but are wrinkled, thin, and exhausted of their
                    nutrient matter, with which the stem and other organs are filled.</p>
                <p>The progress of evolution in those seeds that raise their cotyledons above the
                    earth is exhibited by Malpighi in that of the gourd (<hi rend="italic"
                    >Cucurbita).</hi> This seed is of an oblong figure, and has a flattened form. It
                    possesses three distinct coats or tunics: the outer one is thick, tough, and
                    coriaceous; the middle one thin, membranous, and of a greenish colour; and the
                    inmost is that transparent colourless pellicle that closely invests, and is
                    inseparably connected with, the cotyledons of the seed.</p>
                <p>After this seed has been made to imbibe moisture, the outer and middle tunics
                    readily separate, and expose the <hi rend="italic">nucleus,</hi> which is seen
                    to consist of two leaf-like cotyledons, which have no connection with each
                    other, except by the medium of the little conical body, or radicle, at their
                    base. The size and figure of these cotyledons, and the situation of the radicle
                    that connects them, are represented in fig. 5, Plate XXXIX. Their external
                    surface exhibits to the naked eye prominent lines, which indicate a vascular
                    structure, the vessels of which proceed from the radicle at their base. They are
                    commonly five in number, and from their main fascicular trunks ramifications are
                    produced, which, in their distribution, form a finely reticulated appearance
                    over the whole organ. On their inner side the cotyledons are quite plain, and
                    closely applied against each other, but, as already remarked, are nowhere
                    connected, except at the base. This surface is displayed in fig. 6, in which the
                    great vascularity of the organ is rendered more apparent. It is between the two
                    cotyledons that the plume, consisting of minute convoluted leaves, is lodged and
                    cherished. In fig. 7 a part of the nucleus of this seed is represented a little
                    enlarged, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096601?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6601-0080"/> the two cotyledons have been removed at different
                    places by transverse sections, to show more clearly the situation of the radicle
                    and plume. The letter <hi rend="italic">n</hi> denotes the place from which one
                    of the cotyledons has been removed, so as to bring the plume <hi rend="italic"
                    >o</hi> into view; and <hi rend="italic">p</hi> points to the conical radicle
                    below.</p>
                <p>When this seed has been twenty-four hours m circumstances favourable to its
                    germination, it is rendered tumid, and the umbilical aperture at its base is
                    enlarged by the swelling of the parts within: the cotyledons become turgid, and
                    the plume is augmented in size. After the second day the outer coat is much
                    softened, the middle one appears as if torn and decaying, and all the parts
                    within still further augmented in size. During the third day the colour of the
                    outer tunic becomes darker, the cotyledons are more swollen, their vessels more
                    conspicuous, and the radicle pushes out through the umbilical aperture·</p>
                <p>When the fourth day has elapsed, the plantule is still retained within the
                    tunics; and if these be now removed and examined, the middle one is found to be
                    dry and thin: the cotyledons <hi rend="italic">(q,</hi> fig. 8) are whitish,
                    soft, and flexible, but the vessels on their surface are much more distinct: the
                    radicle <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is elongated and covered with down, as likewise
                    is the stem <hi rend="italic">s.</hi> At the top of the radicle a protuberance
                    is seen, which is white and soft; and farther down appear several smaller
                    tumours, indicating the places of rootlets about to break out.</p>
                <p>About the sixth day the cotyledons <hi rend="italic">t,</hi> fig. 9, emerge from
                    beneath the tunics, representing the “dissimilar leaves” of Grew, and the
                    “seminal leaves” of Malpighi, but which we shall in future denominate <hi
                    rend="italic">cotyledonous leaves.</hi> They are thick, soft, and a little
                    separated from each other; their position is pendent; the colour yellowish; they
                    are very vascular, and between them the plume is still concealed. The radicle
                    <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> at this period, is much elongated, and rootlets
                    everywhere spring from its sides; the stem <hi rend="italic">v</hi> is also
                    lengthened and curved, and, in common with the radicle, is everywhere covered
                    with a white curling down.</p>
                <p>Towards the ninth day the cotyledonous leaves <hi rend="italic">(x,</hi> fig. 10)
                    assume an erect position. At their points they are still yellowish, but
                    elsewhere green, and their cellular tissue is filled with a greenish-yellow
                    juice; they begin to separate a little, but still entirely conceal the plume.
                    The stem <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> at this period, is greatly elongated, and its
                    lower extremity has become green; the protuberance that existed at this part is
                    greatly lessened; and below it the radicle <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is
                    continued, from which numerous rootlets, covered with capillary productions,
                    break out.</p>
                <p>During the following days the cotyledonous leaves continue to enlarge, the stem
                    to elongate, and the plume to augment in size; but it is not yet unfolded. About
                    the twenty-first day the development of the plantule appears to be completed. A
                    representation of its foliage at this period is given in fig. 13; the
                    cotyledonous leaves, <hi rend="italic">a',</hi> have now reached a great size,
                    are of a deep green colour, and very vascular: they rise by a short pedicle from
                    the summit of the stem. On each leaf seven fasciculi of vessels are visible,
                    which, beyond the middle, terminate in a nét-work, from which is produced the
                    cellular structure that contributes to form the breadth of the leaf. In the
                    axil, formed by the cotyledonous leaves, the plume <hi rend="italic">b</hi> lay
                    concealed; it is now disclosed by the removal of one of those leaves. At first
                    the leaves of the plume are curled and convoluted, but afterwards they expand,
                    and their figure is then seen to differ entirely from that of the cotyledonous
                    leaves; they have notched margins, and their surface is covered with down. In
                    this manner the young plant continues to increase, and acquires at length∣ 'its
                    full magnitude, in the progress towards which the co-' tyledonous leaves waste
                    gradually, and finally fall.</p>
                <p>The seeds of the radish <hi rend="italic">(Raphanus),</hi> of the lettuce: <hi
                    rend="italic">(Lactuca),</hi> and of the kidney-bean <hi rend="italic"

                    evolution, a si- <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> milar succession of appearances.
                    In all these seeds, and in many others of this division, the radicle first
                    pierces the seminal tunics; next the cotyledons come into view, and assume
                    generally the form of leaves, between which the tender plume is for a time
                    concealed, and at a later period is disclosed. In different seeds, however, the
                    forms of these organs, and the periods of their successive evolution, are
                    subject to the greatest variation, not only as relates to the species of seed,
                    but to the soil, the climate, and season in which it is destined to grow.</p>
                <p>Having thus surveyed the changes in <hi rend="italic">external</hi> form: which
                    the germinating seed exhibits, we shall conclude <hi rend="superscript"> s</hi>
                    our description by a display of the peculiarities of its <hi rend="italic">in-'
                    ŧernal</hi> structure. This we shall find to consist entirely of vessels and
                    cellular tissue, variously proportioned and combined. In a longitudinal section
                    of the radicle of the pea in an early stage, Malpighi represents it, as in fig.
                    11, to be composed entirely of cellular tissue exteriorly, in the centre of
                    which the vascular system, separating at the top into three divisions to supply
                    the plume and cotyledons, is placed. A similar section of the radicle (fig. 14)
                    on the seventh day exhibits corresponding sections of the rootlets it puts
                    forth; which are seen also to consist of cellular tissue, and of vessels that
                    come off from the central fasciculus of the radicle.</p>
                <p>The stem, when about a month old, is composed of a thick bark formed of cellular
                    tissue, within which are several fasciculi of vessels. In some very thin slices
                    of the stem of the pea, viewed through a microscope of considerable power, the
                    arrangement and distribution of the vessels and cellular tissue appeared to us
                    as represented in fig. 15. The centre of the stem was occupied by cellular
                    tissue, round which was a zone of vessels, <hi rend="italic">c,'</hi> forming
                    four principal fasciculi. Exterior to this zone was a small ring of thickened
                    cellular tissue, and beyond this the proper cellular substance of the bark. Near
                    the circumference of the stem were four larger fasciculi, which may probably be
                    considered as the “proper vessels,” while those near the centre may be deemed
                    the sap-vessels.</p>
                <p>In the plantule of the gourd a similar structure is observable. In fig. 19 is
                    represented a longitudinal section of its stem and radicle on the ninth day, as
                    given by Malpighi. In this stem the vessels are disposed in a circle that
                    surrounds the pith; but as they descend towards the root, they approach each
                    other, and give off ramifications to form the rootlets. In a transverse section
                    of the stem, on the 21st day, Malpighi describes it as hollow in the centre,
                    around which six fasciculi of vessels are disposed, and the intermediate portion
                    is occupied by cellular tissue. Hedwig and Kieser, however, enumerate not fewer
                    than ten fasciculi of vessels in the stem of this plant, some of which are
                    placed next the pith, and others near to the bark, as in fig. 28.</p>
                <p>To these representations of the structure of the pea and gourd by Malpighi, we
                    shall add that of the bean in its early stages, as delineated by Grew, who has
                    traced the distribution of the vessels in the radicle and cotyledons with great
                    minuteness. In fig. 12, Plate XXXlX., is exhibited a vertical section of a young
                    bean, which is made to pass through the cotyledons, the plume, and radicle. From
                    the extremity of the radicle the vessels ascend in fasciculi to the neck of the
                    plantule, where they are seen to diverge towards each cotyledon, and ramify
                    through it, while a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096614?mode=fullsize"

                    plume. In fig. 20 the vascular and cellular structures of the germinating 'bean
                    are shown in conjunction, in a highly magnified representation, presented here
                    in a reduced size from Grew. In this figure <hi rend="italic">d'</hi> denotes

                <p>In the foregoing chapter we have traced the successive changes of form which the
                    seed exhibits in its progress to constitute the perfect plant; we have next to
                    display the structure of the plant itself in its more remarkable varieties and
                    forms. The leading features of this structure have already been laid before the
                    reader when discoursing on the <hi rend="italic">common textures</hi> of plants:
                    it remains now to exhibit individual examples of it, as they occur in the
                    several members of the trunk, the branch, and the root.</p>
                <p>Botanists employ different terms to distinguish the different kinds of stems or
                    stalks that support the leaves and the organs of fructification. These are the
                    stem <hi rend="italic">(caulis),</hi> which is considered peculiar to herbaceous
                    plants; the trunk <hi rend="italic">(truncus),</hi> which is proper to herbs and
                    trees; the straw <hi rend="italic">(culmus),</hi> which is the appropriate stem
                    of the grasses; and the stalk <hi rend="italic">(scapus),</hi> which differs
                    from the other varieties in bearing flowers only, and not leaves. For the
                    peculiarities in external form and character which distinguish these several
                    kinds of stems, as they occur in different species of plants, we must refer to
                    the writers on botany; and shall proceed to exhibit a general outline of their
                    internal structure.</p>
                <p>Perhaps there is no plant in which the simplicity of vegetable organization is
                    more clearly displayed than in the sugar-cane, which belongs to the family of
                    <hi rend="italic">Graminece.</hi> In its stem or culm the cells and vessels are
                    comparatively large, retain much of their more perfect forms, and are quite
                    distinct from each other. When treating of the cellular tissue we referred to
                    the cells of this plant exhibited in the very thin transverse slice, fig. 16,
                    Plate XXXIX., as illustrative of their hexagonal figure, and of their being
                    bounded on every side apparently by a single membrane. In some parts, when the
                    observer is viewing these cells through the microscope, some of them appear
                    quite transparent, from the upper and lower bounding membranes being entirely
                    removed, and the light, in consequence, being freely transmitted; but in others
                    one or both of these membranes remain, and though they are exquisitely thin,
                    yet, when viewed by a strongly reflected hght, a degree of refraction seems to
                    be produced, which communicates to the surface of the membrane an irregu-ar
                    appearance, such as it has been attempted to express in the darker cells of the
                    same figure. The deception that arises from viewing two layers of these cells in
                    conjunction, which imparts the appearance of double sides, as in fig. 21, was
                    before noticed; and the longitudinal appearance of the same organs, as seen both
                    in a single and double series of columns (fig. 22 and 23) was at the same time
                    described.</p>
                <p>It is through this cellular structure that the vessels which constitute the other
                    component part of the culm of this plant are distributed. They occur in
                    fasciculi, which, towards the centre, are placed at considerable distances from
                    each other, and preserve a symmetrical arrangement; but nearer to the
                    circumference they are more numerous, and their distribution is much less
                    regular. In fig. 25, Plate XXXIX., a very thin transverse slice of this plant is
                    exhibited, in which this regular disposition of the vessels at and near the
                    centre <hi rend="italic">st s</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> r</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and their crowded state near the
                    circumference <hi rend="italic">ť,</hi> are well shown; the cells, too, at the
                    centre are larger, and have a more perfect form than those near the
                    circumference of the figure. In fig. 27 a very thin longitudinal slice of this
                    same plant is delineated; it is considerably magnified; the letter <hi
                    rend="italic">u'</hi> denotes the cellular tissue, and <hi rend="italic">d
                    v'</hi> two fasciculi of vessels which ascend through it.</p>
                <p>In the palm, which, though belonging to the division of trees, we shall notice in
                    this place, a similar disposition of the elementary organs is observed; but both
                    the vessels and cells are smaller than in the sugar-cane, and the fasciculi of
                    vessels are also much more numerous. This structure is exhibited in the
                    transverse section of the trunk of the palm, fig. 26, in which the dark spots
                    indicate the vascular fasciculi, and the whiter portion the cellular tissue. As
                    before observed in the sugar-cane, the vessels are seen to be less numerous at
                    the centre than at the circumference, where they are much crowded together, and
                    very irregularly distributed, in consequence of the peculiar mode in which the
                    growth,of these trees is accomplished.</p>
                <p>In fig. 24 of the same plate we have also copied from Μ. Desfonta,ines a portion
                    of the longitudinal section of the trunk of another species of palm <hi
                    rend="italic">(dracaena draco),</hi> which displays more clearly the irregular
                    direction which the vessels take in the lax cellular tissue through which they
                    are distributed. It was before remarked that these plants do not naturally
                    produce branches, but that their vascular system is expended wholly in the
                    production of leaves at their summit, and their trunk is perfectly cylindrical.
                    If, however, the top of the plant has been cut off, or broken by accident, a
                    division into branches is said to take place. <hi rend="italic">(Mém. de
                    ľlnstit. Nat.</hi> tome i. p. 486.)</p>
                <p>As in these plants the ligneous and cortical textures are uniformly blended
                    together through the entire stem, it must be presumed that the sap-vessels and
                    <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> vessels are everywhere associated. This fact is
                    accordingly pointed out by Malpighi as occurring in several species of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> who, as we before remarked, delineates a <hi
                    rend="italic">proper</hi> vessel as existing in each fasciculus of
                    sap-vessels.</p>
                <p>The next variety of structure we shall notice is that of certain herbaceous
                    plants, in which the proportion of cel-, lular tissue in the stem much exceeds
                    that of vessels; and, though belonging to the division of dicotyledons, they in
                    several points resemble in structure those just described. In a section of the
                    pea already given (fig. 15, Plate XXXIX.) the greater portion of the stem was
                    seen to be made up of cellular tissue, through which several fasciculi of
                    vessels were dispersed. The stem of the gourd has been examined with great
                    minuteness by Μ. Kieser, who has represented in several sections, both
                    transverse and longitudinal, its appearance in different parts at different
                    periods of its growth. The total number of fasciculi of vessels that exist in
                    the mature stem of this plant he <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096627?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6627-0082"/> makes, with
                    Hedwig, to be ten; but the number of vessels in each fasciculus he shows to vary
                    at different periods, and in different parts of the same plant, according to
                    their relative age. In fig. 28, Plate XXXIX., is a piece of the stem of the
                    gourd, cut horizontally near the root, of its natural size and appearance, as
                    represented by Kieser. The portion <hi rend="italic">ľ</hi> of this figure is
                    represented in fig. 29, magnified 130 times: it comprehends only <hi
                    rend="italic">one</hi> of the 10 fasciculi of vessels that exist in the stem. In
                    this magnified view the letters <hi rend="italic">m'm’</hi> indicate the
                    elongated cells of the bark; <hi rend="italic">rid</hi> the larger cells, which
                    form the parenchyma of the stem; <hi rend="italic">d d</hi> the cells which
                    surround the fasciculus of spiral vessels; <hi rend="italic">p'</hi> /the
                    fasciculus of spirals, containing 29 vessels, in part simple and in part
                    punctuated spirals; <hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    j</hi><hi rend="italic">ι</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> t</hi> the great
                    cells situated towards the centre of the stem: at <hi rend="italic">(į</hi> are
                    four spiral vessels of different sizes, filled more or less with small
                    punctuated vesicles, which spring from the walls of the vessel, and in two
                    instances nearly close up their cavities.</p>
                <p>The horizontal sections of the stem of the gourd exhibited above are taken from
                    the same plant as the vertical sections of the vessels in figures 13, 14, 15,
                    &amp;c., Plate XXXVIII. The number of fasciculi that exist in the stem of this
                    plant is 10; but the number of vessels in each fasciculus continuallyincreases
                    as the plant approaches maturity, and varies even in different parts with the
                    different stages of its growth. Thus, of six sections made of the stem, that
                    taken near the summit, and therefore of latest growth, exhibits only six or
                    seven vessels in each of the 10 fasciculi, corresponding in this respect with
                    the number found near the bottom in the earliest stage of growth. In the next
                    section, made through the internodial space below, the vessels in each
                    fasciculus have increased both in number and size; in the third section, the
                    vessels have still further increased in size, and in number amount to 19 in each
                    bundle; still lower down, in the fourth internode of the same stem, both the
                    number and size of the vessels go on augmenting. In the fifth section, taken at
                    the largest part of the stem, a still further increase in size is found, and the
                    number in each fasciculus amounts to 23 vessels. Again, the section made in the
                    stem of the same plant very near the root, and taken at a more advanced age in
                    autumn, exhibits vessels approaching in character to those of the ligneous part
                    of trees, and now amounting to 29 in each fasciculus. It is this last section
                    which we have copied above in fig. 28 and 29, where the vessels may be seen
                    smallest next the pith, and gradually increasing in size as they recede from the
                    centre towards the circumference. Lastly, in a section of the branch of the root
                    of the same plant, in place of 10 fasciculi of vessels met with in the stem and
                    in the principal root, there were only four, but each fasciculus contained 37
                    vessels: the cells of this part were smaller than in the stem, and the whole
                    construction was comparatively more vascular and compact.</p>
                <p>The general characters of these vessels, from the earliest period of their
                    development to the mature state of the plant, and the successive changes in
                    size, in form, and appearance which they undergo, have been already exhibited in
                    the series of figures 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 19, of Plate XXXVIII., representing
                    vertical sections, corresponding to the horizontal ones just described. As the
                    plant increases in age the vessels augment in number, and in character they
                    approach to those of arborescent plants: their sides are thickened, their
                    transparency is almost lost, and the cavities of some are filled by vesicles.
                    The balance, also, in the different orders of vessels at mature age is nearly
                    the reverse of that which obtains in youth. In the young stem, says Kieser, the.
                    <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> spirals are to the punctuated variety as 17 to 6,.
                    while in the adult plant there are only 6 simple spirals to 23 of the
                    punctual-ed variety in the stem; and in the root the simple spirals, which at
                    first were equally visible, have altogether disap- <hi rend="superscript">
                    v</hi> peared. A metamorphosis of the simple' into the more complex varieties of
                    vessel must, therefore, during th <hi rend="subscript"> e</hi> progress of
                    growth, be deemed to take place.</p>
                <p>In the stem of the gourd, as thus described, we observe an arrangement of parts
                    in many respects agreeing with that of the sugar-cane. In both, the cells in
                    certain parts are large, and their figure is well preserved; and the vessels are
                    distributed in distinct fasciculi through the cellular tissue. In the gourd,
                    however, the fasciculi are fewer in number, and do not suffer that displacement
                    during the progress of vegetation which those of the cane experience. In neither
                    plant are the vessels so numerous, or so situate, as to compress the cellular
                    tissue into transverse partitions; nor is there in the transverse section of
                    either any ’ appearance of concentric layers. In neither stem is there any
                    proper pith, the central part of the sugar-cane being occupied by cells and
                    vessels, and that of the gourd being alike destitute of both.</p>
                <p>In the sections of various herbaceous stems represented by Grew and Malpighi, the
                    number of vessels and their disposition exhibit the greatest variety, and
                    approach more or less to the arrangement of parts that is found in shrubs and
                    trees. Thus, in holly-hock <hi rend="italic">(Alcea)</hi> Grew describes the
                    vessels of the bark as yielding a thin mucilage, and within them are the
                    sap-vessels, postured in short rays, which comprise twelve or sixteen vessels.
                    In <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Scot-</hi><hi rend="italic">∑onera,</hi> the
                    “proper vessels” in the bark yield a milky fluid, and are postured in a radiated
                    manner with the sap and spiral vessels that extend to the pith, all of which
                    form parts of the same radiated lines. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi>
                    p. 103.) In endive, Malpighi describes the structure of the stem as approaching
                    in character to that of trees. Near the circumference the vessels, says he, are
                    disposed in lines directed towards the centre, and are separated by small ranges
                    of cellular tissue, which is compressed into a solid and dense form; and more
                    interiorly the vessels are larger, and extend a considerable way in rays through
                    the stem. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 25.) Where the vessels have
                    this radiated position, the cellular tissue between them assumes the form of
                    membranous partitions; but the greater portion of the stem of this plant is
                    occupied by cellular tissue, not thus compressed into a membranous form. We thus
                    clearly observe that, even in herbaceous stems, membranous partitions, extending
                    more or less completely through the stem, are formed, whenever the vessels are
                    disposed in radii, and are sufficiently numerous to compress, on either side,
                    the cellular tissue that envelopes them.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Trunk in Shrubs and
                    Trees.</hi></p>
                <p> In shrubs and trees the several textures that compose the trunk are-commonly
                    distinct from each other; and some parts that are but imperfectly distinguished
                    in herbs become in them well defined. In the trunks of these plants, however,
                    though a general uniformity of structure is observed, yet particular
                    modifications of it exist in every species, and these are still further varied
                    by the peculiar nature of the individual plant, and the mode and circumstances
                    of its vegetation. Before descending to particular examples, it may be useful to
                    exhibit a concise view of the parts that compose the trunk, and the terms
                    employed to denote them.</p>
                <p>Externally in every tree we have the skin or cuticle, ' the structure of which
                    has been already described in a former section. In very young plants, and in
                    young <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096640?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6640-0083"/> branches, it is succulent, and its surface is
                    entire; but in older trunks and branches it is frequently dried and 'broken, and
                    in some instances is thrown off; so that the exterior covering of the plant
                    appears to be formed by the cellular tissue of the cortical texture.</p>
                <p>Beneath the skin is the bark, constructed, as we have seen, of cellular tissue,
                    and of vessels collected into fasciculi, which at first are straight, and run
                    parallel to each other; but, by the subsequent augmentation of the parts within,
                    are separated at certain places, and touch only at a few points, so as to form a
                    reticulated appearance. In the annual shoot only a single ring of vessels is
                    observed, and these, with the tissue in which they are placed, form the <hi
                    rend="italic">cortical layer,</hi> as it has been called, of that period. Within
                    this layer a new produetion of vessels and of cellular tissue takes place; and
                    this being annually repeated, constitutes the series of layers of which the bark
                    is ultimately composed. The new layer that is thus annually formed, and which
                    appears to exercise an active vegetative function, was more particularly
                    distinguished by the appellation of <hi rend="italic">liber</hi> by the
                    ancients, from its being the substance on which, before the invention of paper,
                    they were accustomed to write. Very frequently, instead of a ring, the vessels
                    of the bark are collected into distinct parcels or clusters, which, in the
                    progress of vegetation, assume very different shapes.</p>
                <p>Next to the bark is placed the wood, constructed, like the bark, of vessels and
                    eellular tissue. Like it, too, it consists, in the young plant and in the annual
                    shoot of the older one, of a single ring of vessels, which immediately surrounds
                    the pith. In the following year a new ring of vessels is formed around the
                    first, and in every succeeding year this process is repeated; so that the wood
                    consists at length of a series of rings inclosing each other, the number of
                    which denotes the age of the tree. The outer ring of newly formed vessels is
                    more succulent than those of older growth, and is generally of a whiter colour;
                    whence it has received the names of sap-wood or <hi rend="italic">alburnum.</hi>
                    By Du Hamel and most French writers it was named <hi rend="italic">aubier,</hi>
                    and by Hill it was called the <hi rend="italic">blea.</hi> In every annual shoot
                    the newly formed liber and alburnum are in contact, but in every succeeding year
                    they are separated more and more from each other by the interposition of new
                    matter between them; so that at length die first layer of bark and the first
                    ring of wood occupy respectively positions the most distant; those, namely, of
                    the centre and circumference of the tree.</p>
                <p>The vessels that are thus annually formed, and constitute the alburnum, are
                    disposed in <hi rend="italic">radii</hi> which extend more or less completely
                    from the circumference to the centre. In some trees the vessels are much more
                    numerous than in others; and, in the progress pf vegetation, they frequently
                    suffer great alterations in size and <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> external
                    figure, as was before observed when treating of the vascular system. In the
                    alburnum die size of the vessels is very uniform, and so it continues ever after
                    in some trees; but in others it is very various, some being enlarged more than
                    others by a greater influx of sap. With this increase of size the vessels seem
                    to acquire the spiral character. They are also frequently closed up in the more
                    aged parts of trees, by the production of vesicles within their cavities; and,
                    in common with the smaller vessels and the cells, they are in some trees
                    ultimately filled with gummy or resinous matter. In other instances, where the
                    “proper juices” of the plant differ but little in quality from the common sap,
                    the vessels, when no longer employed inactive vegetation, become dry, and appear
                    in some plants hke empty capillary tubes; and in others, from the minuteness of
                    their size, no aperture is visible. In this state they have been regarded as
                    solid filaments, and denominated the <hi rend="italic">ligneous fibres</hi> of
                    the plant.</p>
                <p>From the disposition of the vessels in <hi rend="italic">radii</hi> more or less
                    regular, the eellular tissue by which they are surrounded will be more or less
                    compressed in the same direction, and form those transverse partitions between
                    the several rays of vessels which we have already so frequently noticed. In
                    addition to these fine partitions, described both by Grew and Malpighi, which
                    are thus interposed between every ray or line of vessels, larger portions of
                    cellular-tissue are observed at certain distances, which extend in the same
                    direction through the wood, and in some instances are continued through the bark
                    also. By the authors just mentioned these partitions were described as
                    stretching from the bark towards the pith, and were named <hi rend="italic"
                    >insertments</hi> by Grew, and <hi rend="italic">transverse utricular
                    ranges</hi> by Malpighi. Others have held them to proceed rather from the pith
                    to the bark, and have called them <hi rend="italic">medullary rays.</hi> We
                    shall venture to name them in future <hi rend="italic">transverse septa,</hi>
                    which appellation denotes simply their direction, and the fact of their forming
                    partitions between the vessels, without having any reference to their origin.
                    For similar reasons, the finer partitions of cellular tissue, pre-, viously
                    described, maybe denominated the <hi rend="italic">lesser transverse
                    septa.</hi></p>
                <p>Beside these transverse septa, there are sometimes portions of cellular tissue
                    intercepting the vessels in a longitudinal direction. This was remarked both by
                    Grew and Malpighi in the oak and several other trees: they appear sometimes to
                    be very short, and sometimes to form nearly a continuous ring around the trunk.
                    It is probable they are formed simply by the pressure of the vessels acting in a
                    direction opposite to that by which the transverse septa are produced: they may,
                    for distinction’s sake, be named the <hi rend="italic">longitudinal septa.</hi>
                    In many trees they are not to be observed, or, if they exist, are so thin as to
                    form only a sort of <hi rend="italic">fascia</hi> on the adjacent vessels. To
                    the cellular tissue promiscuously intermingled with the vessels some writers
                    give the name of <hi rend="italic">parenchyma</hi> of the wood: others term the
                    elongated cells of this part ligneous fibres.</p>
                <p>The only other part of the trunk that remains to be ’ mentioned is the pith. It
                    is situated at the centre, and is surrounded commonly by a ring of vessels, but
                    sometimes in part by thickened cellular tissue. Its proportion in shrubs is
                    usually much larger than in trees; and in the young shoots of trees it occupies
                    more space than in the older branches. At first in the young plant it is
                    succulent, but afterwards becomes dry; and in aged trees it frequently is
                    entirely obliterated, or at least rendered solid.</p>
                <p>In a description of the growth of the trunk in a young plant of chesnut, Malpighi
                    has given clear views of the gradual development of these several parts, and
                    exhibited the appearances successively displayed in the first years of growth.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> 'p. 35.) In the vine some of these parts
                    are very distinct. Fig.L Plate XL., represents a transverse section of the
                    annual shoot of this plant. The pith <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> in the centre, is
                    large, and composed of cells of different sizes. From the pith to the skin in
                    the vine, and, according to Grew, in the elm and some other trees, extend the
                    transverse septa <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> In some places the cellular structure
                    of these septa in the recent plant is still visible, as at c; but generally they
                    have the appearance of thickened membranes. Between every two septa two or
                    sometimes three lines or rays of sap-vessels are interposed, which from their
                    size are readily visible, and their place and disposition are indicated by the
                    dotted marks <hi rend="italic">dĩ</hi> the circular ring that bounds these sap
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096653?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6653-0084"/>
                    vessels seems to be formed of condensed cellular tissue, and exterior to it the
                    “proper vessels” are placed in the cellular tissue of the bark.</p>
                <p>In the next figure (fig. 2) is exhibited the transverse section of an
                    apple-branch of one year s growth, which, like the former, is considerably
                    magnified. The angulated figure and relative size of the pith at this period are
                    shown. From the pith to the bark proceed numerous very fine septa, possessing
                    somewhat of a curved direction; and between them innumerable black points,
                    indicating the sap-vessels, are seen. These vessels are disposed in radii, and
                    are bounded exteriorly by the thickened tissue of the bark: the bark is
                    proportionally large, and in die midst of its cellular tissue clusters of
                    “proper vessels,” e, are observed. <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi></p>
                <p>In a similar section of the apple-branch of two years growth, fig. 3, more highly
                    magnified, the pith/ is seen to have assumed a rounder form: from the pith
                    towards the bark the transverse septa extend, between which the vascular radii
                    are situate. The letter <hi rend="italic">g</hi> denotes the place of junction
                    of the two years’ growth; <hi rend="italic">h</hi> the newly formed alburnous
                    vessels, situate between the bark and the wood; and <hi rend="italic">i</hi> two
                    ranges of “proper vessels,” placed in the cellular tissue of the bark. Grew
                    gives a highly magnified view of a section of this same plant about the third
                    year of its growth, in the 25th table of his work, the appearances of which
                    correspond with those just related, except that the transverse septa, as in all
                    his figures, are made to represent straight lines, which, in the earlier periods
                    of vegetable growth, does not appear to be quite correct.: Proceeding next to
                    the plant of more mature age, we shall copy from Grew part of a section of the
                    oak, which in fig. 4 is exhibited on a reduced scale. The letter <hi
                    rend="italic">k</hi> denotes the bark, <hi rend="italic">I</hi> the alburnum,
                    <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the wood, and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the pith. In
                    this section the larger transverse septa <hi rend="italic">o,</hi> and the
                    smaller ones <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> are very distinct, between which the
                    sap-vessels of different sizes, indicated by the dark points, are situate; the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">q</hi> points to the “proper vessels” of the bark, some
                    of which are collected into round parcels, and others form a ring.</p>
                <p>Beside the transverse septa that intersect the diameter of the tree, we observe,
                    in this figure, other lines, <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> placed at right angles to
                    them, and which appear to be interposed between each annual ring of wood. Grew
                    considered it probable that these lines were produced in the oak, and also in
                    the fig-tree and walnut, by a peculiar sort of sap-vessels that existed once in
                    the bark, as did the turpentine vessels distributed through the wood of the
                    pine. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 115.) Hill also calls them
                    sapvessels seated on the outer edge of each annual circle, which in the young
                    plant contain sometimes a limpid liquor, and at other times appear empty. He
                    notices also the existence of “proper vessels,” containing a thick juice in the
                    alburnum of this tree. <hi rend="italic">(On the Construction of Timber,</hi> p.
                    9.)</p>
                <p>An examination of this wood at an age still more advanced may contribute to throw
                    some further light on its structure. In fig. 5 is given the representation of a
                    transverse section of the central portion of a piece of the wood of very old
                    oak, of its natural size and appearance. The pith <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> at
                    the centre, was completely obstructed, and its cellular character obliterated;
                    the letters <hi rend="italic">t11</hi> denote the larger transverse septa,
                    rendered completely solid everywhere, and in some places partially obliterated;
                    and <hi rend="italic">u</hi> the white lines that extend in the opposite
                    direction, and mark the boundaries of each year’s growth. In the substance of
                    these concentric lines numerous traces of minute apertures were visible; and
                    from one line to another, small irregularly curved lines, as represented in the
                    drawing, were everywhere observed to extend. No vacuity was anywhere perceived
                    to exist, but the whole formed one compact and solid mass.</p>
                <p>A small and very thin slice of this wood, comprising a part of one of the larger
                    transverse septa, and small portions of two of the concentric lines above
                    mentioned, was submitted to a pretty highly magnifying power; and a delineation
                    of its appearance is given m fig. 6. In this figure the letters <hi
                    rend="italic">v v</hi> denote the two concentric lines; <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                    one of the smaller irregular lines that frequently extend from <hi rend="italic"
                    >V</hi> to <hi rend="italic">V,</hi> but are often intercepted, and form
                    irregular spots or patches, as traced in several parts of the drawing; <hi
                    rend="italic">x</hi> the smaller transverse septa, situated at unequal distances
                    from each other; and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> the larger septum, the cellular
                    character of which is entirely obliterated. Several small irregular lines,
                    running in the same· direction with the larger concentric ones, are also
                    observed: these, at their junctions with the lesser transverse septa, produce a
                    number of little squares, the areae of which are filled up with a dotted or
                    punctuated membrane.</p>
                <p>This microscopical representation seems to confirm the opinion of Grew, that the
                    concentric lines <hi rend="italic">v v</hi> are chiefly composed of vessels; for
                    their apertures, now rendered visible, are of different sizes, and the canal of
                    many of the larger ones is filled up with a vesicular substance, often observed
                    in the vessels of aged plants. The substance that surrounds these vessels
                    appears to be condensed cellular tissue, rendered perfectly solid by the
                    resinous matter with which it is filled. The irregular thickened lines <hi
                    rend="italic">w</hi> that run transversely to the former are similarly composed
                    of vessels and condensed cellular tissue; and the smaller patches, we have
                    noticed, are made up of the same. Both the large and small transverse septa
                    consist of condensed cellular tissue alone; and such, too, appears to be the
                    matter of which the fine lines or longitudinal septa that intersect them are
                    composed. Some observations of Du Hamel on the formation of the ligneous layers
                    may aid our inquiries into the nature of these latter septa, and the minute
                    structure of the wood.</p>
                <p>In a transverse section of the trunk of the oak, the elm, or the fir, says this
                    very intelligent writer, the ligneous layers are distinctly visible, and it is
                    commonly believed that each of these layers is the product of one year’s growth.
                    If, however, we cut obliquely a piece of oak, each layer is then seen, with the
                    aid of a common lens, to be composed of a number of thinner layers, which
                    mutually cover each other. By macerating pieces of wood in water, he was able to
                    separate the annual layers into a great number of leaflets, thinner than the
                    finest paper; and these primary layers, as they may be called, he afterwards
                    ascertained by experiment to be formed successively during, the whole period of
                    active vegetation; so that the layer which is the product of one year’s growth
                    is itself formed of a number of layers exceedingly thin. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome i. p. 31, and tome ii. p. 19.)</p>
                <p>Now it is probable that between each of these primary layers cellular tissue is
                    interposed; and this tissue, by its compression, gives origin to the minute
                    lines which in this tree have been noticed. In several trees, however, no
                    similar lines are visible, because in all probability they do not, like the oak,
                    afford secretions by which the tissue is thickened and rendered apparent. Even
                    in a very thin slice of oak, when viewed in the microscope by a strongly
                    reflected light, these lines almost entirely vanish, while those of the two
                    orders of proper transverse septa remain.</p>
                <p>M.Kieser examined the same wood in the transverse slice ∣ of a tree 100 years of
                    age: and his representation of its structure is copied in fig. 23, Plate XL. In

                    the parenchyma 'of the wood. At the top and bottom, the cells are obstructed and
                    appear like obscure points (as is the case also in fig. 6 of the same plate);
                    but in the middle of the figure the cavities of the cells are said to be still
                    visible: the letters <hi rend="italic">U U</hi> denote the apertures of enlarged
                    spiral vessels, all of which were filled with vesicles, but a few only are so
                    represented, as in <hi rend="italic">d</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">ď</hi> indicates the smaller vessels dispersed through the
                    cellular tissue; <hi rend="italic">d</hi> a portion of one of the larger septa,
                    and <hi rend="italic">f'</hi> the smaller ones, which are often displaced by the
                    augmentation in the size of the vessels.*</p>
                <p>In this highly magnified representation by Kieser, there is no appearance of the
                    concentric lines or septa which intersect the transverse ones, as noticed by
                    Grew and Malpighi, and exhibited in fig. 5 and 6; but the two orders of
                    transverse septa remain. We before remarked, that in a slice of wood so very
                    thin as, when viewed by a strong light, to become translucent, these lines in a
                    great measure vanished; and in the figure of Μ. Kieser this evanescence is made
                    to extend even to the thickened portion that intercepts the annual layers. It is
                    therefore probable that all these appearances of concentric or longitudinal
                    septa are produced simply by the thickening and compression of the cellular
                    tissue in the oak, and such other trees as have viscid juices, and whose vessels
                    are subject to irregular enlargement; for in whatever position these thickenings
                    occur, numerous vessels are always to be observed. Hence in very thin slices
                    they entirely vanish, while die proper transverse septa, being formed by the
                    condensation of continuous portions of membrane, remain visible. In these
                    figures it may also be remarked, that the surface occupied by cellular tissue
                    seems equal nearly to that occupied by vessels; but it is probable that the
                    apertures of many minute vessels dispersed through the tissue have not been
                    distinguished from the cells. In a highly magnified representation, however, of
                    the wood of this tree by Grew <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> tab. 3,
                    fig. 7), the proportion of the vascular to what is deemed the cellular part is
                    still less.</p>
                <p>The vessels of the bark in the oak, as delineated by Grew, fig. 4, Plate XL., arc
                    represented as disposed partly in parcels and partly in a ring; and in all the
                    representations he has given of different trees, the greatest diversity in
                    regard to the position of these vessels is found to exist. From the difference
                    in the qualities of their juices, in the texture of the parts, and in the modes
                    and circumstances of their growth, this variation may be expected to occur. In
                    the oak, the pine, and many others, it seems certain also that a part of the
                    cortical texture, or at least vessels containing the “proper juices” of the
                    plant, are constantly mixed with those of the ligneous texture, and with them
                    contribute to form each annual layer of wood. For examples of the diversity of
                    structure exhibited in the trunk of a great many different trees, we may refer
                    to the plates of Grew.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> II.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of the Branch and its Appendages.</hi><hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> I.— <hi rend="italic">Of the Branch.</hi></p>
                <p>From the trunk springs the branch, which in structure resembles very exactly that
                    of the trunk itself; and hence the description of the one serves entirely for
                    that of the other.</p>
                <p>Branches, in common with leaves, originate from buds, of which we have
                    subsequently to treat, introductory to a description of leaves. At present we
                    shall describe only the mode of connection between the trunk and the
                    branch.’</p>
                <p>The branch, says Grew, springs not from the surface, but so deep as to take with
                    it not only the bark and the wood, but the pith also, making its way at the
                    parts where the vessels are separated by the transverse septa, and carrying with
                    it the skin, which is extended with it. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi>
                    p. 28.) The separation of the vessels of the trunk to form the branch is not
                    like the separation of a few filaments from a skein of thread; but they spring,
                    says Du Hamel, from a centre, and bear with them a part of each portion of the
                    tree. Hence, if a tree that is divided into two branches be cut a foot above the
                    bifurcation, the surface of the sections resembles that of two trunks cut
                    horizontally: if the section be made lower down, at the place where the branches
                    spring, the same appearances of two series of concentric circles are seen at the
                    axis of the trunk, but they are surrounded by other layers common to those which
                    belong to each of the branches; and still lower on the trunk the concentric
                    circles belonging to each branch diminish, and are finally lost in those which
                    form the trunk from which they sprang. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 93.) These primary branches divide
                    into others, and these again into still smaller branches, which form angles with
                    each other, more or less great, according to the species of tree, and other
                    causes.</p>
                <p>The position of the branches on different trees is very various, but in the same
                    species it is generally uniform. From the measurements of Du Hamel, it appears
                    that in many trees the solid matter of the branches that go out from the trunk
                    exceeds that of the trunk itself in the proportion nearly of five to four. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p.96.)</p>
                <p>Some have supposed that the branches proceeded always from, and were nourished
                    by, the pith; but this opinion has been combated by Du Hamel and Hill. The
                    latter gives a longitudinal section of the trunk of a species of American
                    dog-wood (copied in fig. 7, Plate XL.), representing the origin of two buds <hi
                    rend="italic">g</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">g</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> which
                    are seen in the state of pushing out on either side through the vessels of the
                    wood. In this trunk the pith is of a brown colour, the inmost ring of vessels
                    green, and the outer ones white. Through the white rings the inner green vessels
                    are seen to shoot, and the brown pith is left entire behind; though the new
                    branch at length obtains a pith for itself, which, however, has no connection
                    with that of the trunk. In a similar section of an older trunk (fig. 8), the
                    branches are seen to spring also from the inmost circle of wood; the pith <hi
                    rend="italic">Ji</hi> is not at all disturbed, but each branch is furnished with
                    its own pith <hi rend="italic">i</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">i'.</hi> In a section
                    of the vine (fig. 9), a similar origin of the branches, from the inmost circle
                    of wood, is observed; and not only is the pith <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> f</hi> of the branch distinct from that of the trunk,
                    but the pith of the trunk itself is intercepted by the shooting of a branch <hi
                    rend="italic">ľ</hi> across it. <hi rend="italic">( On the Construction of
                    Timber,</hi> p. 35.) This latter fact of the interception of the pith by the
                    shooting of a branch across it was previously noticed by Grew in the vine and
                    some other plants. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> tab. 19.)</p>
                <p>. When a bud thus protrudes to form a branch, the perpendicular vessels of the
                    trunk are compelled to separate; and they afterwards meet above, and pursue
                    their former direction. This is shown in fig. 11, Plate XL., copied from Du
                    Hamel, in which the bud <hi rend="italic">ni,</hi> in the act of sprouting, is
                    seen to push to either side the vessels of the trunk, which again meet above
                    it.</p>
                <p>The vessels both of the wood and bark, according to the same author, have their
                    direction determined chiefly <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096679?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6679-0086"/> by the course of the sap. If the sap preserve a
                    perpendicular direction, as in trees that have no branches, the vessels arc
                    perpendicular also; but if it move to one side, these vessels then change their
                    direction. This is strikingly evinced in a tree that has been cut over above a
                    branch; for then all the sap being obliged to pass to the young branch, the
                    vessels all at once take the same direction; so that if a tree has been cut oyer
                    in winter, and at the end of the succeeding spring its branch below be examined,
                    the new vessels of the branch will be seen to cross those of the trunk, as
                    exhibited in fig. 12, <hi rend="italic">n',</hi> Plate XL. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 53.)</p>
                <p>In figures 7, 8, and 9, copied from Hill, the young branch, in every instance, is
                    seen to originate from the inmost ring of vessels that surrounds the pith; and
                    he was of opinion that all buds and branches sprang from this part alone. To
                    this vascular circle he gave the name of <hi rend="italic">corona,</hi> and held
                    it to be the most important part of the vegetable body,—-that it was like no
                    other part of the plant, but contained within itself the essence of them all.
                    <hi rend="italic">(On the Construction of Timber,</hi> p. 21.)</p>
                <p>It is however notorious, that trees in which not only this first circle, but
                    almost every other circle of vessels, has perished, produce leaves and shoots
                    from the trunk where the bark is entire, as this author himself admits, p. 44 of
                    his work. There does not appear, either in the anatomical character, or in the
                    functions of this circle, any thing that distinguishes it from the others,
                    except priority of formation, and its being in consequence the seat from which
                    the <hi rend="italic">first</hi> buds and branches spring.</p>
                <p>A much more correct idea of the origin of buds and branches was entertained by Du
                    Hamel, who illustrates it by the diagram fig. 10, Plate XL. Let us suppose .this
                    figure to represent a tree of four years’ growth, as indicated by the four
                    ligneous cones which at its base envelope each other. In the first year a bud o'
                    springs from the inmost ring, which by the fourth year is seen to consist of
                    four ligneous layers. In the second year a second bud fi springs from the ring
                    of that year, and consists only of three layers; the next year a bud <hi
                    rend="italic">cį</hi> is developed on the first bud <hi rend="italic">o',</hi>
                    and possesses only two layers; and the bud <hi rend="italic">τ</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> j</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> developed the fourth
                    year on the outmost ring of wood, is seen to consist only of one layer. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys, des</hi><hi rend="italic">Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 53.) In
                    this way every ligneous layer may be considered equally capable of giving origin
                    to buds and branches.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> II.— <hi rend="italic">Of Thorns.</hi></p>
                <p>Connected both in origin and in structure with branches are those appendages,
                    frequently observed upon them, called thorns. They are very conspicuous on the
                    hawthorn, and are constituted, says Grew, of the same parts as the bud itself,
                    and in a like proportion. They spring from the outer portion of the ligneous
                    texture, and may be considered as abortive buds. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> p. 33.) Malpighi describes them as being frequently produced in the
                    axils of leaves, and assuming for a time the form of a branch, but at length
                    degenerating into a thorn. He considers them to arise from defective nutrition,
                    and adds, that they disappear frequently under higher culture. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 138.)</p>
                <p>According to Willdenow, most species of our fruit-trees naturally possess thorns,
                    which disappear entirely and become branches under higher culture. Even in the
                    black-thorn the prickles diminish in number under improved culture, but do not
                    entirely disappear.</p>
                <p>Sometimes, however, instead of being produced from abortive buds, thorns owe
                    their origin to the degeneration of other organs; the petioles of some pinnate
                    leaves which arc persistent become thorns, and the same thing is observed of the
                    peduncles of some flowers. Certain stipulae also, as those of Mimosa, are said
                    sometimes to change into thorns <hi rend="italic">(Principles of Botany,</hi> p.
                    270); and in the date, according to Μ. de Candolle, a lobe of the leaf has been
                    converted into a thorn. <hi rend="italic">(Théorie</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Element, de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Botanique,</hi> p. 344.) In other
                    instances, as in the holly, the leaf produces thorns round its entire margin,
                    which are formed by the vessels that bound it. (See fig. 11, Plate XLI.)</p>
                <p>When the bark is removed from a branch that possesses thorns, the thorns still
                    remain, by which they are distinguished from prickles that originate from the
                    bark. In fig. 20, Plate XLI., is a representation of a branch deprived of its
                    bark, in which thorns of different forms are seen to spring from the ligneous
                    texture; and in fig. 21 of the same plate is a longitudinal section of another
                    branch covered with its bark, in which the ligneous and cortical textures of the

                <p>From the similarity in structure which these bodies exhibit to the branches from
                    which they spring, we have placed them as appendages to those members. As is
                    well known, they are met with only in certain plants, and their obvious use is
                    to attach the different parts of the plant to one another, for mutual support,
                    or to the objects in their neighbourhood. In a general manner they are
                    denominated <hi rend="italic">fulcra</hi><hi rend="italic">:</hi> the most
                    remarkable species are those which, like the claws of ivy, called <hi
                    rend="italic">claviculi</hi> by Malpighi, are not rolled into a spiral form; and
                    those of the vine, named tendrils <hi rend="italic">(cirri'),</hi> which possess
                    a spiral conformation.</p>
                <p>According to Malpighi, the claws or claspers of ivy possess a roundish form, and
                    are covered with hairs, which yield a viscous humour, by which they are
                    agglutinated to stones or to walls and trees. Their forms are exhibited in fig.

                    figure, their origin and structure arc displayed. They are seen to spring from
                    the ligneous texture of the stem, and to possess a similar structure.</p>
                <p>The tendril is described by the same author as springing from knots between the
                    origins of leaves. It possesses a round stem, which is sometimes covered with
                    hairs; and this stem frequently divides into several branches. At first it is
                    very tender, but gradually acquires solidity, and assumes the spiral character;
                    its colour is green, and it is composed, like the trunk, of all common textures.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 139.) By Willdenow it is regarded as
                    an abortive leaf, being simply a prolongation of the petiole, without the leafy
                    expansion. <hi rend="italic">(Principles of Botany,</hi> p. 272.) Its form, as
                    it occurs in the vine, is exhibited in fig. 23, Plate XLI.; but in this
                    particular it is subject to the greatest variation.</p>
                <p>The leaf itself, as well as the petiole, is said to be sometimes prolonged into a
                    tortuous appendage resembling the tendril; and similar transformations are
                    sometimes exhibited by the peduncle and petals of the flower. In öne species of
                    vine mentioned by Malpighi, the extremity of the tendril, which is at first
                    pointed, becomes gradually incurvated and reflected, and at length is formed
                    into a roundish body, which is furnished with small papillae, that yield a
                    viscous fluid, by means of which it attaches itself to walls or wood, so
                    strongly as not to be easily separated.</p>

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Roots.</hi></p>
                <p>Considered in relation to their general form, roots, says Μ. de Candolle, exhibit
                    two very distinct appearanees. Some roots have a conical trunk, simple or
                    ramified, but springing always from a single base, and their radicle only
                    elongates or ramifies; others spring always in a bundle, more or less marked,
                    from a common base, whieh is so confounded with the neck of the plant that it is
                    sometimes taken for the base of the stem, and sometimes for the trunk of the
                    root The first form of root is met with in the greater number of exogenous
                    plants; the second occurs chiefly in the endogenous, and also in those exogenes
                    which have fascicular roots.</p>
                <p>Of the <hi rend="italic">conical</hi> roots, some ramify greatly, and have
                    numerous fibrous or capillary rootlets; others produce few or no branches, and
                    are furnished with few fibrous roots. In the former class, the principal
                    differences arise from the degree of ramification; in the latter, two varieties
                    of form are very distinct—that of the carrot, <hi rend="italic">named
                    fusiform,</hi> from its tapering to a point, like a spindle—and that named <hi
                    rend="italic">rapi-form</hi> by De Candolle, from the swollen form it assumes at
                    its origin, and sudden shrinking to a point below, as in the turnip.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">fascicular</hi> roots present also many varieties of form:
                    Is/, Those of the <hi rend="italic">Gramineae,</hi> in which each rootlet,
                    though distinct at its birth, ramifies so much that the divisions resemble the
                    fibrous productions of the preceding class: <hi rend="italic">2dly,</hi> Those
                    of the hyacinth, in which many cylindrical rootlets spring from a common base,
                    and descend nearly parallel, or with a slight divergence: <hi rend="italic"
                    >⅛dly,</hi> Those of the orchis, in which, besides cylindrical rootlets, there
                    are others swollen into tubercles: <hi rend="italic">⅛thly,</hi> Those of
                    Ranunculus, where all the fibres that spring from the base are more or less
                    swollen, so as to form a bundle of oblong tubercles. Between all these distinct
                    forms there are several intermediate varieties. Under the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">tuberous</hi> roots arc included all those which have swellings in
                    any part of their length, and that, too, whether they sprang originally from a
                    single or common base. It may, however, be observed, that many tubercles which
                    spring apparently from roots, are in reality productions from inferior branehes
                    of the stem, concealed beneath the soil, as Μ. Dunal first proved to be the fact
                    in the potato. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 252.)</p>
                <p>The root is held to consist of two parts; the main body with its branches, and
                    the fibrous produetions called capillary rootlets. These parts are commonly hid
                    beneath the soil, but in some plants they are attached to rocks or stones, in
                    others they are fixed in other vegetables. Some plants, again, have no fixed
                    attachment, but float loosely on water; and others are considered to possess no
                    root at all.</p>
                <p>With respeet to <hi rend="italic">structure,</hi> the body of the root of trees,
                    says Malpighi <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 145), maybe regarded as
                    an elongation of the trunk beneath the soil, being constructed of the same
                    textures, disposed nearly in the same manner. In various herbaceous plants the
                    root has been examined wifh much minuteness by Grew. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> book ii.) The cuticle, says he, is of different colours in
                    different plants: sometimes its surface is smooth, at others rough; and its
                    texture is cither thin and transparent, or thick and opaque. At an early period
                    the cuticle appears to be a continuation of that of the radicle, but afterwards
                    seems to be derived from the bark. It is composed chiefly of cellular tissue,
                    through which vessels are distributed in the direction of the length of the
                    root. The existence of these vessels, though scarcely visible by the microscope,
                    may be inferred from the fact that it is more difficult to tear the skin in a
                    longitudinal than transverse direction. If, also, the skin be cut transversely,
                    and then allowed to dry, all the parts where there are no vessels shrink beloιv
                    the surface of the cut end; but where there are vessels there is no shrinking.
                    Or if, after making a transverse section of the root, the skin be pressed very
                    gently with the edge of the nail, sap will sometimes arise from the skin, as
                    from any other part where vessels are placed; which does not happen with fluids
                    contained in the cellular tissue, unless the cells be broken. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.</hi> p. 62.)</p>
                <p>Beneath the cuticle lies the bark, which is found to differ very much, both in
                    colour and thickness, in different plants; scarcely in some instances exceeding
                    the skin in thickness, whilst in others it is thicker than the woody part of the
                    root. It is composed of vascular fasciculi and cellular tissue, the cells of
                    which are smaller than those in the trunk: these cells are generally of a
                    spherical form, or nearly so, often transparent, but not visibly pervious into
                    one another. In some roots the cellular tissue is disposed in rays extending
                    from the inner to the outward edge of the bark; in others it extends only in
                    part through the bark. The cells themselves are sometimes uniform, and sometimes
                    they differ both in size and figure. They are often filled with lymph, or other
                    matter. <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 64.)</p>
                <p>In the cellular tissue vessels running lengthwise through the bark like small
                    threads are observed; and in a transverse section the sap is seen to exude from
                    them. They often form a net-work, and seem as if inosculated; but are only
                    contiguous, like the braces in a drum. They are never single, but form clusters
                    of 20 or more together: their form is cylindrical, and they are of the same size
                    through their whole course. Some vessels frequently separate from a cluster and
                    are transferred from place to place; but they never ramify so as to be
                    successively propagated one from another. Their position in the bark is very
                    various, forming sometimes a ring at its inner edge, and dispersed sometimes in
                    clusters through it, or disposed in the form of lines or rays. The fluid they
                    contain varies in colour and consistence in different plants, being sometimes
                    thin and clear, sometimes thick and mucilaginous, often milky or resinous.
                    Sometimes the fluids of the bark vary in the same root, which, when cut
                    transversely, will yield both a limpid and milky sap. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Ibid.</hi> p. 67.)</p>
                <p>The woody part of the root, like that of the trunk, is made up of cellular tissue
                    and vessels. This tissue varies greatly in proportion in different roots, but is
                    less abundant in the root than in the stem. It is disposed sometimes in rings,
                    but oftener in lines and rays, like the transverse septa in the stem. Through
                    this tissue two kinds of vessels are distributed, one containing a lymph, and
                    the other being empty; whence they have been denominated by Grew the succiferous
                    and air-vessels. In some roots these vessels are disposed in clusters or
                    fasciculi; in others they form rings; and in others they have a radiated form.
                    Both kinds are much intermixed, and everywhere surrounded by cellular tissue.
                    The number of empty vessels is sometimes small and sometimes great; <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096705?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6705-0088"/> and
                    the same may be said of their size, even in the same root. Malpighi, says Grew,
                    has described them as being constructed of a thin transparent zone, of a silvery
                    colour, having a spiral form; to which Grew adds, that the spiral zone is not a
                    single piece of a flat form, but consists of two or more round and true fibres,
                    not inosculated side to side, but knit together by other smaller fibres,—a
                    construction similar to that which Kieser has since demonstrated. Their
                    spiration, however, is better seen in the stem, and better m young parts than in
                    old ones. Though these spiral vessels seemed empty, or containing only air, yet,
                    says Grew, “whether these vessels may not, in some vegetables, and at some
                    times, contain liquor, is doubtful.” <hi rend="italic">(Ibid.</hi> p. 74.)</p>
                <p>In illustration of the structure above stated, Grew ex- • hibits, in twelve
                    successive tables of his work, the external forms and internal structure of
                    various roots. As a specimen of this structure, we have copied his
                    representations of the root of wormwood. In fig. 13, Plate XL., is a delineation
                    of a transverse section of this root, of its natural size; and in fig. 14 is a
                    magnified representation of a portion of the same section, here presented on a
                    reduced scale, in which A denotes the cuticle, B the bark, and C the wood. The
                    smaller letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> indicates the ligneous rays formed by
                    the vessels, and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the cellular tissue or transverse
                    septa continuous with that of the bark. The dark spots in the bark are described
                    by Grew as balsam vessels, intermingled with lymphaeducts; and those in wood as
                    the spiral or empty vessels. It will be seen that the vessels of the woody part
                    are smallest at the centre, and gradually augment in size as they approach the
                    circumference, as Kieser has since observed; and that, with the exception of a
                    few vessels said to convey lymph, all those of the wood are considered as
                    air-vessels, and therefore as possessing a spiral conformation. In his chapter
                    on roots, Malpighi also frequently describes trachcae as occurring in the
                    dissections made by him of the roots of various plants.</p>
                <p> In fig. 21, Plate XL., is exhibited a horizontal section of the root of the
                    gourd, of the natural size, as given by Kieser, representing four fasciculi of
                    vessels, intercepted by cellular tissue. One of these fasciculi, consisting of
                    37 vessels, is represented in fig. 22, magnified 130 times. Of these vessels,
                    the largest, as usual, are situated exteriorly, and they pretty regularly
                    diminish in size as they approach the centre. Two of these vessels are nearly
                    filled with vesicles, and the whole of them are generally of smaller, size than
                    those in the stem of the same plant. A vertical section of one of the largest
                    vessels near the circumference, and of two of the smallest at the centre of this
                    root, have been already exhibited in figure 19, Plate XXXVIII. They all belonged
                    to the variety of punctuated spirals; so that all the vessels in the root of
                    this plant, as well as in the stem, may be considered as possessing the spiral
                    conformation.</p>
                <p>To the testimony of Grew, Malpighi, and Kieser, as to the existence of <hi
                    rend="italic">spiral</hi> vessels in roots, we may add that of Du Hamel, who
                    says that if a young root, as that of the horseτchesnut, be duly macerated in
                    boiling water, and its bark afterwards removed, the ligneous portion will be
                    found so tender as to be divisible into fine filaments; which filaments, when
                    viewed with a microscope, will be found to be spiral vessels or tracheae, which,
                    he adds, might lead one to think that all the ligneous fibres are really spiral
                    fibres, while they are yet tender. <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome
                    .ii. p. 13, 14.) Mirbel and some other writers, however, deny altogether the
                    existence of spiral vessels in the root; and Μ. de Candolle declares that one of
                    the chief differences in structure between the stem and the root consists in the
                    total absence of tracheae ⅛ the latter. <hi rend="italic">( Organog. Végét.</hi>
                    tome i. p. 242.) Yielding credence, however, to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >positive</hi> testimony of Grew, Malpighi, Du Hamel, and Kieser, rather than to
                    the <hi rend="italic">negative</hi> assertions of their opponents, we are
                    disposed to conclude, that all the vessels which convey the ascending sap in the
                    root possess, like those in the stem, a spiral structure.</p>
                <p>It cannot fail to be observed also, in the sections of roots just exhibited, that
                    the proportion of vessels to cells is much larger in the root than in the stem
                    of herbs, and that consequently the cells are smaller and more compressed. The
                    vessels occupy also the very centre of the root, to the exclusion of all
                    cellular tissue, in the form of pith, in exogenous plants; but in the
                    endogenous, the internal structure of the roots, as compared with that of the
                    stem, is said to present no sensible difference. In exogenous plants, also, the
                    diametral insertions, or septa, and the appearance of the bark, are as distinct
                    in the root as in the stem; while in the endogenous the vessels and cells are
                    intermingled through the entire root, as well a$ through the stem. In trees, the
                    structure of the root is more distinct than in herbs, and still more nearly
                    resembles that of the trunk.</p>
                <p>In treating of the evolution of seeds, we exhibited several examples of the
                    manner in which the fibrous or capillary rootlets spring from the trunk, or
                    larger branches of the root. These rootlets are more simple in structure than
                    buds, being made up chiefly of the ligneous portion of the plant. They are the
                    organs which absorb nutriment from the earth; and hence, as Du Hamel observed,
                    the earth is exhausted chiefly where these capillary rootlets are distributed,
                    and not in the neighbourhood of the larger roots. On examining the roots of
                    trees after severe winters, he often found the capillary rootlets dead; which
                    led him to suppose that trees lose in the earth their capillary rootlets nearly
                    as in the air they lose their leaves. He found, that even after slight frosts
                    many of these rootlets were dead; and that, when the temperature became milder,
                    new rootlets were developed, which abundantly replaced those destroyed. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tomeì. p. 89.)</p>
                <p>All roots raised from seeds have a tap-root, that grows in length in proportion
                    as the earth is easily penetrable. The seeds of the oak, sown in a deep and rich
                    sand, have produced plants, says Du Hamel, the stems of which were only six
                    inches in height, while the root extended nearly to four feet. If, however, the
                    root meet below the surface with any obstacle that opposes its elongation, it
                    then continues short, and subdivides into many lateral branches. This result may
                    be also obtained by simply cutting the extremity of the root; for roots, as Du
                    Hamel first ascertained by experiment, do not elongate but by their extremity.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome i. p. 83.) Hence, when injured by
                    insects, or in any other way, so as to check its elongation, the root, by
                    throwing out lateral branches, will often derive more nutriment by these new
                    productions than it would have obtained by a single trunk.</p>
                <p>Roots arc provided through their whole extent with a quantity of germs, or a
                    capacity of producing them, when placed in favourable circumstances; and this
                    capacity ⅛ possessed also by the branch. If the branch of many trees be cut off
                    and planted in the earth, it emits rootlets from its sides beneath the soil. If
                    even the bark of a branch be removed so as to intercept the descending sap, and
                    the part be then surrounded with moist earth, the upper portion of the divided
                    bark will emit rootlets into the earth. The simple immersion of cuttings of the
                    willow in water is sufficient to cause the production of <hi rend="italic"
                    >ι</hi> ootlets, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096718?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-6718-0089"/> which spring from the cutting, says Malpighi,
                    just at the 'surface of the water, not below it. They appear at first like small
                    tumours, and are composed of ligneous fibres and tracheae, which gradually force
                    their way through the bark. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 146.)</p>
                <p>In like manner, as a branch may thus be made to produce rootlets, so may a root
                    be made to produce branches. If a root be cut off, or an incision be made in its
                    bark, so as to intercept the descending sap, a swelling, or <hi rend="italic"
                    >bourrelet,</hi> will form around the upper extremity, from which new rootlets
                    will spring; or if this cut end be left exposed to the atmosphere, then, says Du
                    Hamel <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi> tome i. p∙ lθ2), in place of
                    rootlets, new shoots or branch-lets will be developed. It is thus ∙ that many
                    plants, as mint, which spread their roots horizontally, produce new stems from
                    them when they happen to come sufficiently near to the surface. From the facts
                    above stated, Du Hamel maintains that the tumour or enlargement <hi
                    rend="italic">(bourrelet)</hi> formed either on the cut stem or the root of a
                    plant is'essentially the same; that in both it contains germs proper for
                    producing either branches or roots; and that the one or the other is developed,
                    according as the <hi rend="italic">bourrelet</hi> is exposed to the air or is
                    placed in the earth. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des
                    Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 102.)</p>
                <p>Others have maintained not only a perfect identity of structure between the root
                    and branch, but also between the bud that gives origin to the branch, and the
                    rootlet that springs from the root; and further, that they are convertible into
                    each other. In proof of this it is alleged, that if a willow plant be bent down
                    so that its head shall be fixed in the earth, it will soon push forth rootlets;
                    and that if, after these are developed, the trunk with its former roots be
                    raised so as to be exposed to the air, there will shortly be formed a new head,
                    furnished with leaves and branches. These facts, however, prove only a
                    substitution, and not a conversion, of these organs into one another; for the
                    young buds of the head die when placed under the soil, and the new roots spring
                    from points not previously occupied by buds; while, in like manner, all the
                    young rootlets developed beneath the soil perish in the air, and new buds arc
                    produced from the older trunks of the root. In some plants the stem seems to
                    perish, and the root in the following year produces a new stem; and from this it
                    has been inferred that the root alone preserves the vitality of the individual:
                    but the stem in these plants does not, says Μ. de Candolle, entirely perish; and
                    in the phenomena exhibited by cuttings the contrary takes place, for the stem
                    devclopes new roots. Wc ought therefore, says he, to regard the stem and the
                    root as of equal importance. Their union constitutes the body of the plant. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 249.)</p>
                <p>The knots or articulations in the stems of plants, by retarding the descent of
                    the juices, favour the production of new parts; and according as the stem may be
                    exposed to dryness or humidity, either branches or roots may be formed. Hence
                    stems that have many knots most easily propagate by slips and layers; and
                    fleshy'plants, as the <hi rend="italic">Cactus,</hi> which possess a thick and
                    moist cellular tissue, have a disposition to propagate roots even in the open
                    air. It is the same with roots possessing tubercles, which are a sort of
                    magazines of nutrient matter, and possess, therefore, a singular aptitude for
                    emitting new productions. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p.
                    248.)</p>
                <p>We have already stated that roots grow in length, not by an extension of parts,
                    but only by the addition of new rpatter to theiŗ extremity. This power of growth
                    Du Hamel found to reside within two or three lines of the extremity, both in
                    ligneous and herbaceous roots. <hi rend="italic">(Phys.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >des Arb.</hi> tome i. p. 84.) It is chiefly by their extremities, also, that
                    they absorb fluids; for Senebier found, that if the extremity of a root, as that
                    of a carrot or radish, was immersed in water, the water was absorbed; whilst if
                    the whole root, with the exception of the extremity, was immersed, little
                    absorption took place ;—results which have been confirmed by the experiments of
                    Carradori. These facts have led Μ. de Candolle to consider the extremities of
                    roots, and óf all fibrous rootlets, as furnished with a peculiar hygroscopic
                    power. This power he conceives to depend, as we Before remarked, on the
                    existence of a minute cellular structure at this part, to which structure he has
                    given the name of spongioles <hi rend="italic">(spongiolae).</hi> These
                    spongioles, according to him, are formed of a very compact cellular tissue,
                    composed of roundish cells. He distinguishes several varieties of these organs,
                    as the radical, the pistillary, and the seminal, according as they are seated at
                    the extremities of the radical fibres, of the pistil, or in the coats of seeds.
                    So great, he adds, is their absorbing power, that they absorb the colouring
                    molecules of liquids, though these molecules will not enter the ordinary pores,
                    which are infinitely greater in size. <hi rend="italic">( Organog. Végét.</hi>
                    tome i. chap. 7, p. 89.) In his 10th plate he exhibits the appearance of these
                    spongiolcs in the radicles of <hi rend="italic">pandanus odoratissimus,</hi>
                    where they are better seen than in any other plant examined by him.</p>
                <p>The nature and qualities of the soil exert a great influence on the form and size
                    of roots. If the soil be free and pervious, the root often descends to a great
                    depth in the form of a tap-root; but if it encounter obstacles which oppose its
                    descent, it then continues short and divides into lateral branches. Roots also
                    extend into the portions of soil that are richest, while the barren parts are
                    nearly destitute of roots. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des

                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Buds.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding chapter we have described the larger and more permanent members
                    of the plant. We have now to delineate the form and structure of organs, whose
                    existence is of shorter duration, and which present a more diversified
                    character. They may all be said either directly or indirectly to originate from
                    buds, with which therefore we shall commence our descriptions.</p>
                <p>A bud, according ,to Gaertner, is an organic body, sprouting from the surface of
                    a plant. In the beginning it is distinct from the proper and permanent members
                    of the plant, but after some time becomes a part of it; or, if separated, is
                    capable, by the increase of its own proper substance, of growing into a new
                    plant, perfectly similar to its parent. <hi rend="italic">(De Fructib.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 3.)</p>
                <p>Buds may in general be easily distinguished from seeds; but in some of the lower
                    tribes of vegetables the conformity in external appearance and internal
                    structure is said to be so great as to render this a matter of much
                    difficulty.</p>
                <p>Gaertner enumerates four species of buds, two of which are leafless, and two are
                    provided with leaves or scales. The first, <hi rend="italic">propago,</hi> is
                    ’the most, simple species of bud; it is leafless, and possesses different forms:
                    sometimes it is entirely naked, and sometimes is inclosed in a bark-like case:
                    it at length separates spontaneously from its parent, and is dispersed like a
                    s’eed.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096731?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6731-0090"/>
                <p>The second species is termed <hi rend="italic">gongylus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >:</hi> it is described as a perfectly simple, leafless, somewhat globular and
                    solid bud, concealed within the bark of the parent plant, and never separating
                    spontaneously till the bark decays by age. It has a great affinity to the tuber
                    of roots, but differs from it in not being a proper member of the plant, and in
                    not possessing the principle of multiplication which resides in the tuber.</p>
                <p>The third species of bud is a compound germen, and named <hi rend="italic"
                    >bulbus.</hi> Its figure is somewhat globular: it is nearly leafless, and formed
                    of a very short keel· <hi rend="italic">(carina)</hi> and thick succulent
                    scales, and at length separates spontaneously from its parent. Of this species
                    there are two varieties, the one <hi rend="italic">solid,</hi> constructed of a
                    solid fleshy body, and having generally the rudiments of the new plant fixed
                    outwardly upon it; the other <hi rend="italic">coated,</hi> being formed of
                    several concentric scales, in the centre of which the young plant is
                    cherished.</p>
                <p>The last species of bud, and that which is strictly so named, Gaertner
                    denominates <hi rend="italic">gemma.</hi> This is a bud composed of a subulate
                    keel, and distinct herbaceous leaflets: it resembles a branch in miniature, and
                    never separates spontaneously from its parent. It is named an <hi rend="italic"
                    >eye</hi><hi rend="italic">(oculus)</hi> when it puts forth flowers alone, or
                    flowers and leaves together; and simply a <hi rend="italic">gem (gemma)</hi>
                    when it is unfolded into leaves alone.</p>
                <p>Of these several species, the last, <hi rend="italic">gemma,</hi> is generally
                    considered as alone entitled to the appellation of a true bud by those who
                    consider scales and leaves as essential to its constitution; but this
                    definition, says Gaertner, would exclude even bulbs, and it is better to derive
                    our idea <hi rend="italic">of a</hi> bud from a general agreement in properties,
                    and particularly from similarity of origin in formation and evolution, than from
                    the ever-varying condition of external form. The two former species of buds
                    occur in the lower tribes of vegetables; the two latter are observed on the
                    stems and branches, and roots of various plants. On the present occasion we
                    shall notice the latter only.</p>
                <p>That variety of bud which is called a <hi rend="italic">bulb,</hi> and which
                    springs from, or is variously attached to, the roots of many plants, has already
                    been stated to exhibit considerable difference in structuré. It is sometimes
                    constructed of several thick scales or leaves enveloping each other, and is
                    sometimes formed of a more continuous and solid substance. To the first
                    description belongs the bulbous substance of the lily and tulip. Grew has given
                    a section of the latter, made in the month of September. It displays the
                    tunicated structure of the bulb, at the base and in the centre of which the
                    young flower, destined to appear in the following spring, is observed. (See his
                    <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Plants,</hi> table 63.) Of the tunicated variety,
                    the common onion affords also a good example. The coats that compose its bulb
                    are to be regarded as fleshy leaves, and the true root, according to Du Hamel,
                    is the fleshy plate that supports the bulb, from which the rootlets spring. The
                    common potato affords an example of the solid bulb, on whose surface numerous
                    buds, all capable of producing entire plants, are seen. Botanists enumerate a
                    great many other varieties of bulbs, for which we must refer to their writings;
                    and to the works of Malpighi and Du Hamel for the anatomy of many of them.</p>
                <p>The true bud of the stem and branch was distinguished by the ancients into two
                    kinds, according as it produced either a leaf or a flower, and to it they
                    assigned different names. į <hi rend="italic superscript"> t(</hi><hi

                    seed; and not the rudiment of the seed only, but the organ also that contains
                    it. The wordgem. <hi rend="italic">ma</hi> he uses to denote a bud. Gaertner
                    adopts the word <hi rend="italic">germen</hi> in a generic sense, to express
                    every species of bud; and, with Malpighi and Linnaeus, employs the term <hi
                    rend="italic">gemma</hi> as indicative of that species now under consideration.
                    This, therefore, as the most generally received appellation, we shall in future
                    employ.</p>
                <p>During summer, says Du Hamel, buds are gradually formed in the axils of the
                    leaves, viz. in the angle which the petiole forms with the branch. They are at
                    first exceedingly minute; are seen in winter chiefly on the young branches,
                    sometimes on the larger ones, and more rarely on the trunk. They exhibit
                    different forms, according to the kind of tree that bears them, and are attached
                    to it by ā very short pedicle. Their position on the branch was considered·* by
                    Μ. Bonnet to be reducible to five classes; sometimes they are situated on
                    opposite sides of the branch, but placed alternately, and sometimes they are
                    placed exactly opposite to each other. In other instances they form a kind of
                    ring round the branch. Sometimes they have a spiral disposition, and at others
                    constitute a sort of double spiral around the branch. In those cases where the
                    buds stand opposite on the branch, the extremity of the branch is frequently
                    terminated by three buds; but where the buds are only alternate, the young
                    branch is commonly terminated by a single bud. In the pine the true buds are
                    placed, not in the axils of the leaves, but at .the extremity of the branch
                    alone. Some buds stand out a considerable distance, from the branch; others are
                    placed in close contact with it; and these varieties occur sometimes on the same
                    branch in regard to the buds that issue from its sides and extremity. The shape
                    of buds is also very various—some being long and pointed, others short and
                    round; some again are hairy, others smooth; some very small, and others large.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p.
                    99.)</p>
                <p>Beside these varieties in position and form, which serve to distinguish the buds
                    of different genera and species,' there are also many sorts of buds to be
                    observed on the same tree, whose characters are discoverable by their form.
                    Those which are pointed usually produce leaves and branches, and from those
                    which are large and rounder commonly proceed flowers. The former are named leaf
                    or wood buds <hi rend="italic">(gemmae foliiferae),</hi> the latter flower or
                    fruit buds <hi rend="italic">(gemmae floriferae)</hi>: others which possess both
                    leaves and flowers have been called mixed buds <hi rend="italic">(gemmae
                    mixtae).</hi> In some trees, as those of the apple and pear, two varieties of
                    wood-buds occur, one of which is small, produces only a small bunch of leaves,
                    and in the end becomes a fruit-bud; the other is larger, and gives origin to a
                    branch.</p>
                <p>As the rudiments of the flower appear in the bulb of roots the season before they
                    are destined to bloom, so&lt; those of the leaf and the flower are
                    distinguishable at the same period in the bud of the branch. They are to be
                    perceived, says Du Hamel, in autumn, and continue to grow even during winter,
                    appearing to be clandestinely formed in that season, when the movements of the
                    sap seem to be suspended; and are thus prepared to shoot forth on the return of
                    spring. It is, however, only in perennial plants that these phenomena are
                    observed. Annual plants do not produce buds, and even those whose roots survive
                    the fall of the stem produce buds only on their roots. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>Climate appears to exert the greatest influence on the* formation and evolution
                    of buds. In cold regions, asweļ <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096744?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6744-0091"/> have just
                    observed, the budis formed many months before 'it is destined to shoot into a
                    leaf or branch; but in warmer regions scarcely any interval occurs between the
                    periods of formation and evolution. The buds, in such climates, are said to
                    unfold themselves immediately from the bark into branches, without having
                    remained in the. form of buds for any length of time. Sometimes, in the milder
                    seasons of our own climate, the evolution of buds rapidly succeeds to their
                    formation, and the vegetative process with us emulates the productive powers of
                    more favoured climes. In some examples, however, the specific characters of
                    particular plants overcome these general tendencies of climate; and thus hot
                    climates are said to possess some bud-bearing plants, and in colder climates
                    there are a few shrubs which are said never to bud. (Willdenow’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Principles of Botany,</hi> p. 273.) It seems, however, more
                    correct to consider all plants as bearing buds, from which the branches, the
                    leaves, and the flowers, successively proceed; and to say that in warm climates
                    in general no suspension of the vegetative process occurs, as in cold ones, and
                    no marked interval is observed, therefore, between the formation and evolution
                    of buds. The few exceptions that occur respectively in warm and cold climates
                    must be considered in reference to the specific characters of the individual
                    plants. The process by which buds are actually formed has been called <hi
                    rend="italic">Gemmation</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gemmifi-cation.</hi></p>
                <p>Having made these few general remarks on the nature and formation of buds, we
                    have next to exhibit a few examples of their structure and evolution, confining
                    ourselves at present to a description of those which produce either branches or
                    leaves. The mature bud consists of two parts; one that forms the new branch or
                    leaf, and in the language of botanists may be termed <hi rend="italic"
                    >persistent</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> the other serving only a temporary
                    purpose, and falling when that purpose is accomplished. To the former may
                    properly be applied the term <hi rend="italic">germ</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >gem,</hi> and the latter, from its office, may be called <hi rend="italic"
                    >hybernaculum.</hi> In its leading characters the bud bears a near analogy to
                    the more perfect seed, for the germ very exactly resembles the plume; and the
                    hybernaculum, as we shall see, in structure, office, and duration, approaches
                    near to certain cotyledons.</p>
                <p>The leaves or scales which constitute the hybernaculum, and which in future we
                    shall denominate the <hi rend="italic">hybernacular leaves,</hi> vary much in
                    number, size, and figure, in different buds. Even in the same bud the inner ones
                    are thinner, and much more tender and succulent, than the outer, and are
                    besmeared with, a viscid humour which intimately unites them; while the outer
                    ones are commonly hard, hairy, and of a scaly texture. Like the cotyledonous
                    leaves of seeds, those of the hybernacle sometimes grow for a certain time with
                    the germ, and fall successively at periods more or less distant: they are also
                    not less distinct in figure from those of the germ, than the leaves of the
                    cotyledon are from those of the plume. This arises from the peculiarity in the
                    distribution of their vessels, which do not spring from one common central
                    trunk, as in ordinary leaves, but are derived from several distinct fasciculi at
                    the base, like those of the cotyledonous leaf, as seen in that of the gourd, ď,
                    fig. 13, Plate XXXIX. According to. the manner in which they are disposed or
                    folded up in the bud, botanists have assigned them different names, for an
                    account of which we must refer to their writings. In the opinion of Du Hamel,
                    they all derive their origin from the inner layer of the bark, of which they
                    seen^to be only a prolongation. <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des Arb.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">germ</hi> of the bud, which is contained within and
                    protected by these enveloping leaves, is composed of one or more leaves
                    generally folded and curled, but in some instances open and expanded. At first;
                    they are. very small, and their form is indistinct, sò that the pedicle alone is
                    distinctly visible; from which branch off tire vessels that form the middle rib,
                    and are afterwards expanded to construct the lobes of the leaf. From the figuré
                    which the germ possesses before its expansion being like that of a keel, its
                    vascular portion at this period has been named <hi rend="italic">carina,</hi>
                    and its softer part <hi rend="italic">medulla</hi> or pith.</p>
                <p>With respect to the particular portion of the branch from which the germ
                    internally derives its origin, opinions have much varied. Some have held that it
                    proceeded from the pith alone; others from the first circle of vessels that
                    immediately surrounds the pith; others from the tender wood alone; and others
                    from the pith, the wood, and the bark conjointly. Grew held this latter opinion.
                    <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p. 28.) Malpighi describes the germ as
                    a tender, ligneous substance, formed of vessels and cellular tissue, and
                    surrounded by its proper cortical texture. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 45.) According to Du Hamel, it originates from the ligneous
                    texture and thė pith <hi rend="italic">(Phys, des</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 103); and Hill considered it to spring from the first
                    circle of vessels alone, but not to carry with it any portion of the pith.</p>
                <p>As every germ is composed of the cortical and ligneous textures, it may be said
                    to originate in part from both, as all these writers seem to admit. Sometimes
                    also the pith of the germ is continuous with that of the <hi rend="subscript">
                    ι</hi> branch; but in other instances no such connection subsists, and there is
                    nothing in the character of the pith of the trunk that renders it at all
                    essential to the constitution of the germ. That in many instances, also, the
                    germ springs from the first circle of vessels, is most certain; but it is not
                    less certain that buds spring from trees long after this first circle of vessels
                    has lost its vegetative power, or has been entirely destroyed.</p>
                <p>In the oak Malpighi describes the entire bud as consisting of many scales
                    enveloping each other, and forming an oval body. When evolution commences, these
                    open and expand, and in part fall; but two generally remain and protect the
                    springing germ for a long time. In fig. 15, Plate XL., is represented one of the
                    hybernacular leaves <hi rend="italic">d</hi> of the oak-bud, at the base of
                    which the germ <hi rend="italic">e</hi> is placed. The leaf <hi rend="italic"
                    >d</hi> is described as possessing an oblong form, and is very evidently
                    vascular; the germ is exceedingly small, and is represented as possessing at
                    this period only one fasciculus of vessels. By degrees three fasciculi become
                    apparent, which are continued through the germ, and form three pointed
                    extremities, as in fig. 16. These parts augment, and the vascular fasciculi
                    separate, so as to produce successively the appearances in fig. 17 and 18. At
                    length the small Curled leaf/ fig. 19, rising between the two hybernacular
                    leaves <hi rend="italic">g g,</hi> is seen to resemble the plume of the seed,
                    and to possess a form altogether different from the enveloping leaves, which in
                    appearance resemble more the cotyledonous leaves of certain seeds. In fig. 20 is
                    given a vertical section of the germ, considerably magnified, in which <hi
                    rend="italic">h</hi> denotes the pith that occupies the centre: it is inclosed
                    by vascular fasciculi, <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> that send off through the bark
                    ramifications to the several little processes that compose the serrated border
                    of the leaf. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> tab. 10 and 14.)</p>
                <p>But the method of nature in the evolution of buds, continues Malpighi, is not
                    always the same; for the hybema-cular leaves do not always waste and fall as
                    those of the germ increase. On the contrary, in many trees, these leaves,
                    especially those about the base of the bud, losing <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096757?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6757-0092"/> their primary
                    figure, assume new forms, and are converted into the permanent leaves with which
                    the branch is adorned. Examples of this sort occur in laurel, in the apple-tree,
                    the almond-tree, and many others. In other instances, as in the rose, the
                    permanent leaves seem to be generated out of those of the hybernacle, from the
                    apex of which they emerge; and gradually the latter is changed into a sort of
                    petiole, to the sides of which two slender appendages, the remains of the former
                    hybernacular leaf, adhere. Similar transformations are said to occur in many
                    otìier plants.</p>
                <p>The buds, such as they have been described, pullulate variously from the sides of
                    stems and branches, and always above the insertion of the fallen leaves; but
                    they spring also from their extremities, and produce the annual elongation of
                    the branch or stem. The manner in which this takes place, and the appearance
                    which the parts exhibit, have been well illustrated by the observations and
                    dissections of Μ. du Hamel. In the evolution of the seed, the plume, as we have
                    seen, rises above the earth, and produces the stem, which puts forth leaves.
                    When these leaves fall in autumn, the stem continues, and is terminated by one
                    or more buds. The roots, as already remarked, do not increase in length but at
                    their extremity, and therefore never elongate after the smallest portion of
                    their extremity has been cut off. It is not the same with branches; for the
                    newly formed part of the young shoot actually elongates, especially at its
                    extremity, where it is most succulent and tender,—less in the parts lower down,
                    where it is harder,—and in its more ligneous parts not at all; as Du Hamel, by
                    very simple and decisive experiments, ascertained. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 14.)</p>
                <p>Tire appearance, structure, and evolution of a bud, at the extremity of a branch
                    of the horse-chesnut tree, are given by the same ingenious author, whose
                    candour, ability, and success in the prosecution of these curious researches
                    render him worthy to rank by the side of Malpighi and Grew. In fig 1, Plate
                    XLI., is represented part of the annual shoot of this tree, terminated by its
                    appropriate bud, formed in autumn, and which is the commencement of the next
                    year’s shoot. In fig. 2 a vertical section of the same bud is exhibited, in
                    which the number and disposition of the hybernacular leaves that envelope and
                    protect the germ in the centre are displayed. In the stem of the shoot the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> denotes the pith, which is surrounded by the
                    wood <hi rend="italic">b b,</hi> and this again is covered by the bark <hi
                    rend="italic">cc.</hi> In fig. 3 is represented a section of part of the bud
                    detached from the woody part of the shoot, and a little magnified, to show that
                    the leaves of the <hi rend="italic">hy-bernacιdum</hi> take their origin from
                    the inner portion of the bark.</p>
                <p>Proceeding next to the interior part of the bud, Du Hamel represents it as
                    composed of numerous small leaves (fig. 4), which are more and more minute as we
                    proceed inward, and are covered with fine hairs. In fig. 5 is a branch-bud of
                    the peach, as seen in February, after all the enveloping scales have been
                    removed. It is composed of greenish filaments, ranged nearly as they appear in
                    the figure. When some of these filaments were detached and viewed with the
                    microscope, they appeared toothed at the edges, as in fig. 6, and were covered
                    with hairs. All these filaments were afterwards detached in order to disclose, a
                    small body lodged within them, and which appeared to consist of two small
                    leaflets, folded and toothed at their edges, but not covered with hairs. It is
                    represented in fig. 7. -It occupied the centre of the shoot, and seemed to be
                    connected with the pith.</p>
                <p>In the next figure, 8, is represented the bud of the horse-chesnut in the state
                    of evolution. The letters <hi rend="italic">d d</hi> indicate the scales of the

                    germ <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in the centre, and the lateral leaves as in the

                    at <hi rend="italic">p p</hi> it is seen to be prolonged into the lateral
                    branches. The wood of two years’ growth, from <hi rend="italic">m</hi> to <hi

                    except where the branches go off. It is covered by another layer so thin as to
                    be scarcely visible, but which will in the end become wood; and this layer is
                    covered by the bark. The ligneous layer of the annual shoot appears to be a
                    prolongation of the new layer of the older one, and, like it, possesses at first
                    an herbaceous character. ∙ The cortical layer also seems to be a prolongation of
                    that of the older shoot. As to the pith, though in both shoots it is continuous,
                    it is to be observed that that of the older branch is white and dry, and that of
                    the young shoot green and succulent. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi

                <p>It is thus by the formation of a bud in autumn at the extremity of a branch, and
                    the shooting and growth of that bud in the succeeding spring and summer, that
                    the trunk of the tree and its branches are annually elongated. During the first
                    season the shoot retains in great part its herbaceous characters, but in the
                    second it becomes perfectly ligneous. In the axils of the permanent leaves of
                    the young shoot, the rudiments of new buds become apparent, even in the' first
                    season.</p>
                <p>It was before remarked that trees receive an additional circular layer every
                    year, and that from these new layers buds successively spring, so that the
                    earliest branches may contain as many ligneous layers as the trunk, and those of
                    later formation a smaller number, according to the year in which they shot
                    forth, and the circle of wood from which they sprang. Combining this growth in
                    breadth with that in length, it will appear, says Du Hamel, that at the base and
                    centre of a tree 100 years old there is wood of 100 years of age; whilst at the
                    exterior part of the same tree, and at the extremities of its branches, there is
                    wood of one year’s age only. As the latitudinal growth was before illustrated by
                    a diagram, a similar mode may be adopted to explain the longitudinal
                    increase.</p>
                <p>Let fig. 10, Plate XLI., represent in <hi rend="italic">q r</hi> the ligneous
                    portion of a tree that has proceeded from a seed in spring, and is observed in
                    autumn. The following spring a second shoot proceeds from the bud <hi
                    rend="italic">r,</hi> which reaches as far as <hi rend="italic">s';</hi> but at
                    the same time there is a second ligneous layer formed on the first shoot <hi
                    rend="italic">q r,</hi> by which its thickness is proportionally augmented; and
                    at the end of the second year the tree has the form and extent of the unshaded
                    portion of the figure <hi rend="italic">q s.</hi> The next spring the bud 5
                    opens and sends out another shoot to <hi rend="italic">t</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and ligneous layers are added as before to the two preceding shoots; and
                    thus the tree is extended from <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to <hi rend="italic"
                    >t.</hi> The fourth year the same processes are repeated, and the tree extends
                    from <hi rend="italic">q</hi> to <hi rend="italic">w</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >;</hi> and each annual shoot, from the base to the summit of the figure, is
                    seen to be composed successively of four, three, two, and lastly of one layer in
                    thickness. This figure, therefore, illustrates the mode in which trees increase
                    at the same time in height and breadth. The lig-neons<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096770?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6770-0093"/> layers may be
                    compared to a series of cones which 'envelope each other, and which annually
                    augment the diameter of the tree by the two thicknesses of the layers. It shows
                    also that trees grow much more in height than in breadth, and that this growth
                    is effected by the successive formation and evolution of buds at the extremity
                    of the stem, precisely as the first shoot issues from the seed. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome ii. p. 50.)</p>
                <p>It is well known that if a bud be taken from one plant and inserted beneath the
                    bark of a kindred species, it will grow, and retain in its new situation its
                    original qualities and habits; or some buds, if directly planted in the earth
                    and protected from too rapid exhalation, will produce a tree similar to the
                    parent. Hence some writers, as Dr Darwin, have considered each bud as an
                    individual plant, and that a tree, properly speaking, is a family or swarm of
                    buds, which annually produce as many new plants. The bulbs produced beneath the
                    soil by the tulip and many other plants resemble, in this respect, the buds
                    produced in the atmosphere. Vegetables, therefore, are propagated by two
                    methods—the oviparous, as by seeds, and the viviparous, as by buds and bulbs;
                    and the individual plants, whether springing from seeds or from buds and bulbs,
                    are all annual productions. The reproduction of plants, therefore, appears to be
                    of two kinds, solitary and sexual; the former being accomplished by buds and
                    bulbs, the latter by seeds, or through the agency of sexual intercourse.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> II.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Leaves.</hi></p>
                <p>These are organs of great importance in the vegetable economy: they are not
                    however universal; for the <hi rend="italic">Cactus,</hi> some species of <hi
                    rend="italic">Sćhoenus,</hi> and a few other plants, are considered to be
                    destitute of leaves. Like other parts of the plant, they may be regarded with
                    reference either to their external form or their internal structure. The former
                    view belongs more especially to the botanist, who has very happily applied his
                    descriptive language to portray the almost infinite diversity of figure, size,
                    and character, which the leaves of different species of vegetables exhibit. On
                    this branch of the subject we shall but lightly touch, recalling simply to
                    notice the leading distinctions of the botanist, and such only of them as may
                    appear to be more immediately connected with the <hi rend="italic">structure
                    of</hi> these organs.</p>
                <p>The leaves <hi rend="italic">(folia)</hi> are distinguished and denominated
                    according as they are <hi rend="italic">simple</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >compound.</hi> Simple leaves are such as have only a single leaf on the stalk
                    or petiole that supports them, and where all the parts of the leaf are
                    continuous with one another. Compound leaves are those which are mądc up of more
                    than one piece, or where the leaf is formed of parts or leaflets articulated
                    together. In regard to their place, situation, and insertion, leaves are said to
                    be <hi rend="italic">determinate.</hi> By the <hi rend="italic">place of</hi> a
                    leaf is meant the part of the plant to which it is attached. By <hi
                    rend="italic">situation</hi> is understood the disposition of the leaves on the
                    stem or branch, which corresponds to that of the buds. By <hi rend="italic"
                    >insertion</hi> is expressed the mode of connection between the leaf and the
                    stem or branch; and the <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> of leaves is considered
                    to bear reference to the position in which they stand to the stem.</p>
                <p>_ The foregoing observations apply to leaves considered in connection with other
                    members: when we regard them <hi rend="superscript"> sιn</hi> g <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> y, we remark several parts which are common to almost
                    all leaves, and to which particular names have, been assigned. The part at which
                    the leaf springs from the branch or <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi> stem, ^whether,
                    directly, or by means, pf a petiole, is called the <hi rend="italic">base,</hi>
                    and the point opposed to this, the <hi rend="italic">apex,</hi> of the leaf. The
                    expanded portion is termed <hi rend="italic">limbus,</hi> which has its two
                    sides, faces, or surfaces, as they are indifferently called. The prominent lines
                    that appear on these surfaces were named riblets <hi rend="italic"
                    >(costuloe)</hi> by Malpighi, and have very improperly been called <hi
                    rend="italic">nerves</hi> by most writers; for the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >nerve</hi> denotes an organ of a totally different nature, of which not even
                    the existence has yet been demonstrated in any part of the vegetable system. To
                    the line that circumscribes and forms the boundary of the leaf the term <hi
                    rend="italic">margin</hi> or border is commonly applied.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> of leaves exhibits the greatest diversity, to
                    express which various terms are employed. Their <hi rend="italic">margin</hi>
                    also is either entire or variously fissured, notched, or toothed. Their <hi
                    rend="italic">surfaces</hi> are naked and smooth, or clothed with hairs and
                    studded with excrescences; sometimes they are plain and flat, at others furrowed
                    or plaited; and in all these particulars the opposite surfaces present also the
                    greatest diversity. In <hi rend="italic">size,</hi> leaves exhibit the most
                    remarkable differences; and, with respect to <hi rend="italic">substance,</hi>
                    some are exceedingly thin, and have a membranous texture, others very thick, and
                    of a fleshy nature. As to <hi rend="italic">colour,</hi> they exhibit every
                    shade of green, from the most gay and lively to the deepest and most obscure. In
                    some the tint of colour approaches to blue, in others to red; and previous to
                    their fall they all undergo those changes of colour which produce the
                    diversified beauties of an autumnal scene. The period, however, at which this
                    occurs is very different. Some leaves fall early, before the summer has passed,
                    and are termed <hi rend="italic">caducous</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> others
                    retain their place till autumn, and then fall, and are named <hi rend="italic"
                    >deciduous;</hi> others continue beyond the summer, and are styled <hi
                    rend="italic">persistent;</hi> and others, which have a still longer duration,
                    are denominated <hi rend="italic">perennial.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding section on the structure of buds we exhibited the form and
                    appearance of leaves in the earlier periods of their existence. They were shown
                    to possess a very minute size, and to be curiously folded up and concealed
                    within their various scales or coverings, which effectually protected them from
                    the rigour of the winter season. The germ of the bud, from which the leaves
                    originate, was stated to be composed of the same elementary parts as the stem
                    and branch from which it sprang. From the ligneous ring in the annual shoot it
                    derived its vessels, which, after having traversed obliquely the cortical
                    layers, were prolonged into the pedicle by which it remained attached to the
                    branch. This pedicle was continued to form the keel of the germ in its folded
                    state; and, in its more expanded forms, to constitute the vascular riblets of
                    the leaf. By subsequent growth it gradually extends and elongates, becomes more
                    ligneous, and is formed at length into the slender stalk or petiole by which the
                    leaf remains attached to the branch. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 123.)</p>
                <p>The vessels which are given off from the branch to form the petiole are not
                    collected into one bundle, but constitute several fasciculi, which are disposed
                    in different ways about the centre of the stalk. In some stalks there are three,
                    in others five or six, and in others seven or more fasciculi, all placed, says
                    Grew, either in an angular or circular posture, and at a greater or less
                    distance from the centre. This centre is generally occupied by a pith, but
                    sometimes it is hollow or tubular. In table 49 of the <hi rend="italic">Anatomy
                    of Plants,</hi> several transverse sections of the petioles of the leaves of
                    different plants are given, exhibiting the different modes in whieh these
                    fasciculi are dispersed through the cellular tissue that forms the greater
                    portion of. the jstalk. In every instance.the .pith and bark <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096783?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6783-0094"/> of these
                    petioles are represented as forming one continuous substance. In some plants the
                    fasciculi of vessels that come off from the stem are not collected into a
                    cylindrical figure, but, after being variously implicated with each other,
                    expand at once into a leaf. Such leaves rise by a broad base, and, from being
                    destitute of a petiole, are termed <hi rend="italic">sessile,</hi> forming often
                    a sort of sheath about the stem, of which several varieties are enumerated by
                    botanists.</p>
                <p>The petiole, as it springs from the branch, may be compared to a small stem,
                    which at the basis of the leaf expands into numerous branches. Frequently it is
                    continued through the centre of the leaf, forming its middle rib, and giving off
                    in its course numerous branches. At other times, on reaching the base of the
                    leaf, jt separates at once into three or more equal portions, which form as many
                    distinct leaves or parts of a leaf, supported by. their respective petioles. The
                    structure of the petiole is the same as that of the branch, being composed of
                    the ligneous and cortical textures, in which sap and “proper vessels” are
                    discoverable; and the whole is invested by the cuticle.</p>
                <p>Where the petiole terminates, the proper or expanded portion of the leaf <hi
                    rend="italic">(limbus')</hi> commences, the figure of which is determined by the
                    number and distribution of the vessels. These vessels divide and ramify in
                    various modes, till at their termination they form a finely reticulated
                    structure. In many recent leaves this structure is very visible; but when the
                    softer parts are removed by spontaneous decomposition, the vascular system of
                    the leaf remains nearly entire, and its extent and form are then more completely
                    exposed. In fig. 11, Plate XLI., this distribution of the vessels is exhibited
                    in <hi rend="italic">a</hi> leaf of holly. From the central fasciculus branches
                    are everywhere given off, which further subdivide, and form smaller
                    ramifications, that terminate at length in a minutely reticulated structure.
                    Around the margin of the leaf the vessels are continued, and at certain parts
                    are prolonged into the thorns that bound the circumference of this leaf.</p>
                <p>In this and similar instances the vessels appear to be ramified out of greater
                    into less; but, as already observed, this does not appear to be really the fact,
                    the vessels being all of the same size everywhere in the leaf, and all continued
                    through it, like so many distinct tubes. This structure Grew represents in a
                    highly magnified view of the leaf of borage, in table 50 of his work; part of
                    which is represented, on a reduced scale, in fig. 13, Plate XLI., designed to
                    show that the ramified vessels <hi rend="italic">o</hi> are all clusters of
                    tubes of the same size, which, though they separate continually, and come into
                    contact, are never produced or ramified one out of another. Neither do they ever
                    inosculate or anastomose with each other, until, according to Grew, they come to
                    their final distribution.</p>
                <p>The vessels thus distributed through the leaf belong chiefly to the order of
                    spiral vessels, as was shown by Grew in the leaf of the vine and many others;
                    and, from the observations of Malpighi, Darwin, and Knight, already related, it
                    appears that “proper vessels” are everywhere associated with them. It would
                    seem, from the observations of Darwin, that these two orders of vessels
                    communicate in the leaf by continuation of canal, as the arteries and veins do
                    in animal bodies. In the stalk he considered them to be disposed in two
                    concentric rings, the inner one of which carried out the sap to the leaves, and
                    by the outer one it was returned to the bark. <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Phytologiα,</hi> p. 43 and 58.) In branches of the apple and horse-chesnut, Mr
                    Knight also observed coloured fluids to rise through the vascular fasciculi in
                    the petiole of the leaf. These fasciculi were surrounded by others free from
                    colour, which conveyed a different fluid, and, on being traced down the stalk,
                    were found to enter the inner bark, and' to have no communication with those of
                    the wood. The <hi rend="italic">returning</hi> vessels he describes as being
                    situated parallel to and surrounding those which carry up the sap. <hi

                <p>Beside the vascular system which, by its ramιfica-∣ tions, forms the skeleton of
                    die leaf, there is another ∣ structure that requires to be noticed. We have seen
                    that' the vessels, in their ultimate distribution, form a net-work more or less
                    fine and minute in different leaves; so that a great number of intcrvascular
                    spaces are produced. These spaces or areae, says Malpighi, are occupied by
                    cellular tissue, which springs from the vessels themselves, and seems to depend
                    from them; and by its means the thickness of the leaf is formed. In the recent
                    part of the borage leaf, represented in fig. 13, Plate XLI., this cellular
                    structure, occupying the reticulated spaces formed by the vessels, is observed;
                    but it is most clearly seen in thick leaves, when the cuticle has been removed,
                    and the vessels in part dissected away. The cells or utricles which form this
                    <hi rend="italic">parenchyma,</hi> as it has been called, are of different
                    figures, and are mutually contiguous; they are composed of a membrane formed
                    into the shape of a little vesicle or bladder, from the middle of each of which
                    a little vascular production issues; they are all connected with each other, and
                    with the vascular system of the leaf. In fig. 12, Plate XLI., this cellular
                    structure is represented in the leaf of <hi rend="italic">Cactus</hi> by
                    Malpighi, in which the oblong cells arc described as proceeding from the central
                    vessel, and mutually communicating with each other. <hi rend="italic">(Anat.
                    Plantar,</hi> p. 52.) A similar idea of the formation of the cells seems to have
                    been entertained by De Saussure. In different leaves the cells possess very
                    different sizes and forms. In the experiments of Μ. de la Baisse, they are said
                    to have become tinged by coloured fluids conveyed from the vessels. Whether they
                    communicate with each other is not known; but analogy, derived from other
                    similar structures, would lead us to suppose that they communicate only with
                    vessels, as seems to be the case in the cotyledonous leaf of the seed.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Candolle describes the leaf as consisting of a' superior and inferior face,
                    between which is an intcrme- ’ diate part, of very various thickness in
                    different leaves, toļ which he gives the name of <hi rend="italic"
                    >mesophylle,</hi> answering to the parenchyma of preceding writers. The leaf is
                    formed, he says, by ramifications of the vessels, and by cellular tissue, which
                    fills up the intervals of these ramifications. It probably comprehends two
                    systems; one which, receiving the ascending sap, brings it into contact with the
                    air, and permits the exhalation of its superfluous parts; the other a system
                    which receives the elaborated sap, and reconducts it to the stem, whąre it
                    serves for nutrition. Physiological phenomena, he adds, prove the existence of
                    these two functions in leaves; but anatomy has not yet distinguished the organs
                    by which they are accomplished. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi> tome i.
                    p. 271, 273.) It has been before observed that Μ. de Candolle follows Kieser in
                    regarding the alleged spaces between the cells, called intercellular canals, as
                    the organs in which the vegetable fluids are conveyed; but the facts and
                    arguments already stated establish, we think, with sufficient certainty, that,
                    in the wood, the bark, and leaves, the sap is conveyed by appropriate vessels.
                    The consistence of the leaf, continues Μ. de Candolle, depends much on the
                    relative proportions of the cells and vessels that compose it. When the vessels
                    are numerous, the cellular tissue is small in quantity, and the leaf is fibrous,
                    firm, and thin; when, again, the vessels are few and distant, then <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:193096796?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6796-0095"/> the
                    cells are more abundant, and the leaf is softer and 'more fleshy.</p>
                <p>s The two surfaces of this organ often differ much in appearance and structure.
                    On the upper surface the vessels are commonly but little prominent; it is
                    therefore smoother, has but few hairs or pores, and is sometimes destitute of
                    them. The lower surface, on the other hand, presents the vessels more prominent,
                    and is furnished with hairs and pores much more abundantly. These differences
                    are more particularly observed in the leaves of trees: in those of herbs the two
                    surfaces more nearly resemble each other. In aquatic plants, though the upper
                    surface is smooth and green, and the under one pale and rough, yet the former
                    only, as being exposed to the atmosphere, is furnished with pores. It is to be
                    remarked, however, that whether the two surfaces exhibit an aspect either very
                    different or very similar, each seems destined to enjoy a special function.
                    Hence, if the upper surface be turned downward, and the lower one upward, the
                    leaf tends to resume its natural position; and if it be retained by force in a
                    position not natural to it, it dies. <hi rend="italic">(Organog. Végét.</hi>

                <p>In the cellular tissue of herbaceous sterns, and of all leaves, are contained
                    small globules, which by the action of light are rendered green, and bestow on
                    the plant its verdure. In the elongated cells of <hi rend="italic">Conferva

                <p>In the substance of the leaf Malpighi describes small bags or follicles as
                    existing between the cells and vessels, and which, in most leaves, yield a
                    peculiar humour. They spring from the vessels, have a roundish or oblong form,
                    and the lip that bounds their orifice is often furnished with hairs. This
                    orifice points towards the upper surface of the leaf, or that which regards the
                    heavens. In different leaves the follicles have different forms; and they afford
                    a secretion which, adhering to the contiguous parts of the leaf, renders them
                    shining. They are numerous in the leaf of the fig, lemon, orange, &amp;c.; and
                    are rendered more visible as the cellular tissue of the leaf wastes and dries.

                    Flowers.</hi></p>
                <p>The flower is that assemblage of organs which, by the mutual action they exert on
                    each other, give origin to h'uits and seeds. All the parts hitherto described
                    contribute to the growth and perfection of the individual plant, and have been
                    named the Nutritive or Conservative ⅛ystem; but the organs composing the flower
                    are destined to continue the race, and from thence have been denominated the
                    Reproductive Organs. In a limited sense the bud, produced by the conservative
                    system, may be deemed a reproductive organ, since new individuals may
                    successively be propagated from it; but after a certain period, plants thus
                    produced seem to degenerate, and become incapable of producing fruit.
                    Reproduction without fecundation presents no organic apparatus whieh is proper
                    to it; but sexual reproduction, or that accomplished by fecundation, exhibits
                    numerous and varied organs, which merit all our attention, not only because they
                    exercise the principal functions of vegetation, but because, from the constancy
                    and symmetry of their forms in the same species, though varied infinitely in
                    different species, they afford the base on which Classification rests.</p>
                <p>In relation to the organs of reproduction, vegetables, as before remarked, have
                    been divided into two great classes: <hi rend="italic">1st,</hi> such as have
                    flowers visible to the naked eye, and in which the sexual organs are distinct;
                    <hi rend="italic">⅛dly,</hi> such as have flo'wers (if there be any) which can
                    be rendered visible only by the microscope, and in which the sexual organs are
                    not distinct. The former class, named phaenogamous or phanerogamous, comprises
                    all exogenous, and the greater part of endogenous plants; the latter, or
                    cryptogamous division, comprehends some endogenous vascular plants, and all
                    those which possess a simple cellular structure. At present we shall treat only
                    of the first or flowering class.</p>
                <p>The flower is essentially constituted by the presence of one of the two sexual
                    organs, or of two re-united by a common support, with or without the exterior
                    envelope destined to protect them. In some instances the flower bears only a
                    male or female organ, and is then named unisexual; but more commonly these
                    organs are present in the same flower, and it is then called hermaphrodite.</p>
                <p>This unisexual flower, again, is simply male or female, according as it possesses
                    either stamens only, or pistil only. In some instances, though the same plant
                    bears both male and female organs, it is not hermaphrodite, since these organs
                    occur in different flowers; in others, again, the male and female flowers exist
                    only in different plants. Lastly, we sometimes find both male, female, and
                    hermaphrodite flowers mingled together, either on the same or on different
                    footstalks. The distinctions founded on this separation, re-union, and mixture
                    of the sexual organs, have served as the basis of certain classes in theLinnaean
                    system.</p>
                <p>•Sometimes the male or female organs alone, protected in a small scale,
                    constitute the flower; but in general they are surrounded and protected by
                    others, named the <hi rend="italic">corolla</hi> and the <hi rend="italic"
                    >calix.'</hi> All these parts are commonly borne on a stalk called the <hi
                    rend="italic">peduncle,</hi> which, expanding at its extremity, forms the <hi
                    rend="italic">receptacle,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">torus</hi> as it has been
                    called, upon which all the parts above mentioned are supported. In fig. 1, Plate
                    XLII., the sexual parts which constitute a perfect flower are exhibited. The
                    letter <hi rend="italic">a</hi> denotes the corolla, formed, in this flower, of
                    six leaves called petals; <hi rend="italic">b</hi> the stamens or male organs,
                    which surround the pistil or female organ <hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> indicates the peduncle of the
                    flower. In the next figure (fig. 2) the corolla has been removed, and the parts
                    within are then more clearly seen. They now consist only of the sexual organs
                    supported on the peduncle, and at their base are embraced by the calix <hi
                    rend="italic">e.</hi> The pistil, in the centre, is composed of three parts,
                    viz. the ovarium <hi rend="italic">f,</hi> the style <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>
                    and the stigma <hi rend="italic">h</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while each
                    stamen consists only of two parts, the filament <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> and
                    the anther <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> which latter contains the prolific matter
                    named <hi rend="italic">pollen.</hi> Such an assemblage of organs constitutes' a
                    perfect or complete flower; but it often happens, that in flowers where the
                    sexual organs are present, one or other of the accessory organs is wanting;
                    thus, in the tulip only one of the protecting envelopes is present, and
                    botanists differ as to the name it should bear. Linnaeus considers . it as a
                    corolla, because it is coloured like ordinary petals; but Μ. Jussieu regards it
                    as a calix, from its analogy in structure arid use to that organ.</p>

                <p>The flower is sometimes attached immediately to the branch by its base, when it
                    is termed <hi rend="italic">sessile;</hi> but in general it is borne on a
                    footstalk or peduncle. This peduncle of the flower, like the petiole of the
                    leaf, is sometimes single and sometimes ramified: in the latter case its
                    divisions take the name of pedicels.</p>
                <p>Around the base of the flower we often meet with small leaves which, in size,
                    colour, form, and consistence, differ from ordinary leaves. They are called <hi
                    rend="italic">bracteae,</hi> and from the axils they form with the stem or
                    branch the flower-buds often spring. From thus being the birth-place of the
                    flower, which draws from them a great part of the nutrient matter, the bracteae
                    are smaller and more membranous than the ordinary leaves of the plant, and
                    partake often of the colour of the flower. They must, however,be regarded as
                    leaves, modified by the circumstances in which they grow, as is demonstrated by
                    the fact, that examples frequently occur in which bracteae are changed into true
                    leaves. (De Candolle, <hi rend="italic">Or-ganog. Végét.</hi> tome i. p. 438-9.)
                    When these bracteae approximate so as to form a sort of envelope around the
                    flower, they take the name of <hi rend="italic">involucrum,</hi><hi

                    there are numerous modifications, to which botanists attach different names. The

                    they are coloured or exhibit the form of whorls; and the transition of the
                    organs of vegetation into those of florescence is so gradual, says Μ. de
                    Candolle, that the more we study it, the better do we comprehend that unity of
                    composition which constitutes the base of philosophic organography. <hi

                <p>The flower, as well as the leaf, originates from a bud, and in many respects the
                    buds of flowers resemble those of leaves. They are covered and protected in the
                    same manner, but they are generally larger, and have a more rounded form. They

                    sometimes called, and the <hi rend="italic">hybernaculum,</hi> or protecting
                    envelope. In some trees they spring from the extremity of particular branches;
                    in others from the branches in common with the leaf-buds; and in others from the
                    axils of the leaves. In fig. 3, Plate XLII., is a portion of the branch of the
                    peach-tree, bearing two flower-buds <hi rend="italic">11,</hi> between which the
                    smaller and more pointed leaf-bud <hi rend="italic">m</hi> is placed.</p>
                <p>Grew discovered and has exhibited many examples of the complete formation of the
                    flower many months before it is destined to bloom. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of
                    Plants,</hi> tables 63, 64.) Of this fact Du Hamel has also given several
                    examples. In fig. 4 is a longitudinal section of the flower-bud of the
                    peach-tree, made in the month of February, to show the complete formation of the
                    stamens and pistils within the surrounding envelope of the bud. In fig. 5 is
                    another representation of a similar bud, from which the enveloping scales have
                    been removed: it displays the calix, which at this period completely envelopes
                    the other parts of the flower. . When the leaflets of the calix are separated,
                    as is done in fig. 6, then the stamens and pistils are fully disclosed: the
                    petals also of this flower were visible, but at this period were very small.
                    Even the anthers were found to contain a fine dust, but no rudiment of the
                    future embryo could be detected in the ovary. In the flowerbud of the pear,
                    examined in February, the parts of fructification were also visible, but
                    indistinct; a month later, all the parts were more advanced, and the stamens,
                    petals, and pistils were distinct, and towards the end of March, even the
                    rudiments of future seeds were visible in the base of the pistil. <hi
                    rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p. 200.)
                    Thus it appears that through the winter season the several parts of the flower
                    are clandestinely formed, though still extremely minute. As they enlarge, their
                    position within the bud is very various in different species: they gradually
                    expand and form the perfect flower, whose several parts we have next briefly to
                    describe.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">peduncle</hi> of the flower, by which all the other parts
                    are connected with the stem or branch, is frequently single, but often divides
                    into several parts or <hi rend="italic">pedicels,</hi> as they are named, each
                    of which supports one or more flowers. The modes in which the flowers are
                    disposed on the pedicels have received different names from botanists, and to
                    the general circumstance they assign the term <hi rend="italic"
                    >inflorescence.</hi> The peduncle in structure resembles the stalk of the leaf,
                    being formed, like it, of the several common textures. In size, in length, and
                    other external characters, it exhibits all the varieties already noticed in the
                    petiole of the leaf.</p>
                <p>At the extremity of the peduncle is placed the flowercup or <hi rend="italic"
                    >calix,</hi> which has very different forms, and has received in consequence
                    different names. Even in its most common forms it exhibits great variety. It is
                    sometimes composed of a single piece, and has a tubular form; in others, of many
                    pieces called <hi rend="italic">sepals (sepala),</hi> which vary in number,
                    position, and size, and for an account of which we must refer to the writers on
                    botany. In some instances this organ falls when the fruit has set; in others it
                    continues till the fruit is mature; and in others the fruit is formed within it,
                    to which it becomes a permanent covering, and exercises the office of pericarp.
                    The colour of the calix is commonly green, but sometimes partly red, or white,
                    or yellow. In some flowers it is entirely wanting. From the dissections of Grew
                    and Malpighi it appears, like the leaves, to be constructed of a cuticle, a
                    pretty thick cellular tisşue, and of vessels, all of which exist in the
                    peduncle, and are derived from the common textures of the plant.</p>
                <p>Above the calix, the <hi rend="italic">corolla,</hi> the chief ornament of
                    flowers, is borne. It is inclosed by the calix, but surrounds the interior parts
                    of the flower, and is of every colour but green. It consists of one piece, or of
                    several: these pieces are called <hi rend="italic">petals,</hi> and according to
                    the number of these pieces the corolla is variously denominated. The
                    monopetalous corolla, or that composed of one piece, is also distinguished into
                    several parts, expressive of form, position, or quality; and in the polypetalous
                    variety, which consists of several pieces, each petal has its claw <hi
                    rend="italic">(unguis)</hi> situated at the base, and by which it is attached to
                    the calix or receptacle, and its expanded part <hi rend="italic">(lamina),</hi>
                    which is of very various figure, size, and colour. At the base of the petal a
                    tuft of hairs is often observed, and its surface is frequently covered with a
                    fine down, or sometimes with jointed hairs bearing 'globulets, as occurs on
                    leaves. With regard to structure, Malpighi describes it as composed of the same
                    textures as the common leaf, as is distinctly visible in the thicker varieties
                    of it. Grew showed it to possess <hi rend="italic">spiral</hi> vessels,—a proof,
                    as Du Hamel observes, that it is partly derived from the ligneous texture, since
                    such vessels are not found in the bark. The odour these organs possess leads to
                    the belief that they contain also a peculiar juice. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>The organ next to be noticed is the nectary <hi rend="italic">(nectariumf</hi> In
                    a strict sense this term designates any excretory gland which is situated on any

                    organs, symmetrically disposed. Their most common seat is the receptacle or

                    corolla, calix, stamens, &amp;c. They have the form sometimes of distinct
                    tubercles; but in different plants they exhibit various other forms. In <hi

                    placed, but are found on one part and not on the corresponding part of the same
                    flower. Sometimes they supply the place of abortive stamens or pistils. The
                    juice they secrete is greedily sought by insects. <hi rend="italic">( Organog.

                    Flowers.</hi></p>
                <p>Having exhibited this general view of the flower, we must now describe somewhat
                    more particularly the forms, characters, and structure of its most important
                    parts—the sexual organs.</p>
                <p>The male organ or stamen consists, as before remarked, of two parts,—the anther,
                    with the pollen it contains, and the filament on which the anther is borne. The
                    filament, though a common, is not an essential part, and is sometimes wanting,
                    when the stamen is said to be sessile: the perfection of the stamen resides,
                    therefore, in the anther, and especially in the pollen it contains.</p>
                <p>In regard to number, length, position, direction, <hi rend="italic">&amp;c.</hi>
                    the stamens exhibit great diversity in different plants. The <hi rend="italic"
                    >number of</hi> stamens in each flower varies from one to twenty or more; and on
                    this number, progressively increasing in flowers truly hermaphrodite, the first
                    ten classes in the Linnaean system are founded. In <hi rend="italic"
                    >length,</hi> the stamens are equal or unequal; and this disproportion is
                    sometimes symmetrical and sometimes not,—peculiarities which give rise to the
                    formation of other classes in the Linnaean arrangement, <hi rend="italic">Vx
                    position,</hi> the stamens are some? times opposed to the divisions of the
                    petals, and sometimes they alternate with them. Sometimes, from being shorter,
                    the stamens are wholly included within the corolla: in other instances they
                    protrude beyond it. Their <hi rend="italic">direction</hi> is erect, pendent, or
                    horizontal; and their summit is variously inclined to or reflected from the
                    centre of the flower, <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi> In some flowers the stamens
                    are united by their filaments; in others by their anthers; and in others they
                    are joined to and almost confounded with the pistil, giving origin, in their
                    various módes and degrees of union, to the formation of other classes in the
                    Linnaean system.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">filament</hi> which bears the anther is most commonly
                    straight and filiform: sometimes, however, it is flattened or wedge-shaped, or
                    awl-shaped. It is sometimes as small as a hair, sometimes large and flat like a
                    petal, and its summit is cither pointed or obtuse. To the summit the antlrer is
                    commonly attached; but in some flowers this part is prolonged beyond the
                    attachment of the anther. In structure, the filament resembles the corolla; and
                    it often happens that these organs, are transformed into one another. Thus the
                    rose, in its wild state, has only five petals and many stamens; but by
                    cultivation the stamens gradually degenerate into petals, and the flower becomes
                    sterile. Malpighi describes the filaments as originating from the ligneous
                    texture, being formed of spiral vessels and elongated cells; and as they are
                    sometimes produced from elongated floral leaves (petals), they must necessarily,

                    same parts. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">anther</hi> is that essential <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi>
                    part of the stamen that contains the fecundating matter. It is borne on the
                    summit of the filament, and is generally formed of two small membranous sacs,
                    attached immediately to each other, or ’ united by an intermediate connecting
                    body. Anthers,’ therefore, are generally bilocular; but in some plants there is
                    only one sac or loculament, and in others as many as four. The sacs are either
                    round, oval, or elongated: each sac commonly exhibits on one of its sides a
                    longitudinal furrow: this side is properly called the face, and the part opposed
                    to it the back, of the anther. The anther is attached to the summit of the
                    filament, sometimes by its face, sometimes by its back, &amp;c. In form, the
                    anther is subject to great variety; and the two sacs that compose .a bilocular
                    anther are joined together in very different modes. In discharging the pollen
                    the sacs open in different ways in different genera of plants, most commonly by
                    the longitudinal furrow that runs along the face of the anther; but in some
                    plants the opening, or dehiscence as it is called, is through two small holes or
                    pores situated at the summit of the two sacs; and sometimes it is by a sort of
                    little valves in some one or more parts of the anther. As the filaments of the
                    stamens sometimes cohere, so likewise do the anthers, in a manner to form a sort
                    of tube. In other plants the stamens, instead of being free or simply united
                    together, coalesce so as to make one body with the pistil. The colour of the
                    anther is often yellow, orange, violet, white, &amp;c., but never green or truly
                    blue.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">pollen,</hi> contained in the anthers, consists of numerous
                    regularly figured small particles, which possess a very different figure, size,
                    and colour in different plants. Many of their forms and sizes are delineated by
                    Grew in table 58 of his <hi rend="italic">Anatomy of Plants.</hi> In fig. 9, A,
                    Plate XLII., copied from Grew, one of the filaments, bearing its anther, as it
                    appears when detached from the pistil of the mallow, fig. 8, is exhibited. The
                    particles of pollen are considerably magnified, and still more highly in fig. 9,
                    B. In fig. 10 of the same plate, severalrepresentations of the forms of the
                    pollen, as given by Du Hamel, are also exhibited. The number of these particles
                    in each anther extends, it is said, from a few hundreds to many thousands. In
                    the cell of the anther they are said to float in a viscous liquid, and to be
                    nowhere attached to its sides, though it is probable they once were; and Μ.
                    Turpin has even designated a salient point in each cell as the part which
                    produced the pollen. (De Candolle’s <hi rend="italic">Organog. Végét.</hi> tome
                    i. p. 465.)</p>
                <p>In some flowers the pollen consists of transparent grains; in others they are of
                    à white, purple, blue or brown, and more frequently of a yellow colour. Their
                    surface is either smooth or rough, or covered sometimes with a viscous matter.
                    When examined under the microscope at the period of maturity, they may be seen
                    to burst, and yield a fluid, in which, according to Du Hamel, small granules are
                    seen to float. This fluid is described as being thin, or viscid, or oily. If a
                    grain of pollen be thrown on the surface of water, it may be seen to swell
                    insensibly, and finally burst. At this moment a minute quantity of fluid matter
                    escapes, which spreads on the surface of the water, and forms a sort of slight
                    cloudiness. It is to this liquid matter that the fecundating property of the
                    pollen has been attributed. <hi rend="italic">(Elemens</hi><hi rend="italic">de
                    Botanique,</hi> par Achille Richard, p. 199.) This fluid is said by Hedwig to be
                    discharged at once on the bursting of its containing capsule; but Koelreutėr
                    considers it to be slowly transmitted through pores in the side, or hairs on the
                    surface of the capsule.</p>
                <p>Instead of being formed of distinct granules, the pollení is sometimes met with
                    in a solid mass. In many genera of the families <hi rend="italic">Apocyneae</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">0rehidece,flλ</hi> the pollen contained in one sac is
                    united into one body, having the form öf the containing sac; in other instances
                    it forms smaller <pb break="no" facs="nls:193096835?mode=fullsize"

                    net-work; 'while in others the masses are granular. The pollen is very
                    inflammable, and in many plants its odour is said, to bear a striking
                    resemblance to the corresponding secretion in animals. <hi rend="italic"

                <p>It has lately been said by some,.that the particles contained in the grains of
                    pollen exhibit spontaneous motions, like the spermatic animalcules of animals;
                    others ascribe these motions to causes distinct from life; and others, though
                    they allow similar motions to be exhibited by the molecules of unorganized
                    matter, maintain, nevertheless, that in the granules of pollen they are
                    independent of physical causes, and resemble the less rapid motions of some of
                    the simplest animalcules of infusions.</p>
                <p>The parts of the flower hitherto described are constructed, says Malpighi, with
                    reference to the female organs, in which the seed, the last result sought by
                    nature, is curiously formed and matured. This organ, called the pistil <hi

                    rend="italic">p</hi> indicates the stigma, <hi rend="italic">q</hi> the style,
                    and <hi rend="italic">r</hi> the ovary. To this latter organ Malpighi and Grew
                    gave the name of <hi rend="italic">uterus,</hi> Linnaeus that of <hi
                    rend="italic">germen,</hi> and Gaertner that of <hi rend="italic">ovarium.</hi>
                    In different plants the pistil exhibits great variety in form, size, number, and
                    mode of attachment; upon which many of the <hi rend="italic">orders</hi> in the
                    Linnaean system are founded.</p>
                <p>~ The <hi rend="italic">ovarium</hi> occupies almost always the inferior part of
                    the pistil. It is the organ in which the seed is produced. When cut open it
                    exhibits one or more cavities or cells, in which are contained the rudiments of
                    the seeds or ovula; and it is in it that the change of the ovula into perfect
                    seeds is accomplished. Its form is various, but most commonly ovoidal. It is
                    seated commonly on the receptacle, together with the stamens; but frequently it
                    is plaeed below the flower. Its cavity consists sometimes only of one cell or
                    loculament, in which one or more ovula are found. More frequently there are two
                    or more cells containing ovula: these are sometimes disposed in regular series,
                    sometimes they are scattered and without order, and sometimes they are united to
                    one another in a globular form. When these ovula are fecundated they become
                    seeds; but in some plants a certain number are constantly abortive.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">style</hi> is a prolongation from the summit of the
                    ovarium, and supports the stigma. It is commonly so situate in the flower as to
                    be surrounded by the stamens; but sometimes it is entirely wanting, and the
                    stigma is then said to be sessile. The ovary in different plants may be
                    surmounted by one or more styles; while in other plants there is but one style
                    to many ovaries. Most frequently the style occupies the summit of the ovary, but
                    sometimes it springs from its side, and very rarely from its base. The forms of
                    the style are numerous :—the most common is the filiform; but frequently it is
                    thick, angulated, or club-shaped. It is commonly a hollow tube which
                    communicates with the ovary: there is usually but one style to one ovary, but
                    sometimes more. In some instances the pistils correspond in number with the
                    loculaments into which the pvary is divided; in other instances every seed that
                    is formed has its distinct pistil, while in other examples only one pistil is
                    allotted to a great number of seeds. In some flowers the style is so connected
                    with the ovary that it falls after fecundation; in others it continues after
                    that event, and forms a part of the future fruit.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">stigma,</hi> which forms the summit of the pistil,
                    sometimes terminates the style by an open mouth. Sometimes it appears like a
                    small bud; in other instances it is variously divided or forked. Sometimes it is
                    smooth; and' is sometimes covered with hairs. The number of stigmata is
                    determined by that, of the styles, or divisions of the styles, and therefore
                    varies from one to six or more in different plants. Sometimes the stigma is
                    attached to the summit of the ovary, without the intervention of a style; but
                    most frequently it is seated on the summit of the style, or occasionally
                    attached to its side, or to that of the ovary.</p>
                <p>In consistence, the stigma is thick and fleshy, or thin and membranous, or formed
                    of small glandular bodies. In form, it varies exceedingly; and its surface is
                    smooth, pubescent, or plumons, &amp;c. In structure, it is ordinarily glandular;
                    and at the period of fecundation its surface is rendered moist by a peculiar
                    viscous matter. When the pollen falls on this matter, its grains burst, and the
                    granules, called by some <hi rend="italic">favilloe,</hi> are supposed to be
                    absorbed by the spongioles seated in this part, and conveyed to the ovula by the
                    vessels which form the pistillary cord, and thus accomplish their fecundation.
                    Μ. Bulliarđ is said to have traced coloured liquors, previously absorbed by the
                    stigma, along the vessels in the interior of the style, to the ovula contained
                    in the cells of the ovary. (De Candolle, tome i. p. 480.) In many plants,
                    however, either from the structure of the pistil, the nature of the pollen, or
                    the circumstances in which fecundation is effected, the pollen seems never to
                    come into contact with the ovula.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section</hi> IV.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Of the Structure of Fruits and Formation of Seeds.</hi></p>
                <p>In the preceding section we described the structure of the flower antecedent to
                    fructification: we have now to exhibit as concisely as possible the changes of
                    form it undergoes after that event, and particularly as it regards the
                    production of the seed.</p>
                <p>After fecundation has been effected, the calix, corolla, stamens, and even style
                    of the pistil, commonly fade and fall; the ovary alone remains, and undergoes
                    very different changes of form in different plants. In the latter periods of its
                    enlargement it is usually called <hi rend="italic">pericarp (peri-carpìum),</hi>
                    a term which is understood by botanists to apply also in certain cases to the
                    calix, the corolla, or any other apparatus of organs that serves as a support
                    and defence to the seed.</p>
                <p>In its early state the ovary is described by Gaertner as possessing at first a
                    simple cellular structure, which at a <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> later
                    period takes the form of distinct cavities or locula-' ments. Within these
                    cavities minute globules are after-’ wards seen, which are the rudiments of
                    future seeds. According to Mr R. Brown, the ovulum, in the unimpregnated
                    ovarium, is attached only to a part of the membrane that lines its cell or
                    internal cavity; but soon after fecundation in some cases, and still oftener
                    during the growth of the seed, this membrane coheres so closely with the proper
                    coat of the seed as to be no longer distinguishable or separable from it. In the
                    ovarium of plants of the family <hi rend="italic">Composite</hi> he observed two
                    slender filiform cords, which, originating from the base of the ovulum or its
                    short footstalk, ran up, and were more or less connected with the parieţes of
                    the ovarium, until they united at the top of its cavity immediately under the
                    style, between which and the ovulum a connection was then formed. In some
                    species of this family, as in <hi rend="italic">tussilago odorata,</hi> these
                    çorđs were easily separable from the ovarium, and could be removed entire along
                    with the ovulum. These cords he regards rather as vessels conveying' nutrient
                    matter, than as organs by which impregnation was accomplished. A similar
                    appearance of vascular cords con <pb break="no"

                    ovulum with the style was observed in the family <hi rend="italic"
                    >Brunonia;</hi> andin certain liliaceous plants the bulblike seeds, which
                    separate from the plant before the em-bιyo becomes visible, are supplied with
                    distinct spiral vessels, which, entering at the umbilicus, ramify regularly
                    through the fleshy mass, and appear to have a relation to the central cavity,
                    where the embryo is afterwards formed. <hi rend="italic">(Linnaean Trans,</hi>
                    vol. xii.) Thus, then, the ovulum in the plant, like the egg in the animal, is,
                    to a certain extent, produced without fecundation; but if that function be not
                    performed, it soon degenerates and wastes. The progressive changes that occur in
                    the ovary itself, and in its contained <hi rend="italic">ovuĩa,</hi> subsequent
                    to impregnation, have been observed by Malpighi in several plants, whose
                    observations, as they relate to the almond, we shall briefly detail.</p>
                <p>In fig. 11, Plate XLII., is represented the pistil of the almond, as it appears
                    soon after fecundation, in which the ovary <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is seen to
                    be somewhat enlarged, and has an oval form. In the next figure (fig. 12) a
                    longitudinal section of the same pistil is exhibited, exposing the cavity of the
                    ovary <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> within which a small vesicle, <hi rend="italic"
                    >t,</hi> is placed. As the ovary (fig. 13) enlarges, it becomes rounder, and its
                    style is contorted and diminished in size. If in this stage it be laid open, as
                    in fig. 14, its vessels, which in the peduncle <hi rend="italic">w</hi> are
                    disposed cylindrically, are observed to be dilated at the place of the calix <hi
                    rend="italic">x,</hi> and to give off branches to the ovary itself, and to the
                    shell <hi rend="italic">y</hi> that now begins to be formed within it. In the
                    centre, the ovulum <hi rend="italic">z</hi> is now seen to be much increased in
                    size. All the parts continue to augment; the ovary (fig. 15) becomes rounder,
                    and the appearance of the style is obliterated. On exposing its cavity in this
                    stage, as in fig. 16, the ovulum <hi rend="italic">a!</hi> in the centre is
                    observed to be much increased, and the outer layer <hi rend="italic">b'</hi> of
                    the shelly covering that invests it now begins to harden. Such are the changes
                    of form and structure exhibited by the ovary: we have next to trace more
                    minutely those of the ovulum that is produced within it.</p>
                <p>The earlier appearances of this body have been exhibited in fig. 12 and 14. When
                    removed from its seat, a few days after fecundation has been accomplished, and
                    viewed by a moderately magnifying power, it exhibits the form and appearance
                    represented in fig. 17. Externally it is covered by a vascular tunic, c <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi>, derived from the inner coat of the ovarium, a part
                    of which coat adheres to it at <hi rend="italic">ď.</hi> If in this stage the
                    ovulum be laid open by a vertical section, as in fig. 18, it is seen to be
                    composed of two tunics or sacs, one within the other; the inner one is filled
                    with a cellular tissue, that contains a transparent juice. To this inner tunic
                    the term <hi rend="italic">chorion</hi> may be properly applied.</p>
                <p>At a period a little later, when the ovulum is examined, a tubular body (e', fig.
                    19) is observed to extend through the chorion or tunic last mentioned. Shortly
                    after, this tube expands at its apex, and is found to contain a small vesicle.
                    In fig. 20, which represents a section of the entire ovulum, the outer tunic,
                    the chorion, and the tube <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">
                    ,</hi> expanded at its apex, are exhibited. To it the appellation of <hi
                    rend="italic">amnios</hi> may be given; for it is the organ in which the <hi
                    rend="italic">embryo,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">corculum,</hi> as at this early
                    period it has been called, is first seen to emerge. Through several successive
                    days the expanded portion of this tube enlarges and forms a sort of sac, which
                    is filled with cellular tissue, and the summit of which, says Malpighi, the
                    embryo is seen to occupy. In fig. 21 this amnios is separated from the other
                    tunics, and at its summit the embryo <hi rend="italic">g</hi><hi rend="italic
                    superscript"> ,</hi> is observed. If removed from its seat, the embryo presents
                    the appearance <hi rend="italic">h'</hi> (fig. 22), and when expanded, as m fig.
                    22, <hi rend="italic">i',</hi> is seen to consist of a body and two little
                    wings.</p>
                <p>Having thus viewed the several parts of which the ovulum is composed in their
                    separate state, let us next observe them in connection, and trace the series of
                    appearances they exhibit, and the effects they produce on each other. In figure
                    23 is given a vertical section of the entire ovulum in a more advanced state.
                    The outer coat <hi rend="italic">k'</hi> still envelopes the others; the embryo
                    <hi rend="italic">ľ</hi> occupies the summit of the amnios <hi rend="italic"
                    >m',</hi> whose lower part, still tubular, is continued through the chorion <hi
                    rend="italic">n'.</hi> In the next figure (fig. 24), from which the outer coat
                    has been removed, the embryo <hi rend="italic">o'</hi> and the amnios <hi
                    rend="italic">p'</hi> are represented as enlarged; but the chorion <hi
                    rend="italic">q</hi><hi rend="italic superscript"> r</hi> is partly exhausted of
                    its juice, and has fallen down in a collapsed state. At this period the embryo,
                    when separated from the amnios, has the form <hi rend="italic">r',</hi> fig. 25,
                    and in its expanded state is represented by the letter √ of the same figure. The
                    bulk of the embryo <hi rend="italic">ť,</hi> fig. 26, continually augments, and
                    encroaches on the capacity of the two tunics <hi rend="italic">v', x</hi> ’ <hi
                    rend="italic">,</hi> whose forms are constantly changing; and from being
                    successively emptied of their juices, with which the embryo becomes filled, they
                    are gradually pressed downward. At last the embryo <hi rend="italic">y</hi> ’
                    <hi rend="italic">,</hi> fig. 27, is so much augmented as to fill the cavity of
                    the outer tunic; and by this time the amnios and chorion, exhausted of their
                    fluids, exhibit the shrunk and corrugated forms in which they appear at the
                    bottom of the figure. According to this representation, the outer tunic <hi
                    rend="italic">k',</hi> fig. 23, derived from the ovary itself, and the fine
                    membrane that immediately invests the embryo, form the only permanent coverings
                    of the mature ovum or seed; for during the progress of formation the chorion and
                    amnios (which are successively produced subsequent to fecundation) are again
                    obliterated by the growth of the contained embryo. Malpighi describes the
                    process of formation in many other seeds to be nearly similar; for his
                    descriptions of which we must refer the reader to his work <hi rend="italic"
                    >(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 71).</p>
                <p>In the above descriptions of Malpighi, the several parts seem to be clearly
                    exhibited, except in one important particular, namely, the situation and course
                    of the <hi rend="italic">umbilical cord.</hi> In almost every instance he
                    designates the tube, which we have represented as the first form of the amnios,
                    as the umbilical vessel <hi rend="italic">(vasculum umbilicale),</hi> which the
                    subsequent appearances it exhibits show to be erroneous. In the descriptions of
                    Grew this deficiency in the representations of Malpighi is supplied. He has
                    particularly observed the formation of the seed in the apricot, which in many
                    respects resembles that of the almond; and we shall subjoin an abridged account
                    of his observations.</p>
                <p>In this fruit the pericarp that envelopes the seed is seen, in its mature state,
                    to be composed of the pulpy part <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> fig. 28, within which
                    is the osseous envelope <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and at the centre the kernel
                    or true seed <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> At an early period both the pulp and
                    stone are observed to consist of cellular tissue; and through the stone the
                    vessels passing from the peduncle are continued. At the base of the figure the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">d</hi> denotes one fasciculus of vessels continued
                    through the stone, and turning inward, where it reaches the apex of the seed.
                    These vessels form the umbilical cord or seçd-branch of Grew, while the
                    fasciculus <hi rend="italic">e</hi> that runs on the opposite side is continued
                    to the flower. In fig. 29 a vertical section of the ovulum, as well as pericarp,
                    is exhibited as it appears at a very early period; in which <hi rend="italic"
                    >f</hi> denotes the pulp, <hi rend="italic">g</hi> the stone through which the
                    umbilical vessels pass and enter the outer tunic <hi rend="italic">h</hi> of the
                    ovulum, around which they make a ring. Within this tunic is another, <hi

                <p>In fig. 30 these several parts of the ovulum are exhibited on a larger scale; the
                    letter <hi rend="italic">I</hi> denotes the outer tunic that immediately lines
                    the stone; <hi rend="italic">m</hi> the inner one, corresponding to the <hi
                    rend="italic">chorion</hi> of Malpighi; and <hi rend="italic">n</hi> the tube
                    answering to the <hi rend="italic">amnios of</hi> the same author. Through the
                    outer tunic Grew represents the umbilical vessels to pass and be continued to
                    the middle tunic, the cavity of which is occupied by large cells that contain a
                    pure lyπιph. At first this tunic is entire, but soon there appears m it the
                    small duct <hi rend="italic">n.</hi> This duct is not at first wider than a
                    hair, and is dilated at each extremity into an oval cavity that contains a pure
                    lymph. A few days after a soft node is seen to emerge in the upper cavity of
                    this tube. This node (o, fig. 31) is described to possess a conical figure, and
                    to be another tunic filled with very minute cells. It is at first entire, but
                    when about the size of a carraway-seed it becomes a little hollowed near its
                    apex, at which part the vessels enter and terminate in another very small node
                    (fig. 32), which is the first appearance of the embryo of the seed. This embryo,
                    when about one fifth part as big as a cheese-mite, begins to be distinguished by
                    a little fissure, which marks the division of the lobes, as in fig. 33. When the
                    lobes have increased, and are more fully formed, the node contracts at its base
                    (fig. 34), indicating the place of the umbilical cord, which subsequently
                    becomes the radicle of the seed. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. of Plants,</hi> p.

                <p>This description corresponds nearly with that of Malpighi, as far as regards the
                    situation and general form of the tunics, and the place in which the embryo is
                    seen first to emerge. It also displays the course of the vessels to form the
                    umbilical cord; but the growth of the embryo in this seed does not seem to
                    produce the obliteration of some of the tunics in the manner delineated by
                    Malpighi.</p>
                <p>An example of a different kind is observed in the pear. Its structure has been
                    described by Grew, and more minutely by Du Hamel. In its mature state it
                    consists of a pulpy matter, in the centre of which are five loculaments that
                    contain each two seeds. These appearances arc exhibited in the transverse
                    section, fig. 35; and in the longitudinal section, fig. 36, the seeds are
                    further shown to be attached by a small umbilical cord. The pulp of the fruit is
                    made up of a very fine cellular tissue, filled with the proper substance of the
                    fruit, and is everywhere furnished with vessels. Through this pulpy matter a
                    number of solid particles are met with, which are more particularly accumulated
                    at the top and about the core. They are formed of an assemblage of small
                    particles, of a stony consistence, with which a little knot of vessels (fig. 37)
                    is everywhere connected. In fig. 38 is a thin transverse slice, showing the
                    relative position of these stony particles, as indicated by the knots of vessels
                    with which they are associated. The stony matter is not observed at an early
                    period, but seems to be deposited from the juices in a more mature state.</p>
                <p>By long maceration in water the pulpy matter is dissolved, and the vascular
                    system is obtained separate. In the peduncle of the fruit fifteen principal
                    fasciculi of vessels arc contained. Ten of these are distributed to the seeds
                    and flower, and the five others are dispersed through the pulp. This vascular
                    structure is represented in fig. 39 after the removal of the pulpy part; the
                    larger vessels embrace the core, and, after variously ramifying, terminate in
                    the little vascular processes before described as connected with the stony
                    matter of the pulp. In fig. 40 is represented one of the loculaments of the
                    capsule, with the seed in it, receiving vessels from fasciculi continued from
                    the peduncle; and in fig. 41 an entire seed is represented, and also a section
                    of the same, in which the umbilical vessels that enter at the base are. shown,
                    as in other instances, to be continued beneath the tunic to the apex of the
                    seed. <hi rend="italic">(Phys,</hi><hi rend="italic">des Arbres,</hi> tome i. p.

                <p>The last variety we shall notice in the formation of the seed is that of wheat
                    <hi rend="italic">(triticum),</hi> as given by Malpighi. In fig. 42 is
                    represented the pistil of the flower of this plant, consisting of the ovarium
                    <hi rend="italic">q,</hi> the two styles <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> and the
                    feathered parts that form the stigmata. Previous to fecundation, the ovarium is
                    found to contain a little vesicle, fig. 43, which is the rudiment of the future
                    ovulum. After fecundation the styles soon fall, and the ovarium acquires a more
                    pointed figure, as in fig. 44. If now it be opened, the little vesicle has
                    changed its appearance, and contains within it another smaller vesicle, <hi
                    rend="italic">u,</hi> fig. 45. The ovarium continues to alter its shape, and
                    assumes a more oblong form, ∙fig. 46, and the appearance of styles is now quite
                    obliterated. Gradually the little vesicle is formed into a small plantule,
                    convex anteriorly, fig. 47, but more hollowed within, fig. 48, and which is
                    situated at the base of the ovarium. The two portions thus described in figures
                    47 and 48 arc the minute germ and cotyledon of this seed, which are represented
                    in their appropriate place in fig. 49, in which the letter <hi rend="italic"
                    >x</hi> denotes the germ, resting in the concavity of the cotyledon; <hi
                    rend="italic">y</hi> the albumen that forms the chief bulk of the seed; and <hi
                    rend="italic">z</hi> the ovarium, which in this seed continues permanent, and
                    forms its outer tunic. <hi rend="italic">(Anat. Plantar,</hi> p. 73.)</p>

                    refers to the figures given by those authors as illustrative of them. The
                    liquor, however, in which the embryo is first seen, he confounds with the sac
                    that contains it, calling it the amnios; but the term amnios designates the
                    membrane or sac only, and not the fluid contained within it. Sometimes, he says,
                    there is no proper sac for this fluid, but it is contained in the chorion, or in
                    an appropriate cellular tissue. <hi rend="italic">(De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    formation of the seed have likewise been observed by Mr Keith, whose account of
                    them agrees with that of Malpighi and Grew. <hi rend="italic">(System of
                    Physiological Botany,</hi> vol. ii. chap. 8.) Very recently, also, the same
                    subject has occupied the attention of several foreign writers, and particularly
                    of Μ. Mirbcl, whose observations we shall briefly detail.</p>
                <p>According to Μ. Mirbel, little.has been done to advance this part of physiology
                    since the days of Grew and Malpighi, till the late observations of Μ. Schmitz
                    and Mr R. Brown. The latter remarked that we ought not to judge of the structure
                    of the ovulum from that of the developed seed. . Acting on this idea, Μ. Mirbel
                    applied himself to examine the ovarium, from the moment the ovulum begins to
                    appear, and followed its progressive changes of development in plants of the
                    same species. The ovulum at first he describes as a small pulpy excrescence of a
                    conical shape, attached to the containing cell, and which does not appear to
                    have any proper envelope or aperture of any kind. In plants whose ovaria produce
                    many seeds, the ovula exhibit different degrees of development, according as
                    they are nearer to or more distant from the vascular cords that supply
                    nutriment. Μ. Schmitz, it is said, first discovered in the apex of each ovulum a
                    small orifice or hole, which penetrates the two membranes or sacs, of which, at
                    this early period, the ovulum is composed. To these sacs, which are placed one
                    within the other, Μ. Mir-bel has given the names of <hi rend="italic"
                    >primine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">secondine.</hi> The orifices at their apex,
                    which at first form but one aperture <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> externally,
                    soon become more distinct from the enlarge-' ment of the parts within, and
                    gradually a third membrane is seen to protrude through them. No sooner has it
                    become visible in the form of a small pulp, than it begins, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193096874?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-6874-0101"/> in some
                    species, to dilate interiorly, so as to form a sac ' with very thin sides, which
                    afterwards becomes blended with the secondine: in other species it protrudes to
                    a considerable extent, and in a conical form, through the primine and secondine,
                    which appear to invest it as the cup of the acorn embraces the kernel. In this
                    state it is free at its apex, but is attached at its base to the secondine. To
                    this sac the name of <hi rend="italic">tercine</hi> has been given. These three
                    tunics, it is said, appear together as soon as the development of the ovulum
                    begins; the primine is never absent, and the same is probably the case with the
                    tercine, nor has he ever missed the secondine but in a very few instances.</p>
                <p>In addition to the three tunics or sacs just described, two others, named the <hi
                    rend="italic">quartine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">quintine,</hi> successively
                    appear. The former, says Μ. Mirbel, is not rare, but has escaped observation by
                    being confounded with the tercine, from which, however, it differs both in its
                    origin and mode of growth. On its first appearance it forms a cellular lining
                    over the inner surface of the cavity of the ovulum. By degrees it separates, and
                    continues attached only to the summit of that cavity. In this state it forms a
                    close sac, and so continues in the ovula of some plants; while in those of
                    others its cavity becomes filled with cellular tissue, and forms a pulpy
                    mass.</p>
                <p>The fifth envelope, or <hi rend="italic">quintine,</hi> is always developed
                    either within the tercine or quartine when they remain filled with cellular
                    tissue. It is first seen in the centre of the sac like a fine tube, and is
                    attached at one end to its summit, and at the other to its base. It begins to
                    enlarge at the summit, and the embryo is almost simultaneously visible in it. As
                    the enlargement proceeds downward, the quintine presses at all points on the sac
                    that surrounds it, so as often to push down and occupy the place of the tercine
                    or quartine. From the summit of the ovulum a very fine thread (Ze <hi
                    rend="italic">suspenseur)</hi> descends in the quintine, bearing at its
                    extremity a globule, which is the nascent embryo. This quintine, adds Μ. Mirbel,
                    answers to the vesicle called amnios by Malpighi.</p>
                <p>t The foregoing observations were made on the ovula of several plants, and in
                    their more important points will be seen to correspond nearly with the
                    descriptions of Malpighi and Grew. These latter authors have not so minutely
                    examined the ovulum and its envelopes antecedent to fecundation; but after that
                    event the chorion of Malpighi may be considered as answering to the tercine or
                    quartine of Mirbel; for in the centre of this chorion the tube e <hi
                    rend="superscript"> ,</hi> (fig. 19, Plate XLII.) is seen to extend from the
                    summit to the base, as in the tercine of Mirbel. The subsequent expansion of
                    this tube at its summit (fig. 21), its gradual enlargement downwards, and the
                    appearance of the embryo at its apex as described to oecur in the quintine of
                    Mirbel, are all exhibited in the amnios of Malpighi; as is also, in fig. 23, the
                    pressure which this amnios makes on the surrounding sac. In the representations
                    of these appearances given by Grew in figures 28 to 34 inclusive, Plate XLII., a
                    similar series of changes is exhibited; and in what relates to the vascular
                    connection of the ovum with the parent plant, he has anticipated most of the
                    observations of those who have followed him. Thus, in fig. 28, 29, Plate XLII.,
                    he exhibits the course the vessels take after quitting the peduncle, and shows
                    that they penetrate the several tunics to reach the point where the embryo, in
                    the form of a small globule (fig. 32), is first seen to emerge; and in fig. 33
                    and 34 of the same plate he delineates the thread by which it is suspended.</p>
                <p>According to Μ. Mirbel, the vessels which form the funiculus or cord enter the
                    ovulum at the point afterwards called <hi rend="italic">hilum</hi> in the mature
                    seed, and terminate at a point in the inner tunic or membrane, to which the term
                    <hi rend="italic">chalaza,</hi> or internal umbilicus, has been applied. This
                    point or chalaza in the inner tunic corresponds, he says, in the ovula of some
                    plants with that of the hilum in the outer; but sometimes the vessels after
                    their entrance are prolonged in the manner described by Grew, so that the place
                    of the chalaza is opposite to that of the hilum. Wherever the chalaza may be
                    situated, that part, Mirbel adds, is to be considered as the base of the seed.
