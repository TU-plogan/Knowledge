                    was by the father’s side great-grandson, and by the mother’s, grandson of Levi.

                    went together into Egypt to deliver the children of Israel. He had a great share
                    in all that Moses did for their deliverance. The Scriptures call him the prophet
                    of Moses, and he acted in that capacity after the Israelites had passed over the
                    Red Sea. He ascended Mount Sinai with two of his sons, Nadab and Abihu, and
                    seventy elders of the people; but neither he nor they went higher than halfway,
                    from whence they saw the glory of God; only Moses and Joshua went to the top,
                    where they stayed forty days. During their absence, Aaron, overcome by the
                    people’s eager entreaties, set up the golden calf, which the Israelites
                    worshipped by his consent. This calf has given rise to various conjectures. Some
                    Rabbis maintain that he did not make the golden calf, but only threw the gold
                    into the fire, to get rid of the importunities of the people; and that certain
                    magicians who mingled with the Israelites at their departure from Egypt, cast
                    this gold into the figure of a calf. According to some authors, the fear of
                    falling a sacrifice to the resentment of the people, by giving a refusal, made
                    Aaron comply with their desire: and they allege also, that he hoped to elude
                    their request, by demanding of the women to contribute their ear-rings;
                    imagining they would rather choose to remain without a visible deity, than be
                    deprived of their personal ornaments. This affair of the golden calf happened in
                    the third month after the Israelites came out of Egypt. In the first month of
                    the following year, Aaron was appointed by God high-priest; which office he
                    executed during the time that the children of Israel continued in the
                    wilderness. He died upon Mount Hor, in the fortieth year after the departure
                    from Egypt, being then 123 years old; <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> Μ. 2522, of

                    much valued. It was written in Hebrew, and printed in folio with a Latin

                    time with St Alban the first martyr of Britain. We are not told what their
                    British names were, it being usual with the Christian Britons, at the time of
                    baptism, to take new names from the Greek, Latin, or Hebrew. Nor have we any
                    certainty as to the particulars of their death; only that they suffered the most
                    cruel torments. Two churches were dedicated to the brothers, in which their
                    bodies were interred, at Caer-Leon, the ancient metropolis of Wales.</p>
