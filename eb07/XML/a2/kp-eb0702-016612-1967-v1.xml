                    person and another, or between a married and unmarried person.</p>
                <p>Punishments have been annexed to adultery in most ages and nations, though of
                    different degrees of severity. In many it has been capital; in others venial,
                    and attended only with slight pecuniary mulcts. Some of the penalties are
                    serious, and even cruel; others of a jocose and humorous kind. Even contrary
                    things have been enacted as punishments for adultery. By some laws the criminals
                    are forbidden marrying together in case they become single; by others they are
                    forbidden to marry any besides each other: by some they are incapacitated from
                    ever committing the like crime again; by others they are glutted with it till it
                    becomes nauseous.</p>
                <p>Among the rich Greeks, adulterers were allowed to redeem themselves by a
                    pecuniary fine: the woman’s father, in such cases, returned the dower he had
                    received from her husband, which some think was refunded by the adulterer.
                    Another punishment among those people was putting out the eyes of
                    adulterers.</p>
                <p>The Athenians had an extraordinary way of punishing adulterers, called <hi

                    to pay the fines. This was an awkward sort of empalement, performed by thrusting
                    one of the largest radishes up the anus of the adulterer, or, in defect thereof,
                    a fish with a large head, called <hi rend="italic">mugil,</hi> mullet. Alcaeus
                    is said to have died, in this way, though it is doubted whether the punishment
                    was reputed mortal. Juvenal and Catullus speak of this custom as received also
                    among the Romans, though not authorized by an express law, as it was among the
                    Greeks.</p>
                <p>There are various conjectures concerning the ancient punishment of adultery among
                    the Romans. Some will have it to have been made capital by a law of Romulus, and
                    again by the twelve tables; others, that it was first made capital by Augustus;
                    and others, not before the emperor Constantine. The truth is, the punishment in
                    the early days was very various, much being left to the discretion of the
                    husband and parents of the adulterous wife, who exercised it differently, rather
                    with the silence and countenance of the magistrate than by any formal authority
                    from him. Thus, we are told the wife’s father was allowed to kill both parties,
                    when caught in the fact, provided he did it immediately, killed both together,
                    and as it were with one blow. The same power ordinarily was not indulged the
                    husband, except the crime were committed with some mean or infamous person;
                    though, in other cases, if his rage carried him to put them to death, he was not
                    punished as a murderer. On many occasions, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193031980?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-1980-0167"/> however,
                    revenge was not carried so far; but mutilating, castrating, cutting off the
                    ears, noses, &amp;c. served the turn. The punishment allotted by the <hi
                    rend="italic">lex Julia</hi> was not, as many have imagined, death, but rather
                    banishment or deportation, being interdicted fire and water; though Octavius
                    appears in several instances to have gone beyond his own law, and to have put
                    adulterers to death. Under Macrinus, many were burnt at a stake. Constantine
                    first by law made the crime capital. Under Constantius and Constans, adulterers
                    were burnt, or sewed in sacks and thrown into the sea. Under Leo and Marcian,
                    the penalty was abated to perpetual banishment, or cutting off the nose. Under
                    Justinian, a further mitigation was granted, at least in favour of the wife, who
                    was only to be scourged, lose her dower, and be shut up in a monastery. After
                    two years, the husband was at liberty to take her baek again; if he refused, she
                    was shaven, and made a nun for life; but it still remained death in the husband.
                    The reason alleged for this difference is, that the woman is the weaker vessel.
                    Matthaeus declaims against the empress Theodora, who is supposed to have been
                    the cause of this law, as well as of others procured in favour of that sex from
                    the emperor.</p>
                <p>Under Theodosius, women convicted of this crime were punished after a very
                    singular manner, viz. by a publie constuprati on; being locked up in a narrow
                    cell, and forced to admit to their embraces all the men that would offer
                    themselves. To this end the gallants were to dress themselves on purpose, having
                    several little bells fastened to their clothes, the tinkling of which gave
                    notice to those without of every motion. This custom was abolished by the same
                    prince.</p>
                <p>By the Jewish law, adultery was punished with death in both parties, where they
                    were both married, or only the woman. The Jews had a particular trial or ordeal
                    for a woman suspected of the crime, by making her drink the bitter waters of
                    jealousy; whieh, if she were guilty, made her swell.</p>
                <p>Amongst the Mingrelians, according to Chardin, adultery is punished with the
                    forfeiture of a hog, which is usually eaten in good friendship between the
                    gallant, the adulteress, and the cuckold. In some parts, of the Indies, it is
                    said any man’s wife is permitted to prostitute herself to him who will give an
                    elephant for the use of her; and it is reputed no small glory to her to have
                    been rated so high. Adultery is said to be so frequent in Ceylon, that there is
                    not a woman who does not practise it, notwithstanding its being punishable with
                    death. Among the Japanese, and divers other nations, adultery is only penal in
                    the woman. In the Marian islands, the woman is not punishable for adultery; but
                    if the man go astray he pays severely; the wife and her relations waste his
                    lands, turn him out of hi∙s house, &amp;e.</p>
                <p>In Spain they punished adultery in men by cutting off the instrument of the
                    crime. In Poland, before Christianity was established, they punished adultery
                    and fornication in a particular manner: the criminal they carried to die
                    market-place, and there fastened him by the offending part with a nail, laying a
                    razor within his reach, and leaving him under a necessity cither of doing
                    justice upon himself, or of perishing in that condition.</p>
                <p>In England adultery by the ancient laws was severely punished. King Edmund the
                    Saxon ordered it to be punished in the same manner as homicide; and Canute the
                    Dane ordered that a man who committed adultery should be banished, and that the
                    woman should have her nose and ears cut off. In the time of Henry I. it was
                    punished with the loss of eyes and genitals.</p>
                <p>In Britain adultery is now reckoned a spiritual offence, that is, cognizable by
                    the spiritual courts, where it is punished by fine and penance. The common law
                    takes no further notice of it than to allow the party aggrieved an action and
                    damages. This practice is often eensured by foreigners, as making too light of a
                    erime, the bad consequences of whieh, public as well as private, are so great.
                    It has been answered, that perhaps this penalty, by civil action, joined with
                    the ignominy attached to it, is more calculated to prevent the frequency of the
                    offence, which ought to be the end of all laws, than a severer punishment.</p>
                <p>Adultery is, both in England and Scotland, a ground of divorce; but in the former
                    a <hi rend="italic">complete</hi> divorce can only be obtained through an act of
                    parliament, whereas in the latter a complete divorce may be effected by the
                    sentence of the consistorial or commissary eourt. The adulterous parties are by
                    the law of Scotland prohibited from intermarrying with eaeh other. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Divorce.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Adultery</hi> is used in
                    Scripture for idolatry, or departing from the true God to the worship of a false
                    one.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adultery</hi> is used by ecelesiastieal writers for a
                    person’s invading or intruding into a bishopric during the former bishop’s life.
                    The reason of the appellation is, that a bishop is supposed to contract a kind
                    of spiritual marriage with his church. The translation of a bishop from one see
                    to another was also reputed a species of adultery, on the supposition of its
                    being a kind of second marriage, which in those days was esteemed a degree of
                    adultery. This conclusion was founded on the text of St Paul, <hi rend="italic"
                    >Let a bishop be the husband of one wife</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> by a
                    forced construction of church for wife, and of bishop for husband.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Adultery</hi> is used by ancient naturalists for the aet of
                    ingrafting one plant upon another; in which sense Pliny speaks of the adulteries
                    of trees, <hi rend="italic">arborum adulteria,</hi> which he represents as
                    contrary to nature, and a piece of luxury or needless refinement.</p>
