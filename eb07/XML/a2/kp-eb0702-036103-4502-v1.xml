                <p><label type="entry">AHAZ</label>, king of Judah, the son of Jotham, remarkable
                    for his vices and impieties. One of his sons he consecrated, by making him pass
                    through and perish by the fire, in honour of the false god Moloch; and he
                    offered sacrifices and incense upon the high places, upon hills, and in groves.
                    Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah, king of Israel, invaded Judah in the beginning
                    of the reign of Ahaz; and having defeated his army and pillaged the country,
                    they laid siege to Jerusalem. When they found that they could not make
                    themselves masters of that city, they divided their army, plundered the country,
                    and made the inhabitants prisoners of war. Rezin and his part of the confederate
                    army marched with all their spoil to Damascus; but Pekah, with his division of
                    the army, having attacked Ahaz, killed 120,000 men of his army in one battle,
                    and carried away men, women, and children, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193034515?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-4515-0362"/> without
                    distinction, to the number of 200,000. But as they were carrying those captives
                    to Samaria, the prophet Oded, with the principal inhabitants of the eity, came
                    out to meet them, and by their remonstrances prevailed with them to set their
                    prisoners at liberty. At the same time the Philistines and Edomites invaded
                    other parts of his land, killed multitudes of the people, and carried off much
                    booty. In this distressed condition, Λhaz, finding no other remedy for his
                    affairs, sent ambassadors to Tiglath-pileser, king of the Assyrians; and to
                    engage him to his interest, he stripped the temple and eity of all the gold
                    which he eould meet with, and sent it as a present. AEeordingly Tiglath-pileser
                    marched to the assistance of Ahaz, attacked Rezin, and killed him, took his
                    capital Damascus, destroyed it, and removed the inhabitants thereof to
                    Cyrene.</p>
                <p>The misfortunes of this prince had no influence to make him better; on the
                    contrary, in the times of his greatest affliction, he sacrificed to the Syrian
                    deities, whom he looked upon as the authors of his calamities, and endeavoured
                    to render propitious to him, by honouring them in this manner. He broke in
                    pieces the vessels of the house of God, shut up the gates of the temple, and
                    erected altars in all parts of Jerusalem. He set up altars likewise in all the
                    cities of Judah, with a design to offer incense on them. At length he died, and
                    was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the sepulchres of the kings of Judah his
                    predecessors; whieh honour he was deprived of on account of his iniquitous
                    course of life. Hezekiah his son succeeded him in the year of the world 3287,
                    before Jesus Christ 726.</p>
