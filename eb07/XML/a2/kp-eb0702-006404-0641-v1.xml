                    make it a distinct genus.</p>
                <p>The flowers of a species of the acacia are used by the Chinese in making that
                    yellow which we see bears washing in their silks and stuffs, and appears with so
                    much elegance in their painting on paper. The method is this: They gather the
                    flowers before they are fully open; these they put in a clean earthen vessel
                    over a gentle heat, and stir them continually about as they do the tea-leaves,
                    till they become dryish and of a yellow colour; then to half a pound of the
                    flowers, they add three spoonfuls of fair water, and after that a little more,
                    till there is just enough to hold the flowers incorporated together; they boil
                    this for some time, and the juice of the flowers mixing with the water, it
                    becomes thick and yellow; they then take it from the fire, and strain it through
                    a piece of coarse silk. To the liquor they add half an ounce of common alum, and
                    an ounce of calcined oyster-shells reduced to a fine powder. All is then well
                    mixed together; and this is the fine lasting yellow' they have so long used.</p>
                <p>The dyers of large pieces use the flowers and seeds of the acacia for dyeing
                    three different sorts of yellow. They roast the flowers, as before observed; and
                    then mix the seeds with them, which must be gathered for this purpose when fully
                    ripe: by different admixtures of these they give the different shades of colour,
                    only for the deepest of all they add a small quantity of Brazil wood.</p>
                <p>Mr Geoffroy attributes the origin of bezoar to the seeds of this plant; which
                    being browsed by certain animals, and vellicating the stomach by their great
                    sourness and astringency, cause a condensation of the juices, till at length
                    they become coated over with a stony matter, which we call <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The juice is brought to us from Egypt, in roundish masses wrapt up in thin
                    bladders. It is outwardly of a deep brown colour, inclining to black; inwardly
                    of a reddish or yellowish brown; of a firm consistence, but not very dry. It
                    soon softens in the mouth, and discovers a rough, not disagreeable taste, which
                    is followed by a sweetish relish. This inspissated juice entirely dissolves in
                    watery liquors, but is scarce sensibly acted on by rectified spirit.</p>
                <p>Acacia is a mild astringent medicine. The Egyptians give it in spitting of blood,
                    in the quantity of a drachm, dissolved in any convenient liquor; and repeat this
                    dose occasionally: they likewise employ it in collyria for strengthening the
                    eyes, and in gargarisms for quinsy. Among us, it is little otherwise used than
                    as an ingredient in mithridate and theriaca, and is rarely met with in the
                    shops. What is usually sold for the Egyptian acacia, is the inspissated juice of
                    unripe sloes; this is harder, heavier, of a darker colour, and somewhat sharper
                    taste, than the true sort. See the next article.</p>

                    the games; others, a roll of petitions or memorials; and some, a purple bag full
                    of earth, to remind them of their mortality.</p>
