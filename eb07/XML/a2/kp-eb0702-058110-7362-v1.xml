                    the year 1285. In him it appeared that mental excellence can rise superior to
                    riches or extent of territory; for although his dominions were by no <hi
                    rend="superscript"> -</hi> means extensive, nor his riches great, yet, in
                    consequence of his wisdom and success, he obtained the surname of <hi

                    greatly to increase his territory by means of marriage, purchase, and donations.
                    In this situation, with extended dominion, and distinguished for wisdom and
                    prudence, he rose to such eminence among the European powers, that he was
                    constituted their umpire to settle their differences; which office he performed
                    with much reputation to himself and advantage to them. In his character valour

                    Rlιodes from the knights of St John of Jerusalem, he acquired great renown by
                    the valour with which he defended it. A Maltese cross with the letters F. E. R.
                    T. in future became the arms of Amadeus and his successors, in memory of this
                    signal victory. The explanation of this motto is said to be,ŵŵŵ <hi

                    preserved Rhodes. For this important service the grand-master conferred on him
                    the grant of a palace at Lyons. Andronicus, the emperor of the East, had married
                    his daughter; and in order to promote the views of his son-in-law, Amadeus took
                    a journey to Avignon, to persuade Pope John XXII. to preach a crusade in favour
                    of Andronicus. He died there in the year 1323. Deep penetration, keen
                    discernment, consummate prudence, great valour, together with no small portion
                    of the religious superstition of his time, appear the most striking features in
                    his character.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> VIII; count of Savoy, succeeded his father
                    Amadeus VII. in 1391. With the large sum of 45,000 florins of gold he purchased
                    the country of Genevois from its last earl. Anxious to extend his territories,
                    he purchased the city of Rumilli, upon the lake of Geneva, from the widow of the
                    count of Genevois; and thus the house of Savoy became so powerful, that the
                    emperor Sigismund erected Savoy into a duchy in the year 1426. Historians relate
                    that he assisted John Paleologus against the duke of Milan, who endeavoured to
                    wrest from him the duchy of Montferrat. Deeply sensible of the services which he
                    had received, Paleologus not only resigned to the duke, Chivas, Brandis, and
                    several other estates, but submitted to hold all the marquisate of Montferrat as
                    a fief from the house of Savoy. Thèse fortunate acquisitions of territory were
                    not yet limited; for upon the marriage of his daughter with Philip Maria, duke
                    of Milan, he received Vercelli; and about the same time the count of Crescentino
                    submitted to become his feodary. In his ambitious pursuit he laid claim to the
                    sovereignty of the city of Geneva; but that claim, though enforced by the pope,
                    was rejected by the citizens with disdain; and the emperor Sigismund, taking it
                    under his protection, declared it an imperial city. After such an extensive
                    acquisition of dominion, and amassing such sums of money, he formed the singular
                    scheme of abandoning his throne and family; and for that purpose retired to a
                    religious house at a place called <hi rend="italic">Pipaille.</hi> But although
                    he resigned the dukedom of Savöy to his eldest son Lewis, and made his youngest
                    son Philip count of Genevois, yet their honours were merely nominal; for he
                    constrained them to live on a very scanty allowance, while he in his retirement
                    received all the revenues, and collected such sums of money, that he is said to
                    have purchased the papal honours. During the previous part of his life, having
                    assumed great sanctity of manners, the motives for his retirement were generally
                    reckoned religious; but what was the astonishment of mankind to behold the seat
                    of his hermitage become the scene of voluptuous pleasure and the most refined
                    luxury! The local situation of the place was truly delightful, and it was
                    enriched with every thing that could afford gratification to the senses; his
                    retinue consisted of some of his most intimate friends, along with twenty
                    faithful servants, who were the guardians of his voluptuous secrets. Instead of
                    a religious habit, he wore purple robes; and upon his mantle was embroidered a
                    golden cross. His table groaned under a weight of dainties, and the softest
                    music cheered his daily feast: in short, such was the luxury of the place, that
                    in the French language the phrase <hi rend="italic">faire ripaille</hi>
                    signifies to make exquisitely good cheer.</p>
                <p>He instituted a secular knighthood in that place, under the appellation of St
                    Maurice. The brethren assumed the name of hermits, wore beards, and excluded
                    women from their community; and in other respects exhibited the character of
                    decent epicures.</p>
                <p>When he obtained the papal dignity, and was crowned <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193037375?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-7375-0582"/> by the
                    cardinal of Arles at Basil, all Europe was filled with astonishment in
                    consequence of his elevation; for he had never entered into holy orders. But he
                    had found means to remove every objection, the council confirmed his election,
                    and with pretended reluctance he put on the pontifical ornaments, and was
                    consecrated in the church of St Maurice, under the title of Felix V. The papal
                    dignity was severely contested between him and Euge-nius; and, notwithstanding
                    all the importunities of the council, the emperor refused to acknowledge his
                    elevation. This religious dispute involved all Europe in contention. Historians
                    relate that Germany remained neutral, while France, England, Italy, Spain, and
                    Hungary, declared for Eugenius; but Arragon, Poland, and Bretagne, recognised
                    the council only; at the same time that Savoy, Switzerland, Basil, Strasburg,
                    Pomerania, and one of the duchies of Bavaria, recognised Felix. The emperor
                    Frederick III. held a council at Frankfort, before which both the popes urged
                    their respective rights by means of deputies. This attempt; however, to
                    establish peace in Europe proving unsuccessful, the emperor repaired to the
                    vicinity of Basil, and had a personal interview with Felix. Amadeus, that he
                    might the more freely indulge his sensual appetite, again repaired to his
                    favourite retreat; and after the fathers of the council had frequently solicited
                    him in vain to reside at Basil, he prevailed upon them to remove to Lyons, which
                    was near the seat of his pleasures. During the contest Eugenius had
                    excommunicated Felix, the council, and several of the German princes, so that
                    the whole church was then filled with confusion and disorder. The struggle,
                    however, was terminated by the death of Eugenius, when the cardinals at Rome
                    elected Thomas de Sarzan, who assumed the name of Nicholas V. In this state of
                    affairs Amadeus deemed it prudent to enter into a negotiation for the
                    resignation of his papal crown; and such was the policy and address displayed by
                    him in this transaction, that Nicholas was induced to annul all that Eugenius
                    had done to his dishonour, or that of his associates; to confirm the
                    determination of the council of Basil to appoint him perpetual apostolical
                    legate in Savoy, Piedmont, and the other places of his own dominions; and even
                    added to these the honour of being bishop of Basil, Lausanne, Strasburg, and
                    Constance. Nor did his vanity forsake him even in this political transaction,
                    for he provided that he should continue to wear the pontifical dress, unless in
                    a very few particulars. In order to gratify the same haughty disposition, he
                    stipülated that he should not be obliged to go to Rome to attend any general
                    council; and that when he had occasion to approach the pope, he should rise to
                    receive him, and instead of kissing his toe, he should be permitted to kiss his
                    cheek. Amadeus retired to Lausanne, and died there at the age of 60, in the year
                    1451.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeüs</hi> IX. count of Savoy, succeeded his father Lewis,
                    in his dominion and honours. His bodily constitution was weak, and he was
                    afflicted with the fallingsickness; yet, on account of his piety, virtue,
                    benevolence, and justice, he was surnamed the <hi rend="italic">Happy.</hi> The
                    clemency of his temper was such that he readily pardoned those who offended him,
                    and in few instances was he induced to punish. In his character the virtue of
                    benevolence shone with peculiar splendour among the other virtues of the
                    Christian. In 1472, in the seventh year of his reign, and the thirty-seventh of
                    his life, he died universally lamented by all his loyal subjects.</p>
