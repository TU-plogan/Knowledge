                    stuffs for the short drawers Worn both by Malays and Achenese, is established
                    here, and meets with an extensive sale. They weave also very handsome silk
                    pieces, of a particular form, for that part of the dress which is called by the
                    Malays <hi rend="italic">cayeη serrong.</hi> But this manufacture has of late
                    declined, owing probably to the decay of industry among the inhabitants, and
                    also to the failure in the breed of silk-worms. Gold dust is collected in the
                    mountains near Acheen, but the greater part is brought from the southern ports
                    of Nalaboo and Soosoo. Sulphur is gathered from a volcanic mountain in the
                    neighbourhood, which supplies their own consumption for the manufacture of
                    gunpowder, and admits of a large exportation. Having no convenient coins, though
                    most species of money will be taken here at a valuation, traders commonly make
                    their payments in gold dust, and for that purpose are all provided with scales
                    or small steelyards. They carry their gold about them, wrapped up in pieces of
                    bladder, and often purchase to so small an amount as to make use of grain or
                    seeds for weights. They have besides a thin adulterated gold coin, rudely
                    stamped with Arabic characters, called <hi rend="italic">maas.</hi></p>
                <p>In their persons the Achenese differ from the rest of the Sumatrans, being
                    taller, stouter, and of a darker complexion. They do not appear to be a distinct
                    people, but are thought, with great appearance of reason, to be a mixture of
                    Battas, Malays, and Moors, from the west of India. In their dispositions they
                    are more active and industrious than their neighbours; they possess more
                    penetration and sagacity; havő more general knowledge; and, as merchants, they
                    deal upon a more extensive and liberal footing. Their religion is Mahometanism;
                    and having a great number of mosquqs and priests, its forms and ceremonies are
                    strictly observed. They .speak a mixed language of Malay and.Batta, with all the
                    other jargons used by the eastern Maho ’ medans. In writing, they use the Malay
                    character.</p>
                <p>The monarchy is hereditary, and the king usually maintains a guard gf 100- sepoys
                    about his palace. When Acheen was,a flourishing state, he ruled with despotic
                    authority. There was, however, according to Mr Marsden, a grand council of the
                    nation, which consisted of the sultan at its head; of four chief counsellors,
                    and eight of a lower degree, who sat <hi rend="smallcaps">qπ'</hi> the king’s
                    right hand; and of 16 others who sat on <hi rend="subscript"> φ</hi> his left.
                    How far this council shares or controls the royal prerogative, does not seem to
                    be ascertained. ", At the king⅛ feet,” says Mr Marsden. “şjts ą woman, to whom
                    he makes ķņqwn his pleasurej by.hęr jfis com-' munĩcated to an eunuch, who sits
                    next to her; and by him to an officer, who then proclaims it aloud to the
                    assembly. There are also present two other officers, one of whom has the
                    government of the <hi rend="italic">bazar</hi> or market, and the other the
                    superintending and carrying into execution the punishment of criminals. All
                    matters relative to commerce and the customs of the port come under the
                    jurisdiction of another functionary, who performs the ceremony of giving the <hi
                    rend="italic">clιap</hi> or licence for trade; which is done by lifting a
                    golden-hafted <hi rend="italic">kris</hi> over the head of the merchant who
                    arrives, and without which he dares not to land his goods. Presents, the value
                    of which is become pretty regularly ascertained, are then sent to the king and
                    his officers. If the stranger be in the style of an ambassador, the royal
                    elephants are sent: down to carry him and his letters to the monarch’s presence;
                    these being first delivered into the hands of an eunuch, who places them in ą.

                    is provided with a machine for that purpose. Within about an hundred yards of an
                    open hall where the king sits, the cavalcade stops, and the ambassador
                    dismounts, and makes his obeisance by bending his body and lifting his joined
                    hanđş to his head. When he enters the palace, if an European, he is obliged to
                    take off his shoes; and having made a second obeisance, is seated upon a carpet
                    on the floor, where <hi rend="italic">betel</hi> is brought to him.” The crown
                    revenues, which fluctuate considerably, are derived from import and export
                    duties levied on all goods. Monopolies, the approved resource of despotism, also
                    afford a revenue. These are managed by the officer who has the superintendence
                    of commerce, and who frequently uses his power as an instrument of
                    extortion.</p>
                <p>Acheen, like all states in the same stage of civilisation, is distinguished by
                    the severity of its punishments; and no commutation is admitted, as in the
                    southern countries. But it is on the poor chiefly that the rod of justice falls
                    with its full weight, the nobles being secure from its retribution by the number
                    of their dependents. Petty theft is punished by suspending the criminal from'a
                    tree, with a guh or heavy weight tied to his fleet; or by cutting off a finger,
                    a hand, or leg, according to the nature of the theft. Many of these mutilated
                    and wretched objects are daily to be seen in the streets. Robbery on the highway
                    and housebreaking are punished by drowning, and afterwards exposing the body on
                    a stake for a few days. If the robbery is committed upon an imaum or priest, the
                    sacrilege is expiated by burning the criminal alive. A man who is convicted of
                    adultery is delivered up to the friends and relations of the injured husband.
                    These discouragements to vice might seem to bespeak a moral and virtuous people;
                    yet all travellers agree in representing the Achenese as one of the most
                    dishonest and flagitious nations of the East.</p>
                <p>Achecn was first visited by Portuguese adventurers in 1509, after they had
                    discovered the passage to the East Indies by the Cape of Good Hope. Hostilities
                    immediately commenced with the inhabitants, and continued with various success,
                    until the Portuguese lost Malacca in 1641. About the year 1586 the monarchy of
                    Acheen attained to its greatest height of power and prosperity. It had a
                    flourishing commerce; and the port of Acheen was crowded with vessels from all
                    the Asiatic countries, which were allowed to carry on their trade with the most
                    perfect security. About the year 1600, when the Hutch navigators had penetrated
                    to these, seas, some of thęíŗ. vessels which had entered the port of A’cĥeen
                    were nearly cut off by the treachery of the, inhabitants. It was jn 1602 that
                    Acłieen was first visited by tļię English şhipe·</p>

                <p>under Captain Lancaster, wliere they were well received. In 1607, the reigning
                    sultan, having greatly extended his dominions on every side, assumed the title
                    of sovereign. He had some correspondence with King James; and in answering one
                    of his letters, he takes the title of King of Sumatra, and intimates to the king
                    of England his wish that he would send out to him one of· his countrywomen for a
                    wife. The French visited Acheen in 1621 under Commodore Beaulieu. The Dutch were
                    now become the powerful rivals of the Portuguese in the eastern seas. They
                    succeeded in 1640, by the aid of their allies the Achenese, in wresting from
                    them Malacca, which they had so long maintained. They afterwards commenced their
                    encroachments on the Achenese, and reduced the extent of their ancient dominion,
                    which, joined to the weakness of the government, occasioned the decline of the
                    Achenese power. In 1641, the sultan Peducka Siri, who, though of a cruel
                    disposition, was a powerful sovereign, died; and the Achenese monarchy continued
                    in the female line till 1700, when a priest found means to acquire the supreme
                    power. The country was agitated during the whole of the eighteenth century by
                    anarchy, and the most sanguinary revolutions. In 1813, the state of Acheen,
                    formerly so flourishing, was found with hardly any form of civil order existing,
                    every port and village being occupied by petty usurpers, who subsisted by piracy
                    and smuggling. At length the reigning monarch was compelled to abdicate the
                    throne in favour of a shop-keeper’s son in Prince of Wales Island; but he was
                    restored in 1819 to his dignity. In the following year, Mr Sartorius, being
                    deputed to Acheen, found the country in a most miserable state; the king’s
                    authority a mere nullity; and though a commercial treaty had been concluded,
                    there appeared in the distracted state of the country not the least chance of
                    its provisions being carried into effect, without some direct and active
                    interference to uphold the authority of the government.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Acheen,</hi> the capital of the above state, is situated on
                    a river at the north-western extremity of Sumatra, and about a league from the
                    sea, where a road is formed, in which the shipping may be secure under the
                    shelter of several islands. The town is indifferently built of bamboos and rough
                    timber, and raised some feet from the ground on account of the overflow of the
                    river in the rainy season. Its appearance and the nature of the buildings
                    resemble the generality of the Malay bazars, excepting that the superior wealth
                    of this place has occasioned a great number of public edifices, which do not
                    however possess the smallest pretensions to magnificence. The sultan’s palace,
                    which is the chief public building, (s a very rude and uncouth piece of
                    architecture, designed to resist the force of an enemy, and surrounded with a
                    moat and strong walls, but without any regular plan, or any view to the modern
                    system of military attack. Several pieces of ordnance are planted near the gate,
                    some of which are Portuguese; but two were sent, from England by James I., on
                    which the founder’s name and the date are still legible. The river on which the
                    town is situated is not large; and the stream being divided into several
                    channels, is rendered shallow at the bar. In the dry monsoon it will not admit
                    boats of any, burden, much less large vessels, which lie without in the road
                    formed by the islands off the point. The commerce has fallen off. Tlié chief
                    exports are, brimstone, betel-nut, ràtâns, benżoifi, camphor, gold dust, pepper,
                    and horses'; the import's,'opium, salt, piece-goods, muslin, ∣S-'C. The tóŵri
