                <p><label type="entry">ALLEGIANCE</label>, in <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> is the
                    tie, or <hi rend="italic">ligamen,</hi> which binds the subject to the king, in
                    return for that protection which the king affords the subject. The thing itself,
                    or substantial part of it, is founded in reason and the nature of government:
                    the name and the form are derived to us from our Gothic ancestors. Under the
                    feudal system, every owner of lands held them in subjection to some superior or
                    lord, from whom or from whose ancestors the tenant or vassal had received them;
                    and there was a mutual trust or confidence subsisting between the lord and
                    vassal, that the lord should protect the vassal in the enjoyment of the
                    territory he had granted him; and, on the other hand, that the vassal should be
                    faithful to the lord, and defend him against all his enemies. This obligation on
                    the part of the vassal was called his <hi rend="italic">fidelitas</hi> or
                    fealty: and an oath of fealty was required by the feudal law to be taken by all
                    tenants to their landlord, which is couched in almost the same terms as our
                    ancient oath of allegiance; except that in the usual oath of fealty there was
                    frequently a saving or exception of the faith due to a superior lord by name,
                    under whom the landlord himself was perhaps only a tenant or vassal. But when
                    the acknowledgement was made to the absolute superior himself, who was vassal to
                    no man, it was no longer called the oath of fealty, but the oath of allegiance;
                    and therein the tenant swore to bear faith to his sovereign lord, in opposition
                    to all men, without any saving or exception. Land held by this exalted species
                    of fealty was called <hi rend="italic">feudurn legium,</hi> a liege fee; the
                    vassals, <hi rend="italic">lιomines legii,</hi> or liegc men; and the <pb

                    sovereign, their <hi rend="italic">dominus</hi><hi rend="italic">legius,</hi> or
                    liege lord. And when sovereign princes did homage to each other for lands held
                    under their respective sovereignties, a distinction was always made between <hi
                    rend="italic">simple</hi> homage, which was only an acknowledgement of tenure,
                    and <hi rend="italic">liege</hi> homage, which included the fealty before
                    mentioned, and the services consequent upon it. In Britain, it becoming a
                    settled principle of tenure that all lands in the kingdom are holden of the king
                    as their sovereign and lord paramount, no oath but that of fealty could ever be
                    taken to inferior lords; and the oath of allegiance was necessarily confined to
                    the person of the king alone. By an easy analogy, the term of <hi rend="italic"
                    >allegiance</hi> was soon brought to signify all other engagements which are due
                    from subjects to their prince, as well as those duties which were simply and
                    merely territorial. And the oath of allegiance, as administered in England for
                    upwards of 600 years, contained a promise <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi> to be
                    true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and faith to bear of life
                    and limb and terrene honour, and not to know or hear of any ill or damage
                    intended him, without defending him therefrom.” But, at the Revolution, the
                    terms of this oath being thought perhaps to savour too much of the notion of
                    non-resistance, the present form was introduced by the convention parliament;
                    which is more general and indcterminate than the former, the subject only
                    promising “that he will be faithful and bear <hi rend="italic">true</hi>
                    allegiance to the king,” without mentioning “his heirs,” or specifying in the
                    least wherein that allegiance consists. The oath of supremacy is principally
                    calculated as a renunciation of the pope’s pretended authority; and the oath of
                    abjuration, introduced in the reign of King William, very amply supplies the
                    loose and general texture of the oath of allegiance; it recognising the right of
                    his majesty, derived under the act of settlement engaging to support him to the
                    utmost of the juror’s power, promising to disclose all traitorous conspiracies
                    against him, and expressly renouncing any claim on the descendants of the late
                    Pretender, in as clear and explicit terms as the English language can furnish.
                    This oath must be taken by all persons in any office, trust, or employment, and
                    may be tendered by two justices of the peace to any person whom they shall
                    suspect of disaffection; and the oath of allegiance may be tendered to all
                    persons above the age of twelve years, whether natives, denizens, or aliens.</p>
                <p>But, besides these express engagements, the law also holds that there is an <hi
                    rend="italic">implied, original,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">virtual</hi>
                    allegiance, owing from every subject to his sovereign, antecedently to any
                    express promise, and although the subject never swore any faith or allegiance in
                    form. Thus, Sir Edward Coke very justly observes that “all subjects are equally
                    bounden to their allegiance as if they had taken the oath, because it is written
                    by the finger of the law in their hearts, and the taking of the corporal oath is
                    but an outward declaration of the same.”</p>
                <p>Allegiance, both express and implied, is, however, distinguished by the law into
                    two sorts or species, the one <hi rend="italic">natural,</hi> the other <hi
                    rend="italic">local;</hi> the former being also perpetual, the latter
                    temporary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Natural</hi> allegiance is such as is due from all men born
                    within the king s dominions immediately upon their birth; fòr immediately upon
                    their birth they are under the king’s protection, at a time, too, when (during
                    their infancy) they arc incapable of protecting themselves. Natural allegiance
                    is, therefore, a debt of gratitude, which cannot be forfeited, cancelled, or
                    altered, by any change of time, place, or circumstance, nor by any thing but the
                    united concurrence of the legislature. A Briton who removes <hi rend="italic"
                    >to</hi> France or to China, owes the same allegiance to the king of Britain
                    there as at home, and 20 years hence as well as now; for it is a principle of
                    universal law, that the natural-born subject of one prince cannot by any act of
                    his own, no, not by swearing allegiance to another, put off or discharge his
                    natural allegiance to the former; for this natural allegiance was intrinsic and
                    primitive, and antecedent to the other, and cannot be divested without the
                    concurrent act of that prince to whom it was first due.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Local</hi> allegiance is such as is due from an alien, or
                    stranger born, for so long å time as he continues within the king’s dominion and
                    protection; and.it ceases the instant such stranger transfers himself from this
                    kingdom to another. Natural allegiance is, therefore, <hi rend="italic"
                    >perpetual,</hi> and local <hi rend="italic">temporary</hi> only; and that for
                    this reason, evidently founded upon the nature of government, that allegiance is
                    a debt due from the subject, upon an implied contract with the prince; that so
                    long as the one affords protection, so long the other will demean himself
                    faithfully.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">oath</hi> of allegiance, or rather the <hi rend="italic"
                    >allegiance</hi> itself, is held to be applicable, not only to the political
                    capacity of the king, or regal office, but to his natural person and blood
                    royal. And, for the misapplication of their allegiance, viz. to the regal
                    capacity or crown, exclusive of the person of the king, were the Spencers
                    banished in the reign of Edward II. And hence arose that principle of personal
                    attachment and affectionate loyalty which induced our forefathers (and, if
                    occasion required, would doubtless induce their sons) to hazard all that was
                    dear to them, life, fortune, and family, in defence and support of their liege
                    lord and sovereign.</p>
                <p>It is to be observed, however, in explanation of this allegiance, that it does
                    not preclude resistance to the king, when his misconduct or weakness is such as
                    to make resistance beneficial to the community. It seems fairly presumable, that
                    the convention parliament, which introduced the oath of allegiance in its
                    present form, did not intend to exclude all resistance; since the very authority
                    by which the members sat together was itself the effect of a successful
                    opposition to an acknowledged sovereign.</p>
                <p>Again, the allegiance above described can only be understood to signify obedience
                    to lawful commands. If, therefore, the king should issue a proclamation, levying
                    money or imposing any service or restraint upon the subject beyond what the law
                    authorized, there would exist no sort of obligation to obey such a proclamation
                    in consequence of having taken the oath of allegiance.</p>
                <p>Neither can allegiance be supposed to extend to the king after he is actually and
                    absolutely deposed, driven into exile, or otherwise rendered incapable, of
                    exercising the regal office. The promise of allegiance implies, that the person
                    to whom the promise is made continues king; that is, continues to exercise the
                    power and afford the protection which belong to the office of king; for it is
                    the possession of these which makes such a particular person the object of the
                    oath. See Blackstone’s <hi rend="italic">Commentaries,^</hi> Paley’s <hi
