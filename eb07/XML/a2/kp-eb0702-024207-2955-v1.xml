                <p><label type="entry">AGE</label>, in the most general sense of the word, signifies
                    the duration of any being, from its first coming into existence to the time of
                    speaking of it,.,if <hi rend="subscript"> i</hi> it still continues; or to its
                    destruction, if it has ceased to exist some time before we happen to mention
                    it.</p>
                <p>Among the ancient poets this word was used for the space of 30 years; in which
                    sense <hi rend="italic">age</hi> amounts to much the same with <hi rend="italic"
                    >generation.</hi> Thus, Nestor is said to have lived <hi rend="italic">three
                    ages</hi> when he was 90 years old. By ancient Greek historians, the time
                    elapsed since the beginning of the world is divided into three periods, which
                    they call <hi rend="italic">ages.</hi> The first reaches from the creation to
                    the deluge which happened in Greece during the reign of Ogyges: this they call
                    the <hi rend="italic">obscure</hi> or <hi rend="italic">uncertain</hi> age,
                    because the history of mankind is altogether uncertain during that period. The
                    second they call the <hi rend="italic">fabulous</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >heroic</hi> age, because it is the period in which the· fabulous exploits of
                    their gods and heroes are said to have been performed. It began with the Ogygian
                    deluge, and continued to the first Olympiad, when the third or <hi rend="italic"
                    >historical</hi> age commenced. This division, however, it must be observed,
                    holds good only with regard to the Greeks and Romans, who had no histories
                    earlier than the first Olympiad. The Jews, Egyptians, Phoenicians, and Chaldees,
                    not to mention the Indians and Chinese, who pretend to much higher antiquity,

                <p>The interval since the first formation of man has been divided by the poets into
                    four <hi rend="italic">ages,</hi> distinguished by the epithets of <hi
                    rend="italic">golden, silver, brazen,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">iron.</hi>
                    During the <hi rend="italic">golden</hi> age, Saturn reigned in heaven, and
                    justice and innocence in this lower world. The earth then yielded her
                    productions without culture men .held all things in common, and lived in perfect
                    friendship. This period is supposed to have lasted till the, expulsion of Saturn
                    from his kingdom. The <hi rend="italic">silver</hi> age commenced when men began
                    to deviate from the paths of virtue, and, in consequence of this deviation,
                    their lives became less happy. The <hi rend="italic">brazen</hi> age commenced
                    on a further deviation; and the <hi rend="italic">iron age</hi> took place in
                    consequence of one still greater. A late author, however, reflecting on;the
                    barbarism of the first ages, will have the order which the poets assign to the
                    four ages inverted; the first being a time of rudeness and ignorance, more
                    properly denominated an <hi rend="italic">iron</hi> than a <hi rend="italic"
                    >golden</hi> age. When cities and states were founded, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >silver</hi> age commenced; and since arts and sciences, navigation and
                    commerce, have been cultivated, the <hi rend="italic">golden</hi> age has taken
                    place. ∙.∙ <hi rend="subscript">;</hi> √h <hi rend="italic">j</hi><hi

                    facs="nls:193032968?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0702-2968-0243"/> In some
                    ancient northern monuments, the <hi rend="italic">rocky or stony</hi> age
                    corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">brazen</hi> age of the Greeks. It is called
                    <hi rend="italic">rocky,</hi> on account of Noah’s ark, which rested on Mount
                    Ararat; whence men were said to be descended or sprung from mountains; or from
                    Deucalion and Pyrrha restoring the race of mankind, by throwing stones over
                    their heads. The northern poets also style the fourth age of the world the <hi
                    rend="italic">ashen</hi> age,' from a Gothic king, Madenis or Mannus, who, on
                    account of his great strength, was said to be made of ash, or because in his
                    time people began to make use of weapons made of that wood.</p>
                <p>Among the Jews, the duration of the world is also divided into three ages: 1. The
                    <hi rend="italic">seculum inane,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">void age,</hi> was
                    the space of time from the creation to Moses; 2. The <hi rend="italic">present
                    age</hi> denotes all the space of time from Moses to the coming of the Messiah;
                    and 3. The <hi rend="italic">age to come</hi> denotes the time from the coming
                    of the Messiah to the end of the world.</p>
                <p>Various other divisions of the duration of the world into <hi rend="italic"
                    >ages</hi> hav'e been made by historians. The Sibylline oracles, written,
                    according to some, by Jews acquainted with the prophecies of the Old Testament,
                    divide the duration of the world into ten <hi rend="italic">ages</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">;</hi> and according to Josephus, each age contained six hundred
                    years. It appears, by Virgil’s fourth eclogue, and other testimonies, that the
                    age of Augustus was reputed the end of those ten <hi rend="italic">ages,</hi>
                    consequently as the period of the world’s duration.</p>
                <p>By some, the space of time commencing from Constantine, and ending with the
                    taking of Constantinople by the Turks in the fifteenth century, is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">middle age</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but others choose
                    rather to date the middle age from the division of the*empire "made by
                    Theodosius at the close of the fourth century, and extend it to the time of the
                    emperor Maximilian I. in the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the empire
                    was first divided into circles. The <hi rend="italic">middle</hi> is by some
                    denoted the <hi rend="italic">barbarous</hi> age, and the latter part of it the
                    <hi rend="italic">lowest</hi> age. Some divide it into the <hi rend="italic"
                    >nonacademical</hi> and <hi rend="italic">academical</hi> ages. The first
                    includes the space of timé'from the sixth to the ninth century, during which
                    schools or academies were lost in Europe; the second, from the ninth century,
                    when schools were restored, and universities established, chiefly by the care of
                    Charlemagne.</p>
                <p>The several <hi rend="italic">ages</hi> of the world may be reduced to three
                    grand epochs,- viz. the <hi rend="italic">age</hi> of the law of nature, called
                    by the Jews the <hi rend="italic">void age,</hi> from Adam to Moses; the <hi
                    rend="italic">age</hi> of the Jewish law, from Moses to Christ; and the <hi
                    rend="italic">age</hi> of grace, from Christ to the present time.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Age</hi> is aW frequently used in the same sense with <hi
                    rend="italic">century,</hi> to denorhinate a duration of 100 years.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Aoe</hi> likewise signifies a certain period of the duration
                    of human life; by some divided into four stages, namely, infancy, youth,
                    manhood, and old age; the first extending to the 15th year, the second to the
                    25th, the third to the 50th, and the fourth to the end of life; by others
                    divided into infancy, ’ diildhood, youth, manhood, and old age.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Age,</hi> in <hi rend="smallcaps">Zλzw,</hi> Signifies a
                    certain period of life when persons of both* sëxes are enabled to do certain
                    acts. Thus, one at twelve years of age ought to take the oaths of allegiance to
                    the king in a leet; at fourteen he may marry, choose his guardian, and claim his
                    lands held in soccage. Twenty-one is called <hi rend="italic">full age,</hi> a
                    man or woman being then capable of dcting for themselves, of managing their
                    affairs, making contracts, disposing of their estates, and the like.</p>
