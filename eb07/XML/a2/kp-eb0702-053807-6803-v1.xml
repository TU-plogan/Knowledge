                    Seljuk, in Persia, and great-grandson of Seljuk, the founder of the dynasty. He
                    was born in the year 1030, of the Hegira 421. In place of Israel, which was his
                    original name, he assumed that of Mohammed when he embraced the Mussulman faith;
                    and, on account of his military prowess, he obtained the surname <hi
                    rend="italic">Alp Arslan,</hi> which, in the Turkish language, signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">a valiant lion.</hi> Having held the chief command in Choràsan for
                    ten years as lieutenant of his uncle Togrul Beg, he succeeded him in the year
                    1063, and, at the commencement of his reign, saw himself sole monarch of Persia,
                    from the river Amu to the Tigris. When he assumed the reins of government,
                    faction and open rebellion prevailed in his dominions, in subduing which he was
                    ably assisted by Nadham al Molk, his vizier, one of the most distinguished
                    characters of his time, whose prudence and integrity in the administration of
                    the affairs of the' kingdom proved of most essential service to this prince and
                    to his successor. Peace and security being established in his dominions, he
                    convoked an assembly of the states; and having declared.his son Malek Shah his
                    heir and successor, he seated him ‘on a throne of gold, and exacted an oath of
                    fidelity to him from the principal officers of the empire. With the hope of
                    acquiring immense booty in the rich temple of St Basil in Caesarea, the capital
                    of Cappadocia, he placed himself at the head of the Turkish cavalry, crossed the
                    Euphrates, and entered and plundered that cîty. He then marched into Armenia and
                    Georgia, which, in the year 106Ô, he finally conquered. In the former country
                    the very name of a kingdom and the spirit of a nation were totally extinguished;
                    but the native Georgians, who had retired to the woods and valleys of Mount
                    Caucasus, made a more vigorous resistance. They too, however, overpowered by the
                    arms of the sultan and his son Malek, were forced to submission, and reduced to
                    slavery. To punish them for the brave defence which they had made, and as a
                    badge of their humiliating condition, Alp Arslan obliged them to wear at their
                    ears horse-shoes of iron. Some, to escape this mark of cruelty and ignominy,
                    professed to embrace the religion of Mahomet.</p>
                <p>In the year 1068 Alp Arslan invaded the Roman empire, the seat of which was then
                    at Constantinople. Eu-docia, the reigning empress, saw and dreaded the progress
                    of his arms. To aVert the threatened danger, she married Romanus Diogenes, a
                    brave soldier, who was accordingly associated with her in the government, and
                    raised to the imperial dignity. The new emperor, during the exhausted state of
                    their resour¢eš, sustained the Roman power with surprising valour and invincible
                    courage. His spirit and success animated his soldiers in the field to act with
                    fortitude and firmnešs, inspired his subjects with hope, and struck terror into
                    his enemies. In three severe Campaigns his arms were victorious; and the Turks
                    were forced to retreat beyond the Euphrates., In the fourth he advanced with än
                    army of 100,000.men into the Armenian territory, for the relief of that country.
                    Here he was met by Alp Arslan, with 40,000 cavalry, or, according to some
                    authors, a much smaller number; and the sultan having proposed terms of peace,
                    which were insultingly rejected bý the emperor, a bloody and decisive engagement
                    took place. Alp Arslan, it is said, when he saw that a battle was inevitable,
                    wept at the thought that so many of Įiis faithful followers must fall in the
                    struggle; and after offering up a devout prayer, granted free permission to all
                    who chose it to retiré from the field. Then with his own hand he tied up his
                    horse’s tail, exchanged his bow and arrows for a mace and scimitar, and robing
                    himself in a white garment perfumed with tausk, resolved to perish on the spot
                    unless he came off victorious. The skilful movements of the Turkish cavalry sooh
                    made an impression on the. superior numbers of the Greeks, who were thrown into
                    great disorder, and, after a terrible slaughter, were totally routed. .Romanus,
                    desėrted by the main body of his army, with unshaken courage, kept his station,
                    till he was recognised by a slave, taken prisoner, and conducted into the
                    presence of Alp Arslan/ ,In the Turkish divan the captive emperor was commanded
                    to kiss the ground, as a degrading mark of submission to the power and authority
                    of the sultan, who, it is said, leapt from his throne and set his foot on his
                    neck. But this is scarcely probable, or consistent with the
                    generous'and-respectful treatment which he otherwise <hi rend="superscript">
                    ι</hi> experienced; for the sultan instantly raised him from the ground,
                    embraced him tenderly, an assured him that his life and dignity should remain

                    xml:id="kp-eb0702-6816-0539"/> under the protection of a prince who had not
                    forgotten the respect due to the majesty of his equals and the vicissitudes of
                    fortune. When the terms of his ransom were about to be settled, Romanus was
                    asked .by.Alp Arslan what treatment he expected to receive. To this question the
                    emperor, with seeming indifference, replied, “If you are cruel, you will take my
                    life; if you follow the dictates of pride, you will drag me at your chariot
                    wheels; if you consult your interest, you will accept a ransom, and restore me
                    to my country.” “But what,” says the sultan, “would you have done in such
                    circumstances ?” « Had I⅛een victorious,” said the insolent Romanus, “I would
                    have inflicted on thy body many a stripe.” The conqueror smiled at the fierce
                    and unsubdued spirit of his captive; observed that the Christian precepts
                    strongly inculcated the love of enemies and the forgiveness of injuries; and,
                    with a noble greatness of mind, declared that he would never imitate an example
                    which he disapproved. A ransom of a million, an annual tribute of 3000 pieces of
                    gold, an intermarriage between the families, and the deliverance of all the
                    captive Mussulmans in the power of the Greeks, were at last agreed to as the
                    terms of peace and the liberty of the emperor. Romanus was now dismissed loaded
                    with presents, and respectfully attended by a military guard. But the distracted
                    state of his dominions, the consequence of a revolt of his subjects, precluded
                    him from fulfilling the terms of the treaty, and remitting the stipulated price
                    of his ransom. The sultan seemed disposed to favour and support the declining
                    fortunes òf his ally; but the defeat, imprisonment, and death of Romanus
                    interrupted the accomplishment of his generous, or rather ambitious, design.</p>
                <p>At this time the dominion of Alp Arslan extended over the fairest part of Asia;
                    1200 princes, or sons of princes, surrounded his throne; and 200,000 soldiers
                    were ready to execute his commands. He now meditated a greater enterprise, and
                    declared his purpose of attempting the conquest of Turkestan, the original seat
                    of his ancestors. After great preparations for the expedition, he marched with a
                    powerful army, and arrived at the banks of the 0xus. Before he could pass the
                    river with safety, it was necessary to gain possession of some fortresses in its
                    vicinity, one of which was for several days vigorously defended by the governor,
                    Joseph Cothual, a Carizmian. He was, however, obliged to surrender, and was
                    carried a prisoner before the sultan, who, being enraged at his obstinacy and
                    presumption, addressed him in verÿ reproachful terms. Joseph replied with so
                    much spirit, that he roused the resentment of Alp Arslan, and was commanded
                    instantly to be fastened by the hands and feet to four stakes, to suffer a
                    painful and Cruel death. Joseph, on hearing this sentence, became furious and
                    desperate; and drawing a dagger which he had concealed in his boots, rushed
                    towards the throne to stab the sultan. The guards raised their battle-axes, and
                    moved forward to defend their sovereign; but Alp Arslan, the most expert archer
                    of his age, checking their zeal, forbade them to advance, and drew his bow: his
                    foot slipped, and the arrow missed Joseph, who rushed forward, and plunging his
                    dagger in the breast of the sultan, was himself instantly cut in pieces. The
                    wound proved mortal, and the sultan expired a few hours after he received it, in
                    the year 1072.</p>
