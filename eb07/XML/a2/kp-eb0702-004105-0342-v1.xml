                <p><label type="entry">ABRAHAM</label>, the father and stock whence the faithful
                    sprung, was the son of Terah. He was descended from Noah by Shem, from whom he
                    was nine degrees removed. Some fix his birth in the 130th year of Terah’s age,
                    but others place it in his father’s 70th year. It is highly probable he was born
                    in the city of Ur, in Chaldea, which he and his father left when they went to
                    Canaan, where they remained till the death of Terah; after which, Abraham
                    resumed his first design of going to Palestine. The Scriptures mention the
                    several places he stopped at in Canaan; his journey into Egypt, where his wife
                    was carried off from him; his going into Gerar, where Sarah was again taken from
                    him, but restored as before; the victory he obtained over the four kings who had
                    plundered Sodom; his compliance with his wife, who insisted that he should make
                    use of their maid Hagar in order to raise up children; the covenant God made
                    with him, sealed with the ceremony of circumcision; his obedience to the command
                    of God, who ordered him to offer up his only son as a sacrifice, and how this
                    bloody act was prevented; his marriage with Keturah; his death at the age of 175
                    years; and his interment in the cave of Machpelah, near the body of Sarah his
                    first wife.</p>
                <p>Abraham is said to have been well skilled in many sciences, and to have written
                    several books. Josephus<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"
                    ><p>Αntiq. lib. i. cap. 7, 8.</p></note> tells us that he taught the Egyptians
                    arithmetic and geometry; and according to Eupolemus and Artapan, he instructed
