                <p><label type="entry">NEW HAVEN</label>, a city of Connecticut, one of the United
                    States of North America. It lies round the head of a bay, which stretches
                    inwards about four miles from Long Island Sound, seventy-six miles north-east
                    from New York, and stands on a large and beautiful plain, which is bordered on
                    the north partly by eminences called East and West Rock, presenting bold and
                    almost perpendicular columns of bare trap rock from three to four hundred feet
                    in height. Upon the eastern and western sides the city is skirted by small
                    rivers, and extends from east to west three miles, being about two miles in
                    width. It is regularly laid out, and consists of two parts, the old and the new
                    town. The former was originally laid out in one large square, and is divided
                    into several smaller squares. The central square is intersected by a very fine
                    street, in which three handsome churches have been erected; and it also contains
                    a new state-house, built after the model of the Parthenon, and ranking with the
                    best American buildings. The public square and the principal streets are
                    ornamented with trees; and a great part of the dwelling-houses have gardens
                    filled with fruit trees, which give to the city a rural and delightful
                    appearance. New Haven contains eight or nine places of public worship,
                    Congregationalists and Episcopalians being the most numerous sects. There is a
                    jail, an almshouse, a custom-house, a museum, two banks, two insurance offices,
                    an institution for popular lectures, and a number of printing offices, from
                    which five or six newspapers and a few other periodicals are issued. Yale
                    College consists of ten buildings; four halls one hundred feet by forty, and
                    four stories in height, containing thirty-two rooms each for students, a chapel,
                    a medical college, a laboratory, and other necessary apartments. According to
                    the American Almanac for 1837, the state of this institution was as
                    follows:—Instructors, twenty-seven; alumni,4485; ministers, 1297; students, 413;
                    volumes in the college libraries, 10,500; and volumes in the students’
                    libraries, 15,000. The philosophical and chemical apparatus are good, and the
                    cabinet of minerals is the most valuable in the United States. In connection
                    with this establishment there are theological, medical, and law schools; and the
                    place is celebrated for the number of its boarding schools, there being seldom
                    fewer than one thousand persons who come hither from abroad for the purpose of
                    education. The harbour of New Haven is well defended from winds, but is shallow,
                    and gradually filling up with mud; an evil which has been remedied in part by
                    the construction of a wharf, about a mile in length, extending into the harbour.
                    The maritime commerce of this city is greater than that of any other place in
                    Connecticut, and it owns a considerable amount of shipping. Both the foreign and
                    the coasting trade are extensive, and packets and steam-boats ply regularly
                    between New Haven and New York. It was first settled by the English in the year
                    1638, and, as the capital of the colony of New Haven, continued distinct from
                    that of Connecticut till the year 1665. The legislature of the state meets
                    alternately here and at Hartford. The population in 1820 amounted to 7147, in
                    1830 to 10,678, and in 1837 to about 13,000. Long. 72. 57. W. Lat. 4L 18. N.</p>

                    >of</hi> Sussex, and the hundred of Holmstrough, sixty miles distant from
                    London. It stands at the mouth of the river Ouse, and is the port of Lewes,
                    where the custom-house is established. It was formerly a place of more
                    importance than at present; but the harbour has been neglected, and nearly
                    choked up by sand. It is sometimes called Meeching. The population amounted in
                    1801 to 584, in 1811 to 755, in 1821 to 927, and in 1831 to 904.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Newhaven,</hi> an ancient and considerable fishing village,
                    situated on the Frith of Forth, less than two miles north from Edinburgh, and
                    one mile west from Leith. The village is formed by a street running contiguous
                    with the shore, with several back lanes, and in appearance it has nothing to
                    recommend it to attention. It possesses a low-water pier, which affords shelter
                    to the fishing boats of the station, and accommodation to the ferry and other
                    steamers in the taking up and landing of their passengers and goods. A handsome
                    chapel has lately been erected at the west end of the village, and forms a
                    subsidiary place of worship, or chapel of ease, to North Leith church. The
                    inhabitants are a most industrious race, both sexes being busily employed, the
                    men in procuring the fish, and the females in carrying them to the market. The
                    oyster-bank is valuable, and yields fish of excellent quality. Were it turned to
                    its proper account, it would yield a far greater amount of revenue to the
                    proprietors. At the west end of the village there has been erected within these
                    few years a considerable suburb, called Trinity, consisting chiefly of houses
                    built in the villa style, and cottages for sea-bathing quarters. There is a
                    chain-pier here, built by Captain Brown, from which steamers for various
                    quarters hourly depart. A bill passed last session (1836-37) for constructing a
                    harbour here, in order to accommodate the large class of steamers plying between
                    the English and Scotch capitals. At Granton, about a mile farther west, a
                    harbour is considerably advanced for the same purpose. There is no municipal
                    government in Newhaven, the superiors of the place being the town-council of
                    Edinburgh, who purchased it in the year 1511, with all the privileges and rights
                    with which James IV. had endowed it. Along with Leith, Portobello, Musselburgh,
                    and Fisherrow, it returns a member to Parliament.</p>
