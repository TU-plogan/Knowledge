                <p><label type="entry">NECESSITY</label>, whatever is done by a cause or power that
                    is irresistible. In this sense it is opposed to freedom. Man is a necessary
                    agent, if all his actions be so determined by the causes preceding each action,
                    that not one past action could possibly not have come to pass, or have been
                    otherwise than it has been; or if it be so ordained that any future action
                    cannot possibly not come to pass, or be otherwise than it shall be. But he is a
                    free agent if he be able, at any time, to do different things; or, in other
                    words, if he be not unavoidably determined in every point of time, by the
                    circumstances in which he is placed, and the causes to the action of which he is
                    exposed, to do that one thing which he does, and not possibly to do any other
                    thing. Whether man is a necessary or a free agent, is a question which has been
                    debated with much ingenuity by writers of the first eminence. (See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics,</hi> part iii. chap. V.; and also <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Predestination.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Necessity,</hi> in
                    <hi rend="italic">Mythology,</hi> a power superior to all other powers, and
                    equally incapable of being resisted by gods or men. Herodotus, as quoted by
                    Cudworth, mentions an oracle which declared that “God himself could not shun his
                    destined fate;” and amongst the fragments of Philemon, collected by Le Clerc, we
                    find the following sentence:</p>
                <p>∆βvλβ.* βαfιλιων t&lt;r∕ztv, al βa&lt;ηλlιs Qιων, à lias iναγxui∙</p>
                <p>“We are subject to kings, kings are subject to the gods, and God is subject to
                    Necessity.” Hence it is that, in the Iliad, we find Jove himself, the sire of
                    gods and men, regretting that he was restrained by Necessity from rescuing his
                    favourite son from the sword of Patroclus. Nay, to such a height was this
                    impiety carried in the earliest ages of Greece, that we find Hesiod and Homer
                    teaching that the gods themselves were generated by Necessity engendering with
                    Night and Chaos.</p>
                <p>This power, although always represented as blind and unintelligent, was, however,
                    worshipped as a goddess, bearing in her hand large iron nails, and wedges, and
                    anchors, and melted lead, as emblems of the inflexible severity of her nature.
                    In the city of Corinth she had a temple, in which the goddess of Violence
                    likewise resided, and into which no person was ever permitted to enter except
                    the priest who officiated <hi rend="italic">in sαcris.</hi></p>
                <p>Learned men have exercised their ingenuity in vain attempts to trace this
                    portentous notion to its origin. Some, who wished to interpret it in a pious
                    sense, have supposed that the gods who are subject to necessity were only those
                    who were the ministers of the supreme <hi rend="italic">numen;</hi> and that by
                    necessity itself nothing more was meant than divine providence. But this is not
                    consistent with the generation of the gods according to Homer and Hesiod, nor
                    with the epithets <hi rend="italic">saeva</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >necessitas,</hi><hi rend="italic">dura</hi><hi rend="italic">necessitas,</hi>
                    by which this power was perpetually distinguished. Others, amongst whom may be
                    mentioned Mosheim, have supposed that this monstrous fable was invented by the
                    Pagan priests, and diligently inculcated upon the minds of the people, to excuse
                    the villanies of the objects of their worship.</p>
