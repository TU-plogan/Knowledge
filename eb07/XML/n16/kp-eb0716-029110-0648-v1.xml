                <p><label type="entry">NOWOGOROD</label>, a province of Great Russia, which takes
                    its name from the city which is now its capital, but was formerly that of the
                    whole of Russia. The governments of Olonez, Pfkow, Twer, and a part of that of
                    St Petersburg, were included in it, till the recent divisions of the empire were
                    established. It now extends between 57. 18. and 61. 8. north latitude, and
                    between 20. 4. and 29. 41. east longitude, over 56,616 square miles. It contains
                    ten cities, and 7932 villages, which are formed into 690 parishes, having each a
                    church. The inhabitants are 964,500, and almost exclusively adhere to the Greek
                    worship. The face of the country is level, though it includes the Waldai Hills;
                    but none of these is more than 300 feet above the level of the sea. The soil in
                    the northern part is marshy, and chiefly covered with moss; but in the south
                    there is some dry and good land, the cultivation of which rewards the labourer,
                    and the province produces more corn, chiefly rye, than it consumes. It also
                    yields flax, hemp, and mucn wood. The climate is severe, being nearly similar to
                    that <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560661?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0661-0292"/> of St Petersburg. The fisheries on the rivers and
                    lakes yield much subsistence. There is but little commerce, and none but
                    domestic manufactures.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Nowogorod,</hi> a city of Russia, the capital of a province,
                    and of one of the thirteen circles of the same name into which that province is
                    divided. It is situated in latitude 58. 32. 31. north, and longitude 31. 14. 16.
                    east. It is the seat of the military government of Twer, as well as of both the
                    military and civil governments of the province in which it stands. The site is
                    on the banks of the Wolchow, where the water of the Ilmen is received into that
                    stream, forming a river of more than a mile in breadth. The antiquities of the
                    city are more striking than its beauties. The cathedral, with its brazen gates,
                    is an object of curiosity for its venerable age, as is the tomb of St John of
                    Nowogorod, a saint to whose shrine numerous pilgrims resort. It contains
                    fifty-eight stone and four wooden churches, three monasteries, and 1550 houses,
                    with 10,100 inhabitants. Though ill built, and with irregular narrow streets, it
                    has an imposing appearance at a little distance, from the numerous spires and
                    cupolas which are displayed. The chief occupations of the people are making
                    sail-cloth and tanning leather.</p>
