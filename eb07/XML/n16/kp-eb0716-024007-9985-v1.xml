                <p><label type="entry">NOMINALISTS</label>, a sect of school philosophers, the
                    disciples and followers of Occam, or Ocham, an English cordelier, who flourished
                    in the fourteenth century. They received the denomination of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nominalists,</hi> because, in opposition to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Realists,</hi> they maintained that general terms, and not things or images,
                    are the objects of the mind when engaged in abstract reasonings or
                    inquiries.</p>
                <p>This sect had its first rise towards the end of the eleventh century, and
                    pretended to follow Porphyry and Aristotle; but it was not till Occam’s time
                    that they bore the name of Nominalists. The chief of this sect, in the eleventh
                    century, was a person named John, who, on account of his logical subtilty, was
                    called the sophist; and his principal disciples were Robert of Paris, Roscelin
                    of Compïègne, and Arnoul <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Laon. At the beginning the
                    Nominalists had the upper hand; but the Realists, though greatly divided amongst
                    themselves, were supported by men of eminent abilities, such as Albertus Magnus,
                    Thomas Aquinas, and Duns Scotus. The Nominalist sect thus fell into disrepute,
                    till Occam, in the fourteenth century, again revived it, and filled France and
                    Germany with the flame of disputation. His followers having joined the party of
                    the Franciscan monks, who strenuously opposed John XXII., that pope himself, and
                    his successors after him, left no means untried to extirpate the philosophy of
                    the Nominalists, which was deemed highly prejudicial to the interests of the
                    church; and hence it was that, in the year 1339, the university of Paris, by a
                    public edict, solemnly condemned and prohibited the philosophy of Occam, which
                    was that of the Nominalists. The consequence was, that the Nominalists
                    flourished more than ever. In the fifteenth century the controversy was
                    continued with more vigour and animosity than before; and the disputants, not
                    content with using merely the force of eloquence, had frequently recourse to
                    more dangerous weapons, and battles were the consequence of a philosophical
                    question which neither side understood. In most places, however, the Realists
                    maintained a superiority over the Nominalists. Whilst the famous Gerson and the
                    most eminent of his disciples were living, the Nominalists were in high esteem
                    and credit in the university of Paris; but, upon the death of these patrons, the
                    face of things changed much to their disadvantage. In the year 1473, Louis XI.,
                    at the instigation of his confessor, the Bishop <pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">of</hi> Avranches, issued a severe edict against the doctrines of
                    the Nominalists, and ordered all their writings to be seized and secured, that
                    they might not be read by the people; but the same monarch mitigated this edict
                    the year following, and permitted some of the books of that sect to be delivered
                    from their confinement; and, in the year 1481, he not only granted a full
                    liberty to the Nominalists and their writings, but also restored that
                    philosophical sect to its former authority and lustre in the university.</p>
                <p>The student of philosophy will do well to examine the researches of Brucker and
                    the other historians of philosophy on the subject of Nominalism, and also to
                    peruse what is to be found on the subject in the works of Mr Dugald Stewart and
                    Dr Thomas Brown.</p>
