                <p><label type="entry">NINEVEH</label>, the capital city of Assyria, which was
                    founded by Ashur the son of Shem (Gen. x. 11); or, as others read the text, by
                    Nimrod the son of Cush. However this may have been, it must be owned that
                    Nineveh was one of the largest and most ancient cities of the world. It is very
                    difficult to assign exactly the time of its foundation; but it cannot have been
                    long after the building of Babel. It was situated upon the banks of the Tigris;
                    and in the time of the prophet Jonas, who was sent thither under Jeroboam II.
                    king of Israel, and, as Calmet thinks, under the reign of Pul, father of
                    Sardanapalus, king of Assyria, Nineveh was a very great city, its circuit being
                    three days’journey (Jonah, iii. 3). Diodorus Siculus, who has given us the
                    dimensions of this city, says that it was 480 stadia, or fortyseven rfliles, in
                    circumference, and that it was surrounded with lofty walls and towers; the
                    former being 200 feet in height, and so very broad that three chariots might
                    drive along them abreast, and the latter 200 feet in height, and 1500 in number;
                    and Strabo allows it to have been much greater than Babylon. Diodorus Siculus
                    was, however, certainly mistaken in placing Nineveh on the Euphrates, since all
                    historians as well as geographers who speak of that city, tell us in express
                    terms that it was situated on the Tigris. At the time of Jonah’s mission
                    thither, it was so populous that it was reckoned to contain more than six score
                    thousand persons who could not distinguish their right hand from their left
                    (Jonah, iv. 11), which is generally explained of young children who had not yet
                    attained to the use of reason; so that upon this principle it is computed that
                    the inhabitants of Nineveh were then above 600,000 persons. Nineveh was taken by
                    Arbaces and Belesis, in the year of <pb break="no"

                    3257, under the reign of Sardanapalus, in the time of Ahaz, king of Judah, and
                    about the epoch of the foundation of Rome. It was reduced a second time by
