                <p><label type="entry">NOVEL</label>, a fictitious narrative in prose, which
                    professes to exhibit the natural workings of the human heart, the happiness and
                    misery of private life, and, above all, the nature of the affection called love,
                    and the consequences of indulging it in certain circumstances. A critic, by no
                    means too indulgent to works of fancy, and amongst whose failings laxity of
                    morals has never been numbered, thus expresses himself on the subject of
                    novel-writing. “These familiar histories,” says Dr Johnson, “may perhaps be made
                    of greater use than the solemnities of professed morality, and convey the
                    knowledge of vice and virtue with more efficacy than axioms and definitions. But
                    if the power of example is so great as to take possession of the memory by a
                    kind of violence, and produce effects almost without the intervention of the
                    will, care ought to be taken, that, when the choice is unrestrained, the best
                    examples only should be exhibited; and that what is likely to operate so
                    strongly, should not be mischievous or uncertain in its effects.”</p>
                <p>We have said that the novel professes above all things to exhibit the nature of
                    love, and its consequences. Whether this be essential to such performances, may
                    perhaps be reasonably questioned; but it has been made an important part of the
                    drama in most novels, and, we think, with great propriety. It is the object of
                    the novellist to give a true picture of life, diversified only by accidents that
                    daily happen in the world, and influenced by passions and qualities which are
                    really to be found in conversing with mankind. To accomplish this object, he
                    conceives a hero or heroine, whom he places in a certain rank of life, endows
                    with certain qualities of body and mind, and conducts, through many vicissitudes
                    of fortune, either to the summit of happiness or to the abyss of misery,
                    according to the passion which he wishes to excite in his readers. In the modern
                    novel, this hero or heroine is never placed on a throne or buried in a cottage;
                    because to the monarch and the cottager no difficulties occur which can deeply
                    interest the majority of readers. But amongst the virtuous part of the
                    intermediate orders of society, that affection which we call <hi rend="italic"
                    >love</hi> seldom fails, at some period of life, to take possession of the
                    hearts of both sexes; and wherever it has place, it must be productive of
                    happiness or of misery. In the proper management of this passion consists much
                    of the difficulty of the novel writer. He must exhibit his hero as feeling all
                    the pangs and pleasures of love, as sometimes animated with hope, and sometimes
                    ready to sink into despair, but always exerting himself to obtain the
                    gratification of his wishes. In doing this, care should be taken, either that he
                    never transgress the laws of virtue, or that at least he never transgress them
                    with impunity.</p>
                <p>“It is justly considered,” says the writer above quoted, “as the greatest
                    excellency of art to imitate nature; but it is necessary to distinguish those
                    parts of nature which are most proper for imitation: greater care is still
                    required in representing life, which is so often discoloured by passion or
                    deformed by wickedness. If the world be promiscuously described, I cannot
                    perceive of what use it can be to read the account; or why it may not be as safe
                    to turn the eye immediately upon mankind, as upon a mirror which shows all that
                    presents itself without discrimination. It is therefore not a sufficient
                    vindication of a character, that it is drawn as it appears; for many characters
                    ought never to be drawn: nor of a narrative, that the train of events is
                    agreeable to observation; for that observation which is called knowledge of the
                    world will be found much more frequently to make men cunning than good. The
                    purpose of these writings is surely not only to show mankind, but to provide
                    that they may be seen hereafter with less hazard; to teach the means of avoiding
                    the snares which are laid by treachery for innocence, without insuring any wish
                    for that superiority with which the betrayer flatters his vanity; to give the
                    power of counteracting fraud, without the temptation to practise it; to initiate
                    youth, by mock encounters, in the art of necessary defence; and to increase
                    prudence without impairing virtue.</p>
                <p>“Many writers, for the sake of following nature, so mingle good and bad qualities
                    in their principal personages, that they are both equally conspicuous; and as we
                    accompany them through their adventures with delight, and are led by degrees to
                    interest ourselves in their favour, we lose the abhorrence of their faults,
                    because they do not hinder our pleasures, or perhaps regard them with some
                    kindness for being united with so much merit. There have been men indeed
                    splendidly wicked, whose endowments threw a brightness on their crimes, and whom
                    scarce any villany made perfectly detestable, because they never could be wholly
                    divested of their excellencies: but such have been in all ages the great
                    corrupters of the world; and their resemblance ought no more to be preserved
                    than the art of murdering without pain.</p>
                <p>“In narratives, where historical veracity has no place, there should be exhibited
                    the most perfect idea of virtue; of virtue not angelical, nor above probability
                    (for what we cannot credit we shall never imitate), but the highest and purest
                    that humanity can reach, which, exercised in such trials as the various
                    revolutions of things shall bring upon it, may, by conquering some calamities
                    and enduring others, teach us what we may hope, and what we can perform. Vice
                    (for vice is necessary tobe shown) should always disgust; nor should the graces
                    of gaiety, or the dignity of courage, be so united with it as to reconcile it to
                    the mind. Wherever it appears, it should raise hatred by the malignity of its
                    practices, and contempt by the meanness of its stratagems; for while it is
                    supported by either parts or spirit, it will seldom be heartily abhorred.”</p>
                <p>It is farther observed by Johnson, that the task of the novel writer “requires,
                    together with that learning which is to be gained from books, that experience
                    which can never be attained by solitary diligence, but must arise from general
                    converse and accurate observation of the living world. Their performances have,
                    as Horace expresses it, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >oneris</hi><hi rend="italic">quantum variae minus,</hi> little indulgence, and
                    therefore more difficulty. They are engaged in portraits of which every one
                    knows the original, and can detect any deviation from exactness of resemblance.
                    Other writings are safe, except from the malice of learning, but these are in
                    danger from every common reader; as the slipper ill executed was censured by a
                    shoemaker who happened to stop in his way at the Venus of Apelles.</p>
                <p>“But the fear of not being approved as a just copier of human manners, is not the
                    most important concern that an author of this class ought to have before him.
                    Novels are written chiefly to the young, the ignorant, and the idle, to whom
                    they serve as lectures of conduct and introduction<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194560648?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0648-0291"/> into life. In
                    every such work, it should therefore be carefully inculcated, that virtue is the
                    highest proof of understanding, and the only solid basis of greatness; and that
                    vice is the natural consequence of narrow thoughts; that it begins in mistake,
                    and ends in ignominy; and since love must be introduced, it should be
                    represented as leading to wretchedness whenever it is separated from duty or
                    from prudence.’’</p>
                <p>For some striking and profound observations on the effects of novel-reading, the
                    reader is referred to what Mr Stewart has written upon that subject in his
