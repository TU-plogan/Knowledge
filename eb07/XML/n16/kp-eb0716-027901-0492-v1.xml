                <p><label type="entry">NOTAE</label>, signs used in writing, which have the force of
                    many letters. This contrivance for expedition is of great antiquity. It was
                    known to the Greeks, and from them passed to the Romans. By whom the invention
                    was brought to Rome has not been precisely ascertained; but the most general
                    opinion is, that in matters of importance Tully first made use of notes or
                    short-hand writing when Cato delivered an oration in opposition to Julius Caesar
                    relative to the conspiracy of Catiline. Cicero, who was at that time consul,
                    placed <hi rend="italic">notarii,</hi> or expert short-hand writers, in
                    different parts of the senate-house, to take down the speech; and this was the
                    first public occasion which we find recorded of employing short-hand writers
                    amongst the Ronans. It is unnecessary to observe, that the name of <hi
                    rend="italic">no·</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic">αry,</hi> still in use, was derived
                    from this practice. There vere three kinds of notes for short-hand writing used
                    by I he ancients, either for despatch or secrecy. The first ιnd most ancient was
                    that of hieroglyphics, which are <hi rend="superscript"> ,-</hi> ather images or
                    representations of things than of words. Γhe second species were called <hi
                    rend="italic">singulariae,</hi> from their ex- )ressing words by single letters.
                    Sertorius Ursatus has !ompiled a very copious collection of such abbreviations.
                    The third kind were called <hi rend="italic">notae Tironianae,</hi> from Tiro he
                    freedman of Cicero, who was particularly skilled in his art; and it is to him
                    that we are indebted for the pre-ervation of Cicero’s letters, of which a great
                    part still regain, one entire book having been addressed to Tiro him-elf.</p>
                <p>It appears that notes were in frequent use amongst the tomans, and continued to
                    be employed till the tenth and !eyenth centuries. We have indeed but few books
                    re- ’ wining which are written in short-hand; but this is not uprising, when
                    such was the unhappy situation of early times, that either superstition
                    condemned them to the flames as the works of impious magicians, or they were
                    left, through ignorance and stupidity, to be devoured by vermin. It is probable,
                    however, that there are still extant writings of this sort, which might
                    contribute to enrich the republic of letters.</p>
                <p>There are several manuscripts and instruments written in these kinds of <hi
                    rend="italic">notae</hi> in the royal library of Paris. In the year l74∙7, the
                    learned and ingenious Μ. Charpentier engraved and published at Paris a
                    capitulary, and fifty-four charters of Louis the Pious, emperor and king of
                    France, written in the <hi rend="italic">notae Tironianae.</hi> To this work the
                    learned editor has prefixed an <hi rend="italic">Alphabetum Tironianum,</hi>
                    together with a great number and variety of notes or marks for the different
                    parts of speech, and rules for acquiring the art of writing in this kind of
                    notes. Valerius Probus, in his book <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Litteris Antiquis,</hi> explains many of the characters used by the short-hand
                    writers; and there is a dictionary of them published by Gruterus.</p>
