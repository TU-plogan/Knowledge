                    same name, in the district of Norhamshire, county-palatine of Durham, pleasantly
                    situated on the south side of the river Tweed, nine miles above Berwick. It is
                    celebrated for being the frequent scene of forays during the wars between
                    England and Scotland, probably because one of the principal fords across
                    the-Tweed between Berwick <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560076?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0716-0076-0247"/> and Kelso is only at a short distance above the
                    village. Norham, in its present state, appears to have been built from the ruins
                    of the celebrated castle situated at its eastern extremity. It has been much
                    improved, and is now kept free from the filth which was formerly allowed to
                    accumulate on its streets. The cross, which is at the west end of the village,
                    also adds to its appearance. The church of Norham is of very old date, and has
                    for its middle aisle part of the first church, which was built in the year 840.
                    Before the Reformation, it had the privilege of affording sanctuary for
                    thirty-seven days. There is also a Presbyterian meeting-house and an endowed
                    school in the village. Its inhabitants are principally supported by salmon
                    fisheries on the Tweed, shoe-making, and agricultural employment in the
                    neighbourhood. In consequence of the dangerous state of the ford across the
                    Tweed, and from the river being often impassable, even for boats, when it is
                    swollen with rain, it is in contemplation to construct a chain-bridge across the
                    river. The ruins of the castle are situated on a high rock, which overhangs the
                    river Tweed; they are of considerable extent, and consist of the remains of two
                    sides of the tower or keep, many vaults, with the fragments of other edifices,
                    and the remains of the outward walls, which enclose the castle to a considerable
                    extent. There are also traces of field-works, which appear to have been erected
                    by the forces which besieged it, in order to enable them to reduce it. The ruins
                    have a most picturesque appearance. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 901, and
