                    <hi rend="italic">Nunez,</hi> a learned Portuguese, and one of the most able
                    mathematicians of the sixteenth century, was born at Alcacer. He was preceptor
                    to Don Henry, son of Emmanuel, and taught mathematics in the university of
                    Coimbra. He published the following works, by which he gained great reputation,
                    viz. 1. De Arte Navigandi; 2. Annotationes in Theorias Planetarum Purbachii,
                    which are greatly esteemed; 3. A treatise De Crepusculis; 4. A treatise on
                    Algebra. It is observed in Furetière’s Dictionary, that Peter Nonius, in 1530,
                    first invented the angles of 45 degrees made in every meridian, and that he
                    called them <hi rend="italic">rhumbs</hi> in his language, and calculated them
                    by spherical triangles. Nonius died in 1577, aged eighty.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">-</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Nonius,</hi> the name given to
                    the common device for subdividing the arcs of quadrants and other astronomical
                    instruments, from the persuasion that it was invented by the above-named Nonius
                    or Nunez. The generality of astronomers, however, transferring the honour of the
                    invention from Nunez to Peter Vernier, a native of Franche Comté, have called
                    this method of division by his name. But Mr Adams, in his Geometrical and
                    Geographical Essays, has shown that Clevius the Jesuit may dispute the invention
                    with both of them. The truth seems to be, that Nunez started the idea, Clevius
                    improved it, and Vernier carried it to its present state of perfection. The
                    method of Nunez, described in his treatise <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Crepusculis,</hi> printed at Lisbon in 1542, consists in
                    describing within the same quadrant 45 concentric circles, dividing the
                    outermost into 90 equal parts, the next within into 89, the next into 88,
                    &amp;c. till the innermost was divided into 46 only. On a quadrant thus divided
                    the plumb-line or index must cross one or other of the circles very near a point
                    of division; and hence, by computation, the degrees and the minutes of the arch
                    may be easily ascertained. This method is also described by Nunez in his
                    treatise <hi rend="italic">De Arte</hi><hi rend="italic">atque Datione
                    Navigandi,</hi> where he would fain persuade himself that it was not unknown to
                    Ptolemy. But as the degrees are thus divided very unequally, and as it is very
                    difficult to attain exactness in the division, especially when the numbers into
                    which the arches are to be divided are incomposite, the method of diagonals,
                    first published by Digges, in a treatise entitled <hi rend="italic">Aleae seu
                    Scalae Mathemoticae,</hi> printed at London in 1573, and said to be invented by
                    one Richard Chenseler, was substituted in its stead. Nonius’s method, however,
                    was improved at different times and by different persons; and it must be
                    acknowledged, that if Vernier saw either the original or any of the improvements
                    (and there can be little doubt of his having seen them all), his merit consists
                    only in having applied to an useful practical purpose the speculative invention
                    of another person.</p>
