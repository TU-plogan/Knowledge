                <p><label type="entry">NUMERAL <hi rend="smallcaps">Letters</hi></label> are those
                    letters of the alphabet which are generally <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> used
                    for figures, as 1, one; V, five; X, ten; L, fifty; C, a hundred; D, five
                    hundred; M, a thousand; and so on. It is not agreed how the Roman numerals
                    originally received their value. It has been supposed, as we have observed in
                    the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Number,</hi> that the Romans used Μ to denote
                    1000, because it is the first letter of <hi rend="italic">mille,</hi> which is
                    the Latin word for 1000; and C to denote 100, because it is the first letter of
                    <hi rend="italic">centum,</hi> which in Latin means 100. It has also been
                    supposed that D, being formed by dividing the old Μ in the middle, was therefore
                    appointed to stand for 500, that is, half as much as the Μ stood for when it was
                    whole; and that L being half a C, originally written E, was for the same reason
                    used to denominate fifty. But what reason is there to suppose that 1000 and 100
                    were the numbers which letters were first used to express? And what reason can
                    be assigned why D, the first letter in the Latin word <hi rend="italic"
                    >decern,</hi> ten, should not rather have been chosen to stand for that number
                    than for 500, because it had a rude resemblance to half an Μ? But if these
                    questions could be satisfactorily answered, there are other numeral letters
                    which have never yet been accounted for at all. These considerations render it
                    probable that the Romans did not, in their original intention, employ letters to
                    express numbers at all. The most natural account of the matter seems to be this:
                    The Romans probably put down a single stroke, I, for one, as is still the
                    practice of those who score upon a slate or with chalk. This stroke, I, they
                    doubled, trebled, and quadrupled, to express 2, 3, and 4; thus, II., HL, IIH. So
                    far they could easily number the strokes with a glance of the eye. But they
                    presently found that if more were added it would soon be necessary to tell the
                    strokes one by one. For this reason, then, when they came to 5, they expressed
                    it by joining two strokes together in an acute angle, thus, V; which will appear
                    the more probable, if it be considered that the progression of the Roman numbers
                    is from 5 to 5, that is, from the fingers on one hand to the fingers on the
                    other. Ovid has touched upon the original of this in his <hi rend="italic"
                    >F'asti</hi> (lib. iii.), and Vitruvius has made a similar remark.</p>
                <p>After they had made this acute angle V for five, they added the single strokes to
                    it to the number of four, thus VI., VII., VIII., V1HL, and then, as the strokes
                    could not be further multiplied without confusion, they doubled their acute
                    angle by prolonging the two lines beyond their intersection, thus, X, to denote
                    two fives, or ten. After this they doubled, trebled, and quadrupled this double
                    acute angle thus, XX., XXX., XXXX.; they then, for the same reason which induced
                    them first to make a single and then to double it, joined two single strokes in
                    another form, and instead of an acute angle, made a right angle, L, to denote
                    fifty. When this fif ty was doubled, they then doubled the right angle thus, E,
                    to denote 100; and having numbered this double right angle four times, thus, EC,
                    LEE, EE EE, when they came to the fifth number, as before, they reverted it, and
                    put a single stroke before it thus I□, to denote 500; and when this 500 was
                    doubled, then they also doubled their double right angle, setting two double
                    right angles opposite to each other, with a single stroke between them, thus, El
                    J, to denote 1000. When this note for 1000 had been four times repeated, then
                    they put down I□□ for 5000, EEI∑1□ for 10,000, and IJ□□ for 50,000, and EEEU□□
                    for 100,000, IJJJJ for 500,000, and ECEEI□□J□ for one million.</p>
                <p>That the Romans did not originally write Μ for 1000, and C for 100, but square
                    characters, as they are represented above, we are expressly informed by Paulus
                    Manutius; but the corners of the angles being cut off by the transcribers for
                    despateh, these figures were gradually brought into what are now numeral
                    letters. When the corners of EI□ were made round, it stood thus CIO, ιvhich is
                    so near the Gothic <hi rend="italic">cn,</hi> that it soon deviated into that
                    letter; so 13 having the corners rounded, stood thus, 10, and then easily
                    deviated into D. L also became a plain C by the same means; the single rectangle
                    which denoted fifty was, without alteration, a capital L; the double acute angle
                    was an X; the single acute angle a V consonant; and a plain single stroke the
                    letter I; and thus these seven letters, M, D, C, L, X, V, 1, became
                    numerals.</p>
