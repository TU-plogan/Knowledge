                    something belonging to an ellipsis.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Elliptic Turning.</hi> Wood and other substances are turned
                    into an elliptic form by means of a chuck, whieh is applied on the common
                    turning lathe. This ehuck is on the principle of the trammel, Plate CCXVIII.
                    fig. 1. The grooves in the chuck are much wider than in the trammel, and the
                    points of the chuck that correspond to C, D of the trammel, fig. 1, remain
                    fixed, and in one horizontal line; whereas in the trammel these are the points
                    whieh are put in motion.</p>
                <p>If two straight lines, crossing each other, be drawn on a pieee of transparent
                    paper or miea; if this transparent paper be laid upon a sheet of white paper,
                    with two points marked on it; if the transparent paper be moved round, so that
                    the cross lines shall travel over the two points, in like manner as the two
                    points C, D in the trammel, fig. 1, travel over the cross grooves of the
                    trammel; and if the point of a peneil be held fixed, and touching the
                    transparent paper, so as to leave a trace on the transparent paper when the
                    paper is moved; then after the transparent paper has made a revolution, the
                    trace left on it by the point of the pencil will be an ellipse. This method of
                    describing an ellipse represents the action whieh takes place in the chuek for
                    turning ellipses; the point of the pencil whieh remains unmoved is in the same
                    situation as the turner’s gouge; the transparent paper which receives the trace
                    of the ellipse from the fixed peneil is analogous to the wood, which is to be
                    turned into the form of an ellipse by the fixed eutting gouge.</p>
                <p>In fig. 2, the ehuck is represented as fitted on a common turning lathe, of whieh
                    A is the pulley of the nιaundrel, B and C are the sides of the frame supporting
                    the pulley, P the rest, D the frame in which the rest slides, Ε, F the feet of
                    that frame, I the nut and serevv which serve to fix the rest, G, H arc the
                    continuation of the sides B, C. K is the elliptic ehuek, with two grooves,
                    through which the knobs of the slider pass. These knobs are connected by a
                    strong bar of iron screwed into their ends; and on this bar of iron is seen the
                    screw for fastening the board, to which is fixed the wood or other substance
                    whieh is to be turned elliptically.</p>
                <p>Fig. 3 shows the other side of the chuck, whieh in fig. 2 is turned towards the
                    side of the frame C. N, in fig. 3, is the board with the grooves whieh contain
                    the slider 0. In the middle of N is sccn the cnd of the serew, whieh is fixed to
                    the mayndrel. The board N has a circular motion, being fixed on the axis of the
                    maundrel, whilst the slider 0, at the same time that it is carried round by the
                    circular motion of N, is constrained to perform other motions by the grooves in
                    N and by the groove in 0, fig· 3, which slides on the ring M, fig. 4.</p>
                <p>In fig. 4, L is a part of the side C of the maundrel frame, <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193331884?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-1884-0673"/> with the ring
                    M fastened to it. On this ring the broad groove in the slider 0, fig. 3, moves
                    when the lathe is set agoing; and this groove is at right angles to the grooves
                    in N, fig. 3, in which the knobs of 0 move. In fig. 4 it is seen that the centre
                    of the ring M may be made to coincide with the centre of the spindle of the
                    maundrel, in which case a circle is described. If the ring is fixed, so that the
                    centre of the ring does not coincide with the centre of the maundrel, an ellipse
                    is described by the wood screwed upon the bar of 0 in fig. 2; and the most
                    eccentric ellipse that the machine describes is obtained when the nιaundrel is
                    at the circumference of the ring. The centre of the spindle of the maundrel, and
                    the centre of the ring M, are always in one immoveable horizontal line, and are
                    analogous to the points C, D of the trammel, fig. 1. In fig. 3 it is seen that
                    the sides of the grooves may be brought nearer together by means of screws; so
                    that the sliders and the eylindric ring may fit exactly to the grooves. The best
                    elliptic chucks are made of brass. See <hi rend="italic">Mechanical
