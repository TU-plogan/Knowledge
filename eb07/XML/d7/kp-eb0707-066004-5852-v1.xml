                <p><label type="entry">DEATH</label> is generally considered as the separation of
                    the soul from the body; in which sense it stands opposed to life, which consists
                    in the union of both.</p>
                <p>Physicians usually define death as consisting of a total stoppage of the
                    circulation of the blood, and a cessation of the animal and vital functions
                    consequent thereon; as respiration, sensation, and the like.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Drothers of</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Death,</hi> a
                    denomination usually given to religious persons of the order of St Paul, the
                    first hermit. They are called “brothers of death,” <hi rend="italic"
                    >fratres</hi><hi rend="italic">a morte,</hi> on account of the figure of a
                    death’s head which they were always to have in their custody, to remind them of
                    the certainty of death. This order, by its constitutions made in 1620, does not
                    seem to have been established long before Pope Paul V. In 1621, Louis XIII.
                    permitted them to settle in France. The order was probably suppressed by Pope
                    Urban VIII.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">DEATH-Watch,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Natural History,</hi> a
                    little insect famous for a ticking noise, like the beat of a watch, which the
                    vulgar have long regarded as a presage of death in the family where it is heard;
                    and hence it is also called <hi rend="italic">pediculus fatidicus,</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">mortisaga, pulsatorius,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                <p>There are two kinds of death-watches. Of the first we have a good account by Mr
                    Allen in the Philosophical Transactions. It is a small beetle, five sixteenths
                    of an inch long, of a dark-brown colour, spotted, and having pellucid wings
                    under the vagina, a large cap or helmet on the head, and two antennae proceeding
                    from beneath the eyes, and doing the office of proboscides. The part it beats
                    withal, he observed, was the extreme edge of the face, which he calls the upper
                    lip, the mouth being protected by this bony part, and lying out of view
                    underneath.</p>
                <p>The above account is confirmed by Dr Derham; with this difference, that instead
                    of ticking with the upper lip, he observed the insect draw back its mouth, and
                    beat with its forehead. That author had two death-watches, a male and a female,
                    which he kept alive in a box several months; and could bring one of them to beat
                    whenever he pleased, by imitating its beating. By means of this ticking noise he
                    could frequently invite the male to get up upon the other in the way of coition.
                    When the male found he had mounted in vain, he would get off, beat very eagerly,
                    and then get up again; hence the ingenious author concludes that these insects
                    woo one another by means of such pulsations, and thus find out and invite each
                    other to copulation.</p>
                <p>The second kind of death-watch is an insect in appearance quite different from
                    the first. The former only beats seven or eight strokes at a time, and these
                    quickly; the latter will beat several hours together without intermission, but
                    his strokes are more leisurely, and resemble the beat of a watch. This latter is
                    a small grayish insect, much like a louse when viewed with the naked eye.</p>
                <p>It is commonly found in all parts of a house in the summer months; and it is very
                    nimble in running to shelter, and shy of beating when disturbed; but it will
                    beat very freely before you, and also answer the beating, if you can view it
                    without giving it disturbance, or shaking the place where it lies. The author
                    cannot say whether they beat on any other substance, but he never heard their
                    noise except in or near paper. As to their noise, the same person is in doubt
                    whether it be made by their heads, or rather snouts, against the paper; or
                    whether it be not effected after some such manner ás grasshoppers and crickets
                    make their noise. He inclines to adopt the former opinion. The reason of his
                    doubt is, that he observed the animal’s body to shake and give a jerk at every
                    beat, but could scarcely perceive any part of its body touch the paper. But its
                    body is so small and so near the paper, and its motion in ticking is so quick,
                    that he thinks it might be so without his perceiving it. The ticking, as in the
                    other, he judges to be a wooing act; having observed another, after much
                    beating, come and make advances to the beating insect, who, after some offers,
                    left off beating, and got upon the back of the other. When they were joined, he
                    left off again; and they continued some hours joined tail to tail, like dog and
                    bitch in coition. Whether this insect changes its shape, and becomes another
                    animal, or not, he could not say; though he had some reason to suspect that it
                    becomes a sort of fly. It is at first a minute white egg, much smaller than the
                    nits of lice, though the insect is nearly as big • as a louse. In March it is
                    hatched, and creeps about <pb break="no" facs="nls:194755865?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-5865-0661"/> with its shell on. When it first leaves its
                    shell, it is even smaller than its egg; though that be scarcely discernible
                    without a microscope. In this state it is perfectly like the mites in cheese.
                    From the mite state these insects grow gradually to their mature perfect state.
                    When they become like the old ones, they are at first very small, but run about
                    much more swiftly than before.</p>
