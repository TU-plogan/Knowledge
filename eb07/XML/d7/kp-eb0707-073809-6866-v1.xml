                <p><label type="entry">DESAULT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre Joseph</hi></label>, a
                    distinguished French surgeon, was born at Magny-Vernais, a village of
                    Franche-Comté, in the year 1744. He was descended of parents of a humble rank in
                    life, received the early part of his education in a school of the Jesuits, and
                    was destined for the church; but his own inclination tended to the study of
                    medicine; and in this he was at length indulged, and settled as an apprentice in
                    the military hospital of Béfort. Here he acquired some knowledge of anatomy and
                    surgery; and having previously made considerable progress in mathematical
                    studies, hc applied this knowledge, after the example of Borelli and others, to
                    the investigation of physiological subjects. He translated the work of Borelli,
                    <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu Animalium,</hi> and added notes
                    and illustrations, in which, although he proceeded upon wrong principles, he
                    discovered at a very early period strong proofs of his zeal and industry.</p>
                <p>About his twentieth year he went to Paris, where he enjoyed the best
                    opportunities of storing his mind with the knowledge of surgery and anatomy,
                    which he prosecuted with the utmost ardour and success. He spent almost the
                    whole of his time at the anatomical theatres and hospitals; but by this close
                    attendance his health suffered greatly. Hc was seized with a cachectical
                    disease, which confined him to bed for twelve months; and he was indebted for
                    his recovery to the vigour of his constitution, and the kind offices of a young
                    friend, who constantly watched the progress of his disorder. His health being
                    re-established, neither his circumstances nor the activity of his mind permitted
                    him to indulge in repose. He commenced teacher of anatomy in the winter of 1766,
                    and was soon attended by about three hundred pupils, a great proportion of whom
                    were older than himself. But this success excited the jealousy of the
                    established teachers and professors, who exerted all the influence of authority
                    to silence him; and although he was patronised and protected by some surgeons of
                    great eminence, the opposition which he met with would have obliged him to
                    renounce public teaching, had he not managed to go on by the expedient of
                    adopting the name of another as a sanction. His reputation was now greatly
                    extended; but still he <pb break="no" facs="nls:194756879?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0707-6879-0739"/> declined private practice, till he should be
                    established in some distinguished public station. In the year 1776 he was
                    admitted a member of the corporation of surgeons, and it would appear that his
                    finances were at this time extremely limited, from the circumstance of his being
                    indulged by that body in paying his fees when it should be convenient for
                    himself. He successively filled the honourable stations in the corporation and
                    academy of surgery; and in tlιe year 1782 he was appointed surgeonmajor to the
                    hospital <hi rend="italic">De la Charite.</hi></p>
                <p>Desault was now regarded as one of the first surgeons of Paris. He succeeded to
                    the next vacancy at the Hôtel Dieu; and after the death of Moreau, almost the
                    whole surgical department of that hospital was intrusted to him. Here he
                    instituted a clinical school of surgery on a liberal and extensive plan, which
                    attracted a great concourse of students, not only from every part of France, but
                    also from foreign countries. An audience composed of about six hundred students
                    frequently met to hear his instructions; and most of the surgeons of the French
                    army derived their knowledge from his lectures.</p>
                <p>The surgical practice of Desault was always distinguished for its efficacy and
                    simplicity. Amongst the improvements which he introduced into surgery may be
                    mentioned bandages for the retention of fractured limbs, the use of compressions
                    in promoting the cure of ulcers, the use of ligature in umbilical hernia of
                    children, the extraction of loose cartilages in joints, the use of bougies in
                    schirro-sities of the rectum, and that of elastic probes in contractions of the
                    urethra. He also introduced essential improvements in the construction of
                    various surgical instruments.</p>
                <p>In the year 1791 he published a work entitled <hi rend="italic">Journal de
                    Chirurgerie,</hi> the object of which was to record the most interesting cases
                    which had occurred in his clinical school, with the remarks which he had made
                    upon them in the course of his lectures. The editing of this work was intrusted
                    to his pupils. But in the midst of his valuable labours he became obnoxious to
                    some of the prevailing parties of that turbulent period; and in 1792 he was, on
                    some frivolous charge, denounced to the popular sections. After being twice
                    examined, he was seized whilst he was delivering a lecture, carried away from
                    his theatre, and committed to the prison of the Luxembourg. But in three days
                    thereafter he was liberated, and permitted to resume all functions. When the
                    school of health was established, he was appointed clinical professor for
                    external maladies; and it was through his means that the Evêché was converted
                    into an hospital for surgical operations.</p>
                <p>The horrid scenes which were exhibited in May 1795 made so deep an impression on
                    his mind, from the apprehension of a renewal of the horrors which he had
                    formerly experienced, that he was seized with an ataxic fever, accompanied with
                    delirium, which put an end to his life on the 1st of June the same year, at the
                    age of fifty-one. He had attended the dauphin in the Temple; and from the
                    circumstance of his death having happened but a short time before that of the
                    prince, an opinion was prevalent among the populace that he was poisoned,
                    because he had refused to do any thing against the dauphin’s life. This story
                    seems to be without foundation; but it affords a proof of the opinion
                    entertained by the public of Desault’s integrity. A pension was settled on his
                    widow by the republic. Fame, and not emolument, had always been the object of
                    his ambition; and he neglected many opportunities of acquiring wealth.
                    Indifferent to all other pleasures and pursuits, Desault was solely and
                    passionately attached to his profession. His temper was ardent, and sometimes
                    rather violent; but his sentiments were always elevated and noble, and hence his
                    pupils called him <hi rend="italic">Le Bourru</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Bienfaisant.</hi> The only work of which he is to be considered as the sole
