                <p><label type="entry">DAPHNEPHORIA</label>, a festival in honour of Apollo,
                    celebrated every ninth year by the Boeotians. It was then usual to adorn an
                    olive bough with garlands of laurels and other flowers, and to place on the top
                    a brazen globe, on which were suspended smaller ones. In the middle were
                    arranged a number of crowns, and a globe of inferior size, while the bottom was
                    adorned with a saffron-coloured garment. The globe on the top represented the
                    sun, or Apollo, that in the middle was an emblem of the moon, and the others
                    indicated the stars. The crowns, which were sixty-five in number, represented
                    the sun’s annual revolution. This bough was carried in solemn procession by a
                    beautiful youth of an illustrious family, whose parents were both living at the
                    time of its celebration. The youth was dressed in rich garments which reached to
                    the ground, lιis hair hung loose and dishevelled, his head was covered with a
                    golden crown, and he wore on his feet shoes called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Iphicratidce,</hi> from Iphicrates, an Athenian, who first invented them. He
                    was called Aapvjj£ogoř, <hi rend="italic">laurel-bearer,</hi> and on that
                    occasion he held the office of priest of Apollo. He was preceded by one of his
                    nearest relations, bearing a rod adorned with garlands, and behind him followed
                    a train of virgins with branches in their hands. In this order the procession
                    advanced as far as the temple of Apollo, surnamed Ismenius, where supplicatory
                    hymns were sung to the god. This festival owes its origin to the following
                    circumstance. When an oracle advised the AEtolians, who inhabited Atne and the
                    adjacent country, to abandon their ancient possessions, and go in quest of a
                    settlement, they invaded the Theban territories, which at that time were
                    pillaged by an army of Pelasgians. As the celebration of Apollo’s festival was
                    near, both nations, who religiously observed it, laid aside their hostilities,
                    and, according to custom, cut down laurel boughs from Mount Helicon, and in the
                    neighbourhood of the river Melas, and walked in procession in honour of the
                    divinity. The day on which this solemnity was observed, Polematas, the general
                    of the Bceotian army, saw in a dream a youth who presented him with a complete
                    suit of armour, and commanded the Boeotians to offer solemn prayers to Apollo,
                    and to walk in procession with laurel boughs in their hands every ninth year.
                    Three days after his dream, the Boeotian general made a sally, and cut off the
                    greater part of the besiegers, who were compelled by this blow to relinquish
                    their enterprise. Polematas immediately instituted a novennial festival to the
                    god, who seemed to be the patron of the Boeotians.</p>
