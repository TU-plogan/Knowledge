                <p><label type="entry">SUSA</label>, the ancient royal residence of the kings of
                    Persia, built by Darius the son of Hystaspes, according to Pliny, though he
                    perhaps only restored it, being a very ancient city, founded by Tithonus, father
                    of Memnon. Its compass was said by ancient authors to be 120 stadia; but the
                    ruins give us the idea of a still greater extent. They are situated on the east
                    side of the river Kerah, in the latitude of 32°, stretching not less than twelve
                    miles from one extremity to the other. These ruins consist of hillocks of earth
                    and rubbish, covered with broken pieces of brick and coloured tile. One of these
                    hillocks is a mile in circumference, and 100 feet high. Another, though not
                    quite so high, has double the circuit. Large blocks of marble covered with
                    hieroglyphics are frequently discovered by the Arabs. There is a building,
                    apparently modern, called the tomb of Daniel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Susa,</hi> a province of the department of Turin, in the
                    continental part of the kingdom of Sardinia. It is on the frontier towards
                    France. It is 704 square miles in extent, and forms a large valley with two
                    terminations or horns, through one of which is the road over Mount Genevre to
                    France by the Cottian Alps, and the other passes over Mount Cenis, and so into
                    Savoy; but the latter is by far the preferable road. In the western part of the
                    province lofty rugged rocks and even glaciers are to be seen; but in the west is
                    an alternation of valleys and gentle hills, with a fertile soil watered by the
                    river Dora, which runs to Turin. The district produces abundance of wine, flax,
                    hemp, and silk, but is deficient in corn, and chestnuts are much used as a
                    substitute for grain. There are iron mines and marble quarries worked; and much
                    linen is spun and woven. The province has the title of a marquisate, and
                    contains a city, with sixty-five towns and villages, and about 70,000
                    inhabitants.</p>
                <p>The capital is the city of the same name at the foot of the Alps, on the river
                    Dora, which here receives the Ei-nische. The town is badly fortified, and is
                    rather meanly built. It is the see of a bishop, has a cathedral and two
                    monasteries, with nearly 2000 inhabitants, whose chief occupation is making
                    gloves, and spinning cotton thread. It is a place of great antiquity, and must
                    have been formerly of importance in a military view, from its situation on the
                    only road then known from Gaul into Italy; to defend which it had the castles of
                    Santa Maria and La Brunette, which were destroyed by the French in 1796. Here
                    stands a beautiful triumphal arch in honour of Augustus, which is in good
                    preservation. This place is twenty-three miles from Turin, in longitude 6. 50.
                    10. E., and latitude 45. 8. N.</p>
