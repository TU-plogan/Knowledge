                <p><label type="entry">KIRCHER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Athanasius</hi></label>, a
                    Jesuit, and one of the most learned and laborious men that this celebrated order
                    has ever produced, was born on the 2d of May 1602, at Geysen, a small town near
                    Fulde in Germany. His parents were humble, but respectable, and exerted
                    themselves to give him a good education. Having finished his studies, he entered
                    the society of the Jesuits, where he found new means of satisfying his passion
                    for learning, and applied himself to physics, natural history, mathematics, and
                    ancient languages, embracing with equal ardour almost every department of
                    knowledge. Being appointed to teach philosophy, and afterwards the oriental
                    languages, in the college of Wurtzbourg, he acquitted himself of this double
                    duty in the most satisfactory manner. But the Thirty Years’ War, having
                    interrupted his useful labours, and disturbed his repose, forced him to quit the
                    country where he had already distinguished himself. He retired into France, and
                    first settled in the Jesuits’ College at Avignon, where he passed two years,
                    entirely occupied with the study of antiquities. It was during his residence in
                    this city that he became acquainted with the learned Peiresc, who advised him to
                    attempt the explication of the Egyptian hieroglyphics; a task to which he
                    afterwards applied himself with great zeal, though, unfortunately, with but
                    indifferent success. Having received an appointment to the professorship of
                    mathematics at Vienna, be was preparing to return to Germany, when he received
                    an order to repair to Rome, whither he accordingly proceeded without delay. In
                    1637, the pope charged him to accompany Cardinal Frederick of Saxony to Malta,
                    where he was received by the grand-master of the order of knights of St John and
                    Jerusalem with much distinction. He next visited Sicily and the kingdom of
                    Naples, and then proceeded to take possession of the chair of mathematics in the
                    Roman College; a situation which he filled for eight years, at the end of which
                    he obtained permission of his superiors to discontinue teaching in order to
                    apply himself to other pursuits. He had a dispute with Father Maignan respecting
                    the invention of an optical instrument; but though the affair made some noise,
                    the question of priority remained undecided. Kircher died at Rome, on the 28th
                    of November 1680, the same day on which Bernin and Grimaldi expired. He was a
                    man of extraordinary but ill-digested erudition, without critical judgment. He
                    was gifted with a strong imagination, vast memory, and indefatigable patience;
                    but, notwithstanding his persevering application, be found himself unable to
                    verify the facts stated in his works; and he had, besides, the folly to attempt
                    to explain everything, by which means he fell into serious errors, and his
                    fidelity was even brought into question. For an account of his fanciful and
                    abortive efforts to penetrate the mystery of the Egyptian inscriptions, the
                    reader is referred to the introductory section of the article <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Hieroglyphics</hi> in this work. Several sovereigns, and
                    amongst these Augustus duke of Brunswick, furnished him with the sums necessary
                    for his experiments, and also transmitted to him rare and curious articles, with
                    which he formed one of the most valuable cabinets which had yet been seen;
                    whilst the most distinguished foreigners who visited Rome failed not to pay
                    their respects to the learned Jesuit. The works of Kircher are very numerous,
                    and would merit a detailed notice; but all that is consistent with the object of
                    this notice of his life is merely to subjoin a list of the more important. They
                    may be divided into three classes, according as they relate to the physical
                    sciences and mathematics, languages and hieroglyphics, history and antiquities,
                    not to mention some smaller productions of an ascetic character, which cannot be
                    included under any of these heads. And they are as follow, viz. 1. Ars
