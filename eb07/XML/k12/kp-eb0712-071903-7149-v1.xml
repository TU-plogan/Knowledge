                <p><label type="entry">KILMARNOCK</label>, a town in Ayrshire, which is said to
                    derive its name, from the circumstance of St Marπock having suffered martyrdom
                    there, about 350 years after Christ. It is pleasantly situated upon an almost
                    levei plain, surrounded by very beautiful scenery. Of its early history little
                    is known, and neither in a warlike nor a monastic point of view is it at all
                    conspicuous. Two centuries ago Kilmarnock was a mere hamlet, dependent upon the
                    baronial castle in its neighbourhood; and, forty years ago, it consisted chiefly
                    of a number of narrow passages and lanes. Since that period, however, it has
                    been greatly enlarged and improved, elegant and even spacious streets having
                    supplanted the more confined avenues. It is now well lighted with gas, possesses
                    a somewhat modern appearance, and promises to become one of the first
                    manufacturing towns in Scotland.</p>
                <p>Kilmarnock received its first charter as a burgh of barony in 1591, a second in
                    1672; and in 1760 its magistrates purchased from its feudal lord the whole <hi
                    rend="italic">common good</hi> and customs of the burgh. For many years the town
                    was distinguished for the manufacture of those broad, flat bonnets, which were
                    so long the characteristic of the lowland peasantry of Scotland. In the year
                    1790, the produce of its whole manufacture amounted only to L.86,000. However,
                    since the above date, it has made rapid advances in many branches of
                    manufactures, and is now the principal town in Ayrshire for population, wealth,
                    and appearance. There are about 1200 weavers, and 200 printers engaged in the
                    printing of worsted shaw ls; and from 1st June lö30 to 1st June 1831 there were
                    manufactured 1,128,000 of these shawls, the value of which is about L.200,000.
                    At present there are 1000 persons engaged in the production of Scottish,
                    Venetian, and Brussels carpets: the annual amount of this important branch may
                    be about L.100,000. The annual value of the boots and shoes manufactured is
                    L.42,000, of the bonnets L. 12,000. The number of sheep and lamb skins dressed
                    annually exceeds 140,000. There are many other branches of manufactures carried
                    on very extensively. It unites with Dumbarton, Rutherglen, Renfrew, and Port
                    Glasgowin returning a member to parliament, Kilmarnock being the returning
