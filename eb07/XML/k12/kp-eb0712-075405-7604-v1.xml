                <p><label type="entry">KOEMPFER, <hi rend="smallcaps">Engelbert</hi></label>, was
                    born in 1651 at Lemgow, in Westphalia. After studying in several towns, he went
                    to Dantzig, where he gave the first public specimen of his proficiency, in a
                    dissertation <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Majestatis
                    Divisione.</hi> He then w <hi rend="superscript"> z</hi> ent to Thorn, and
                    thence proceeded to the university of Cracow, where he took his degree of doctor
                    in philosophy; after which he went to Königsberg in Prussia, and staid there
                    four years. He next travelled into Sweden, where he soon began to make a figure,
                    and was appointed secretary of the embassy to the sophi of Persia. He set out
                    from Stockholm with the presents for that emperor, and went through Aaland,
                    Finland, and Ingermanland, to Narva, where he met Mr Fabricius the ambassador,
                    who had been ordered to take Moscow in his way. The ambassador having ended his
                    negotiations at the Russian court, set out for Persia. During their stay two
                    years at Ispahan, Dr Koempfer, whose curious and inquisitive disposition
                    suffered nothing to escape him unobserved, took all the advantage possible of
                    remaining so long in the capital of the Persian empire. When, towards the close
                    of 1685, the ambassador prepared to return into Europe, Dr Koempfer chose rather
                    to enter into the service of the Dutch East India Company, in quality of chief
                    surgeon to the fleet, then cruising in the Persian Gulf. Fie w ent on board the
                    fleet, which, after touching at many Dutch settlements, reached Batavia in
                    September 1689. Dr Koempfer here applied himself chiefly to natural history.
