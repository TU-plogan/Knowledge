                <p><label type="entry">HALICARNASSUS</label>, a city of Caria, on the coast of Asia
                    Minor, opposite to the island of Cos, founded by a colony of Troezenians
                    (Strab.), who were joined by a party of Argeians under the command of Melas and
                    Ar-vanias (Vitruv, ii. 8). We are told by Herodotus (i. 144), that it originally
                    belonged to the Dorian confederacy, which consisted of six cities, and that it
                    lost this privilege because Agasicles, one of its citizens, carried off the
                    tripod, which had been adjudged to him in the games in honour of the Triopian
                    Apollo, instead of dedicating it to the god, as had always been the custom. The
                    other cities, indignant at this breach of the law, met and declared
                    Halicarnassus unworthy of participating in their privileges; <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193640564?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-0564-0113"/> and from that
                    time the Dorian confederacy consisted of five cities, and was called Pentapolis.
                    We have no means of discovering at what period this event took place; but about
                    the year 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> we find it subject to Lygdamis,
                    whose daughter, Artemisia, commanded a squadron of ships in the fleet of Xerxes,
                    and behaved so nobly in the battle of Salamis, 480 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> (Herod, viii. 87.) It was probably during the reign of her son, called
                    Lygdamis, that Herodotus, unwilling to witness the tyrannical acts of a despot,
                    abandoned his native city and retired to Samos. (Suid.) A considerable period
                    now elapses, in which we know nothing of the history of Halicarnassus; but about
                    350 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> we find it under princes of Carian
                    extraction. Hecatom-nus is mentioned by Strabo (xiv. 656) as king of the
                    Carians; and he left three sons, Mausolus, Hidrieus, and Pixodarus, and two
                    daughters, Artemisia and Ada, who were married to the two elder brothers. On the
                    death of Mausolus, his wife and sister became queen, and is best known in
                    history as the builder of that celebrated tomb to her husband, which she called
                    from him mausoleum, (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Mausoleum),</hi> and which was
                    reckoned one of the seven wonders of the world. She was succeeded by her second
                    brother Hidrieus, whose sister and wife, Ada, was driven from the kingdom by her
                    brother Pixodarus. Atthis period Alexander the Great arrived with his forces in
                    Caria, and having razed Halicarnassus to the ground, restored Ada to the
                    sovereignty of Caria. It seems to have been rebuilt, but never regained its
                    former degree of splendour. Cicero speaks of his brother restoring Halicarnassus
                    (ad Q. Fr. i. 8), and Tacitus (Ann. iv. 55) tells us that the people of this
                    place were anxious to erect a temple to Tiberius. It was the birthplace of
                    Herodotus, and of Dionysius, author of the Roman Antiquities. Its ruins are
                    still found at Bondroun, and are thus described by Captain Beaufort :—“The spot
                    where Halicarnassus was placed rises gently from a deep bay, and commands a view
                    of the island of Cos and the southern shore of the Ceramic Gulf as far as Cape
                    <hi rend="italic">Krio.</hi> In front of the town a broad square rock projects
                    into the bay, on which stands the citadel. The walls of the ancient city may be
                    here and there discerned; and several fragments of columns, mutilated sculpture,
                    and broken inscriptions, are scattered in different parts of the bazaar and
                    streets. Above the town are the remains of a theatre." <hi rend="italic"
