                    Christian</hi></label>, lord of Zeeł-hem, was the second sou of Constantine
                    Huygens, secretary and counsellor to the princes of Orange, and born at the
                    Flague on the 14th of April 1629. He was one of those rare men who, from the
                    most subtile theories, know how to deduce the most useful applications, and
                    wjιoιn admirable inventions in the arts, as well as the sciences, place on the
                    same level with the Archimedeses and the Newtons. His family, originally from
                    Brabant, was rich and respected; and the important post which his father held
                    under three successive princes of Orange had been filled by his grandfather, as
                    it subsequently was by his elder brother Constantine, who in this capacity
                    attended King William in the celebrated expedition to England, which <pb

                    issued in the Revolution of 1688. His father, a distinguished man of letters,
                    whose poetical compositions had attained much celebrity, was not slow in
                    remarking the happy qualities of his genius, and, full of paternal solicitude
                    for his improvement, became his first instructor. He early taught his son music,
                    arithmetic, and geography; and, about the age of thirteen, initiated him in the
                    knowledge of mechanics, for which young Huygens showed a surprising aptitude. At
                    fifteen he received the assistance of a master in the mathematics, a geometer of
                    Amsterdam named Stampioen, of whom Descartes has left an unfavourable
                    impression, but who in a short time enabled his pupil to make great progress. At
                    the age of sixteen he was sent to Leyden to study law under the learned
                    jurisconsult Vinnius, who dedicated to him his Commentary on the Institutions;
                    but he did not permit jurisprudence to divert him from his mathematical studies,
                    which he prosecuted at this place, as well as afterwards at Breda, where an
                    university had been erected, and where, being placed under the direction of his
                    father, he resided from 1646 to 1648. In these two cities he had as masters two
                    very able geometers, Francis Schooten and John Pell; and his first essays were
                    so successful that they attracted the notice of Descartes, to whom the author
                    had communicated them. The genius of this great man divined instinctively that
                    of Huygens. “It is some time,” said he, in a letter written at this period,
                    “since Professor Schoo-tcn sent me a writing by the second son of Μ. de
                    Zuylichem touching a mathematical invention which he had attempted to make; and
                    although he has not yet found his account in the pursuit (which is not
                    wonderful, seeing he sought a thing which no one has ever been able to find),
                    yet he has taken such a bias towards geometry, that I feel assured he will
                    become excellent in that science, of which I scarcely see any one who knows
                    anything.” On his part, the young geometer was filled with admiration of the
                    great philosopher; and he wrote to Father Mersenne that, for ages, no one
                    comparable to him had appeared. Nevertheless, Huygens had not the good fortune
                    to see him. Descartes had quitted Holland, and when, in 1649, Huygens, having
                    left the university, travelled with Henry Count de Nassau, he regretted much not
                    having it in his power to pass from Denmark to Sweden, whither Descartes had
                    repaired, out of complaisance to the imperious Christina. After this tour, he
                    settled in his native country; and it was then that he commenced that series of
                    inventions which have rendered his name so justly celebrated. In 1651 he
                    published at Leyden his <hi rend="italic">Theoremata</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">quadratura</hi><hi rend="italic">Hyperboles,
                    Ellipsis,</hi><hi rend="italic">et Circuli,</hi><hi rend="italic">ex</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">dato portionum gravitatis centro;</hi> a work which afforded a
                    favourable specimen of his genius for mathematics, and gave promise of still
                    greater excellence. In 1655 he travelled into France, and took the degree of
                    doctor of laws at Angers. In 1658 he published at the Hague his <hi
                    rend="italic">Horologium osciïlatorium,</hi><hi rend="italic">sive</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de</hi><hi rend="italic">motu pendulorum-</hi> In a preceding
                    work, entitled <hi rend="italic">Brevis</hi><hi rend="italic">Institutio</hi><hi

                    he had exhibited a model of a newly-invented <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi>
                    pendulum; but as some persons, envious of his reputation, laboured to deprive
                    him of the honour of the invention, he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Horologium
                    osciilatorium</hi> to explain the construction of his pendulum, and to show that
                    it differed from the astronomical pendulum invented by Galileo. In 1659 he
                    published his <hi rend="italic">Systema Saturninum, sive</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >de</hi><hi rend="italic">causis mirandorum Saturni</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >phenomenon,</hi><hi rend="italic">et comite ejus planeta novo.</hi> Galileo had
                    endeavoured to explain some of the appearances exhibited by the planet Saturn;
                    he had at first perceived two attendant stars, but some time afterwards was
                    surprised to find that they had disappeared. Huygens, desirous to account for
                    these changes, laboured with his brother Constantine to improve the construction
                    of telescopes; and having at length made an instrument of this kind, possessing
                    greater power than any which had yet been contrived, he proceeded to observe the
                    phases of Saturn, and to record all the different aspects of that planet. The
                    results were of equal interest and importance to the science of astronomy. He
                    discovered a satellite of that planet, which had hitherto escaped the notice of
                    astronomers; and, after a long course of observation, he showed that the planet
                    is surrounded with a solid and permanent ring, which never changes its
                    situation. In 1660, he took a second journey into France, and the year following
                    he visited England, where he communicated the art of polishing glasses for
                    telescopes, and was admitted as a member of the Royal Society. The air-pump,
                    then recently invented, he materially improved; and about the same time he also
                    discovered the laws of the collision of elastic bodies, as did afterwards our
                    own countrymen, Wallis and Wren, who disputed with him the honour of the
                    discovery. After a stay of some months in England, Huygens returned to France,
                    where, in 1663, his merit became so conspicuous, that Colbert resolved to bestow
                    on him such a pension as might induce him to establish hitnself at Paris. But
                    this resolution was not carried into effect until 1665, when letters written in
                    the king’s name were forwarded to the Hague, where he then resided, inviting him
                    to repair to Paris, and offering him a considerable pension, with other
                    advantages. Huygens accepted the proposal of the French minister, and, from 1666
                    to 1681 resided at Paris, where he was admitted as a member of the Royal Academy
                    of Sciences. During this period he was occupied with mathematical pursuits; he
                    wrote and published several works, which were most favourably received; and he
                    invented and perfected some useful instruments and machines. But, by continued
                    application, his health began to be impaired; and although he had twice had
                    recourse to his native air, and on both occasions derived benefit from the
                    change, the improvement was only temporary, and he at length found it necessary
                    to quit France and return to his own country. It is not improbable that his
                    departure was accelerated by the revocation of the edict of Nantes; for although
                    he had received an assurance that he would be permitted to enjoy the same
                    liberty as before, without being molested on account of his opinions, he had but
                    little encouragement to remain in a country where his religion was proscribed,
                    and those who professed it subjected to the most cruel persecution. He
                    accordingly left Paris in 1681; passed the remainder of his life in his own
                    country, occupied with his usual pursuits; and died at the Hague on the 8th of
                    June 1693, in the sixty-seventh year of his age, whilst his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Cosmoťheoros,</hi> a treatise on the plurality of worlds, was passing through
                    the press. The <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Varia</hi> of
                    Huygens were published in 1700, 4to, and his <hi rend="italic">Opuscula
                    Posthuma</hi> appeared soon afterwards, Leyden, 1703, in 4to. The former
                    collection, which is generally bound in four volumes, contains the greater
                    number of the pieces which he published separately, and is divided into four
                    parts; the first comprising the pieces relating to mechanics; the second, those
                    relating to geometry; the third, those relating to astronomy; and the fourth,
                    miscellaneous productions, which could not be arranged under any of the
                    preceding heads. ’ sGravesande had the care of this edition, in which he
                    inserted various additions to the different pieces extracted from the
                    manuscripts of Huygens. The same individual also superintended the publication
                    of his <hi rend="italic">Opera</hi><hi rend="italic">Reliqua,</hi> which
                    appeared at Amsterdam in 1728, in two vols. 4to, and contain, 1. his Treatises
                    on Light and Gravity; and, 2. his <hi rend="italic">Opuscula Posthuma,</hi>
                    originally printed in 1703. For a masterly account of the genius and labours of
                    Huygens, the reader may consult the Dissertations by Professors Playfair and Sir
                    John Leslie, prefixed to this work. This illustrious man gave his whole time to
                    science; he loved a <pb break="no" facs="nls:193649053?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9053-0766"/> quiet studious life, and found sufficient
                    enjoyment in pursuing curious and useful researches. He was modest, amiable,
                    cheerful, and in all respects as estimable in private life as he was eminent in
                    science. It is not a little singular, that the discovery of the real nature, or
                    at least of the true figure, of the luminous belt or ring which encompasses the
                    planet Saturn should have been made by the same individual who invented the
                    pendulum clock and the micrometer. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
