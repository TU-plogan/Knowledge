                    Bengal, formerly called Saatgong, situated principally between the 21st and 22d
                    degrees of north latitude, and extending a considerable distance along both
                    sides of the river Hooghly. It is bounded on the north by the districts of
                    Burdwan and Kishenagur, on the south by the sea, on the east by Jessore and the
                    Sunderbunds, and on the west by Midnapoor. This district consists of low flat
                    land, very fertile; but that part which is nearest to the sea is very thinly
                    inhabited; it is called the Sunderbund, is swampy, covered with wood, and
                    remarkably unhealthy. It is intersected in every direction by rivers and their
                    branches, which afford great facilities for internal navigation; but these
                    waters are unfortunately infested by gang-robbers or river pirates, who are a
                    most ferocious banditti, robbing in gangs, and often using torture to extort
                    from their victims the disclosure of their hidden treasures. Along the shores of
                    the ocean salt of an excellent quality is manufactured on account of the
                    government. Although this district is so near Calcutta, which affords a ready
                    and constant market for its produce, the greater part of the country lies in a
                    completely desert state, infested by alligators, tigers, and a countless variety
                    of vermin and reptiles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hooghly,</hi> an ancient and formerly a large town in the
                    province of Bengal, situated on the western bank of the Hooghly, nearly
                    twenty-six miles above Calcutta, and supposed to have been founded by the
                    Portuguese about the year 1538. During the Mogul government, it was a town of
                    great consequence, being the port of the western arm of the Ganges, where the
                    duties on merchandise are collected. It very soon drew away all the trade from
                    Saatgong, which had been before the government port of Bengal. During the
                    prevalence of the Portuguese dominion in India, Hooghly was fortified, and
                    continued to flourish till the year 1632, when it was attacked by order of the
                    emperor Shah Jehan, and, after a siege of three months and a half, was taken by
                    the Mogul troops, a thousand of the Portuguese being killed, and four thousand
                    four hundred men, women, and children taken prisoners. From this period Hooghly
                    became the imperial port. All the officers of the government were ordered to
                    remove thither, and it was placed under the jurisdiction of a special governor.
                    In the year 1642, the English, and soon afterwards the Dutch, obtained the
                    permission of the native government to erect factories. After this period, every
                    encouragement was given to commerce; and Hooghly, which was called Bukh-shy
                    Bunder, became a great commercial emporium between Europe, Persia, Arabia, and
                    India. In 1686 hostilities commenced between the English and the nabob. An
                    action <pb break="no" facs="nls:193646297?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-6297-0554"/> ensued, in which the nabob’s troops were
                    defeated; and at the same time the town of Hooghly was cannonaded, and five
                    hundred houses burned. The result, however, was a disgraceful peace; an amicable
                    arrangement was made by the military superintendent of the district. But in
                    consequence of Calcutta being an open town, the agent and council retired to
                    that place. Long. 88. 28. E. Lat. 22.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Hooghly</hi><hi rend="italic">River,</hi> properly the
                    Bhagirutty, a river of Bengal, formed by the junction of the two westernmost
                    branches of the Ganges, the Cossimbazar, and the Jellinghy. This is thθ port of
                    Calcutta, being the only branch of the Ganges that is navigated by large
                    vessels; yet the entrance to the river is rendered extremely dangerous and
                    difficult, by reason of numerous sand banks in it, which are frequently
                    shifting. The shoals are very numerous where the Ganges is joined by the
                    Roopmarain; and as this river directly faces the approach from the sea, whilst
                    Hooghly turns to the right, it occasions the loss of many vessels, which are
                    carried up the Roopmarain by the force of the tide. The spring-tides run up with
                    great violence, advancing at the rate of fifteen miles an hour. This is what is
                    called by the Europeans the Bore, which commences at Hooghly Point, where the
                    river first contracts itself, and is perceptible above Hooghly town; and though
                    the distance is above seventy miles, it traverses this space in about four
                    hours, running along the opposite bank to the Calcutta side, whence it crosses
                    at Chitpoor, about four miles above Fort William, and rushes with great violence
                    past Barna-gore, Duckinsore, &amp;c., frequently oversetting boats and driving
                    ships from their anchorage. At Calcutta it sometimes occasions an instantaneous
                    rise of five feet. The tide does not rise more than thirty miles above Calcutta;
                    and during the rainy season its influence is checked by the large body of water
                    that comes down the river. The Hooghly contains several kinds of good fish,
                    particularly the cockup, sable mangoe fish, and prawns; and it abounds also in
                    crocodiles and sharks. It is about three quarters of a mile broad at Calcutta,
                    and eight or ten miles wide at the mouth. It is only navigable for ships as high
                    as the tide reaches, and the upper part of it is nearly dry during the hot
                    season; yet there are few rivers that can boast of a more extensive commerce,
                    all the towns belonging to European nations, and several others by the natives,
                    standing on its banks. It is esteemed to be the most sacred branch of the Ganges
                    by the Hindus, and it is on this account that those who cannot afford to bury
                    their dead throw them into the Hooghly.</p>
