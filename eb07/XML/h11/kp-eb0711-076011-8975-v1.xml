                <p><label type="entry">HUSKISSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Right Honourable
                    William</hi></label>, a distinguished statesman, was born at Birch Moreton, in
                    Worcestershire, ou the 11th of March 1770. After receiving a liberal education,
                    he was sent to Paris for instruction in physic, the profession to which he was
                    originally destined. Whilst in the French capital, however, circumstances
                    occurred which induced him entirely to alter his course of life. On the breaking
                    out of the French revolution, he espoused the popular side, and became an active
                    member of the London Corresponding Society, but not, as has been sometimes
                    asserted, of the Jacobin Club of Paris. Through the influence of a friend he was
                    introduced to Lord Gower, then British ambassador at Paris, and was afterwards
                    appointed his private secretary. On his return to England, the talents of Mr
                    Huskisson attracted the attention of Mr Pitt and Mr Dundas, and in 1795 he was
                    appointed chief clerk in the office of the latter, at that time <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193648988?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-8988-0761"/> secretary of
                    state for the war department. In the following year he succeeded to the office
                    of under secretary; and being found a valuable man of business, he was brought
                    into parliament for the borough of Morpeth. In his subordinate connection with
                    the ministry, Mr Huskisson shared the varying fortunes of those in power,
                    retiring from office and returning to it with his superiors. During the early
                    part of his parliamentary career he did not speak much, but he was exceedingly
                    useful to the ministry in matters of business, particularly of a financial
                    nature. On the return of Mr Pitt to power in 1804, he was appointed one of the
                    joint secretaries to the treasury. During Mr Fox’s short administration he was
                    in opposition, but he returned with Mr Percival, and resumed his secretaryship.
                    As a politician Mr Huskisson belonged to that party of which Mr Canning was the
                    head, and which first assumed a distinct character in 1809, when the latter
                    statesman proclaimed his difference from Lord Castlereagh, and left the
                    ministry. Mr Huskisson retired along with him, and continued to follow in that
                    middle course which Mr Canning pursued, voting with ministers upon questions of
                    general policy both foreign and domestic, but contending, with the opposition,
                    for the necessity of retrenchment in the public expenditure. Being placed on the
                    celebrated Bullion Committee, Mr Huskisson published an able pamphlet on the
                    subject, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Question concerning the Depreciation of
                    our Currency stated and examined.</hi> In this tract Mr Huskisson defended the
                    principles embodied in the report of the committee, and showed the necessity of
                    the bank resuming cash payments. He afterwards took a prominent part in various
                    debates on finance, in all of which he was listened to by the house with the
                    greatest attention. In 1812 he obtained the lucrative situation of colonial
                    agent for Ceylon; and in 1814 he was sworn a privy councillor, and appointed the
                    first commissioner of woods and forests. His subsequent efforts in parliament
                    were characterized by that middle course of policy which he had hitherto
                    followed. On Mr Canning’s appointment as secretary of state in 1822, and his
                    declining to be re-elected for Liverpool, Mr Huskisson was chosen as his
                    successor. In the following year he was appointed treasurer <hi rend="italic"
                    >of</hi> the navy, and afterwards president of the board of trade. The part
                    which Mr Huskisson took in the great questions brought before parliament from
                    the year 1820 till the close of his life, will be found fully detailed in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Britain.</hi> In the ministry of Lord Goderich he
                    became secretary for the colonies, which post he retained under that of the Duke
                    of Wellington; but having voted against government on a question of importance,
                    he placed his office at the duke’s disposal, and his resignation was accepted.
                    His death took place on the 15th of September 1830. Being present at the opening
                    of the Liverpool and Manchester railway, he came inadvertently in the line of
                    one of the carriages, moving at a rapid rate, and the vehicle having passed over
                    one of his legs, lacerated it in such a dreadful manner that he died soon after.
                    The speeches of Mr Huskisson are characterized by little of that which in
                    ordinary language is called eloquence. They are distinguished for clear,
                    distinct statement, lucid arrangement, close adherence to the matter in hand,
                    continuous reasoning, and a thorough knowledge of the subject discussed, in all
                    its bearings and details. The strength of his oratory lay in the soundness and
                    comprehensiveness of his views, particularly in all questions of political
                    economy and commercial legislation. On such subjects he rose far above the
                    majority of his parliamentary contemporaries, both in the extent of his
                    information, and in the scientific character of his reasoning. He was, indeed,
                    one of the few practical statesmen who could deal alike with matters of detail
                    and the principles of the science by which they are illustrated. No debater ever
                    came better prepared with facts and details bearing directly upon his subject,
                    of which he always made himself completely master. His speeches are therefore
                    exceedingly instructive, as well for their facts as for their reasonings. A
                    collection of them was published in 1831, in three vols. 8vo. <hi
