                    successively bishop of Bangor, Hereford, Salisbury, and Winchester, was born in
                    the year 1676. His first preferment in the church was to the rectory of St
                    Peter-le-Poor, and the lectureship of St Mildred’s in the Poultry. In the year
                    1706 he published some remarks on Bishop Atterbury’s sermon at the funeral of Mr
                    Bennet, in which Dr Atterbury had, in the opinion of Mr Hoadly, laid down some
                    dangerous propositions. Two years afterwards Mr Hoadly again entered the lists
                    against this formidable antagonist; and in his exceptions against a sermon
                    published by Dr Atterbury, entitled The Power of Charity to cover Sin, he
                    attacked the doctor with his usual strength of reasoning and dispassionate
                    inquiry. In 1709 another dispute arose between these two learned combatants
                    concerning the doctrine of non-resistance, occasioned by a performance of Mr
                    Hoadly’s, entitled the Measures of Obedience; some positions in which Dr
                    Atterbury endeavoured to confute in an elegant Latin sermon which he preached
                    that year before the London clergy. In this debate Mr Hoadly signalised himself
                    in so eminent a degree, that the House of Commons conferred on him a particular
                    mark of respect, by representing, in an address to the queen, the signal
                    services he had done to the cause of civil and religious liberty. The principles
                    which he espoused, however, being repugnant to the general temper <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> those times, drew on him the virulence of a party; yet it
                    was at this period, 1710, when, as he himself expressed it, fury seemed to be
                    let loose upon him, that Mrs Howland presented him to the rectory öf Streatham
                    in Surrey, unasked, unapplied to, and without his ever having seen his
                    benefactress. Soon after the accession of King George I. Mr Hoadly was
                    consecrated to the see of Bangor; and, in 1717, having broached some opinions
                    concerning the nature of Christ’s kingdom, he again became the object of popular
                    clamour. At this juncture he was distinguished by a particular mark of the royal
                    regard, inasmuch as the convocation was successively prorogued, nor was it
                    permitted to sit, or to do any business, until that resentment had entirely
                    subsided. In 1721 he was translated to Hereford; and from thence, in 1723, to
                    Salisbury. In 1734 he was, on the demise of Dr Willis, translated to Winchester,
                    and published his Plain Account of the Sacrament; a performance which served as
                    a butt for his adversaries to shoot their arrows at, yet impartiality must own
                    it to be clear, rational, and manly, written with candour and judgment, and
                    suited to the capacity of every serious and considerate inquirer after truth.
                    His latter days were embittered by an instance of fraud and ingratitude. The
                    bishop took under his protection a French priest, who pretended to abjure his
                    religion, and who had no other recommendation than that of his necessities. In
                    return for this act of humanity, the priest found an opportunity of getting the
                    bishop’s name written by his own hand, and, causing a note of some thousand
                    pounds to be placed before it, offered it in payment. But the bishop denying it
                    to be his, it was brought before a court of justice, and was there found to be a
                    gross imposition. The ungrateful villain had now recourse to a pamphlet, in
                    which he charged the bishop with being a drunkard; and alleged that he had
                    received the note from him when he was in liquor. To this calumny the bishop
                    made a full and nervous answer, in which he exposed the man’s falsehood, and
                    solemnly averred that he was never drunk in his whole life. The world with
                    becoming ardour embraced his defence, and he had the happiness to find himself
                    perfectly acquitted even of any suspicion of such a charge. As a writer, he
                    possessed uncommon abilities. But his style was defective and cumbrous, owing to
                    the extreme length of his periods. His sermons, published in 1754 and 1755, are
                    esteemed inferior to few writings in the English language, for plainness and
                    perspicuity, energy and strength of reasoning, and a free and masterly manner.
                    In private life he was naturally facetious, easy, and complying; and, though
                    fond of company, accustomed frequently to retire for the purposes of study or
                    devotion. He was everywhere happy, <pb break="no"

                    particularly in his own family, where he took all opportunities of instructing
                    by his influence and example. Bishop Hoadly died in 1761, aged eighty-three.
                    Besides the works already mentioned, he wrote, 1. Terms of Acceptance, 8vo; 2.
                    Reasonableness of Conformity; and 3. On the Sacrament. His tracts and pamphlets
                    are extremely numerous. A complete edition of his works, in three volumes folio,
                    was published by his son Dr John Hoadly, in 1773, with a short life of the
                    author prefixed. The appendix to this edition contains some portion of his
                    correspondence with Lady Sundon, formerly Mrs Clayton, bed-chamber woman to
                    Queen Anne, and a person to whom he appears to have been chiefly indebted for
                    his influence at court.</p>

                    in physic; and having, when young, applied himself to mathematical and
                    philosophical studies, he was admitted a member of the Royal Society. He was
                    made registrar of Hereford whilst his father filled that see, appointed
                    physician to his majesty’s household, and died at his house in Chelsea in 1757.
