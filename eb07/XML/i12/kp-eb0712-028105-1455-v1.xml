                    others of extraordinary note, and of the same signification with the French word

                    Court</hi> are so called, according to some, because the students there are to
                    serve and attend the courts of judicature; or because these colleges anciently
                    received none but the sons of noblemen, and the better sort of gentlemen, who,
                    as Fortescue affirms, were to be there qualified to serve the king in his court.
                    In the time of Fortescue, there were about two thousand students in the inns of
                    court and chancery, all of whom were <hi rend="italic">filii</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">nobilium,</hi> or gentlemen born. But this custom gradually fell
                    into disuse; so that in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, Sir Edward Coke does not
                    reckon above one thousand students, and the number at present is very
                    considerably less. For this Judge Blackstone assigns the following reasons: 1.
                    Because the inns of chancery, being now almost totally filled by the inferior
                    branches of the profession, are neither commodious nor proper for the resort of
                    gentlemen of any rank or figure; so that there arc very rarely any young
                    students <pb break="no" facs="nls:192941468?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0712-1468-0282"/> entered at the inns of chancery. 2. Because in
                    the inns of court all sorts of regimen and academical superintendence, either
                    with regard to morals or studies, have been found impracticable, and therefore
                    entirely neglected. 3. Because persons of birth and fortune, after having
                    finished their usual courses at the universities, have seldom leisure or
                    resolution sufficient to enter upon a new scheme of study at a new place of
                    instruction; wherefore few gentlemen now resort to the inns of court, except
                    those for whom the knowledge of practice is absolutely necessary in such as are
                    intended for the profession.</p>
                <p>Our inns of court, justly famed for the production of men of learning in the law,
                    are governed by masters, principals, benchers, stewards, and other officers; and
                    they have public halls for exercises, readings, and the like, which the students
                    are obliged to attend for a certain number of years, before they can be admitted
                    to plead at the bar. These societies have not, however, any judicial authority
                    over their members; but instead of this there exist among themselves certain
                    orders or regulations, which have by consent the force of laws. For lighter
                    offences persons are only excommoned, or put out of commons; for greater, they
                    lose their chambers, and are expelled the college; and when once expelled out of
                    one society, they are never received by any of the others. The gentlemen in
                    these societies maybe divided into benchers, outer-barristers, inner-barristers,
                    and students.</p>
                <p>The four principal inns of court are, the Inner Temple and Middle Temple,
                    formerly the dwelling of the Knights Templars; and Lincoln’s Inn and Gray’s Inn,
                    which anciently belonged to the Earls of Lincoln and Gray. The other inns are
                    the two Serjeants’ Inns.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Inns</hi><hi rend="italic">of Chancery</hi> were probably so
                    called, because anciently inhabited by such clerks as chiefly studied the
                    forming of writs, which regularly belonged to the cursitors, who are of
                    chancery.</p>
                <p>The first of these is Thavies Inn, begun in the reign of Edward IH., and
                    afterwards purchased by the society of Lincoln’s Inn. Besides this, there are
                    New Inn, Symond’s Inn, Clement’s Inn, Clifford’s Inn, Staple Inn, belonging to
                    the merchants of the staple; Lion’s Inn, anciently a common inn with the sign of
                    the lion; Furnivaľs Inn, and Bernard’s Inn.</p>
                <p>Heretofore these were preparatory colleges for younger students; and many were
                    entered there, before they were admitted into the inns of court. Now they are
                    mostly occupied by attorneys, solicitors, and others. They all belong to one or
                    other of the inns of court, who formerly used to send yearly some of their
                    barristers to read to them.</p>
