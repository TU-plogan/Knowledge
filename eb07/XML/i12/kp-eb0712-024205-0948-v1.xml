                <p><label type="entry">IDIOCY</label>, a defect of understanding. Both idiocy and
                    lunacy excuse from the guilt of crimes. For the rule of law as to lunatics,
                    which may also be easily adapted to idiots, is, that <hi rend="italic"
                    >furiosus</hi><hi rend="italic">furore solum</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >punitur..</hi> In criminal cases, therefore, idiots and lunatics are not
                    chargeable for their own acts, if committed when under these incapacities; not
                    even for treason itself. Also, if a man in his sound memory commits a capital
                    offence, and before arraignment becomes mad, he ought not to be arraigned for
                    it; because he is not able to plead to the charge with that advice and caution
                    that he ought. And if, after he has pleaded, the prisoner becomes mad, he shall
                    not be tried; for how can he make his defence? If, after he be tried and found
                    guilty, he loses his senses before judgment, judgment shall not be pronounced;
                    and if, after judgment, he becomes of unsound merno^ry, execution shall be
                    stayed; for peradventure, says the humanity of the English law, had the prisoner
                    been of sound memory, he might have alleged something in stay ofjudgment or
                    execution. But if there be any doubt whether the party be <hi rend="italic"
                    >compos</hi> or not, this shall be tried by a jury; and if he be found <hi
                    rend="italic">non compos,</hi> a total idiocy, or absolute insanity, excuses
                    from the guilt, and of course from the punishment, of any criminal action
                    committed under such deprivation of the senses; but if a lunatic has lucid
                    intervals of understanding, he shall answer for what he does in those intervals,
                    as if he had no deficiency. It was the doctrine of the ancient English law, that
                    persons deprived of their reason might be confined till they recovered their
                    senses, without waiting for the forms of a commission or other special authority
                    from the crown; but now a method is chalked out for imprisoning and sending them
                    to their proper homes.</p>
                <p>The matrimonial contract, likewise, cannot take place in a state of idiocy. It
                    was formerly adjudged, that the issue of an idiot was legitimate, and his
                    marriage valid. But since consent is absolutely requisite to matrimony, and
                    neither idiots nor lunatics are capable of consenting to any thing, therefore
                    the civil law judged much more sensibly when it made such deprivations of reason
                    a previous impediment, though not a cause of divorce if they happened after
                    marriage. Modern resolutions have adhered to the sense of the civil law, by
                    determining that the marriage of a lunatic, not being in a lucid interval, was
                    absolutely void. But as it might be difficult to prove the exact state of the
                    party’s mind at the actual celebration of the nuptials, the statute 15 Geo. II.
                    c. 30, has provided, that the marriage of lunatics and persons under phrensies
                    (if found lunatics under a commission, or committed to the care of trustees
                    under any act of parliament), before they are declared of sound mind by the lord
                    chancellor, or the majority of such trustees, shall be totally void.</p>
                <p>Idiots and persons of unsound memory, as well as infants and persons under
                    duress, are not totally disabled either to convey or purchase, but <hi
                    rend="italic">sub</hi><hi rend="italic">modo</hi> only; for their conveyances
                    and purchases are voidable, but not actually void. The king, indeed, on behalf
                    of an idiot, may avoid his grants or other acts. But it has been said, that a
                    <hi rend="italic">non compos</hi> himself, though he be afterwards brought to a
                    right mind, shall not be permitted to allege his own insanity in order to avoid
                    such grant; because no man shall be allowed to stultify himself, or plead his
                    own disability. The maxim that a man shall not stultify himself, has in fact
                    been handed down as settled law; though later opinions, feeling the
                    inconvenience of the rule, have in many points endeavoured to restrain it. The
                    next heir, or other person interested, may clearly, after the death of the idiot
                    or <hi rend="italic">non compos,</hi> take advantage of his incapacity, and
                    avoid the grant; and so, too, if he purchases under this disability, and does
                    not afterwards upon recovering his senses agree to the purchase, his heir may
                    either waive or accept the estate at his option. In like manner, an infant may
                    waive such purchase or conveyance when he comes to full age; or, if he does not
                    then actually agree to it, his heir ∙. may waive it after him. By the statute 11
                    Gco. HI. c. 20, the guardians or committees of a lunatic are empowered to renew
                    in his right, under the directions of the Court of Chancery, any lease for lives
                    or years, and apply the profits of such renewal for the benefit of such lunatic,
                    his heirs, or executors.</p>
                <p>In the law of Scotland, an idiot, or fatuous person, is one entirely deprived of
                    the faculty of reason, having an uniform stupidity and inattention in his
                    manner, and a childishness in his speech, which distinguish him from other men.
                    This state is ascertained by the judgment of a jury, on a brieve directed to the
                    judge-ordinary of the bounds within which the person resides, and containing <pb
                    break="no" facs="nls:192940961?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0712-0961-0243"/> two
                    heads of inquest; one relating to the state of the person, and the other having
                    for its object to ascertain who is the nearest male agnate of twenty-five years
                    of age. The brieves for cognoscing furious persons are nearly similar, differing
                    only in the description of the circumstances into which the jury are to inquire.
                    As a state of idiocy disqualifies the person for entering into transactions, a
                    proof, even after his death, that the granter of a deed was an idiot at the time
                    of granting it will be sufficient for reducing that deed; and, according to
                    Bankton, restitution on the ground of idiocy is competent to idiots against
                    their curators within four years after their convalescence, in the same way as
                    it is competent to minors.</p>
