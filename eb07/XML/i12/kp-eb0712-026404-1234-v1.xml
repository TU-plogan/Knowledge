                <p><label type="entry">INDIA</label>. The general name of India has always had a
                    very wide and rather indefinite application, both in ancient and modern times.
                    It has been generally used to designate all those vast regions of the Asiatic
                    continent which lie to the eastward of the Indus, which were accordingly
                    distinguished by the ancients into two great divisions, namely, <hi
                    rend="italic">India intra</hi><hi rend="italic">Gangem,</hi> and <hi
                    rend="italic">India extra</hi><hi rend="italic">Gangem.</hi> The meaning of the
                    name, which has long been a source of perplexity to the learned, has never been
                    clearly ascertained. It is supposed to be of ‘Persian origin, from the word
                    Hind, or Heando, the term in the more ancient languages of Persia, which has
                    been employed by the Greeks and Romans, and from them made its way into the
                    modern languages of Europe. The progress of ancient discovery in India has been
                    already narrated in our account both of Asia and Hindustan. Prior to the
                    expedition of Alexander, all the knowledge which the Greeks possessed of India
                    was derived from the report of the Persians. The geographical writers of ancient
                    times, Eratosthenes, Strabo, and Pliny, procured more correct information from
                    Alexander’s officers; and in later times the ancients extended their knowledge
                    of India by means of commerce. The general notion of the boundaries of India
                    within the Ganges appears to have been correct. On the north they stated the
                    boundary to be a range of mountains, the modern Himalaya, which they considered
                    to be the extremity of the range of Mount Taurus, and which were named
                    Paro-pamesus by the natives, or the mountains of Emodus and Imaus. The Indus was
                    pointed out as the western boundary; and in later times, when the knowledge of
                    Indian geography was extended, the Ganges was considered the boundary on the
                    east, and the ocean· on the south. Of the form and limits of this extensive
                    region, known under the general appellation of India, the ancients entertained
                    very erroneous notions. Of the country that lay between the Indus and the Ganges
                    they had begun to acquire from travellers more accurate information; but their
                    accounts respecting Southern India was still imperfect. The different
                    geographical writers enumerate many distinct tribes who were scattered over the
                    country between the Indus and the Ganges; but they seem not to have had
                    sufficient information for such a classification of the inhabitants; and little
                    instruction is conveyed concerning India in such a list of uncouth names. Of
                    India beyond the Ganges the ancients are still more imperfectly informed, nor do
                    they seem to have affixed any limits to its extension eastward.</p>
                <p>This term of India has been applied with great latitude by modern geographers,
                    not only to Hindustan, but to the countries eastward as far as China, including
                    Arracan, Ava, Cassay, Cachar, Pegu, Tongho, Martaban, Junkseylon, Tavay,
                    Tenassarim, Lowashan, Yemshar, and all the other districts really or nominally
                    subordinate to the Burman empire; also Siam, Malacca, Cambodia, Siampa, Laon,
                    Cochin China, and Tunquin. It includes, in short, all those extensive countries
                    that lie between the Indus on the west and China on the east, and that are
                    bounded on the north by Bukharia and Thibet, on the south by the Indian Ocean
                    and the Bay of Bengal, and on the north-east by the Chinese Sea. A particular
                    description of Hindustan, and of all these other countries, will be found under
                    their respective titles, to which therefore the reader is referred.</p>
