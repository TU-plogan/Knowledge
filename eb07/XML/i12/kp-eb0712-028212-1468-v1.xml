                    transplantation of distempers from one subject to another, particularly for the
                    engraftment of the small-pox; a practice which, though of ancient use in eastern
                    countries, is but of modern date amongst us, at least under the direction of
                    art. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Surgery</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps"

                <p>The time and place in which the method of inoculating for the small-pox was first
                    used, are equally unknown. Accident probably gave rise to it. Pylarini says,
                    that amongst the Turks it was not attended to, excepting amongst the meaner
                    sort. Dr Russell informs us<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                    142.</p></note> that no mention is made of it by any of the ancient Arabian
                    medical writers who are known in Europe; and the native physicians of Arabia
                    assert, that nothing is to be found regarding it in any of those of a more
                    modern date. He further says, that he engaged some of his learned Turkish
                    friends to make inquiry concerning this matter; but they did not discover any
                    thing on the subject of inoculation in the writings of their physicians,
                    historians, or poets. Until the beginning of the eighteenth century, all the
                    accounts we have of inoculating the small-pox are merely traditional. The
                    silence on this subject observed amongst writers in the countries where the
                    practice obtained, Dr Russell supposes, with great probability, to be owing to
                    the circumstance that the physicians there never countenanced or engaged in it.
                    It is also remarkable, that before Pylarini’s letter to the Royal Society in
                    1701, and for several years afterwards, this practice is not noticed by any of
                    the most inquisitive travellers. On this Dr Russell very justly observes, that
                    customs the most common in distant countries are often the least apt to attract
                    the observation of travellers, who, engaged in other pursuits, are indebted to
                    accident for the knowledge of such things as the natives seldom talk of, from a
                    belief that they are known to all the world.</p>
                <p>The first accounts we have concerning inoculation, are from two Italian
                    physicians, Pylarini and Timoni, whose letters on the subject maybe consulted in
                    the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions</hi> abridged (vol. v. p. 370).
                    The first is dated in 1701, the second in 1713. But whether our inquiries extend
                    to countries abroad, or are confined to our own, inoculation, in one mode or
                    other, has been practised from time immemorial; in Great Britain and its
                    adjacent isles we have well authenticated accounts, extending farther backwards
                    than any we have received from the continent. Dr Williams of Haverfordwest, who
                    wrote upon inoculation in 1725, proves that it had been practised in Wales,
                    though in a somewhat different form, time out of mind. Mr Wright, a surgeon in
                    that principality, says, that <hi rend="italic">buying the smallpox</hi> is both
                    a common practice, and of long standing, in that neighbourhood. He mentions,
                    that in Pembrokeshire there are two large villages near the harbour of Milford,
                    more famous for this custom than any other, namely, St Ishmael’s and Marloes.
                    The old inhabitants of these villages say, that it has been a common practice;
                    and that one William Allen of St Ishmael’s, who was ninety years of age in 1722,
                    declared to some persons of good sense and integrity, that this practice was
                    used all his time, and that he well remembered his mother telling him that it
                    was a common practice all her time, and that she got the smallpox by
                    inoculation.</p>
                <p>Dr Alexander Monro senior informs us, that in the Highlands of Scotland and some
                    of the adjacent isles, the custom through ages had been, to put their children
                    to bed with those who laboured under a favourable small-pox, and to tie worsted
                    threads about their children’s wrists, after having drawn them through variolous
                    pustules.</p>
                <p>According to the result of Dr Russell’s inquiries, the Arabians asserted that the
                    inoculation of the small-pox was the common custom of their ancestors, and that
                    they had no doubt of its being as ancient as the disease itself. It is
                    remarkable, that <hi rend="italic">buying the small-pox</hi> is the name
                    universally applied in all countries to the method of procuring the disease. It
                    is true that there are other terms; but in Wales and in Arabia, as well as in
                    many other countries, this is the usual appellation. From the identity of the
                    name, and the little diversity observable in the manner of performing the
                    operation, it is probable that the practice of inoculation in these countries
                    was originally derived from the same source. It is also in all probability of
                    great antiquity.</p>
                <p>In the year 1717, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, wife of the English ambassador at
                    Constantinople, had her son inoculated there at the age of six years; he had but
                    few pustules, and soon recovered. In April 1721, inoculation was successfully
                    tried upon seven condemned criminals in London, by permission of his Majesty. In
                    1722, Lady Mary Wortley Montague had a daughter six years old inoculated in this
                    island; soon after which, the children of the royal family who had not had the
                    small-pox were inoculated with success; then followed some of the nobility, and
                    the practice soon became general. And here we date the commencement of
                    inoculation under the direction of art.</p>
