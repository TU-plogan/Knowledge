                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Burning,</hi> in antiquity, a way of disposing of the dead,
                    much practised by the Greeks and Romans, and still retained by several nations
                    in the East and West Indies. The antiquity of this custom reaches as high as the
                    Ιheban war, where we are told of the great solemnity accompanying this ceremony
                    at the pyre of Menaeacus and Arche-morus, who were contemporary with Jair, the
                    eighth judge <pb break="no" facs="nls:193742489?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0705-2489-0725"/> of Israel. Homer abounds with funeral obsequies
                    of this nature. In the interior regions of Asia, the practice was of very
                    ancient date, and its continuance long; for we are told, that in the reign of
                    Julian, the king of Chionią burnt his son’s body, and deposited the ashes in a
                    silver urn. Coeval almost with the first instances of this kind in the East, was
                    the practice in the western parts of the world. The Herulians, the Getes, and
                    the Thracians, had all along observed it; and its antiquity was as great among
                    the Celtae, Sarmatians, and other neighbouring nations. This custom seems to
                    have arisen out of friendship to the deceased, whose ashes were preserved, as we
                    preserve a lock of hair, a ring, or a seal, which had been the property of a
                    departed friend.</p>
                <p>Kings were burnt in cloth made of the asbestos stone, that their ashes might be
                    preserved pure from any mixture with the fuel and other matters thrown on the
                    funeral pile. The same method is still observed with the princes of Tartary.
                    Among the Greeks, the body was placed on the top of a pile, on which were thrown
                    divers animals, and even slaves and captives, besides unguents and perfumes. In
                    the funeral of Patroclus we find a number of sheep and oxen thrown in, then four
                    horses, followed by two dogs, and lastly by twelve Trojan prisoners. The like is
                    mentioned by Virgil in the funerals of his Trojans; where, besides oxen, swine,
                    and all manner of cattie, we find eight youths condemned to the flames. The
                    first thing was the fat of the beasts, wherewith the body was covered, that it
                    might consume the faster; it being reckoned a great felicity to be quickly
                    reduced to ashes. For the like reason, where numbers were to be burnt at the
                    same time, care was taken to mix with them some of humid constitutions, and
                    therefore more easily to be inflamed. Thus we are assured by Plutarch and
                    Macrobius, that for every ten men it was customary to put in one woman. Soldiers
                    usually had their arms burnt with them. The garments worn by the living were
                    also thrown on the pile, with other ornaments and presents; a piece of
                    extravagance which ' the Athenians carried to so great a height, that some of
                    their lawgivers were forced to restrain them, by severe penalties, from
                    defrauding the living by their liberality to the dead. In some cases, burning
                    was expressly forbidden among the Romans, and even looked upon as the highest
                    impiety. Thus, infants who died before the breeding of teeth w ere entombed
                    unburnt in the ground, in a particular place set apart for this purpose. The
                    same thing was practised in regard to persons struck dead with lightning, who
                    were not allowed to be burnt again. Some say that burning was also denied to
                    suicides. The manner of burning among the Romans was not unlike that of the
                    Greeks. The corpse, being brought out without the city, was carried directly to
                    the place appointed for burning it; which, if it joined the sepulchre, was
                    called <hi rend="italic">bustum,</hi> if separate from it, <hi rend="italic"
                    >ustrina,</hi> and there laid on the <hi rend="italic">rogus</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">pyra,</hi> a pile of wood prepared for burning it, and built in
                    the shape of an altar, but of different height, according to the quality of the
                    deceased. The wood used was commonly that of such trees as contain most pitch or
                    rosin; and whatever kind was used, they split it, for the more easy catching
                    fire; while round the pile they set cypress trees, probably to hinder the
                    noisome smell of the corpse. The body was not placed on the ban? pile, but on
                    the couch or bed whereon it lay; and when this was done, the next of blood
                    performed the ceremony of lighting the pile; which they did with a torch,
                    turning their faces all the while the other way, as if it were performed with
                    reluctance. During the ceremony, decursions and games were celebrated; after
                    which came the <hi rend="italic">ossilegium,</hi> or gathering of the bones and
                    ashes; also washing, anointing, and depositing them in urns.</p>
