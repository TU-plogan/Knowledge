                <p><label type="entry">BUTTON</label>, an article in dress, the form and use of
                    which are too well known to need description.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Mxtal</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Buttons.</hi> The metal
                    with which the moulds are intended to be covered is first cast into small
                    ingots, and then flatted into thin plates or leaves, of the thickness intended,
                    at the flattening mills; after which it is cut into small round pieces
                    proportional to the size of the mould they are intended to cover, by means of
                    proper punches, on a block of wood covered with a thick plate of lead. Each
                    piece of metal thus cut out of the plate is reduced into the form of a button by
                    beating it successively in several cavities, or concave moulds, of a spherical
                    form, with a convex puncheon of iron, always beginning with the shallowest
                    cavity of the mould, and proceeding to the deeper, till the plate has acquired
                    the intended form ļ and the better to manage so thin a plate, ten, twelve, and
                    sometimes even twenty-four, are formed to the cavities, or concave moulds, at
                    once; often nealing the metal during the operation, to make it more ductile.
                    This plate is generally called by workmen the <hi rend="italic">cop of the
                    button.</hi></p>
                <p>The form being thus given to the plates or caps, the intended impression is
                    struck on the convex side, by means of a similar iron puncheon, in a kind of
                    mould engraven <hi rend="italic">en creux,</hi> either by the hammer or the
                    press used in coining. The cavity or mould in which the impression is to be made
                    is of a diameter and depth suitable to the sort of button intended to be struck
                    in it; each kind requiring a particular mould. Between the puncheon and the
                    plate is placed a thin piece of lead, called by workmen a <hi rend="italic"
                    >hob,</hi> which greatly contributes to take off all the strokes of the
                    engraving; the lead, by reason of its softness, easily giving way to the parts
                    which have relief, and as easily insinuating itself into the traces or
                    indentures.</p>
                <p>The plate thus prepared makes the cap or shell of the button. The lower part is
                    formed of another plate, in the same manner, but much flatter, and without any
                    impression. To the last or under plate is soldered a small eye, made of wire, by
                    which the button is to be fastened.</p>
                <p>The two plates being thus finished, they are soldered together with soft solder,
                    and then turned in a lathe. Generally indeed they use a wooden mould instead of
                    the under plate; and in order to fasten it, they pass a thread or gut across
                    through the middle of the mould, and fill the cavity between the mould and the
                    cap with cement, in order to render the button firm and solid; for the cement
                    entering all the cavities formed by the relief <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    other side, sustains it, prevents its flattening, and preserves its bosse or
                    design.</p>
