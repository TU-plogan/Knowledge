                    British admiral, was the second son of Hugh Lord Viscount Falmouth. Having early
                    entered into the navy, he was, in 1740, captain of the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Shoreham;</hi> and behaved with great intrepidity as a volunteer under Admiral
                    Vernon, at the taking of PortoBello. At the siege of Carthagena, in March 1741,
                    he had the command of a party of seamen who resolutely attacked and took a
                    battery of fifteen twenty-four pounders, though exposed to the fire of another
                    fort of five guns. Lord Aubrey Beauclerk having been killed at the attack of
                    Boca-Chica, Captain Boscawen succeeded him in the command of the <hi
                    rend="italic">Prince Frederick</hi> of seventy guns. In May 1742 he returned to
                    England, and married Frances, daughter of William Glanville, Esq.; and the same
                    year he was elected representative for Truro in Cornwall. In 1744 he was made
                    captain of the <hi rend="italic">Breadnought</hi> of sixty guns; and soon after
                    he captured the <hi rend="italic">Medea,</hi> a French man of war commanded by
                    M. Hoquart, the first ship taken in that war. In May 1747 he signalized himself
                    under the admirals Anson and Warren, in an engagement with the French fleet off
                    Cape Finisterre, and was wounded in the shoulder with a musket ball. Here Μ.
                    Hoquart, who then commanded the <hi rend="italic">Biamond</hi> of fifty-six
                    guns, again became his prisoner; and all the French ships of war, ten in number,
                    were taken. On the 15th of July he was made rearadmiral of the blue, and
                    commander-in-chief of the sea and land forces employed on an expedition to the
                    East Indies; and on the 4th of November he sailed from St Helen’s, with six
                    ships of the line, five frigates, and 2000 soldiers. On the 29th of July 1748 he
                    arrived at St David’s, and soon after laid siege to Pondicherry; but the men
                    growing sickly, and the monsoons being expected, the siege was raised, and Mr
                    Boscawen showed himself as much the general as the admiral in his retreat. Soon
                    afterwards he received news of the peace, and Madras was delivered up to him by
                    the French. In April 1750 he arrived at St Helen’s in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Exeter,</hi> and found that in his absence he had been appointed rear-admiral
                    of the white. He was the next year made one of the lords commissioners of the
                    admiralty, and chosen an elder brother of the Trinity-house. In February 1755 he
                    was appointed vice-admiral of the blue. On the 19th of April, sailing in order
                    to intercept a French squadron bound to North America, he fell in with the <hi
                    rend="italic">Alcide</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Leys</hi> of sixty-four guns
                    each, which were both taken. On this occasion Μ. Hoquart became his prisoner for
                    the third time, and he returned to Spithead with his prizes and 1500 prisoners.
                    In 1756 he was appointed vice-admiral of the white, and in 1758 admiral of the
                    blue and commander-in-chief of the expedition to Cape Breton, when, in
                    conjunction with General Amherst, and a body of troops from New England, the
                    important fortress of Louisbourg and the whole island of Cape Breton were taken;
                    services for which he afterwards received the thanks of the House of Commons. In
                    1759, being appointed to command in the Mediterranean, he arrived at Gibraltar,
                    where hearing that the Toulon fleet, under Μ. de la Clue, had passed the Straits
                    in order to join that at Brest, he got under sail, and on the 18th of August
                    saw, pursued, and engaged the enemy. His ship, the <hi rend="italic">Namur</hi>
                    of ninety guns, losing her main-mast, he shifted his flag to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Newark;</hi> and, after a sharp engagement, took three large ships
                    and burnt two, in Lagos Bay, after which he returned to Spithead with his prizes
                    and 2000 prisoners. On the 8th December 1760 he was appointed general of the
                    marines with a salary of L.3000 per annum, and was also sworn a member of the
                    privy council. He died in 1761.</p>
