                <p><label type="entry">BRISTOL</label>, a city of England, partly within the
                    boundary of the county of Somerset, and partly in that of Gloucester, though it
                    is a county of itself; distant 119 miles from London, and 13 miles from Bath. It
                    is situated in a valley, rather contracted, at the junction of the rivers Frome
                    and Avon, which, by the construction of a canal and locks, have been formed into
                    a basin, where vessels, which lay on the ground formerly at low water, are now
                    kept constantly afloat. From this floating dock the ships are lowered by locks
                    into the united stream, which joins the Severn a few miles below the city.
                    Bristol is a city of extensive and beneficial commerce, and that with almost
                    every part of the globe. The trade with the West Indies is the most
                    considerable; that with Spain and Portugal, with the Baltic ports, with the
                    Mediterranean, with Africa, and the East Indies, if inferior to that of London
                    and Liverpool, comes next to the latter place. There are considerable
                    manufactures also in and near the city, especially of glass, sugar, braziery and
                    tin ware, snuff, tobacco, beer, soap, corn, spirits, vinegar, sugar refineries,
                    white lead, and many smaller articles. It has, from its local position, an
                    advantageous inland trade; and is a kind of emporium for South Wales, and the
                    northern parts of Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall, to which there is a constant
                    water conveyance; whilst by means of other canals goods are transmitted to the
                    central parts of the kingdom. Many ships are built here; and the equipment of
                    them, as well as the barges and trows for inland navigation, affords
                    considerable employment to the labouring portion of the population.</p>
                <p>Although tins city dates its origin at a remote period, and some parts of it
                    contain streets that are narrow, crooked, and gloomy, and many houses of an
                    antiquated appearance, yet many parts are not behind any city in England in
                    improvements of every kind. Several new streetsand squares have been built of
                    late years in the valley; whilst in Clifton, one of the parishes which compose
                    the city, there have been constructed crescents, parades, and streets, which vie
                    with the best in the metropolis, and, from their beautiful situation and
                    prospects, far exceed them. Another of the parishes of this city, Bedminster,
                    has also much increased in beauty of buildings, as well as in the number of its
                    inhabitants. The city is governed by a mayor, two sheriffs, twelve aldermen, and
                    twenty-eight common council men, besides a high steward, commonly a nobleman of
                    high rank, and a recorder, usually a lawyer of distinguished eminence. The
                    guilds are thirteen in number, and the , whole body of freemen many thousands,
                    and the more so as every daughter of a freeman conveys by marriage the freedom
                    to her husband. The two members for the city are chosen by the whole body of
                    them. Bristol contains, besides the cathedral, eighteen parish churches and five
                    chapels, with a number of places of worship for the several descriptions <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> separatists from the established religion. It has two
                    scientific institutions, social establishments, and numerous societies for the
                    laudable purposes of benevolence, in the formation of which all the jarring
                    political and religious parties show an honourable rivalry. There are several
                    markets, where provisions are supplied of excellent quality, in great abundance,
                    and at very moderate rates. The inhabitants of Bristol are more distinguished
                    for their steady prudence than for their adventurous spirit in commerce; hence,
                    if the city has not made occasionally such rapid advances, it has gone on
                    steadily, and scarcely ever suffered by extensive disappointments in its
                    commercial pursuits, or been the victim of those crises and fluctuations which
                    have frequently occurred in other trading towns.</p>
                <p>The hot wells near this city were formerly higher in fame than at the present
                    day, but the water is still in estimation for its purity, and large quantities
                    of it are dispatched to distant parts of the world. The population of Bristol
                    has made the same regular advances as are to be found in the other ports of the
                    British islands. In our view we include the parish of Bedminster in the city of
                    Bristol, because it forms a part of it, as much as Westminster or Southwark do
                    of London. The number of inhabitants thus taken amounted in 1801 to 66,922, in
                    1811 to 76,952, and in 1821 to 95,758. According to all probable appearance this
                    rate of increase must have continued since the last census, which will make the
                    present population at least 105,000 persons.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bristol,</hi> a seaport town, and capital of a county of the
                    same name, in Rhode Island. It is a very pleasant town, finely situated and
                    handsomely built. The harbour is safe and commodious, and the place has a
                    considerable trade. In 1820, the shipping belonging to the port amounted to
                    10,701 tons. The trade is carried on principally with the West Indies and with
                    Europe. Bristol possesses a courthouse, a jail, a market-house, a masonic-hall,
                    a public library containing about 1400 volumes, and four places of public
                    worship. Great quantities of onions are raised here for exportation. Mount Hope,
                    which lies about two miles north-east of Bristol, within the township, is a
                    pleasant bill, of a conical form, and famous for having been the residence of
                    the Indian king, Philip. The population of Bristol in 1820 amounted to 3197. It
                    is situated fifteen miles south from Providence, fifteen north from Newport, and
                    fifty-six south-south-west from Boston. Long. 71.12. W. Lat. 41. 38. N.</p>
