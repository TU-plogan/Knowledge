                <p><label type="entry">BUILDER</label>, in the general sense of the term, an
                    undertaker of works of building. With reference to the operations of civil
                    architecture particularly, the builder stands between the proprietor and
                    architect on the one hand, and the artizan, merchant, and manufacturer on the
                    other: he engages to the first to carry a certain proposed work into execution,
                    as he may be directed by the second, and saves to both of them the trouble and
                    responsibility of procuring materials and employing workmen.</p>
                <p>The builder’s emolument arises from an improved price, or charges bearing an
                    advance on the prime cost, to remunerate him for the use of his capital, and his
                    own personal application or labour. A builder has the power also of deriving an
                    advantage from the division of labour, by employing artizans in those operations
                    only which habit enables them to execute with the greatest facility.</p>
                <p>The builder contracts to do certain specified works for a certain total sum of
                    money, the amount of which lie determines by a previous estimate; or to do
                    prescribed operations at so much for a certain fixed quantity of every sort
                    involved, per yard, per rod, per foot, and so on, the amount to be ascertained,
                    when they are completed, by measurement; or he executes works according to
                    instructions or specifications, leaving the charges to be determined according
                    to the usual and accustomed rates, on the quantities ascertained by
                    admeasurement. In the two former cases he is said to work by contract, and in
                    the last by measure and value. For jobbing, in repairs and alterations, a day
                    account is kept; that is, a record <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the time workmen
                    are employed, and of the materials used, in performing certain operations. This
                    is made out with an advance of so much per cent, on the prime cost, or wages of
                    the workmen and selling prices of the unwrought materials, for the builder’s
                    profit or remuneration, as before stated.</p>
                <p>A builder should be theoretically acquainted with the principles of construction,
                    and practically conversant with the details of all the mechanic arts used in
                    building; as well to be enabled to carry on his business with advantage to his
                    own interest, as to the proper execution of the works he may undertake. He
                    should be qualified to ascertain with the utmost minuteness, from the drawings
                    of a design, and the specification of the manner in which, and matter of which,
                    it is to be carried into execution, the quantity <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    labour, and materials of every kind and description, and the exact value of them
                    all. In this is involved the necessity of being well acquainted with the market
                    prices of raw and manufactured articles to a very great extent, and a matured
