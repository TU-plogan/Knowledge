                    miles from London, and situated on a branch of the river Aire. It is built
                    partly on the side of a steep hill, with some of the streets looking over the
                    houses in the others. It has extensive manufactures of worsted stuffs, and,
                    during the war, had several founderies for cannon, and other heavy iron
                    articles. The market is held on Thursday. The parish church is a remarkably fine
                    Gothic edifice, with a melodious peal of bells. The inhabitants amounted in 1801
                    to 6393, in 1811 to 7761, and in 1821 to 13,064. The whole parish of Bradford,
                    comprehending twelve townships or chapelries, contained, in 1801, 28,985
                    inhabitants, who in 1821 had increased to 52,954.</p>

                    channels, communication with London and with Bristol. It is a great
                    manufacturing place for broad cloths and cassimeres. 1 he streets are narrow,
                    crooked, and ill built; but the situation is sheltered, and it is very healthy.
                    There are good markets on Monday and Saturday. The inhabitants amounted in 1801
                    to 8540, in 1811 to 9230, and in 1821 to 10,231.</p>

                    Henry, and his successor Edward VI., as paymaster to the troops abroad. Bradford
                    at this time was a gay man, and to support his extravagance made free with the
                    king’s money; but being at last unable to endure the reflection of his guilt, he
                    determined to make restitution, and actually repaid the money. Quitting his
                    employment of secretary about the year 1547, he took chambers in the Inner
                    Temple, and for some time studied the law; but finding in himself an inclination
                    to preach the gospel, he removed the following year to Catherine-hall,
                    Cambridge, where he applied with uncommon assiduity to the study of divinity,
                    and in a much shorter time than usual was admitted to the degree of master of
                    arts, and soon after made fellow of Pembroke-hall. Bishop Ridley, who in 1550
                    was translated to the see of London, being charmed with Bradford’s application
                    and zeal, now sent for him to the metropolis, ordained and appointed him his
                    chaplain. In 1553 he was also made chaplain to Edward VI.; during which time he
                    became one of the most popular preachers in the kingdom. Such a reformer was too
                    dangerous to be tolerated in the succeeding reign. Accordingly, Mary had hardly
                    got possession of the crown when Bradford’s persecutions began. He was first
                    confined in the Tower for sedition, where he continued a year and a half. During
                    this time he wrote several epistles, which were dispersed in various parts of
                    the kingdom. He was afterwards removed to other prisons, and at last brought to
                    trial before that court of inquisition in which Gardiner sat as chief
                    inquisitor, where he defended his principles to the last, in contempt of their
                    utmost power. They condemned him to the flames, and he was accordingly burnt
                    alive in Smithfield, on the 1st of July 1555. His works are, 1. Seventy-two
                    Letters, written to various people, whilst the author was in prison, and printed
                    in Bishop Coverdale’s collection; 2. Ten Letters, printed in Fox’s Acts and
                    Monuments; 3. Complaint of Verity, 1559, 8vo; 4. Three Examinations before the
                    Commissioners, and his Private Talk with the Priests, with the Original of his
                    Life, 1561, 8vo; 5. Two Notable Sermons 1574, 8vo, 1631; 6. Godly Meditations
                    and Prayers, 1614, 24to; 7. Treatise of Repentance, 1622; with several
                    translations and other pieces.</p>
