                    western judicial circuit. It is bounded on the north-west and west by
                    Gloucestershire, on the west by Somersetshire, on the south by Dorset and Hanks,
                    and on the east and north-east by the latter county and Berkshire. The length is
                    about fifty miles, and the breadth about thirty-four. It is of an elliptical
                    form, with very irregular indentations on the borders. The area is 1379 square
                    miles, or 882,560 statute acres. The county is divided into twenty-nine
                    hundreds, comprising one city, twenty-three market-towns, and 295 parishes. The
                    whole of the county is in the diocese of Salisbury, and is ecclesiastically
                    divided into two archdeaconries, which are subdivided into ten deaneries.</p>

                    shewing a slower progressive increase of the inhabitants than has taken place in

                    and the females 122,534. The number of dwelling-houses was 46,281, inhabited by

                    were chiefly employed in trade, manufactures, and handicraft, and 10,987 were
                    not comprised in either of the two preceding classes. At the period in question
                    the number of males twenty years of age was 58,439; the occupiers of land
                    employing labourers were 3387; the occupiers of land not employing labourers,
                    1239; the labourers employed in agriculture, 24,708; the males employed in
                    manufactures, and in making manufacturing machinery, 3497; male servants twenty
                    years of age, 1161; male servants under twenty years of age, 396; female
                    servants, 7623; employed in retail trade, or in handicraft as masters or
                    workmen, 13,080; bankers, professional and other educated men, 1792; labourers
                    employed in labour not agricultural, 4828; other males twenty years of age,
                    except servants, 4338.</p>
                <p>The southern division of Wiltshire is chiefly that extensive tract of unwooded
                    land usually denominated Salisbury Plain. It is an unenclosed country, and has
                    an appearance of desolateness; but bottoms are frequent, and having generally
                    streams of water running through them, the houses and villages are for the most
                    part erected in them, and the district is much more populous than a traveller
                    passing over the plain would suspect. The land, though chiefly used for feeding
                    sheep, is, when brought under the plough, highly productive in turnips, barley,
                    and wheat. There is a tract of rich land between Salisbury Plain and Marlborough
                    Downs; and to the north of these downs the country is well enclosed, and abounds
                    in rich pasture, on which are fed the cows that produce the excellent cheese
                    known by the name of North Wiltshire. The peculiar breed of sheep of this
                    county, which are universally called by its name, are all horned, afford heavy
                    fleeces of moderately fine wool, and are very numerous; on Salisbury Plain they
                    are said to be more than 500,000. The produce of wheat and other grain is
                    estimated to be less per acre than the general average of the contiguous
                    counties. There were anciently several extensive forests in this county; but,
                    although the districts still retain the name either of <hi rend="italic"
                    >Forest</hi> or <hi rend="italic">chace,</hi> they are, with the exception of
                    Savernake or Marlborough Forest, and Cran-boume Chace, almost wholly either in
                    pasture or under the plough.</p>
                <p>Wiltshire being an elevated district, many rivers have their sources in it, or
                    water the lands of it soon after their rise. The most important of these are the
                    Thames, the Lower Avon, and the Kennet, all of which are navigable. Besides
                    these, are the tributary streams, the Upper Avon, the Willey, the Nadder, the
                    Bourne, the Stour, and the Brue. The canals which pass from or through this
                    county are the Thames and Severn, connecting those two rivers with each other;
                    the Kennet and Avon, which also unites those rivers. Both of these canals have
                    been most expensive, and hitherto unproductive undertakings, designed to
                    facilitate the intercourse between London and Bristol. The Wilts and Berks
                    Canal, designed to connect the Severn with the Thames, has been a particularly
                    unfortunate concern. The Salisbury and Southampton Canal has been found of some
                    benefit, by supplying the former place with coals, but has been little
                    productive to the proprietors.</p>
                <p>This county has long been one of the chief districts for the manufacture of fine
                    cloths. That branch of industry is now however confined to the western part of
                    it. The populous towns of Bradford, Trowbridge, Devizes, Warminster, Chippenham,
                    Westbury, Melksham, Calne, and the villages surrounding them, are chiefly
                    maintained by making cloths and cassimeres of fine quality, the wool for which
                    used to be imported from Spain to Bristol; but of late years the fine wools of
                    Saxony have in a great measure supplanted those of Spain in this country. The
                    fine woollen trade still employs more than 1000 males above twenty years of age
                    at Trowbridge, about 600 at Bradford, 200 at Westbury, and some at Melksham,
                    Chippenham, and Heytesbury. Some fine cutlery ware and steel work is made at
                    Salisbury, but those fabrics are much reduced by their rivals at Sheffield and
                    Birmingham. Wilton, which gave its name to a description of carpets, has still
                    some remains of its former trade.</p>
                <p>Few counties present so many objects of antiquarian research as Wiltshire. Among
                    those of British origin are the Wansdike, a fortification of earth traversing
                    the whole county; the druidical masses of stone at Stonehenge and Avebury; the
                    numerous <hi rend="italic">barrows,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">tumuli,</hi> which
                    are to be seen on a great number of spots on the downs; and the earthen ramparts
                    supposed to have formerly enclosed the towns of the ancient Britons. Among the
                    Roman antiquities are many of the roads constructed by that people, their
                    fortified encampments, and the ruins of several of their castles, especially
                    those of Marlborough, Devizes, Malmesbury, and Old Sarum. The monastic remains,
                    especially at Malmesbury, present very interesting subjects of study to the
                    antiquary. Besides these vestiges of antiquity, tesselated pavements, coins,
                    urns, fragments of sculpture, daggers, shields, and ornaments of British, Roman,
                    Saxon, and Norman fashion, have been discovered. The cathedral of Salisbury,
                    though not of such an age as to be classed among antiquities, is an object of
                    great admiration on account of the elegant design and scientific execution of
                    the structure. The beautiful spire is much admired for its height and its
                    proportions, and, though in a valley, may be seen at a great distance rising
                    above the surrounding hills. It is said to be the loftiest in England, rising
                    from the floor of the church to the height of 400 feet.</p>
                <p>The peers deriving their titles from places in this county are the duke of
                    Marlborough, the marquises of Lansdowne and of Salisbury, Viscount Bolingbroke,
                    and Barons Arundel and Methuen. No county has undergone so great changes by the
                    parliamentary reform bill as Wiltshire. By that law the county is divided for
                    election purposes into north and south. The elections for the northern division
                    are held at Devizes; and the other polling places are Melksham, Malmesbury, and
                    Swindon. The elections for the southern are at Salisbury; and the other polling
                    places are Warminster, East Everley, and Hindon. Each of these divisions returns
                    two members. By the reform bill the following boroughs, each of which returned
                    two members, have been disfranchised; viz. Old Sarum, Ludgershall, Hindon, Great
                    Bedwin, Heytesbury, Wooton-Basset, and Downton; and the following towns, which
                    chose two each, have now but one; viz. Westbury, Wilton, Malmesbury, and Calne.
                    No new boroughs were created in the county, but the following places retain
                    their ancient privileges of electing two members each; viz. Salisbury,
                    Chippenham, Cricklade, Devizes, and Marlborough. The towns and the population
                    exceeding 4000 persons are, Trowbridge, 10,863; Bradford, 10,102; Salisbury,
                    9876; Westbury, 7324; Warminster, 6115; Melksham, 5866; Calne, 4795; Chippenham,
                    4333.</p>
                <p>Among a great number of seats belonging to noblemen and gentlemen, the most
                    remarkable are Longleat, the marquis of Bath; Bowood, marquis of Lansdowne;
                    Tottenham Park, Lord Aylesbury; Wardour Castle, Lord Arundel; Fontbill Abbey, Mr
