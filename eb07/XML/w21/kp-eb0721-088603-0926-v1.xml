                    philosopher and divine, the son of Walter Wilkins, a goldsmith of Oxford, was
                    born in 1614, at Fawsley, near Daventry in Northamptonshire, in the house of his
                    maternal grandfather, John Dod, a non-conformist. After being trained in a
                    private school at Oxford, he was entered of New Inn Hall in 1627, but was not
                    long afterwards removed to Magdalen Hall, where he took his degrees in arts. On
                    receiving holy orders, he became chaplain to Lord Say, and afterwards to Charles
                    Count Palatine of the Rhine. To the favour of this prince his knowledge of
                    mathematics was a strong recommendation. At the age of twenty-four he published
                    “The Discovery of a New World; or, a Discourse tending to prove that 'tis
                    probable there may be another habitable World in the Moon: with a Discourse
                    concerning the Possibility of a Passage thither.” Lond. 1638, 8vo. This was
                    followed by “A Discourse concerning a New Planet; tending to prove that it is
                    probable our Earth is one of the Planets.” Lond. 1640, 8vo. Both these works
                    appeared without his name. He next produced “Mercury; or, the secret and swift
                    Messenger; shewing how a man may with privacy and speed communicate his thoughts
                    to a friend at any distance.” Lond. 1641, 8vo. Another of his works bears the
                    title of “Mathematical Magick; or, the Wonders that may be performed by
                    Mechanical Geometry.” Lond. 1648, 8vo. These four tracts were long afterwards
                    reprinted in a collection of his Mathematical and Philosophical Works. Lond.
                    1708, 8vo. Lond. 1802, 2 vols. 8vo. The earliest of his theological works was
                    his “Ecclesiastes; or, a Discourse of the Gift of Preaching, as it falls under
                    the Rules of Art.” Lond. 1646, 8vo. The ninth edition was printed in 1718. This
                    publication was succeeded in 1649 by “A Discourse concerning the Beauty of
                    Providence, in all the rugged passages of it ;” and in 1653 by “A Discourse
                    concerning the Gift of Prayer.”</p>
                <p>On the commencement of the civil wars he adhered to the parliament, and took the
                    solemn league and covenant. The committee for reforming the university appointed
                    him warden of Wadham College. On the 12th of April 1648 he was created B. D.,
                    and was next day admitted to the office, for which his learning, as well as his
                    talents and temper, eminently qualified him. Next year he was created D. D., and
                    about the same period married Robina, the sister of Oliver Cromwell, and the
                    widow of Dr French, canon of Christ Church. The protector granted him a
                    dispensation for retaining the wardenship, notwithstanding his marriage. In 1659
                    Richard Cromwell appointed him master of Trinity College, Cambridge, but he was
                    ejected in the course of the following year. The Restoration did not however
                    deprive Dr Wilkins of all hope of preferment. He soon afterwards became preacher
                    at Gray’s Inn, and rector of St Lawrence-Jewry. His next promotion was to the
                    deanery of Ripon. It was about this period that he published the most remarkable
                    of his works, “An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language.”
                    Lond. 1668, fol. Of this essay a Latin version was completed by Ray, but was
                    never published. During the same year, 1668, he was advanced to the bishopric of
                    Chester; and his consecration sermon was preached by Dr Tillotson, who had
                    married his step-daughter, Elizabeth French. The high preferment which he so
                    well merited he did not long enjoy. Wilkins was the fourth bishop appointed to
                    this see since the year 1660. His fatal disease was a suppression of urine,
                    which was mistaken for the stone. He died at Dr Tillotson’s house in
                    Chancery-lane, London, on the 19th of November 1672, having only attained the
                    age of fifty-eight. His funeral <pb break="no"

                    sermon was preached by Dr Lloyd, afterwards bishop of Worcester, who was himself
                    a man of distinguished learning. His papers were left to the disposal of
                    Tillotson, who prepared for the press his treatise <hi rend="italic">“Of</hi>
                    the Principles and Duties of Natural Religion, two books.” Lond. 1675, 8vo. This
                    work was very favourably received, and it reached a fifth edition in 1704. The
                    same editor afterwards published a volume containing fifteen of the bishop’s
                    Sermons. Lond. 1682, 8vo. In the preface he vindicated the character of this
                    excellent prelate from some of the malignant aspersions to which it had been
                    exposed. Wilkins was a man of a liberal and generous mind, and was as much
                    distinguished by his amiable disposition as by his intellectual endowments. But
                    he was the brother-in-law of Oliver Cromwell, and had subscribed the covenant;
                    and after the church again became triumphant, he was disposed to treat
                    dissenters with a degree of Christian moderation and charity which the
                    indomitable bigotry of too many churchmen could not but regard as truly
                    scandalous. If the other prelates of that age had been animated with the same
                    spirit, the church of England would not so speedily have been felt as a grievous
                    scourge by a great proportion of its most pious and exemplary ministers. Richard
                    Baxter would not have been subjected to persecution merely for preaching the
                    gospel with a degree of zeal and fervour scarcely equalled in that secularized
                    establishment from which he had found himself compelled to separate.</p>
