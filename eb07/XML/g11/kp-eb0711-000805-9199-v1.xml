                    Stradbrook in Suffolk, towards the close of the twelfth century. His parents
                    were so poor, that when a boy he was obliged to perform the meanest offices, and
                    even to beg his bread, until the mayor of Lincoln, struck with his appearance
                    and the quickness of his answers to certain questions, took him into his family,
                    and put him to school. Here his ardent love of learning, and admirable capacity
                    for acquiring knowledge, soon appeared, and procured him many patrons, by whose
                    assistance <pb break="no" facs="nls:193639212?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0711-9212-0009"/> he was enabled to prosecute his studies, first at
                    Cambridge, ’ afterwards at Oxford, and lastly at Paris. In these three seats of
                    learning he spent many years in the indefatigable pursuit of knowledge, and
                    became one of the best and most universal scholars of the age. He was a great
                    master not only of the French and Latin, but also of the Greek and Hebrew
                    languages, which was a very rare accomplishment in those times. We are also
                    assured by Roger Bacon, who was intimately acquainted with him, that he spent
                    much of his time for nearly forty years in the study of geometry, astronomy,
                    optics, and other branches of physical and mathematical learning, in all of
                    which he very much excelled. But theology was his favourite study, in which he
                    read lectures at Oxford with great approbation. In the mean while he had
                    obtained several preferments in the church, and was at length elected and
                    consecrated Bishop of Lincoln in the year 1235. In this station he soon became
                    celebrated for the purity of his manners, the popularity of his preaching, the
                    vigour of his discipline, and the boldness with which he reproved the vices and
                    opposed the arbitrary mandates of the court of Rome. Of his independence in this
                    last respect it may be proper to give one example. Pope Innocent IV. had granted
                    to one of his own nephews, named Frederick, who was but a child, an appointment
                    to the first canon’s place in the church of Lincoln which should become vacant;
                    and he sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Innocent, then papal legate in
                    England, a bull commanding them to see the provision made effectual, which bull
                    they transmitted to the Bishop of Lincoln. But that brave and virtuous prelate
                    boldly refused to give effect to this unreasonable mandate, and sent an answer
                    to the papal bull containing very severe reproaches against his holiness for
                    abusing his power. The bishop did not long survive this noble stand against the
                    corruption and tyranny of the church of Rome, for he fell sick at his castle of
                    Bugden that same year; and when he became sensible that his end was drawing
                    near, he called his clergy into his apartment, and made a long discourse to
                    them, to prove that the reigning pope, Innocent IV. was antichrist. With this
                    exertion his strength and spirits were so much exhausted, that he soon
                    afterwards expired, on the 9th of October 1253.</p>
