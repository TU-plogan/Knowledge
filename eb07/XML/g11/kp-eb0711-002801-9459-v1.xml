                <p><label type="entry">GUILD</label> (from the Saxon <hi rend="italic"
                    >guildane,</hi> to pay), signifies a fraternity or company, because every one
                    was <hi rend="italic">gildare,</hi> that is, to pay something towards the charge
                    and support of the company. As to the original of these guilds or companies, it
                    was a law amongst the Saxons, that every freeman of fourteen years of age should
                    find sureties to keep the peace, or be committed. Upon this certain neighbours,
                    consisting of ten families, entered into an association, and became bound for
                    one another, either to produce him who committed an offence, or to make
                    satisfaction to the injured party; and that they might the better do this, they
                    raised a sum of money amongst themselves, which they put into a common stock,
                    and when one of their pledges had committed an offence, and fled, then the other
                    nine made satisfaction out of this stock, by payment of money, according to the
                    offence. Because this association consisted of ten families, it was called a <hi
                    rend="italic">decennary</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and hence arose other kinds
                    of fraternities. But as to the precise time when these guilds had their origin
                    in England, there is nothing certain to be found; since they were in use long
                    before any formal license was granted to them for such meetings. It seems to
                    have been about the close of the eleventh century, according to Anderson <hi
                    rend="italic">(History of Commerce,</hi> vol. i. p. 70), that merchant-guilαs,
                    or fraternities, which were afterwards styled corporations, came first into
                    general use in many parts of Europe. Madox <hi rend="italic">{Firma Burgi,</hi>
                    chap. i. sect. 9) thinks they were hardly known to our Saxon progenitors, and
                    that they might probably have been brought into England by the Normans, although
                    they do not seem to have been very numerous in those days. The French and
                    Normans might perhaps have borrowed them from the free cities of Italy, where
                    trade and manufactures were much more early propagated, and where such
                    communities appear to have been first in use. These guilds are now companies or
                    associations, having laws and orders made by themselves, in virtue of authority
                    from the prince to that effect.</p>
