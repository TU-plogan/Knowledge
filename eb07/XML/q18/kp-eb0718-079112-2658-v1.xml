                    of the seventeenth century. They were so called from a kind of absolute rest and
                    inaction whieh they supposed the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193542671?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0718-2671-0792"/> soul to be in
                    when arrived at that state of perfection they called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >unitive life;</hi> in which state they imagined the soul wholly employed in
                    contemplating its God, to whose influence it was entirely submissive, so that he
                    could turn and drive it whither and how he would. In this state, the soιd no
                    longer needs prayers, hymns, and the like, being laid, as it were, in the bosom
                    and between the arms of its God, in whom it is in a manner swallowed up.</p>
                <p>Molinos, a Spanish priest, is the reputed author of Quietism, though the
                    Illuminati in Spain had certainly taught something like it before. The
                    sentiments of Molinos were contained in a book which he published at Rome in the
                    year 1681, under the title of the Spiritual Guide. For this he was cast into
                    prison in 1685; but he afterwards publicly renounced the errors of which he was
                    accused. This solemn recantation, however, proved unavailing, inasmuch as it was
                    followed by a sentence of perpetual imprisonment, and he died in prison in the
                    year 1696. Molinos had numerous disciples in Italy, Spain, France, and the
                    Netherlands. One of the principal patrons and propagators of Quietism in France
                    was Marie Bouvières de la Mothe Guyon, a woman of fashion, remarkable for
                    goodness of heart and regularity of manners, but of an unsettled temper, and
                    subject to be drawn away by the seduction of a warm and unbridled fancy. She
                    derived all ideas of religion from the feelings of her own heart, and described
                    its nature to others as she felt it herself. Accordingly her religious
                    sentiments made a great noise in the year 1687; and, after accurate
                    investigation, they were declared unsound by several men of eminent piety and
                    learning, and professedly confuted in the year 1697, by the celebrated Bossuet.
                    Hence arose a controversy of greater moment between the prelate last mentioned,
                    and Fénélon, archbishop of Cambray, who seemed disposed to favour the system of
                    Madame Guyon, and who, in 1697, published a book containing several of her
                    tenets. Fénélon’s book was, by means of Bossuet, condemned in the year 1699, by
                    Innocent XII.; and the sentence of condemnation was read by Fénélon himself at
                    Cambray, where he exhorted the people to respect and obey the papal decree.</p>
                <p>A sect similar to this had appeared at Mount Athos in Thessaly, near the end of
                    the fourteenth century; it was called <hi rend="italic">Hesychasts,</hi> meaning
                    the same with Quietists. They were a branch of the mystics, or those more
                    perfect monks who, by long and intense contemplation, endeavoured to arrive at a
                    tranquillity of mind free from every degree of tumult and perturbation. In
                    conformity to an aneient opinion of their principal doctors, who thought there
                    was a eelestìal light concealed in the deepest retirements of the mind, they
                    used to sit every day, during a certain space of time, in a solitary corner,
                    with their eyes eagerly and immoveably fixed upon the middle regions of the
                    belly, or navel; and boasted, that whilst they remained in this posture, they
                    found, in effect, a divine light beaming forth from their soul, which diffused
                    through their hearts inexpressible sensations of pleasure and delight. To such
                    as inquired what kind of light this was, they replied, by way of illustration,
                    that it was the glory of God, the same celestial radiance that surrounded Christ
                    during his transfiguration on the Mount. Barlaam, a monk of Calabria, from whom
                    the Bar-laamites derived their denomination, styled the monks who adhered to
                    this institution Massalians and Euchites; and he gave them also the new name of
                    <hi rend="italic">Umbilicanι,</hi> Gregory Palamas, archbishop of Thessaloniea,
                    defended their cause against Barlaam, who was condemned in a council held at
                    Constantinople in the year 1341.</p>
                <p>The Mahommedans seem to be no strangers to Quietism. They expound a passage in
                    the seventeenth chapter of the Koran, “0 thou soul whieh art at rest, return
                    unto the Lord,” of a soul whieh, having, by pursuing the concatenation of
                    natural causes, raised itself to the knowledge of that being whieh produced them
                    and exists of necessity, rests fully contented, and acquiesces in the knowledge
                    of Him, and in the contemplation of his perfection.</p>
