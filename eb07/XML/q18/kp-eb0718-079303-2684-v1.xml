                <p><label type="entry">QUIN, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    performer on the English stage, was born at London in 1693. He was intended for
                    the bar; but preferring Shakspeare to the statutes at large, he, on the death of
                    his father, when it became necessary for him to do something for himself,
                    appeared on the stage at Drury Lane. In 1720 he first displayed his comic powers
                    in the character of Falstaff, and soon afterwards appeared to as great advantage
                    in Sir John Brute; but it was upon Booth’s quitting the stage that Quin showed
                    to most advantage, in the part of Cato. He continued a favourite performer until
                    the year 1748, when, on some disgust between him and Mr Rich the manager, he
                    retired to Bath, and only came up annually to act for the benefit of his friend
                    Ryan, until the loss of two front teeth spoiled his utterance for the stage.
                    Whilst Mr Quin continued upon the stage, he constantly kept company with the
                    greatest geniuses of the age. He was well known to Pope and Swift; and the Earl
                    of Chesterfield frequently invited him to his table; but there was none for whom
                    he entertained a higher esteem than for the poet Thomson, the author of the
                    Seasons, to whom he made himself known by an act of generosity that does the
                    greatest honour to bis character. Mr Quin’s judgment in the English language
                    recommended him to Frederick prince of Wales, who appointed him to instruct his
                    children in speaking and reading with a graceful propriety; and Quin being
                    informed of the elegant manner in which his majesty delivered his first speech
                    from the throne, he cried out in a kind of ecstasy, “Ay, I taught the boy to
                    speak.” Nor did his majesty forget his old tutor; for, soon after his accession
                    to the throne, he gave orders, without any application being made to him, that a
                    pension should be paid to Mr Quin during his life. Mr Quin, indeed, was not in
                    absolute need of this royal benefaction; for, as he was never married, and had
                    none but distant relations, he sunk L.2000, which was half his fortune, in an
                    annuity, for which he obtained L.200 a year, and, with about L.2000 more in the
                    funds, lived in a decent manner during the latter part of his life at Bath,
                    whence he carried on a regular correspondence with Mr Garrick, and generally
                    paid a visit to his friends in the metropolis once a year, when he con stantly
                    passed a week or two at Mr Garrick’s villa at Hampton. He died of a fever in
                    1766.</p>
