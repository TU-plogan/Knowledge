                <p><label type="entry">ARCHANGEL</label>, a Russian government or stadtholdership in
                    the north of the eastern hemisphere of the globe; for though the city as well as
                    the circle of the same name is comprehended in Europe, yet the government
                    extends, according to Russian division, over great part of Asia. It is bounded
                    on the north by the Frozen Ocean and White Sea; on the east by Tobolsk; on the
                    south-east by Wologda; on the south-west by Olonez, of which a narrow part
                    extends to the White Sea, and separates it from Finland; on the west by Finland;
                    and on the north-west by Norway: but besides these boundaries there are some
                    islands in the White Sea, and the great island Nova Zembla in the Frozen Ocean.
                    The whole extent is 346,120 square miles, or 18,000 square miles more than, the
                    kingdom of France, comprehending 41 degrees of longitude, from 27. 54. to 69.
                    13., and 16⅜ of latitude, from 61. 23. to 78. 4. The climate, though not all
                    alike, is universally raw and cold. Up to the latitude of 65° the spring is
                    moist, with frost at nights; the summer is short, with long but foggy days; the
                    autumn is moist, and the winter begins early. The trees, however, grow, and the
                    rye ripens. The rivers cease to flow from October to April. Between the 65th and
                    47th degrees there are some trees, but dwarfish; corn does not ripen; and
                    animals scarcely endure the temperature. Beyond 67° is a more arctic climate,
                    short summer, long winter, and the soil always frozen below the surface. The
                    rivers are closed in September, and scarcely thaw before July. Though oats and
                    rye grow up to the 65°, yet beyond that the chief subsistence depends on the
                    chase and the fisheries; but even in the most southern parts the bark of trees
                    is mixed with corn to eke out the scanty products of the harvest. The province
                    contains seven cities or towns, and 220 parishes. The inhabitants are Russians,
                    Samoieds, Laplanders, or Permijaks, whose number it is difficult to ascertain.
                    By the latest accounts we have been able to obtain, the males, exclusive of the
                    burghers, were, in 1783, 80,546; the whole may be about 170,000.</p>

                    circle of the same name, is situated on the Dwina where that river flows into
                    the White Sea, and forms the Bay of Dwinskaja. The city is fortified in a very
                    antique manner. All the houses but one are of wood, and the streets are planked
                    instead of being paved. The churches are eleven Greek, and one each for
                    Lutherans and Calvinists. There are a gymnasium, a seminary for priests, an
                    hospital, and 1300 houses, with about 8000 inhabitants, who depend chiefly on
                    foreign, commerce. The harbour is good, but only accessible from July to
                    September. The ships that repair to it are generally of 300 tons burden, mostly
                    British, but some from the Netherlands and the Hans towns. The way to this port
                    was first discovered by the English in the year 1553, since which it has
                    gradually increased in commercial importance. In the year 1819 the arrivals of
                    vessels were 305; the imports amounted to 442,403 rubles, the exports to
                    6,031,088: the former have doubled, and the latter tripled, since the year 1803.
                    The chief exports are, corn, linseed, train-oil, tar, tallow, peltry, wax,
                    honey, mats, linen, bar iron, and copper, the greater part of which is brought
                    from a great distance, some by the Dwina, and some in the winter on sledges. The
                    imports consist chiefly of sugar and other colonial productions, wine, and
                    manufactured goods. The commercial establishments are chiefly branches of
                    mercantile houses of Petersburg, or of English, German, or Dutch merchants
                    residing here. It is in long. 38. 41. 48. E. and lat. 64. 31. 40. N.</p>
