                    principal of the university of 'Aberdeen in the reign of James VI. of Scotland,
                    was born in the year 1538. He studied first at Aberdeen, and was afterwards sent
                    over to France, where, under the famous Cujacius, he applied himself to the
                    study of the civil law. In the year 1563 he returned to Scotland and took
                    orders. Whether he was ordained by a bishop or by presbyters is a matter of
                    uncertainty. In 1568 he was appointed minister of Arbuthnot and Logie Buchan;
                    and in the following year Mr Alexander Anderson being deprived, our author was
                    made principal of the King’s College at Aberdeen in his room. In the general
                    assembly which met at Edinburgh in the years 1573 and 1577 he was chosen
                    moderator, and to the end of his life was an active supporter of the reformed
                    religion. He died in 1583, in the 45th year of his age, and was buried in the
                    College church of Aberdeen. It was by him that Buchanan’s <hi rend="italic"
                    >History of Scotland,</hi> published in 1582, was edited. The only production of
                    his own is his <hi rend="italic">Orationcs de</hi><hi rend="italic">Origine et

                    His contemporary Thomas Maitland wrote a copy of Latin verses on the publication

                    which contributed so much to his future greatness, soon made their appearance.
                    Having there gone through a course of academical studies, and obtained the
                    degree of doctor of physic, he went to London in order to reap the fruits both
                    of his natural and acquired abilities. He then began to display his talents in
                    teaching mathematics, in which he was very expert. <hi rend="italic">An
                    Examination of Dr Woodward’s Account of the Deluge,</hi> &amp;c. in 1697, first
                    made him known to the learned world. This performance was received with great
                    applause; and in 1700 a treatise <hi rend="italic">On the Usefulness of
                    Mathematical Learning</hi> still increased his reputation. A very interesting
                    paper <hi rend="italic">On the Regularity of the Births of both Sexes,</hi>
                    demonstrating from authentic proofs the universal similarity which is observed
                    by nature in this circumstance, and drawing from these Several political and
                    moral inferences, which he presented to the Royal Society, procured his election
                    in 1704 into that body. Meanwhile, in his own proper profession, he Was
                    acquiring considerable eminence, and was appointed, on account of his great
                    medical knowledge, physician extraordinary to Prince George of Denmark, and
                    shortly afterwards one of the physicians in ordinary to Queen Anne. He was
                    admitted in 1710 a fellow of the college. He formed about this period a very
                    intimate acquaintance, Which lasted with unabating tenderness and affection
                    during the rest of his life, with these great literary men, Pope, Gay, and
                    Swift. In 1714 he engaged in an extensive design of making a satire upon all the
                    abuses of science in every branch, in co-operation with Pope and’ Swift, which
                    was to be written under the form of the history of a fictitious character, and
                    in the grave ironical style. The plan was never finished, but the <hi
                    rend="italic">Memoirs</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> 0</hi><hi rend="italic">f
                    Martinus Scriblerus,</hi> published in Pope’s works, form a part, of which much
                    is the performance of Dr Arbuthnot. It is very probable that the whole of the
                    first book is of his composition, in which the great profoundness of knowledge
                    that is discerned, and the good-natured pleasantry with which the satire is
                    directed, has gained it the character of one of the most original, learned, and
                    interesting pieces in the English language. Those parts which relate to anatomy,
                    the manners and customs of antiquity, and logic, are particularly his
                    performance. On the death of Queen Anne he made a visit to Paris, in order to
                    drive away the melancholy which attended him on account of that circumstance,
                    which was a severe stroke to him, and destructive not only to his personal, but
                    also to his political views. Returning from thence, as his medical services were
                    no longer required at St James’s, he retired from it, and followed at large the
                    practice of his profession; yet he did not thcnce give up his literary pursuits,
                    but pursued them with great ardour, although long intervals took place between
                    the times of his publications. A work entitled <hi rend="italic">Tables of
                    Ancient Coins, Weights, and Measures,</hi> explained and exemplified in several
                    dissertations, appeared in 1727, in a 4to volume, which is the chief of his
                    serious performances. Although there are several inaccuracies in it which could
                    hardly be avoided in so intricate a subject, it is a work of great merit, and
                    has ever since been considered as the standard authority. A treatise <hi
                    rend="italic">On the Nature and Choice of Aliments,</hi> which was published in
                    1732, and another published in 1733, <hi rend="italic">On the Effects of Air on
                    Human Bodies,</hi> finish the list of his sterling works. Both these were well
                    received by the faculty, and continue to be still esteemed, and are occasionally
                    read and quoted. Respecting his humorous works, which were the productions of
                    his leisure hours, they are so confounded with those of his contemporaries, that
                    it is not easy to distinguish them. But a piece which, independent of any other,
                    would raise him to the character of the first humorous writer in the English
                    language, entitled the <hi rend="italic">History of John Bull,</hi> is
                    confidently ascribed to him. This is conducted with great wit and humour, and
                    all the circumstances and characters are most admirably adapted. Among his
                    several avowed ironical pieces are, <hi rend="italic">A Treatise concerning the
                    Altercation or Scolding of the Ancients,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Art of
                    Political Lying.</hi></p>
                <p>In the year 1751 there were published two small volumes, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Miscellaneous Worhsof Dr Arbuthnot',</hi> but the greater part
                    of what they contain is denied by his son to be of his composition. As it was
                    customary for him, when any comical occurrence took place, which struck his
                    fancy, to write concerning it in a large folio which lay in his parlour, it is
                    very probable that many slight and imperfect essays, which had gone out of his
                    remembrance, might get abroad into the world. Through all his pieces of this
                    kind there runs a vein of good-natured pleasantry; and this tends to confirm the
                    character given of him by Swift, to a lady who desired to know his opinion
                    concerning Dr Arbuthnot, “He has more wit than we all have, and his humanity is
                    equal to his wit. Although his writings are free from that gall and rancour too
                    common among party writers, yet they cannot be said to be altogether free from a
                    party spirit; and in one ι∏∙ stance he cannot be excused for allowing his
                    personal disíike to overrule his humanity, viz. in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Memorandums of the six days preceding the death of a late T</hi><hi
                    rend="italic superscript"> i</hi><hi rend="italic">9</hi><pb break="no"

                    rend="italic">Reverend</hi> (meaning Bishop Burnet). The indignation of a
                    virtuous man towards an infamous character is sufficient to justify his severity
                    in his bitter <hi rend="italic">Epitaph on Colonel Chartres,</hi> and this
                    severity was probably aggravated by party spirit. Although he had no proper
                    poetical talent, yet he made an effort to try his genius in that kind of
                    composition. A piece published in Dodsley’s collection is valuable for its
                    philosophical sentiment. It is entitled ΓN∩ΘI ΣEA^fTON, <hi rend="italic">Know
                    thyself.</hi> He was also skilled in musie; and Sir J. Hawkins mentions an
                    anthem and a burlesque song whieh are ascribed to him.</p>
                <p>In these occupations he passed his days, amid all the pleasures that can render
                    domestic life happy, in the affection and estimation of his friends, beloved and
                    esteemed by all his literary associates, who have each taken great pains to
                    celebrate their mutual friendship. Swift, in one of his poems, sincerely laments
                    that he is</p>
                <lg part="N">
                    <l part="N"> Far from his kind Arbuthnot’s aid, </l>

                <p>Pope has dedicated to him an epistle called a <hi rend="italic">Prologue to the
                    Satires.</hi> He was full of humility and resignation in all the dispensations
                    of Providence. Of his two sons, he witnessed the’death of one; and the other,
                    with some daughters, survived him. At length, from an inveterate asthma, he fell
                    into a dropsical disorder; and, in order to try the effect of a change of air,
                    he repaired to Hampstead, but without the least gleam of hope respecting a
                    recovery, as he assured his friends Pope and Swift. Returning to his house in
                    London, he died February 27, 1734-5.</p>
