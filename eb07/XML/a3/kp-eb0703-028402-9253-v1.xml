                <p><label type="entry">APIS</label>, a divinity worshipped by the ancient Egyptians
                    at Memphis, namely, an ox, having certain exterior marks. The soul of Osiris was
                    supposed to subsist in the body of this animal. <hi rend="italic">“</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">A</hi> white spot,” says. Pliny, “resembling a crescent, on the
                    right side, and a lump under the tongue, were the distinguishing marks of Apis.
                    When a eow, therefore, which was thought to be struck with the rays of the moon,
                    produced a ealf, the sacred guides went to examine it, and if they found it
                    conformable to this description, they announced to the people the birth of Apis.

                <p>“Immediately,” says AElian, “they built a temple to the new god, facing the
                    rising sun, aeeording to the precepts of Mercury, where they nourished him with
                    milk for four months. At the expiration of this term, the priests repaired in
                    pomp to his habitation, and saluted him by the na∏ <hi rend="superscript">
                    ,e</hi> of Apis. They then placed him in a vessel magnificently deeorated,
                    covered with rich tapestry, and resplendent with gold and conducted him to
                    N∏opolis, singing hymns, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193099266?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0703-9266-0285"/> and burning perfumes. There they kept him for
                    forty days. During this space of time women alone had permission to see him, and
                    saluted him '&gt;ι a particular manner. 4fter the inauguration of the god in
                    this city, he was /conveyed to Memphis with the same retinue, followed by an
                    innumerable quantity of boats sumptuously decked out. There they completed the
                    ceremonies of his inauguration, and he became'sacred ’ to all the world. Apis
                    was superbly lodged, and the place where he lay was mrstically called <hi

                <p>• There was a mysterious term fixed for his life. “Apis,” says Pliny, “cannot
                    live beyond a certain number of years. When he has‘attained that <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 5</hi> period they drown him in the fountain of the priests;
                    for it is not permitted to let him prolong his life beyond the period prescribed
                    for him by the sacred books.” When tlιis event happened he was embalmed, and
                    privately let down into the subterraneous place destined for that purpose, after
                    which the priests announced that he had disappeared; but when he died a natural
                    death before this period arrived, they proclaimed his death, and solemnly
                    conveyed his body to the temple of Serapis. Huet, bishop of Avranches, has
                    endeavoured to prove that Apis was a symbolical image Of the patriarch Joseph,
                    and has supported his opinion with all his erudition. Mr Bryant apprehends that
                    the name <hi rend="italic">Apis</hi> was an Egyptian term for father; that it
                    referred to the patriarch Noah; and that the creseent which was usually marked
                    on the side of the animal was a representation of the ark.</p>
