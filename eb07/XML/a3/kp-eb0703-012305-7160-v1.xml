                    human figure, which, by certain springs or other movements, is capable of
                    performing some of the natural motions of a living man. The motions of the human
                    body are more complicated, and consequently more difficult to be imitated, than
                    those of any other creature; whence the construction of an <hi rend="italic"
                    >androides,</hi> in such a manner as to imitate any of these actions with
                    tolerable exactness, is justly supposed to indicate a greater skill in mechanics
                    than any other piece of workmanship whatever.</p>
                <p>A very remarkable figure of this kind appeared in Paris in the year 1738. It
                    represented a flute-player, and w as capable of performing different pieces of
                    music on the German flute; which, considering the difficulty of blowing that
                    instrument, the different contractions of the lips necessary to produce the
                    distinctions between the high and low notes, and the complicated motions of the
                    fingers, must appear truly wonderful.</p>
                <p>This machine was the invention of Μ. Vaucanson, member of the Royal Academy of
                    Sciences; and a particular description of it was published in the Memoirs of the
                    Academy for that year.</p>
                <p>The figure itself was about 5ļ feet in height, situated at the end of an
                    artificial rock, and placed upon a square pedestal 4⅜ feet high and 3⅜ broad.
                    The air entered the body by three pipes separated one from the other. It was
                    conveyed to them by nine pairs of bellows, three of which were placed above and
                    six below. These were made to expand and contract regularly in succession by
                    means of an axis of steel turned round by some clockwork. On this axis were
                    different protuberances at proper distances, to which were fixed cords thrown
                    over pulleys, and terminating in the upper boards of the bellows, so that, as
                    the axis turned, these boards were alternately raised and let down. A
                    contrivance was also used to prevent the disagreeable hissing fluttering noise
                    usually attending the motion of bellows. This was by making the cord by which
                    the bellows was moved press, in its descent, upon one end of a smaller lever,
                    the other end of which ascending, forced open the small leathern valve that
                    admitted the air, and kept it so till, the cord being relaxed by the descent of
                    the upper board, the lever fell, and the air was forced out. Thus the bellows
                    performed their functions constantly without the least hissing, or other noise
                    by which it could be judged in what manner the air was conveyed to the machine.
                    The upper boards of three of the pairs of bellows were pressed down by a weight
                    of 41bs∙, those of three others by a weight of 21bs∙, and those of the three
                    remaining ones by nothing but their own weight.</p>
                <p>The three tubes by which the air entered terminated in three small reservoirs in
                    the trunk of the figure. There they united, and, ascending towards the throat,
                    formed the cavity of the mouth, which terminated in two small lips adapted in
                    some measure to perform their proper functions. Within this cavity also was a
                    small movable tongue, which, by its play, at proper periods admitted the air, or
                    intercepted its passage to the flute.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097173?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7173-0124"/>
                <p>The fingers, lips, and tongue, received their proper directions by means of a
                    steel cylinder turned by clockwork. It was divided into 15 equal parts, which,
                    by means of pegs pressing upon the ends of 15 different levers, caused the other
                    extremities to ascend. Seven of these levers directed the fingers, having wires
                    and chains affixed to their ascending extremities, which being attached to the
                    fingers, caused them to ascend in proportion as the other extremity was pressed
                    down by the motion of the cylinder, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> Thus
                    the ascent or descent of one end of a lever produced a similar ascent or descent
                    in the corresponding finger, by which one of the holes of the flute was
                    occasionally opened or stopped, as by a living performer. Three of the levers
                    served to regulate the ingress of the air, being contrived so as to open and
                    shut, by means of valves, the three reservoirs of air above mentioned, so that
                    more or less strength might be given, and a higher or lower note produced, as
                    occasion required. The lips were, by a similar mechanism, directed by four
                    levers, one of which opened them, to give the air a freer passage; the other
                    contracted them; the third drew them backward; and the fourth pushed them
                    forward. The lips were projected upon that part of the flute which receives the
                    air; and, by the different motions already mentioned, modified the tone in a
                    proper manner. The remaining lever was employed in the direction of the tongue,
                    which it easily moved so as to shut or open the mouth of the flute.</p>
                <p>Thus we see how all the motions necessary for a fluteplayer could be performed by
                    this machine; but a considerable difficulty still remains, namely, how to
                    regulate these motions properly, and make each of them follow in just
                    succession. This, however, was effected by the following simple method: the
                    extremity of the axis of the cylinder was terminated on the right side by an
                    endless screw, consisting of twelve threads, each placed at the distance of a
                    line and a half from the other. Above this screw was fixed a piece of copper,
                    and in it a steel pivot, which, falling in between the threads of the screw,
                    obliged the cylinder to follow the threads, and instead of turning directly
                    round, it was continually pushed to one side. Hence, if a lever was moved by a
                    peg placed on the cylinder in any one revolution, it could not be moved by the
                    same peg in the succeeding revolution, because the peg would be moved a line and
                    a half beyond it by the lateral motion of the cylinder. Thus, by an artificial
                    disposition of those pegs in different parts of the cylinder, the statue was
                    made, by the successive elevation of the proper levers, to exhibit all the
                    different motions of a flute-player, to the admiration of every one who saw
                    it.</p>
                <p>The construction of machines capable of imitating even the mechanical actions of
                    the human body shows exquisite skill; but what shall we say of one capable, not
                    only of imitating actions of this kind, but of acting as external circumstances
                    require, as though it were endued with life and reason? This, nevertheless, has
                    been done. Μ. de Kempelen, a gentleman of Presburg in Hungary, excited by the
                    performances of Μ. de Vaucanson, at first endeavoured to imitate them, and at
                    last far excelled them. This gentleman constructed an androides capable of
                    playing at chess! Every one who is in the least acquainted with this game must
                    know that it is so far from being mechanically performed, as to require a
                    greater exertion of the judgment and rational faculties than is sufficient to
                    accomplish many matters of greater importance. That this machine really was
                    made, however, the public have had ocular demonstration. The inventor came over
                    to Britain in 1783, where he remained above a year with his automaton.</p>
                <p>It is a figure as large as life, in a Turkish dress, sitting behind a table, with
                    doors of three feet and a half i∏ length, two in depth, and two and a half in
                    height. The chair on which it sits is fixed to the table, which runs on four
                    wheels. The automaton leans its right arm on the table, and in its. left hand
                    holds a pipe: with this <hi rend="superscript"> k</hi> hand it plays after the
                    pipe is removed. A chess-board of 18 inches is fixed before it. This table, or
                    rather cup. board, contains wheels, levers, cylinders, and other pieces of
                    mechanism, all which are publicly displayed. The vestments of the automaton are
                    then lifted over its head, and the body is seen full of similar wheels and
                    levers. There is a little door in its thigh, which is likewise opened; and with
                    this, and the table also open, and the automaton uncovered, the whole is wheeled
                    about the room. The doors are then shut, and the automaton is ready to play; and
                    it always takes the first move.</p>
                <p>At every motion the wheels are heard; the image moves its head, and looks over
                    every part of the chessboard. When it checks the queen it shakes its head twice,
                    and thrice in giving check to the king. It likewise shakes its head when a false
                    move is made, replaces the piece, and makes its own move; by which means the
                    adversary loses one.</p>
                <p>Μ. de Kempełen remarks as the most surprising circumstance attending his
                    automaton, that it had been exhibited at Presburg, Vienna, Paris, and London, to
                    thousands, many of whom were mathematicians and chessplayers, and yet the secret
                    by which he governed the motion of its arm was never discovered. He prided
                    himself solely in the construction of the mechanical powers, by which the arm
                    could perform ten or twelve moves. It then required to be wound up like a watch,
                    after which it was capable of continuing the same number of motions.</p>
                <p>The automaton could not play unless Μ. de Kempelen or his substitute was near it
                    to direct its moves. A small square box, during the game, was frequently
                    consulted by the exhibiter; and herein consisted the secret, which he said he
                    could in a moment communicate. He who could beat Μ. de Kempelcn was, of course,
                    certain of conquering the automaton. It was made in 1769. His own account of it
                    was, “C’est une bagatelle qui n’est pas sans mérite du côté du mechanisme; mais
                    les effets n’en pa-roišsent si merveilleux que par la hardiesse de l’idée, et
                    par l’heureux choix des moyens employés pour faire illusion.” See <hi
