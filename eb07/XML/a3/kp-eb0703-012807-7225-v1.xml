                <p><label type="entry">ANGLE</label>. This term is, owing to the poverty of
                    language, employed to signify very different tilings. In Plane Geometry, it
                    means the opening or separation of two straight lines which meet in a point; but
                    in Solid Geometry, it variously denotes the deviation of a straight line from a
                    plane, the divergence of one plane from another at their line of junction, or
                    even a cluster of plane angles terminating in a common summit. This diversified
                    application of the same word is not likely, however, among mathematicians, to
                    occasion any misconception. But it would be more perspicuous, and certainly more
                    philosophical, to imitate the practice of naturalists in framing a set of
                    cognate words to express the several transitions of meaning.</p>
                <p>The word <hi rend="italic">angle</hi> was drawn from common discourse into the
                    vocabulary of science. Its primitive sense, in all the languages in which it can
                    be traced, is merely a <hi rend="italic">nook</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >corner</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> but it has acquired a more precise and
                    extensive application in its transfer to geometry. In its simplest form, it now
                    denotes generally the <hi rend="italic">divergence</hi> or difference of
                    direction between two concurring straight lines. Yet a learner still experiences
                    some difficulty in seizing the correct idea of its nature, which has always
                    baffled the attempts of authors to reduce to the terms of a strict definition.
                    Apollonius, at once the most elegant and inventive of the Greek geometers, was
                    satisfied with representing an angle as a <hi rend="italic">collection of space
                    about a point,</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi> a description which is not only
                    extremely loose, but which intimates quite a different conception. Euclid, the
                    great compiler of the <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> has defined an angle to
                    be the <hi rend="italic">×Kι&lt;nς,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">mutual inclination
                    of two straight lines that meet.</hi> But, in strict language, this definition
                    should apply only to the acute angle, in which one of the sides leans towards
                    the other, and deflects from the perpendicular. Without an extension of the
                    meaning of the term <hi rend="italic">inclination,</hi> it will not include the
                    obtuse angle, and far less comprehend angles in general; which, since they are
                    capable of repeated additions, must evidently, as much as lines themselves, be
                    susceptible of all degrees of magnitude.</p>
                <p>It is indeed impossible, by any combination of words, to express completely and
                    accurately the primary notions which form the ground of geometrical science. The
                    more profitable task is to trace the process by which the mind, refining on
                    external observation, comes to acquire such abstract ideas. We seem to get the
                    idea of <hi rend="italic">length,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic">linear
                    extension,</hi> by viewing <hi rend="italic">progressive</hi> motion; and the
                    enlarged conception of <hi rend="italic">angles,</hi> or of <hi rend="italic"
                    >angular magnitude,</hi> is easily attained, from the contemplation of <hi
                    rend="italic">revolving</hi> motion. In opening, for instance, the legs of a
                    pair of compasses, we perceive that their difference in direction gradually
                    increases, keeping pace with the turning at the joint. The quantity of this
                    opening properly constitutes the measure of an angle; and an entire revolution,
                    which brings the moving side of the angle back to its first position, furnishes
                    a <hi rend="italic">standard</hi> of reference. The bisected revolution marks
                    the divergence of a directly opposite position, or that of two segments of a
                    straight line at their point of separation; and the half of this, again, or the
                    divergence of a line proceeding from the same point, and turned equally aside
                    from both segments, is the <hi rend="italic">right angle,</hi> which, therefore,
                    being constant, serves to measure all the rest</p>
                <p>Suppose an inflexible straight line AB to turn from right <pb break="no"

                    about the point or vertex A. It first comes to the [position AC, then to AD,
                    next to AE, and now returning it reaches AF, and lastly it gains its original
                    site AB. The angles thus formed at the point A arise from the combination of
                    successive openings.</p>
                <p>The angle BAD is composed of BAC and CAD; the angle BAE, or that of direct
                    opposition, is compounded of BAC, CAD, and DAE; and the entire circuit is made
                    of the accumulated angle BAC, CAD, DAE, EAF, and FAB. This circuit, being
                    quartered by the straight lines BE and DF, is divided at the vertex A into four
                    right angles. By comparison, therefore, the angle BAC is acute, and CAE
                    obtuse.</p>
                <p>But the side AB can attain the direction AC either by moving onwards, or by
                    turning backwards through the points F, E, and D. The angle compounded of the
                    openings BAF, FAE, EAD, and DAC, may hence be termed appropriately the <hi
                    rend="italic">reverse</hi> of BAC. The defect of an angle from a right angle is
                    called its <hi rend="italic">complement,</hi> the defect from two right angles
                    its <hi rend="italic">supplement,</hi> and the defect from four right angles, or
                    the entire circuit, might be conveniently named its <hi rend="italic"
                    >explernent.</hi> Thus, CAD is the <hi rend="italic">complement of</hi> the
                    angle BAC, CAE is its <hi rend="italic">supplement,</hi> and the reverse angle
                    BAC its <hi rend="italic">explement.</hi></p>
                <p>If we consider attentively the formation of angles about a point, we shall be
                    convinced that two concurring straight lines do not contain merely a single
                    angle, but involve an indefinite multitude of angles; in short, that they
                    comprehend all the revolutions and parts of a revolution by which the one line
                    would successively attain the direction of the other. Hence AB will, after
                    describing repeated revolutions, always return into the same position AC. Thus,
                    if A represent the measure of an angle, and C that of a whole circuit, or four
                    right angles; then the primary angle will include likewise A + C, A + 2C, A +
                    3C, A⅛4C, continued for ever. Of those successive angles, A, A + C, A + 2C, A +
                    3C, A + 4C, &amp;c. the sines, tangents, and secants are severally the same; and
                    so are the versed sines, the cosines, cotangents, and cosecants. This extension
                    of the doctrine of angles is of the greatest importance in the higher branches
                    of geometry, in the application of trigonometrical formulae, and in algebraical
                    analysis.</p>
                <p>Euclid, in the course of his reasoning, has frequent occasion to combine angles
                    together; and yet he never ventures beyond the consideration of those angles
                    which are less than two right angles. Had he composed his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Elements</hi> after the science of trigonometry came to be cultivated, he could
                    not have failed to take more enlarged views of angular magnitude. In consequence
                    of his narrow conception of the constitution of angles, the Greek geometer is
                    not a little cramped sometimes, and obliged to adopt a circuitous mode of
                    demonstration. For instance, in the 20th prop, of his third book, that “the
                    angles at the circumference are the halves of those at the centre standing on
                    the same arc,” he quite overlooks the case of obtuse angles at the
                    circumference. But, in the annexed figure, the angle ABC is clearly the half of
                    the <hi rend="italic">reverse</hi> angle AOC at the centre, which is subtended
                    by the large arc AEC. It hence follows that the obtuse angles ABC and ADC
                    contained in the same seg-</p>
                <p>VOL. ι∏.</p>
                <p>ment must be equal, since they are both of them halves of the same <hi
                    rend="italic">reverse</hi> angle AOC. Yet, in demonstrating this very obvious
                    corollary, Euclid is constrained to divide the obtuse angles into portions which
                    are shown to be the halves of corresponding angles at the centre. For the same
                    reason he finds it necessary to give a distinct demonstration of the celebrated
                    proposition, that “the angle contained in a semicircle is a right angle.” But
                    this property ought likewise to be considered as a mere corollary; for if the
                    radii OA and OC were supposed to extend in one straight line, and thus form the
                    diameter of the circle, their angle AOC would become equal to two right angles,
                    and consequently ABC, its half, would be one right angle. See Leslie’s <hi

                    the limits of elementary geometry. They soon perceived that such problems cannot
                    be solved by any combination of mere straight lines or circles. To this
                    conclusion they were led directly by the application of <hi rend="italic"
                    >geometrical analysis,</hi> a beautiful instrument of discovery which Plato had
                    recently invented or improved. Their investigations pointed at some curves of a
                    higher order than the circle, and opened to them a wide and interesting field of
                    research.</p>
                <p>The analysis of the trisection of an angle, conducted in two different ways,
                    terminates in the construction of the <hi rend="italic">conchoid,</hi> a complex
                    curve which was first proposed by Nicomedes. As the subject is very curious, and
                    throws great light on the theory of angular magnitude, we shall here not only
                    give both the ancient methods of investigation, but subjoin a third which is due
                    to the sagacity of Newton.</p>
                <p>1. Let it be required to trisect the angle BAC or the arc BC. Suppose the thing
                    already done, and the angle BAD to be the third part of the given angle. From
                    the point C draw CE parallel to AD, meeting the extended diameter in E, and
                    cutting the circumference of the circle in the point F; join FD and FA. It is
                    obvious that the angle BAD is the half of DAC, the remaining part of the whole
                    angle, and therefore equal to the angle DFC at the circumference. But AD and EC
                    being parallel, the angle BAD is equal to AEF, which is hence equal to DFC; and
                    consequently FD is parallel to EB. Wherefore the arc BD is equal to GF, and the
                    angle BAD equal to GAF. The angle AEF is thus equal to EAF, and hence the side
                    EF is equal to AF, the radius of the circle.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193097251?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-7251-0130"/>
                <p>To solve the problem, therefore, it would be requisite ' to infleet from C a
                    straight line CFE, such, that the portion FE, intercepted between the
                    circumference and the diameter, or its extension, should be equal to the radius
                    of the circle. The radius AD, drawn parallel to this inflected line CE, would
                    cut off an angle BAD, which is the third part of the given angle BAC.</p>
                <p>But elementary geometry will not in general furnish the means of infleeting CE,
                    according to the required conditions. This must be done either tentatively, that
                    is, by repeated trials, or by the application of a curve, so constituted that
                    every straight line drawn from the <hi rend="italic">pole</hi> C to the <hi
                    rend="italic">directrix</hi> BG shall have the portion EF, intercepted by the
                    curve, equal to AB. This curve is, from its general shape or resemblance to a
                    <hi rend="italic">conch</hi> or shell, named the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conchoid:</hi> it consists of two branches, one above the directrix called the
                    <hi rend="italic">interior conchoid,</hi> and the other below it called the <hi
                    rend="italic">exterior conchoid.</hi> The conchoid being described, will, by its
                    intersection with the circumference of the circle, give the point F, and
                    consequently the position of the trisecting line AD'. But such a complex curve
                    must cut the circumference in more points than one, and consequently the problem
                    of angular trisection, viewed in its generality, admits of several answers. In
                    fact, there are always <hi rend="italic">three</hi> distinct positions of the
                    inflected line CE, which will fulfil the conditions of the problem.</p>
                <p>It is curious to examine these different positions of the inflected line. Draw
                    AD' parallel to the <hi rend="italic">second</hi> position CE', and join D'F,
                    AD', and AF'. Because AF' is equal to E'F', the angle E'AF' is equal to AE'F';
                    and, consequently, the exterior angle AF'C is the double of either of these. But
                    CAF' being an isosceles triangle, AF'C is equal to ACF', which again is equal to
                    the alternate angle CAD'; wherefore CAD' is the double of the angle AE'F'; and
                    being likewise the double of CF'D' at the circumference, the angles CF'D' and
                    AE'F' are equal, and, consequently, F'D' and E'A parallel. Now the angle CAD'
                    being double of E'AF' or D'AG, and the angle CAD double of DAB, the arc DCD' is
                    double of the arcs D'G and DB, which serve to complete the semicircumference;
                    wherefore this arc DCD' is two third parts of the semicireumferenee, or one
                    third of the whole circumference.</p>
                <p>In the <hi rend="italic">third</hi> position AD" of the trisecting line, draw CF"
                    parallel to it, and join AF" and D"F". The isosceles triangles D"AF'' and AF"E"
                    have equal vertical angles; and, consequently, the angles at their base are
                    likewise equal; wherefore AF"D" is equal to the alternate angle F"AE", and the
                    chord D"F" parallel to the diameter BG. But the reverse angle CAD" standing on
                    the are CD'D" is double of the angle CF"D" at the circumference, and therefore
                    double of BE"F" or of BAD"; and the angle CAD being by the first construction
                    likewise double of BAD, the reverse angle CAD", together with CAD, must be
                    double of BAD" and BAD, or the arc CD'GD" is double of DBD", which completes the
                    eireumference. Hence the arc DD'D" is two thirds of the circumference.</p>
                <p>It thus appears that the construction of the problem assumes three different
                    aspects, and that the trisecting lines, to whieh a elose analogy conducts us,
                    mutually di∙ vide the whole circuit into equal portions. These results are
                    perfectly conformable with the theory of angulaι magnitude. For if A denote the
                    arc BC, and C the whole cireumferenee, this arc will be generally expressed by
                    A. A + C, A÷2C, &amp;c.; consequently, the third part will be expressed by ⅛∙A,
                    ⅛∙A + ^C, ¾A + ∣C, &amp;c., which evidently correspond to BD, BD' and BD". But
                    any farther exteι⅛. sion of this progression only brings the trisecting line
                    back into its former positions.</p>

                    the pole C, on either side of the directrix BG, with a measure equal to the
