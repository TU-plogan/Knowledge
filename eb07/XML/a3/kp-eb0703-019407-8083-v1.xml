                <p><label type="entry">ANNAN</label>, a royal borough and parish of Scotland, in the
                    county of Dumfries, situated on the river of the same name, about two miles
                    above its junction with the Solway Frith. An elegant new bridge of three arches
                    has been built within these three years. It has a good harbour; the highest
                    tides rise 21 feet; 23 vessels belonged to the port in 1818, registering 1025
                    tons; at present (1830) there are 39 vessels, registering 3054 tons. These
                    vessels are chiefly employed in the coasting trade. A cotton spinning
                    manufactory has been long established in the town, giving employment to between
                    80 and 100 persons of different ages. The salmon fishery, which in former years
                    was so very productive, has fallen off very considerably. The town has recently
                    been much improved by the addition of several new streets and public buildings:
                    among the latter is a handsome new academy, built and endowed by the heritors
                    and borough-council; it is conducted by a rector and two masters, and is in a
                    very flourishing state. The town unites with Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Sanquhar,
                    and Lochmaben, in sending a representative to parliament. The environs are very
                    inviting; and few places are more beautiful than the river and its finely wooded
                    banks, for eight or ten miles above the town. There was formerly a castle, built
                    by the Bruces after they became lords of Annandale. The population of the parish
                    is 4500, of the town 3000. The latter is 16 miles from Dumfries, and 78 from
                    Edinburgh.</p>
                <p>The river Annan, on which the town stands, rises in the county of Peebles, and
                    flowing through Dumfriesshire, falls into the Solway Frith after a course of 30
                    miles. It abounds with trout and salmon. The stewartry or district of Annandale,
                    of which Lochmaben castle was the chief fortalice, is a fertile vale, 24 miles
                    long and about 14 miles broad. From its vicinity to England, and the continual
                    incursions and predatory wars of the borderers, the greater part of it was
                    uncultivated and common; but since the beginning of the last century all these

                    the country has assumed a new appearance, which may be ascribed not only to the

                <p>Annandale formed a part of the Roman province of Valentia; and Severus’s wall
                    ending at Bowpess on the opposite coast of the Solway, it abounds with Roman
                    stations and antiquities.</p>
                <p>The Roman camps at Birrens in Middlebie, on the hill of Birrenswark, and at
                    Torwood Muir in Dryfesdale, are still nearly entire, and their form is
                    preserved; and the traces and remains of a military road are yet visible in
                    different parts of the country. The ruins of the house or castle of Auchincass,
                    in the neighbourhood of Moffat, once the seat of that potent baron Thomas
                    Randolph, earl of Murray, lord of Annandale, and regent of Scotland during the
                    minority of David II., covers above an acre of ground, and even now conveys an
                    idea of the plan and strength of the building. The ancient castle of Comlongan,
                    formerly belonging to the Murrays, earls of Annandale, and now to the earl of
                    Mansfield, is still in a tolrable state of preservation; but except this castle,
                    and that of Hoddam, most of the other old fortalices and towers are now taken
                    down or in ruins.</p>
