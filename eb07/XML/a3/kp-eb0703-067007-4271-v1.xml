                <p><label type="entry">ASHMOLE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Elias</hi></label>, an
                    industrious English antiquary and philosopher of the 17th century, was born at
                    Lichfield in 1617. Having enjoyed the advantages of a country education, he went
                    to London at the age of 16, and resided in the family of James Paget, Esq. one
                    of the barons of the exchequer, and then turned his attention to the law and
                    various branches of literature. In the year 1638 he married, and commenced the
                    business of attorney in London. When the civil war began, he, being then a
                    widower, entered into the king’s service in the ordnance department. When
                    residing in the city of Oxford in that capacity, he entered Brazen Nose College,
                    and began the study of natural philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. Naturally
                    inclined to grave and scientific trifles, he wandered too far into the wilds of
                    astrological imposture, not a little encouraged by several eminent meh of that
                    age. From the same cause he entered keenly into the secrets of masonry, and made
                    considerable additions to the history of that sect.</p>
                <p>When Worcester was surrendered to the parliament in 1646, Ashmole retired to
                    London, where he became acquainted with the famous astrologers, Moore, Lilly,
                    and Booker. Having removed to Berkshire in the year following, he added the
                    knowledge of botany to his other acquirements. There he became acquainted with
                    lady Mainwaring, a well-jointured widow, whom he married in 1649; and although
                    her estate was sequestrated on account of his loyalty, yet through the interest
                    of Lilly and others he again recovered it, and afterwards settled in London,
                    where his house became the resort of all the curious literati. A taste for
                    chemistry, or rather alchemy, was produced, by his conversation with William
                    Blackhousc; and Ashmole, under a feigned name, published a work upon that
                    subject. The next effort of his industry was a collection of the manuscripts of
                    English alchemy, which he published under the title of <hi rend="italic"

                    in 4to. This work was the effect of great labour arid expense; and although it
                    procured him much fame among the learned, yet it was only a collection of <hi

                    ignorant of real chemical knowledge. About this period he began to number among
                    his acquaintances Selden, Oughtred, and Dr Wharton.</p>
                <p>The wealth he acquired by his marriage engaged him in several disputes, and the
                    lady herself at last made an attack upon him in chancery, but he was honourably
                    acquitted, and the lady restored to hęr affectionate husband. His active
                    industry never wearied, and hc next attended to the study of antiquity and the
                    investigation of records. Along with Sir W. Dugdale, he about this period traced
                    a Roman road to Lichfield. Abandoning all other pursuits, he began to make
                    preparations for his <hi rend="italic">History of the Order of the Garter.</hi>
                    Upon a visit to Oxford, he gave a full description of the coins bequeathed to
                    that university by Laud; and about this time John Trades-cant, the famous
                    gardener of Lambeth, presented him with the collection of curiosities which both
                    he and his father had procured.</p>
                <p>Upon the restoration, Ashmole was greatly respected by the king, who made him
                    Windsor herald, and employed him to give a description of the royal medals. The
                    offices of commissioner and comptroller of excise were conferred upon him; and
                    being called to the bar in the Middle Temple, he was afterwards admitted a
                    fellow of the Royal Society. The university of Oxford conferred upon him the
                    degree of doctor of physic; and several other employments and emoluments were
                    given him, until he rose to the highest eminence in the literary world. About
                    this time his second wife died, and he married the daughter of his friend Sir W.
                    Dugdale. In May 1662 he addressed his great work to the king, entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The Institution·) Laws, and Ceremonies of the most noble Order of
                    the Garter</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> folio, London, 1672. In favour of his
                    brother-in-law Mr Dugdale, he resigned his office of herald of Windsor; and when
                    offered the office of garter king-at-arms, he declined it in favour of Sir.W.
                    Dugdale. About this time a fire broke out in one of the chambers of the temple
                    <pb break="no" facs="nls:193104284?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0703-4284-0671"/>
                    adjacent to his, and consumed a library which he had been collecting during the
                    course of 33 years, together with 9000 coins and many valuable antiquities; but
                    his manuscripts and gold medals fortunately were saved. In 1683 he sent his
                    manuscripts and curiosities to the university of Oxford, which laid the
                    foundation of the <hi rend="italic">AIu-saeum Asĥmoleanum,</hi> still in Oxford.
                    On the death of Sir W. Dugdale, he refused a second time the office which that
                    gentleman had enjoyed. He died at the age of 76, and was interred in the church
                    of Great Lambeth.</p>
