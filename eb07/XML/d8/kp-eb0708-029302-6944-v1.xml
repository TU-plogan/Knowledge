                <p><label type="entry">DUTENS</label>, Louis, a late French writer of some
                    eelebrity, was born at Tours, of Protestant parents, on the l5th of January
                    1730. In his youth he addicted himself to poetry; and in 1748 he repaired to
                    Paris and composed a tragedy, entitled <hi rend="italic">The Return of Ulysses
                    to Ithaca,</hi> which he showed to the comedian Lanoue, requesting him to bring
                    it on the stage. The latter, how ever, returned the piece, advising the author
                    to retouch it. Irritated at this advice, Dutens went to Orleans, where he got
                    his play represented with great applause; but he soon became sensible of the
                    faults of his work, and abandoned a species of composition in whieh he found he
                    was not destined to excel. He soon afterwards went to England. Before leaving
                    France, he aecidentally became acquainted with Miss Pitt, sister to the Earl of
                    Chatham, who gave him a letter to her brother; but after a short stay in London
                    he returned to Franee. Not long afterwards, he was recalled to London by one of
                    his uncles, to accompany a young English nobleman on his travels. Soon after his
                    arrival, the young nobleman ehanged his intention; but, at the same time, he
                    procured for Dutens the situation of a tutor in a private family. The father of
                    the pupil was a man of considerable literary and seientifie attainments, who
                    instructed Dutens in those branches of knowledge in whieh he was deficient. In
                    this manner he learnt Greek and mathematics; and he at the same time applied
                    himself to the oriental languages, and to Italian and Spanish. At the end of
                    three years his pupil died; but one of his sisters being deaf and dumb, Dutens
                    undertook to educate her. His young pupil, however, having become enamoured of
                    her instructor, he deemed it a matter of delicaey and of duty to leave the
                    house.</p>
                <p>About this time he was appointed ebaplain and secretary to the Honourable Mr
                    Stuart Maekenzie, the English minister at the court of Turin, and left England
                    in the month of October 1758. In 1760, when Mr Mackenzie returned to England,
                    the secretary remained at Turin as charge d’affaires. Dutens eame to England in
                    1762, and attached himself to the family of Lord Bute, who, before he retired
                    from office in 1763, procured him a pension. He again went to Turin as chargé
                    d’affaires, and during this second mission he undertook the task of collecting
                    and publishing a complete edition of the works of Leibnitz, and wrote his work
                    on the <hi rend="italic">Discoveries of the Ancients.</hi> He afterwards quitted
                    Turin, returned to Britain, and attached himself to the Duke of Northumberland,
                    who procured him a living in the north of England. He accompanied the duke’s
                    son, Lord Algernon Perey, in his travels through France, Italy, Germany, and
                    Holland; and while at Paris, he was chosen a member of the AEademy of
                    Inscriptions. In 1776 he returned to England, and soon afterwards aeeompanied Mr
                    Mackenzie and his lady on a tour to Naples. On his return he was invited by Lord
                    Mountstuart, who had been appointed envoy extraordinary, to aecompany him to
                    Turin, and Dutens found himself for the third time chargé d’affaires at that
                    eourt, during a short absence of the envoy. From Turin, which he left on aeeount
                    of some unpleasant circumstances, he went to Florence, and thenee to Rome. He
                    was in Paris in 1783, and returned to London the following year. The revenue lie
                    derived from his living of Elsdon, amounting to L.800 per annum, together with a
                    considerable legacy left him by Mr Mackenzie, and estimated at L. 15,000,
                    enabled him to pass the remainder of his life in affluenee, and in the best
                    company. He died at his house, Mount Street, Grosvenor Square, on the 23d of May
                    1812.</p>
                <p>Dutens was the editor of the works of Leibnitz, published at Geneva, 1769, in 6
