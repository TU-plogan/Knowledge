                    rend="smallcaps">Monceau, Henri Louis,</hi> author of many valuable works on
                    agriculture, natural history, and the arts, son of Alexander du Hamel, lord of
                    Denainvilliers, and of Ann Trottier, was born at Paris in 1700. His family had
                    formerly emigrated to Holland, but returned to France as early as the year 1400,
                    with the Duke of Burgundy.</p>
                <p>He was educated at the College d’Harcourt; but the chief advantage which he
                    derived from his residence there, was a taste for the further acquirement of
                    physical knowledge, which he afterwards pursued with ardour at the Jardin du
                    Roi, having for his fellow-students a number of young men, who afterwards
                    acquired a high degree of celebrity, and among the rest Dufay, Geoffroi, Léméri,
                    Jussieu, and Vaillant. At the age of twenty-eight he obtained the title of
                    adjunct botanist in the Academy of Sciences; in 1730 he became an associate, and
                    in 1738 an academician, having previously been elected a fellow of the Royal
                    Society of London, in the beginning of 1734. Upon his first admission into the
                    list of the academy, his assistance was requested in the investigation of a
                    disease which affected the saffron cultivated in the Gâtinois, where his estate
                    was situated; and he found reason to attribute it to a parasitical fungus
                    attached to the roots of the plant. His memoirs and notes communicated to the
                    academy, as well as his separate publications, are so multitudinous, that the
                    shortest possible enumeration of their subjects can barely be brought within the
                    ordinary limits of a biographical article.</p>

                <p>The earlier part of Mr Duhamel’s life was chiefly devoted to the study of
                    vegetable physiology, which he had continued for thirty years before the
                    publication of his principal works. The most original of his observations
                    related to the growth of plants, the formation of the bark and the wood, the
                    effects of grafting, the inversion of a tree, the double motion of the sap, and
                    the influence of light, air, and soil. In agriculture he introduced the practice
                    of drying corn in a particular stove or kiln, with a heat sufficient to destroy
                    the insects which infested it and their larvas. He made many experiments on
                    manures, . and he conferred a great benefit on several provinces of France, by
                    introducing the cultivation of potatoes into general practice, as well as by
                    promoting that of rhubarb in different places.</p>
                <p>Having obtained from Μ. Maurepas the appointment of inspector-general of the
                    marine, he undertook to make himself master of every department of nautical
                    knowledge; and setting out with the established doctrines of Euler and Bouguer,
                    where theory was wanted, he collected for his works on these subjects an immense
                    mass of facts and experiments, affording the means of resolving every question
                    on practical grounds. He established a school for ship-builders, which
                    effectually secured to them an education superior to that of simple carpenters.
                    He also <pb break="no" facs="nls:193326463?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0708-6463-0256"/> made some very valuable improvements in the
                    theory of rope-making, showing especially the disadvantages arising from the
                    excessive twisting of cordage. His conduct in this capacity seems to have been
                    as judicious in a moral as in a mechanical point of view; whilst by his modesty
                    and good nature he silenced the contending passions of those with whom he was
                    obliged to enter into discussion, and was enabled to unite a variety <hi
                    rend="italic">of</hi> opposite interests, in the important object of the
                    establishment of an academy for the cultivation of naval science.</p>
                <p>His meteorological observations included, besides the usual registers, accounts
                    of the direction of the magnetic needle, of the state of agriculture, of the
                    diseases of the year, and of the times of migration of birds, and of the
                    appearance of their young.</p>
                <p>From his experiments on the growth of their bones, he inferred that they are
                    enlarged by means of the ossification of the laminae of the periosteum, nearly
                    in the same manner as trees are known to grow by the hardening of the cortical
                    layers; although the bones, while they are soft, expand in every direction, as
                    the very young shoots of vegetables are also found to do. Having learned from
                    Sir Hans Sloane that madder possesses the property of giving colour to the
                    bones, he fed animals successively on food mixed and not mixed with madder; and
                    he found that their bones in general exhibited concentric strata of red and
                    white, whilst the softer parts showed in the mean time signs of having been
                    progressively extended. These experiments are still of great importance in
                    illustrating the physiology of ossification, although the actual conversion of
                    the periosteum into bone may justly be disputed.</p>
                <p>In trees Mr Duhamel found that the graft was incorporated with the stock, so as
                    to form a single substance completely identical with it; and he showed that
                    animal bodies were capable of a similar union, the vessels of the anirņals
                    forming communications with those of the parts insérted; the spur of a cock, for
                    instance, grafted into his comb, uniting perfectly with it, and becoming
                    gradually furnished with a bony core, like the horn of a bullock, which either
                    forms a joint with the cranium, or is firmly attached to it, and affords
                    nourishment for the growth of this newly adopted member.</p>
                <p>Having demonstrated in 1737 the different natures of soda and potass, he made an
                    interesting experiment on the production of these alkalies by different
                    vegetables. He sowed the head of the salsola kali at Denainvilliers, and it was
                    found by the analysis of Mr Cadet that its ashes produced at first soda, but
                    afterwards more and more potass every year; and after several generations almost
                    entirely potass. His other chemical memoirs were of less permanent importance;
                    and, with respect to the weight of ignited iron, he was unfortunately inaccurate
                    in his mode of conducting the experiment, otherwise it must necessarily have led
                    him to an anticipation of some of the most important discoveries of the last
                    century.</p>
                <p>From his extensive correspondence in different countries, lie was enabled to
                    communicate to the academy from time to time a number of detached facts, which
                    were both amusing and instructive, and which appear perpetually in the histories
                    of the respective years. His works were in general <hi rend="italic">of an</hi>
                    elementary nature, and calculated for the usc of such as possessed but little
                    previous information; and hence they may appear to some readers to contain an
                    unnecessary detail of explanation. “Prolixity,” says Mr Condorcet, “is injurious
                    to perspicuity, when we are addressing ourselves to persons accustomed to fix
                    their attention firmly on the subject before them, who are able to observe the
                    slightest shades of difference, and to receive at once a variety of ideas;
                    supplying, where there is occasion, any connecting links of the chain which may
                    have been omitted. If we are too diffuse, the attention of such persons droops
                    for want of excitement; their memory is fatigued with the attempt to retain
                    impressions which have not been communicated to them with sufficient force; and
                    when they are compelled to travel slowly, the delay exhausts them, from having
                    been in the constant habit of a more rapid motion. But it was not for this very
                    limited class of readers that Mr Duhamel’s works were calculated. He wrote for
                    the use of those who seldom go beyond the bare expressions of the author, who
                    find all close attention toilsome, and who read rather for simple information
                    than for the cultivation of the mind; and an author may always be said to write
                    well when his style is appropriate to his subject, and to the capacity of his
                    readers.”</p>
                <p>Mr Duhamel was economical in his habits of life, and disinterested in his views,
                    sacrificing his own pecuniary advantage, and that of his family, to the desire
                    of serving the public by his experiments and his writings. Having once
                    established a certain scale for his expenses, he never troubled himself with
                    keeping a minute account of them. His integrity sometimes wore the appearance of
                    severity, and his vivacity that of harshness; but no imputation was ever cast on
                    the goodness of his heart. He was averse to all changes, both in political and
                    scientific institutions, which were not connected with obvious improvement. He
                    was punctual in his attention to the duties which his religion imposed on him,
                    but he did not sacrifice to unnecessary parade such of his hours as he thought
                    might be more conscientiously employed in studies of general utility. His
                    application, though assiduous, was seldom severely laborious. He never entered
                    into any matrimonial engagements. On some occasions he felt himself neglected by
                    the public; but he was little disposed to lament this injustice, except from
                    reflecting on the effect which it would have had on an individual less zealous
                    or less independent than himself. Besides his election as <hi rend="italic"
                    >a</hi> fellow of the Royal Society of London, he obtained the honour of
                    diplomas from the academies <hi rend="italic">of St</hi> Petersburg, Palermo,
                    Bologna, Edinburgh, and Padua, and from several agricultural societies; and his
                    name has acquired a celebrity commensurate to the extent of his varied
                    researches.</p>
                <p>Few persons have ever passed through life with greater tranquillity of mind, or
                    with a greater desire of rendering themselves useful to mankind, than Mr
                    Duhamel. He was one of the most active promoters of the kind of revolution which
                    took place in the cultivation of science during the last century, and of which
                    the characteristic distinction was, to endeavour to turn its chief course
                    towards the grand objects of public utility and domestic convenience. Upon this
                    modification of the pursuits of natural philosophy, Mr Condorcet very
                    judiciously remarks, that “if the sciences have sometimes raised themselves too
                    high towards heaven, and if it has been of advantage to recall them towards the
                    earth, we must still shun the opposite error of condemning them to creep on it
                    for ever.” And when we see the paths of discovery open before us, wc must follow
                    boldly wherever they lead us, confident that, sooner or later, all theoretical
                    knowledge may eventually confer some material benefit on society, even with
                    regard to the more practical purposes of life. Mr Duhamel indeed well knew the
                    necessity of previous study and of extensive inquiry for the success of his
                    experimental investigations; and the former half of a longlife he spent chiefly
                    in qualifying himself for making the observations which he recorded, and
                    deriving from them the instructions which he published, in the latter. At a very
                    advanced age his memory began to fail; he still continued his pursuits, but
                    without reaping any advantage <pb break="no" facs="nls:193326476?mode=fullsize"

                    the academy, but took little or no interest in any thing that passed at them;
                    and after having been present at one of these meetings, on the 22d of July 1782,
                    he had an attack of apoplexy, which wholly deprived him of his remaining
                    faculties, and on the 13th of August put an end to his life.</p>
                <p>A few years before his death he had felt very severely the loss of his brother,
                    who had lived constantly at Denainvilliers, and had assisted him in many of his
                    agricultural researches and meteorological observations, though he had always
                    remained anonymous. His nephew, Mr Fou-geroux, had also been useful to him on
                    several occasions in his literary pursuits; and this gentleman became heir to
                    the principal part of the property of both his uncles. <hi rend="italic"
