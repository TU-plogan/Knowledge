                <p><label type="entry">DURANGO</label>, a town of Spain, in the province of Biscay.
                    It stands twenty miles south-east of Bilboa, on one of those numerous streams
                    which, when united, form its river. It contains 2800 inhabitants. Manufactories
                    of iron and steel goods are carried on here.</p>

                    intendancy of Mexico, in North America. According to Humboldt, it extends from
                    long. 104. 40. to 110. 0. W. and from lat. 23. 55. to 29. 5. N.<note
                    anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>According to Major Pike, a
                    more recent traveller in these parts, it is situated between long. 105. and 111.
                    W. and lat. 24. and</p><p>33. N. lie gives its length from north-west to
                    south-east at G00 miles, its greatest breadth at 400, and its population at
                    200,000.</p></note> It is bounded on the west by Sonora; on the east it touches
                    on San Luis Potosi; and towards the north and east, for upwards of 200 leagues,
                    it borders on an uncultivated country, inhabited by warlike and independent
                    Indians. It comprehends the northern extremity of the great table-land of
                    Anahuac. Its length from north to south, from the celebrated mines of Guarisamey
                    to the mountains of Carçay, is 232 leagues. Its breadth is very unequal, and
                    near Parrel is scarcely fifty-eight leagues. Its extent of surface is greater
                    than that of the united kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland; and yet its total
                    population, according to Humboldt, was in 1803 rather less than 160,000. Of
                    these, Major Pikc thinks, three twentieths might be European whites, five
                    twentieths Creoles, five twentieths Mestizoes and half-castes, and seven
                    twentieths Indians. It comprises, besides the city of Durango, six towns
                    (villas), 199 villages (pueblos), seventy-five parishes (paroquias), 152
                    haciencias, thirtyseven missions, and 400 cottages (ranchos).</p>
                <p>The climate of this intendancy is stated by Major Pike to be dry, and the heat,
                    at that period of the year which precedes the rainy season, to be very great.
                    The rains commence in June, and continue by light showers till September. During
                    the remainder of the year there falls neither rain nor snow to moisten the
                    earth, and the atmosphere becomes highly electrified. The agricultural produce
                    consists of wheat, maize, rice, oats, cotton, flax, indigo, and the fruit of the
                    vine. To the north of Chihuahua, about thirty miles to the right of the main
                    road, there is some pine timber. In one place, near a spring, Major Pike noticed
                    a solitary walnut tree; and in all the small streams there are, he says, shrubby
                    cotton trees. “With these few exceptions, the whole province is a naked, barren
                    plain, which presents to the eye an arid unproductive soil; and, more especially
                    in the neighbourhood of mines, even the herbage appears to be poisoned by the
                    qualities of the land.” New Biscay trades with the southern provinces, and also
                    with New Mexico and Sonora, furnishing to the more populous parts of the kingdom
                    a great number of horses, mules, beeves, sheep, and goats, in return for dry
                    goods, European furniture, ammunition, books, and other articles, which are
                    brought from the capital on mules. “Some individuals make large fortunes by
                    being the carriers from Mexico to Chihuahua, the freight being eight dollars per
                    cent.; and they generally put 300 lb. on each mule. The merchants make their
                    remittances twice a year, in bullion. Goods sell at Chihuahua about 200 per
                    cent, higher than the prices in the seaport towns of the Atlantic. This was in
                    1807. Horses then averaged six dollars; some, however, fetched a hundred
                    dollars; and trained mules twenty dollars. Ricc sold for four dollars the
                    hundredweight. They manufacture some few arms, blankets, stamped leather,
                    embroidery, coarse cotton and woollen cloths, and a species of carpeting.” This
                    traveller concludes his statistical account of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193326879?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6879-0288"/> the province
                    by stating, that law here is merely a shadow, the only laws that can be said to
                    be in force being the military and the ecclesiastical; that the corruption of
                    morals is general, this being the natural concomitant of a great degree of
                    luxury among the rich, and of misery among the poor; and that the Roman Catholic
                    religion is in full force, but the inferior clergy are much dissatisfied.</p>
                <p>There are no slaves in this province, nor, according to Humboldt, a single
                    tributary individual; and “all the inhabitants, are either white, or consider
                    themselves as such.” Major Pike explains the state of things more specifically.
                    Except the Apadus, who inhabit the Bolson de Mapimi, there are, he says, no
                    uncivilized tribes in this province. “The Christian Indians are so incorporated
                    amongst the lower grades of Mestizoes, that it is scarcely possible to draw the
                    line of distinction, except at the ranchos of some nobleman or large landholder,
                    where they arc in a state of vassalage. This class of people laid a conspiracy,
                    which was so well concerted as to baffle the research of the Spaniards for a
                    length of time, and to occasion them the loss of several hundreds of the
                    inhabitants. The Indians used to go out from their villages in small parties; in
                    a short time a part would return with a report that they had been attacked by
                    the Indians. The Spaniards would, immediately send out a detachment in pursuit,
                    when they were led into an ambuscade, and every soul cut off. They pursued this
                    course so long that the whole province became alarmed at the rapid manner in
                    which their enemies multiplicd; but some circumstances leading to a suspicion,
                    they made use of the superstition of these people for their ruin. Some officers
                    disguised themselves like friars, and went round amongst the Indians, pretending
                    to bc possessed of the spirit of prophecy. They preached up to them that the day
                    was approaching when a general deliverance from the Spanish tyranny was about to
                    take place, and invited the Indians to join with them in promoting the work of
                    God. The poor creatures came forward, and in their confessions stated the great
                    hand that had already been put to the work. After they had ascertained the
                    nature and extent of the conspiracy, and obtained a body of troops, they
                    commenced the execution, and put to death about four hundred of them. This
                    struck terror and dismay throughout the Indian villages, and they durst not rise
                    to support their freedom and independence.”</p>
                <p>Durango or Guadiana, the principal city, is the residence of the intendant and of
                    a bishop. It is situated in the most southern part of the province, in long.
                    107. W. and lat. 25. N., at 170 leagues distance in a straight line from the
                    city of Mexico, and 289 leagues from the town of Santa Fe, in New Mexico. The
                    elevation of the town above the sea level is 6800 fcet. There are frequent falls
                    of snow, and the thermometer descends to 14° Fahrenheit below the freezing
                    point. The city was founded in 1559. The population in 1803 was 12,000, but
                    Major Pike makes it 40,000. He also states that the city is infested in a very
                    remarkable manner by scorpions. “They come out of the walls and crevices in May,
                    and continue for about a fortnight in such numbers that the inhabitants never
                    walk in their houses after dark without a light, and always shift or examine the
                    bed-clothes and beat the curtains previously to going to rest, after which the
                    curtains are secured under the bed.”</p>
                <p>In the midst of a very level plain, between this city, the plantations Del Ojo
                    and Del Chorro, and the town of Nombre de Dios, which lies in the road to the
                    famous mines of Sombrereto, there arises a singular group of rocks, of a very
                    grotesque form, covered with scoria, called La Breña. They extend twelve leagues
                    from north to south, and rise from east to west, and appear to be a volcanic
                    production, consisting of basaltic amygdaloid. On the summit of one of the
                    neighbouring mountains (the Treayle), is found a crater 300 feet in
                    circumference and 100 feet in perpendicular depth. In the environs of Durango
                    there is also to be found, insulated in the plain, an enormous mass of malleable
                    iron and nickel, said to weigh upwards of 40,000 pounds avoirdupois, and
                    corresponding in its composition to the aëroliths which fell in 1751, near
                    Agram, in Hungary. Major Pike also informs us that there is “a mountain or hill
                    of loadstone” about a hundred miles south of Chihuahua.</p>
