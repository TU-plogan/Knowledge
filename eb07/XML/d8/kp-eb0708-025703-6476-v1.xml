                    without the title or quality of king. The word is borrowed from the Latin
                    through the medium of the modern Greek. Some sovereigns have the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">grand duhe,</hi> as the Grand Duke of Tuscany and the Grand Duke
                    of Muscovy. The title of grand duke belongs to the heir apparent of Russia; and
                    the title of archduke is given to all the sons of the house of Austria, and that
                    of archduchess to all the daughters.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Duke</hi> is also a title of honour or nobility, the next
                    below princes.</p>
                <p>The dukedom, or dignity of duke, is a Roman dignity, so denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi><hi rend="italic">ducendo,</hi> from leading or commanding.
                    Accordingly the first dukcs, <hi rend="italic">duces,</hi> were the <hi
                    rend="italic">ductores exercituum,</hi> leaders or commanders of armies. Under
                    the later emperors, the governors of provinces in time of war were entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">duces.</hi> In after times the same denomination was also given to
                    the governors of provinces in time of peace. The first governor under the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">duke</hi> was a duke of the Marchia Rhaetica, or Grisons,
                    of which mention is made in Cassiodorus; and there were afterwards thirteen
                    dukes in the eastern empire, and twelve in the western. The Goths and Vandals,
                    upon their overrunning the provinces of the western empire, abolished the Roman
                    dignities wherever they settled; but the Franks, in order to humour the Gauls,
                    who had long been used to that form of government, made it a point of policy not
                    to make any change therein; and accordingly they divided all Gaul into duchies
                    and counties, giving to the governors of these sometimes the names of dukes, and
                    sometimes that of counts, or <hi rend="italic">comites.</hi></p>
                <p>In England, during the Saxon times, Camden observes, the officers and commanders
                    of armies were called dukes, <hi rend="italic">duces,</hi> in the ancient Roman
                    manner, without any addition. But after the conqueror came in, the title lay
                    dormant till the reign of Edward III., who created his son Edward, called the
                    Black Prince, first duke of Cornwall; a title which has ever since been the
                    peculiar inheritance of the king’s eldest son during the lifetime of his father,
                    so that he is <hi rend="italic">dux ĩìatus, non</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >creatus.</hi> After this more dukes were made, in such a manner that their
                    titles descended to their posterity. They were created with much solemnity, <hi
                    rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic">cincturam</hi><hi rend="italic">gladii,
                    cappoeque,</hi><hi rend="italic">et circuli</hi><hi rend="italic">αurei
                    in</hi><hi rend="italic">capite impositionem.</hi> In the reign of Queen
                    Elizabeth, however, that is, in 1572, the whole order became utterly extinct;
                    but it was revived about fifty years afterwards by her successor, in the person
                    of George Villiers, duke of Buckingham.</p>
                <p>Though the Freneh retained the names and forms of the ducal government, yet under
                    their second race of kings there was scarcely any such dignity as that of duke.
                    All the great lords were called <hi rend="italic">counts, peers,</hi> or <hi
                    rend="italic">barons,</hi> excepting, however, the Dukes of Burgundy and
                    Aquitain, and the Duke of France, which was a dignity held by Hugh Capet
                    himself, and corresponded to the modern dignity of maire de palais, or the
                    king’s lieutenant. By the weakness of the kings, the dukes or governors
                    sometimes made themselves sovereigns of the provinces entrusted to their
                    administration. This change happened chiefly about the time of Hugh Capet, when
                    the great lords began to dismember the kingdom; so that this prince found more
                    competitors among them than subjects. It was even with great difficulty that
                    they could be brought to own him as their superior, or to consent to hold of him
                    by faith and homage. What with force, and what by marriages, these provinces,
                    both duchies and counties, which had been severed from the crown, were again
                    gradually united to it. But the title of duke was no longer given to the
                    governors of provinces. From that time duke became a mere title of dignity,
                    annexed to a person and his heirs male, without giving him any domain,
                    territory, or jurisdiction over the place of which he was duke. All the
                    advantages of the title now consist in the name, and in the precedence which it
                    gives.</p>
                <p>The dukes of our days retain nothing of their ancient splendour except the
                    coronet on their escutcheon, which is the only mark of their departed
                    sovereignty. They are created by patent, cincture of the sword, mantle of state,
                    imposition of a cap and coronet of gold on the head, and a verge or rod of gold
                    in their hand.</p>
                <p>The eldest sons of dukes are by the courtesy of England styled <hi rend="italic"
                    >marquises,</hi> though they are usually distinguished by their father’s second
                    title, whether it be that of marquis or earl; and the younger sons are <hi
                    rend="italic">lords,</hi> with the addition of their*Christian name, as Lord
                    James, Lord Thomas, Lord Charles, and they take place of viscounts, though not
                    so privileged by the laws of the land.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">DuκE-Duke,</hi> a quality given in Spain to a grandee of the
                    bouse of Sylva, on account ofhis having several duchies from the union of two
                    considerable houses in his person. Don Roderigo de Sylva, eldest son of Don Rπy
                    Gomez de Sylva, and heir of his duchies and principalities, having married the
                    eldest daughter of the Duke de ľInfantado, the Duke de Pastrana, who was
                    descended from her, added to his other great titles that of duke-duke, to
                    distinguish himself from the other dukes, some of whom might enjoy several
                    duchies, but none so considerable ones.</p>
