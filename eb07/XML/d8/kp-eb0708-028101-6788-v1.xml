                <p><label type="entry">DUNFERMLINE</label>, a royal burgh of Scotland, situated in
                    the western district of the county of Fife, fifteen miles north-west of
                    Edinburgh, in longitude 3. 27. 11. west, latitude 56. 5. 3. north. The town is
                    built on an extensive eminence, having a pretty stccp and uniform deelivity
                    towards the south, and likewise declining into a ravine on the west, which
                    divides the more ancient part of the town from the extensive and extending
                    suburb of Pittencrieff. This ravine is crossed by an earthen mound, on which an
                    excellent street has been built, which equals the second-rate streets of the
                    metropolis, and exceeds in its uniformity, and the splendid appearance of its
                    shops, the principal streets of most country towns. The town is situated about
                    270 feet above the level of the sea, and about two miles and a half distant from
                    Limekilns, the nearest place on the eoast. It may be described as consisting of
                    one principal thoroughfare, stretching from east to west, near the top of the
                    eminence on which the town is built, whieh is intersected at right angles by
                    streets running up and down the hill, terminating in a plain both at the top and
                    bottom. From its elevated situation, the prospect all around is very extensive.
                    Seen from the south or west, the town has a very noble appearance, principally
                    from its irregular outline, and the many prominent objects, sueh as steeples and
                    public buildings, with which the whole is adorned; and it is here and there
                    interspersed with gardens and trees, which give it a very pleasing and
                    pieturesque appearance, flanked as it is on the cast and west by the extensive
                    policies of Viewfield and Pittencrieff'. The building most worthy of notice is
                    the Abbey Church, whieh has been erected on the site of the Chureh of the Holy
                    Trinity, built by Malcolm Ceanmore, about the middle of the eleventh century;
                    whieh was demolished by Edward I. on the lOth February 1304, and subsequently at
                    the Reformation, on the 28th of March 1560. However, at the latter period, the

                    till September 1821, when the new church was opened for divine service. It is a
                    splendid edifice, in the most elegant Gothic style. Over the centre of the cross
                    is erected a square tower ninety feet high, terminating in a flat roof, round
                    the four sides of which, in open hewn work, are the words “King Robert the
                    Bruce,” in capital letters four feet in height, surmounted by royal crowns and
                    lofty pinnacles on the four corners, which give an elegant and appropriate
                    finish to the whole. The old church forms a very fine entrance to the new; and,
                    were a little expense laid out in some small repairs, it might be rendered still
                    more impressive. It is of various orders of architecture, accordant with the
                    different ages in which it has been altered and repaired. The interior of the
                    new Abbey Church is even more elegant than its exterior. Its tower and galleries
                    are supported by magnificent pillars, moulded on the solid mason-work with Roman
                    cement, into small columns, which form the aggregate pillar, the capitals of
                    which are adorned with exquisite imitations of foliage. The ribs of the arches
                    composing the different roofs and the central ornaments are in the purest style,
                    and, seen from any point, the effect of the whole is at once magnificent and
                    pleasing. Exactly below the pulpit, which is of wainscot, and in the Gothic
                    style, lie the remains of Robert Bruce; and in the north transept lie seven
                    other kings, two queens, and numbers of the nobility. Besides the old church,
                    all that now remains of the ancient buildings is the south-west wall of the
                    palace, w hich hangs on the brink of a deep hollow, through which runs a small
                    stream. A building over a gate, probably the principal entrance to the palace
                    yard, the south wall of the Refectory or Fraters Hall, and a large window of
                    elegant workmanship, form the whole antiquities of the abbey and palace. There
                    is likewise some slight traces of Malcolm Ceanmore’s tower, which formed the
                    original nucleus of the town. The Guildhall, which was erected in 1808, is a
                    superb edifice of the Grecian order, having a spire a hundred and thirty-two
                    feet in height. It consists of a large hall intended for meetings of guildry;
                    the chamber is occupied as a reading-room, and the rest of the building is
                    fitted up as a hotel. The town-house is a narrow building, with a prison above.
                    The council hall is adorned with some good paintings, and the whole is
                    surmounted by a spire. The Bank of Scotland is an elegant building in the Abbey
                    Park, surrounded with an extensive policy. The High School is a beautiful
                    building in the Grecian style, and is taught by a rector and usher; the
                    Commercial Academy is in the form of a villa, where the several branches of
                    education are taught by two independent teachers, with assistants. A handsome
                    new row of houses has been erected at the eastern entrance to the town.</p>
                <p>The linen trade is of considerable antiquity in Dunfermline; it began originally
                    with ticks and checks. The first table-linen manufactured here was a kind called
                    hucka-buck; this was followed in course of time by damask, the richest and most
                    ingenious kind of table-linen, which has been for the last century improving in
                    quality and pattern, and is still continuing to be improved. The value of
                    table-linens and covers annually manufactured here is estimated at about
                    L.200,000. Another important branch of industry is the spinning of yarns and
                    threads; there are eight large spinning mills, at some of which the very finest
                    quality of yarns is manufactured.</p>
                <p>This town is remarkable as being the theatre in which the principal dissents from
                    the established church have taken their rise; namely, the Seceders under Ralph
                    Erskine, and the Relief under George Gillespie.</p>
                <p>The population of the parish in 1821 was 13,690, and of the town 8041; in 1831
                    the former was 17,068, and the latter 10,624.</p>
