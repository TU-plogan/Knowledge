                    in consequence of the overthrow of Babel at the birth of Peleg (whence he
                    derived his name); and by the account given of his ancestors (Gen. chap. xi.
                    10-16) this appears to have happened in the 10lst year after the Flood,
                    according to the Hebrew chronology, and by the Samaritan computation in the
                    401st. However, various difficulties have been suggested by chronologists
                    concerning the true era of this event. Sir John Marsham and others, in order to
                    reconcile the Hebrew’ and Egyptian chronologies, maintain a dispersion of
                    mankind before the birth of Peleg; whilst others, unable to find numbers
                    sufficient for the plantation of colonies in the space of 101 years, according
                    to the Hebrew computation, fix the dispersion towards the end of Peleg’s life,
                    thus following the computation of the Jews. Petavius assigns the 153d year after
                    the Flood; Cumberland the 180th; and Usher, though he generally refers it to the
                    time of Peleg’s birth, in one place assigns the 131st after the Flood for this
                    event. Mr Shuckford supposes the dispersion to have been gradual, and to have
                    commenced with the separation of some companies at the birth of Peleg, and to
                    have been completed thirty-one years afterwards. According to the calculation of
                    Petavius, the number of inhabitants on the earth at the birth of Peleg amounted
                    to 32,768; but Cumberland makes them 30,000; Mr Mede states them at only 7000
                    men, besides women and children; and Mr Whiston, who supposes that mankind now
                    double themselves iu about 400 years, and that they doubled themselves between
                    the deluge and the time of David in sixty years at a medium, when their lives
                    were six or seven times as long as they have been since, by his computation
                    produces about 2389; a number much too inconsiderable for the purposes of
                    separating and forming distinct nations. This difficulty induced Mr Whiston to
                    reject the Hebrew and to adopt the Samaritan chronology, as many others have
                    done; which, by allowing an interval of 401 years between the Flood and the
                    birth of Peleg, furnishes, by the last-mentioned mode of computation, more than
                    240,000 persons.</p>
                <p>As to the manner of the dispersion of the posterity of Noah from the plain of
                    Shinar, it was undoubtedly conducted with the utmost regularity and order. The
                    sacred historian informs us that they w ere divided in their lands, every one
                    according to his tongue, according to his family, and according to his nation
                    (Gen. x. 5, 20, 31); and thus, as Mr Mede observes, they were ranged according
                    to their nations, and every nation was ranged by its families, so that each
                    nation had a separate lot, and each family a separate share in what fell to
                    every nation. The following abstract will serve to give a general idea of their
                    respective settlements. Japhet, Noah’s eldest son, had seven sons. Of these,
                    Gomer was he whose descendants inhabited those parts of Asia which lie upon the
                    AEgean Sca and Hellespont northward, containing Phrygia, Pontus, Bithynia, and a
                    great part of Galatia. The Galatians, according to Josephus, were called <hi
                    rend="italic">Gomeroei</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> while the Cimmerii,
                    according to Herodotus, occupied this track of country; and from these
                    Gomerians, Cimmerii, or Celts, Mr Camden derives our ancient Britons, who still
                    retain the name <hi rend="italic">Cymru</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Cyιηri.</hi>
                    Magog, the second son of Japhet, was probably the father of the Scythians on the
                    east and north-cast of the Euxine Sea. Madai planted Media, though Mr Mede
                    assigns Macedonia to his share. Javan was the father of the Grecians about
                    Ionia, whose country lies along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea; the radices
                    of Javan and Ionia being the same. To Tubal and Meshech belonged Cappadocia and
                    the country which lies on the borders of the Euxine Sea; and from them,
                    migrating over Caucasus, it is supposed the Russians and Muscovites are
                    descended. Tiras occupied Thrace. The sons of Shem were five: Elam, whose
                    country lay between the Medes and Mesopotamians, and was called by the Gentile
                    writers <hi rend="italic">Elemais</hi> (Josephus calls the Elamites the founders
                    of the Persians); Ashur, who was driven out of Shinar by Nimrod, afterwards
                    settled in Assyria, and there built Nineveh and other cities; Arphaxad, who gave
                    name to the country which Ptolemy calls <hi rend="italic">Arraphacitis,</hi> a
                    province of Assyria, though Josephus makes him the father of the Chaldees; Lud,
                    who inhabited and gave name to the country of Lydia, about the river Maeander,
                    remarkable for its windings, in Asia Minor; and Aram, the father of the Syrians.
                    Ham, the youngest son of Noah, had four sons: Cush, whose posterity spread into
                    the several parts of Arabia over the borders of the land of Edom, into Arabia
                    Felix, up to Midian and Egypt; Mizraim, the father of them who inhabited Egypt
                    and other parts of Africa; Phut, to whom Bochart assigns the remaining part of
                    Africa, from the Lake of Tritonides to the Atlantic Ocean, called <hi
                    rend="italic">Libya</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and Canaan, to whom belonged
                    the land of Canaan, whence the Phoenicians derived their origin.</p>
                <p>Dr Bryant has advanced a ncw hypothesis on this subject, and supported it with
                    his usual acuteness and learning. He maintains that the dispersion as well as
                    the confusion of tongues was local, and limited to the inhabitants of the
                    province of Babel; that the separation and distribution recorded to have taken
                    place in the days of Peleg (Gen. X. 25, 31, 32), which was the result of divine
                    appointment, occasioned a general migration; and that all the families amongst
                    the sons of men were concerned in it. The house of Shcm, from which the Messiah
                    was to spring, was particularly regarded in this distribution. The portion of
                    his children was near the place of separation; they <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193323694?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-3694-0043"/> in general had
                    Asia to their share, as Japhet had Europe, and Ham the large continent of
                    Africa. But the sons of Cush would not submit to the divine dispensation. They
                    went off under the conduct of Nimrod, and scem to have been for a long time in a
                    roving state. However, at last they arrived at the plains of Shinar; and having
                    ejected Ashur and his sons, who were placed there by divine appointment, seized
                    his dominions, and there laid the foundation of a great monarchy. But afterwards
                    fearing lest they should be divided and scattered abroad, they built the tower
                    of Babel as a land-mark to which they might repair, and probably to answer the
                    purposes of an idolatrous temple, or high altar, dedicated to the host of
                    heaven, from which they were never long to be absent. They only, viz. the sons
                    of Cush, or the Cushites, and their associates from other families, who had been
                    guilty of rebellion against divinc authority, and of wicked ambition and
                    tyranny, were punished with the judgment of confounded speech through a failure
                    in labial utterance, and of the dispersion recorded in Genesis; in consequence
                    of which they were scattered abroad from this city and tower, without any
                    certain place of destination. The Cushites invaded Egypt, or the land ofMizraim,
                    in its infant state, seized the whole country, and held it for some agcs in
                    subjection; and they extended likewise to the Indies and Ganges, and still
                    farther in China and Japan. From them the province of Cushan or Goshen in Egypt
                    derived its name. Here they obtained the appellation of royal shepherds; and
                    when they were by force driven out of the country, after having been in
                    possession of it for 260 or 280 years, the land which they had been obliged to
                    quit was given to the Israelites, who were also denominated “shepherds,” but
                    should not be confounded with the former, or the antecedent inhabitants of
                    Goshen.</p>
