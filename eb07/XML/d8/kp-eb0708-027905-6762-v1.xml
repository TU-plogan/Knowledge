                <p><label type="entry">DUNDAS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Henry, Viscount
                    Melville</hi></label>, a late eminent British statesman, was born about the year
                    1741. He was a younger son of the Right Honourable Robert Dundas, lord president
                    of the Court of Session in Scotland, by Miss Gordon, a daughter of Sir William
                    Gordon of Gordonston, Bart. He w as educated at the High School and University
                    of Edinburgh, and having been brought up to the profession of the law, was
                    admitted a member of the Faculty of Advocates in the year 1763. He soon
                    distinguished himself at the bar, and rapidly attained to extensive practice.
                    The first promotion he obtained was the situation of one of the assessors to the
                    magistrates of Edinburgh; after which he became successively an advocate-depute
                    and solicitor-general. In 1775, when Sir James Montgomery was appointed lord
                    chief baron, Mr Dundas succeeded him in the office of lord advocate, which
                    situation he continued to occupy until 1783. In the month of March 1777, hc was
                    appointed joint keeper of the Signet for Scotland.</p>
                <p>From the period of his appointment to the office of lord advocate, Mr Dundas in a
                    great measure abandoned the ordinary practice of the bar, and devoted himself to
                    public business. In 1774 he became a member of parliament, having been elected
                    representative for the county of Edinburgh. Some years afterwards he resigned
                    the representation of the county in favour of the late lord chief baron of the
                    Court of Exchequer, and was chosen member for the city of Edinburgh, which he
                    continued to represent until his advancement to the peerage. Although originally
                    returned to parliament in opposition to the ministerial interest, he soon joined
                    the party in power, and became a strenuous supporter of Lord North’s measures
                    during the American war. He frequently spoke in the House of Commons, and,
                    notwithstanding the disadvantages of an ungraceful manner and a provincial
                    dialect, he was always listened to with great attention, on account of the
                    clearness of his statements and the weight <hi rend="italic">of</hi> his
                    arguments.</p>
                <p>In the year 1782, Mr Dundas was admitted a member of the Privy Council, and
                    appointed treasurer of the navy, under the administration of the late Marquis of
                    Lansdowne, then Earl of Shelburne; and he continued to fill that office, and to
                    support the measures of government, until the dissolution of that ministry.
                    During the short coalition administration he was out of place, and made a
                    conspicuous figure in opposing the memorable East India bill, a measure which
                    occasioned the overthrow of the <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193326775?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0708-6775-0280"/> ruling party.
                    Upon that occasion he displayed a knowledge of the affairs of the East India
                    Company, which was evidently the result of mueh study and laborious
                    investigation. In the month of December 1783, when Mr Pitt became prime
                    minister, Mr Dundas was restored to the same office which he had previously
                    held; and was appointed president of the board of eontrol, under the new East
                    India system. In 1791 he beearnc a member of the cabinet, in eonsequenec of his
                    appointment to the office of principal secretary of state for the home
                    department. The duties of this office he discharged with energy and ability. The
                    volunteer system, which, undoubtedly, contributed mueh to rousc the spirit of
                    the eountry during a period of peculiar difficulty and danger, has been ascribed
                    to Mr Dundas. On the aeeession of the Duke of Portland to the administration of
                    Mr Pitt, he resigned the home department, and became secretary at war. At this
                    time he also held the offices of lord privy seal, and governor of the Bank of
                    Scotland, and enjoyed an extent of patronage in his native eountry, whieh has
                    seldom or never fallen to the share of any individual, and has been considered
                    by many as more exclusive than can be safely confided to the hands of any one
                    man. For many years he was the intimate friend and coadjutor of Mr Pitt, and
                    took a leadingpart in all the important measures of his administration. The
                    details <hi rend="italic">of</hi> these measures, and Lord Melville’s conduct in
                    regard to them, belong to history. In the present article we must restrict
                    ourselves to a general outline of the events of his life, and a short summary of
                    the leading traits of his character.</p>
                <p>Upon the resignation of Mr Pitt in 1801, Mr Dundas also resigned his political
                    offices; and in 1802, under the administration of Mr Addington, afterwards Lord
                    Sidmouth, he was elevated to the peerage, by the titles of Viscount Melville and
                    Baron Dunira. The last publie situation whieh hc held in the government was that
                    of first lord of the admiralty, to which he was appointed, on Mr Pitt’s return
                    to power, in the room of Lord St Vincent. It was in his administration of the
                    affairs of the naval department that his lordshi]) incurred that irregularity
                    relative to the balances of publie money remaining in his hands, which produced
                    his celebrated impeachment. We eonceive it unnecessary to dwell upon the
                    proceedings of that well-known trial. It is sufficient to say that the House of
                    Lords finally aequitted him of all the charges brought forward in the articles
                    of impeachment exhibited by the Commons; but he had previously resigned all his
                    offiees in the administration.</p>
                <p>Subsequently to his acquittal, Lord Melville was restored to his seat in the
                    privy eouneil; but he did not return to office. He sometimes took a share in the
                    debates in the House of Lords; and, in 1810, he brought forward a motion, the
                    objeet of whieh was to recommend the employment of armed troop-ships, instead of
                    hired transports, for the accommodation of such troops as it might be found
                    expedient to embark in furtherance of the publie serviee∙ But the greater part
                    of his time was spent in Scotland, where he died suddenly, at the house of his
                    nephew, the Right Honourable Robert Dundas, lord chief baron of the Exchequer,
                    on the 27th of May 1811, at the age of seventy-one. He appeared in his usual
                    health for some time preceding, and his death is supposed to have been hastened
                    by the affection he felt for the loss of his old and valued friend the Lord
                    President Blair, who died a few days before.</p>
                <p>In his person Lord Melville was tall, stout, and well formed. In publie life hc
                    was principally distinguished by his great capacity for business, by the
                    unwearied attention whieh he paid to the details of all official measures, and
                    by the manliness and decision of his conduct. For many years, as we have already
                    observed, he was the steady friend and firm supporter of the measures of Mr
                    Pitt, to whom he proved a very powerful auxiliary. Whilst he held the offices of
                    treasurer of the navy, and first lord of the admiralty, his exertions are
                    admitted to have been attended w ith great advantage to the publie serviee. He
                    devised several improvements in the details of that department, which have been
                    found of great utility; and, in particular, the regulations with regard to the
                    payment of seamen’s wages, transmission of letters, and other matters connected
                    with that branch of the publie service, contributed much to the comfort of that
                    class of men, and are highly honourable to the character of their author. In
                    parliament he was a clear, acute, and argumentative speaker. His eloquence,
                    however, was that of a man possessed of strong natural talents, wholly unadorned
                    by literary taste or acquirements; and his speeches produced their effect from
                    the solidity of his arguments, and the fearlessness with whieh he delivered his
                    opinions, not from any powers of oratory or graces <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    style. The ornamental parts of eloquenee, indeed, he seemed to despise, and was
                    satisfied to bring his audience at once to the objeet he had in view. Political
                    power was his passion, and the bustle of official life was the element in whieh
                    he loved to move.</p>
                <p>In private life his lordship was a most agreeable companion; easy, frank, and
                    convivial; careless of money, even to a fault; always disposed to do kind
                    offices; affectionate in his domestic relations, and greatly beloved by the
                    numerous eirele of his friends.</p>
                <p>Lord Melville was twiee married: first, to Miss Ran-nĩe, daughter of Captain
                    Rannie of Melville, by whom he had one son, Robert, now Lord Melville; and three
                    daughters. His seeond wife was Lady Jean Hope, sister of the late Earl of
                    Hopetoun, by whom he left no issue.</p>
                <p>Although not, strictly speaking, a literary man, Lord Melville is the author of
                    several pamphlets on political subjects, which are distinguished by his usual
                    sense and knowledge of business. These are, 1. <hi rend="italic">The Substance
