                    the highest reputation, is said to have been born in the year 1274, but the
                    place of his birth has been long and much disputed. Dempster has asserted the
                    claims of Scotland by twelve arguments;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Dempsteri Asserti Scotìae Cives esse sui; S. Bonifacius
                    rationibus iχ. Joannes Duns rationibus xĩi. Bononìae, 1621, 4to.</p></note> but
                    a less formidable number might perhaps have been sufficient. The designation <hi
                    rend="italic">Scotus,</hi> which is commonly added to his name, evinces him to
                    have been a native either of Scotland or of Ireland; and the pretensions of the
                    latter country cannot be supported by the authority of a single early writer.
                    Wadding and other Irish authors who claim him as their countryman, persuade
                    themselves that he was born at <hi rend="italic">Dunum,</hi> or Downpatrick, and
                    must thence have derived the name of Duns;<note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                    type="authorial"><p>Wadding Scriptores Ordinis Minorum, f. 201. a. llomae, 1650,
                    fol.</p></note> but this is obviously a mere conjecture, unsupported by
                    tradition, and carrying with it no great plausibility. Leland claims him as an
                    Englishman, on the authority of certain manuscript copies of his works,
                    preserved in the library of Merton College, and bearing a colophon which
                    describes him as born at the village of Dunstane in the county of
                    Northumberland.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Lelandus
                    de Scriptoribus Britannicis, tom. ii. p. 317∙</p></note> But if this had been
                    the place of his birth, his surname ought to have been Dunstane. It apparently
                    belongs to the class of local surnames, or those derived from places of birth or
                    habitation; and we have little or no hesitation in supposing him <pb break="no"

                    native of Dunse in the eounty of Berwick. This surname is still to be found in
                    Scotland. He is mentioned as a native of Scotland by Trithemius, <hi
                    rend="superscript"> 1</hi> and likewise by Paulus Jovius, Sixtus Senensis,
                    Possevin, and many other writers of various countries. We are told that when a
                    boy hebecame accidentally known to two Franciscan friars, who, finding him to be
                    a youth of very extraordinary capacity, took him to their convent at Newcastle,
                    and afterwards persuaded him to become one of their fraternity. From thenee he
                    was sent to Oxford, where he became a fellow of Merton College, and professor of
                    divinity; but it appears that he had likewise studied at Paris. His lectures
                    were frequented by a prodigious concourse of students. His fame was now become
                    so universal, that the general of his order removed him to Paris, that the
                    students of that university might also have the benefit of his lectures. He went
                    to Paris in the year 1304, where he is said to have been honoured first with the
                    degree of baehelor, then of doctor of divinity, and in 1307 to have been
                    appointed regent of the divinity sehools; but as he had taught divinity at
                    Oxford, he must previously have taken at least one degree in that faculty.
                    During his residence at Paris, arose the famous controversy about the immaculate
                    conception of the Virgin Mary. Albertus Magnus maintained that she was born in
                    original sin. Scotus advanced two hundred arguments in support of the contrary
                    opinion, and convinced the university of Paris that she was really eonceived
                    immaculate. This important nonsense however continued to be disputed till the
                    year 1496, after the eouneil of Basel, when the university of Paris made a
                    decree, that no student who did not believe the immaculate conception should be
                    admitted to a degree. Duns had not been above a year at Paris, when the same
                    general of the Franeiseans ordered him to remove to Cologne, where he was
                    received with great pomp and ceremony by the magistrates and nobles of that
                    city, and where he dicd of an apoplexy soon after his arrival, in the year 1308,
                    in the thirty-fourth year of his age. Some writers have reported that he was
                    buried in an epileptic fit, and that, upon removing his bones, he appeared to
                    have turned himself in his eoffin. The genius of this renowned schoolman, who
                    obtained the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Doctor</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Subtilis,</hi> or the Subtle Doctor, reflects no inconsiderable lustre on the
                    nation to which he belonged: he maintained a reputation almost unrivalled till
                    the scholastic theology and scholastic philosophy were finally exploded. His
                    followers, who were called Scotisιs, opposed the opinions of the Thomists, or
                    followers of St Thomas Aquinas. An edition of his works, accompanied by a life
                    of the author by Luke Wadding, was published at Lyon in twelve volumes
                    folio.</p>
