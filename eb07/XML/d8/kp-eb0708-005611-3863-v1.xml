                <p><label type="entry">DITTON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Humphry</hi></label>, an eminent
                    mathematician, was born at Salisbury on the 29th May 1675. Being an only son,
                    his father, observing in him an extraordinary eapaeity, determined to cultivate
                    it by means of a good education. For this purpose he placed him in a reputable
                    private aeademy, upon quitting whieh he at the desire of his father, though
                    against his own inelination, engaged in the profession of divinity, and began to
                    exercise his profession at Tunbridge, in the county of Kent, where he continued
                    to preach some years, during which time he married a lady of that place.</p>
                <p>But a weak constitution and the death of his father induced Mr Ditton to quit
                    that profession; and at the persuasion of Dr Harris and Mr Whiston, both eminent
                    mathematieians, he engaged in the study of mathematics, a scienee to which he
                    had always a strong inclination. In the proseeution of this scienee he was mueh
                    encouraged by the suceess and applause he received, being greatly esteemed by
                    the ehief professors of it, and particularly by Sir Isaac New ton, by whose
                    interest and recommendation he was elected master of the new mathematical school
                    in Christ’s Hospital, where he continued till his death, which happened in 1715,
                    in the fortieth year of his age.</p>
                <p>Mr Ditton published the following mathematical and other tracts: I. Of the
                    Tangents of Curves, &amp;e. <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans,</hi> vol. xxiii. 2. A

                    1706. This work, with additions and alterations, was again published by Mr John
                    Clarke in the year 1726. 5. In 1709 he published the <hi rend="italic">Synopsis

                    Treatise on Perspective w as published in 1712. In this work he explained the
                    principles of that art mathematically; and, besides teaching the <pb break="no"

                    generally practised, gave the first hints of the new method afterwards enlarged
                    upon and improved by Dr Brook Taylor, and which was published in the year 1715.
                    7. In 1714 Mr Ditton published several pieces, both theological and
                    mathematical, particularly his Discourse on the Resurrection of Jesus Christ;
                    and The New Law of Fluids, or a Discourse concerning the Ascent of Liquids, in
                    exact Geometrical Figures, between two nearly contiguous Surfaces.· To this was
                    annexed a tract to demonstrate the impossibility of thinking or perception being
                    the result of any combination of the parts of matter and motion; a subject much
                    agitated about that time. To this work also was added an advertisement from him
                    and Mr Whiston concerning a method for discovering the longitude, which it sëems
                    they had published about half a year before. This attempt probably cost our
                    author his life; for although it was approved and countenanced by Sir Isaac
                    Newton before it was presented to the Board of Longitude, and the method had
                    been successfully put in practice in finding the longitude between Paris and
                    Vienna, yet that board then determined against it; so that the disappointment,
                    together with some public ridicule, particularly in a poem written by Dean
                    Swift, affected his health so that he died in the ensuing year, 1715.</p>
                <p>In an account of Mr Ditton, prefixed to the German translation of his Discourse
                    on the Resurrection, it is said that he had published, in his own name only,
                    another method for finding the longitude, but which Mr Whiston denied. However,
                    Raphael Levi, a learned Jew, who had studied under Leibnitz, informed the German
                    editor that he well knew that Ditton and Leibnitz had corresponded upon the
                    subject, and that Ditton had sent to Leibnitz a delineation of a machine he had
                    invented for that purpose, which was a piece of mechanism constructed with many
                    wheels like a clock, and which Leibnitz highly approved of for land use, but
                    doubted whether it would answer on board of ship, on account of the motion.</p>
