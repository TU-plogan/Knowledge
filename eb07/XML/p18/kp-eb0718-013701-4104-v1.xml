                    rend="smallcaps">Eridanus,</hi> one of the great rivers of Europe, which
                    traverses the north of Italy from west to east. It has its source in Monte Viso,
                    one of the Cottian Alps, flows north-east to Turin, passes that capital, holds
                    an easterly course throughout the whole length of Lombardy, separating Austrian
                    Italy from Parma, Modena, and the Ecclesiastical States, and discharges itself
                    by a number of mouths into the Adriatic, about thirty miles to the south of λ
                    <hi rend="superscript"> τ</hi> enice. In its course, which, including its
                    windings, is upwards of 500 miles, it receives a great number of rivers, flowing
                    in full current from the Alps on the north, and in less copious but equally
                    rapid streams from the Apennines on the south. Of these tributary waters the
                    principal are, the Dora Riparia, the Dora Baltea, the Stura, the Oreo, the
                    Sesia, the Tanaro, the Ticino, the Adda, the O1ona, the Oglio, the Mincio, the
                    Crostolo, and the Panaro. The Po, rising in a very mountainous country, soon
                    becomes a large river, and is sufficiently deep to float boats and barges at
                    thirty miles from its source; but its current is often so rapid that the
                    navigation is at all seasons difficult, and not unfrequently hazardous. Hence,
                    though it passes in its progress more than fifty towns, little advantage
                    comparatively is derived from it for the conveyance of merchandise. Its volume
                    of water is subject to sudden increase from the melting of the snows, and from
                    heavy falls of rain, the rivers that flow into it being almost all mountain
                    streams; and in the flat country, in the lower part of its course, this would
                    have been attended with very destructive effects, if great dykes had not been
                    constructed to confine it within its channel. The gravel rolled down from the
                    mountains has progressively raised the bed of the river, and the protecting
                    mounds have also been correspondingly elevated; so that the Po, in the lower
                    part of its course, presents the singular spectacle of a vast body of water, the
                    level of which is higher than that of the adjoining country. Its borders,
                    interspersed with trees and villages, display great luxuriance of vegetation,
                    and are extremely pleasant, though by no means picturesque. This river, like the
                    Rhine, is crossed by flying bridges. A post is fixed in the middle of the
                    stream, and a rope conveyed from it to the passage raft, by means of a number of
                    small boats which form the connecting links; and these boats being pressed on by
                    the current, guide the raft to the opposite side, with no other assistance than
                    that of an oar. The raft usually consists of two barges boarded over, and
                    encompassed with a rail. Lastly, the basin of the Po has been the theatre of
                    some of the most remarkable military operations of modern times; more
                    particularly of the campaigns of Eugene, Napoleon, and Suwarof, who, each in his
                    turn, decided, for the time, the fate of Italy.</p>
