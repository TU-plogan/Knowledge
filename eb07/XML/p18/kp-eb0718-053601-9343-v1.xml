        <body>
            <div facs="nls:193539343?mode=fullsize" type="entry">
                <p><label type="entry">PRINCIPLE</label>, in science, is a truth, admitted without
                    proof, from which other truths are inferred by a chain of reasoning. Principles
                    are of two kinds, <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                    >general;</hi> and to the latter the name of <hi rend="italic">axioms</hi> is
                    sometimes given, on account of their importance and dignity. An axiom, or
                    general principle, when the terms in which it is expressed are understood, must
                    be a self-evident truth; but from its very nature it cannot be a first truth.
                    Our first truths are all <hi rend="italic">particular.</hi> A child knows that
                    two particular lines, each an inch long, are equal to one another, before he has
                    formed any general notions of length and equality. “Things equal to one and the
                    same thing are equal to one another,” is the first of Euclid’s axioms; and an
                    axiom it undoubtedly is, but to no man has it been a first truth. It is, if we
                    may use the expression, a genus or class of truths, comprehending under it
                    numberless individuals. Were a full-grown man introduced into the world without
                    a single idea in his mind, as we may suppose Adam to have been, he woukl
                    instantly perceive, upon laying together three pieces of wood, each a foot long,
                    that they were all equal in length; and if lie were to cut another to the same
                    length with any one of them, he would find, upon trial, that it was of the same
                    length with them all. After a few simple experiments of this kind, he would, by
                    a law of human thought, infer, that all things equal in length, or in any other
                    dimension, to any one thing, are in that dimension equal to one another.</p>
                <p>It was not, therefore, with such weakness as some have imagined, that Hobbes
                    declared those propositions commonly called axioms, not to be primary but
                    secondary principles. A primary principle deserves not the name of an axiom, as
                    it is only a particular truth including in it no other truth. There is not one
                    of Euclid’s axioms which has not been the result of induction, though we
                    remember not the time at which the induction was made. That the whole is greater
                    than any of its parts is a general truth which no man can controvert; but every
                    one discovered that truth by observing, that his body was larger than his head,
                    his foot, or his hand, that a mountain is larger than a mole-hill in the middle
                    of it, and that a piece of timber, measuring what is called a yard, is longer
                    than any one of the divisions marked upon it, which are termed inches.
                    Particular objects are observed by the senses, and treasured up in the memory;
                    and the intellect, by its constitution, compares them together, marks in what
                    they agree and disagree, and thence draws its axioms or general principles. He,
                    therefore, who should admit the truth of an axiom, and deny the evidence of
                    sense and perception, would act as absurdly as he who accepts payment in a
                    bank-bill, and refuses it in the individual pieces of gold or silver which that
                    bill represents. General axioms are of infinite use in the pursuits of science;
                    but it is not because they create new truths; they only shorten the process in
                    the discovery of such as might be found, with labour, through the medium of
                    particular propositions.</p>
