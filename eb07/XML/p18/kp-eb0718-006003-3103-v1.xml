                <p><label type="entry">PLOT, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dr Robert</hi></label>, a learned
                    antiquary and philosopher, was born at Sutton-Barn, in the parish of Borden,
                    Kent, in the year 1641. He studied in Magdalen Hall, and afterwards in
                    University College, Oxford. In 1682 he was elected secretary of the Royal
                    Society, and published the Philosophical Transactions from No, 143 to No. 166
                    inclusive. The next year Mr Elias Ashmole appoint-’ ed him first keeper of his
                    museum, and about the same time the vice-chancellor nominated him primarius
                    professor of chemistry in the university of Oxford. In 1687 he was made
                    secretary to the earl marshal; and the following year received the title of
                    historiographer to James II. In 1690 he resigned his professorship of chemistry,
                    and likewise his place of keeper of the museum, to which he presented a very
                    large collection of natural curiosities, which he had described in his histories
                    of Oxfordshire and Staffordshire; the former published at Oxford in 1677, folio,
                    and reprinted with additions and corrections in 1705, and the latter printed of
                    the same size in 1686. In January 1694- 1695, Henry Howard, earl marshal,
                    nominated him Mobray-herald extraordinary; two days after which he was
                    constituted register of the court of honour; and, on the 30th of April 1696, he
                    died of the stone, at his house at Borden.</p>
                <p>As Dr Plot delighted in natural history, the above works were designed as essays
                    towards a Natural History of England; and he had actually formed a design of
                    travelling through England and Wales for that purpose. He accordingly drew up a
                    plan of his scheme, in a letter addressed to Bishop Fell, which is inserted at
                    the end of the second volume of Leland’s Itinerary, in the edition of 1744.
                    Amongst several manuscripts which he left behind him were large materials for
                    the Natural History of Kent, Middlesex, and the city of London. Besides the
                    above works, he published De Origine Fontium Tentamen Philosophicum, 8vo, and
                    nine papers in the Philosophical Transactions.</p>
