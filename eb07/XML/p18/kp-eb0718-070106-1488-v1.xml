                    fictitious name of a pretended Formosan, a person of learning and ingenuity.
                    Born in France, he was educated in a free school, and afterwards in a college of
                    Jesuits, in an archiépiscopal city, the name of which, as likewise those of his
                    birth-place and his parents, are unknown. Upon leaving the college he was
                    recommended as a tutor to a young gentleman, but soon fell into a mean and
                    rambling life, which involved him in disappointments and misfortunes. His first
                    pretence was that of being a sufferer for religion. He procured a certificate
                    that he was of Irish extraction, that he had left that country for the sake of
                    the Catholic faith, and was going on a pilgrimage to Rome. But being unable to
                    purchase a pilgrim’s garb, and observing one in a chapel, dedicated to a
                    miraculous saint, which had been set up as a monument of <pb break="no"

                    some wandering pilgrims, he contrived to take away both the staff and the cloak;
                    and, thus accoutred, he begged his way in fluent Latin, accosting only clergymen
                    or persons of figure, whom hc found so generous and credulous that, before he
                    had gone twenty miles, he might easily have saved money, and put himself in a
                    much better dress. As soon as he had got what he thought sufficient, however, he
                    begged no more, but viewed everything worth seeing, and then retired to some
                    inn, where he spent his money as frccly as he had obtained it. Having heard the
                    Jesuits speak much of China and Japan, hc started the wild scheme, when hc was
                    in Germany, of passing for a native of the island of Formosa; and what he wanted
                    in knowledge he supplied by a pregnant invention. He formed a new character and
                    language on grammatical principles, which, like other oriental languages, hc
                    wrote from right to left with great readiness; and hc planned a new religion,
                    and a division of the year into twenty months, with other novelties, in order to
                    give credit to his pretensions. He now assumed the character of a Japanese
                    convert to Christianity, travelling for instruction, with an appearance of
                    greater wretchedness than even that of common beggars. Hc then entered as a
                    soldier in the Dutch service; but, being still desirous of passing for a
                    Japanese, he altered his plan to that of being an unconverted heathen; and at
                    Sluys, Brigadier Lauder, a Scotch colonel, introduced him to the chaplain, who,
                    with the view of recommending himself to the bishop of London, resolved to carry
                    him over to England. At Rotterdam, some persons having put shrewd questions to
                    him, that carried an air of scepticism, he took one more whimsical step, which
                    was to live upon raw flesh, roots, and herbs, thinking that such strange food
                    would remove all scruples. The bishop of London patronized him with credulous
                    humanity; and Psalmanazar found a large circle of friends, who extolled him as a
                    prodigy. Yet there were some who entertained a just opinion of him, particularly
                    Dr Halley, Dr Mead, and Dr Woodward; but their endeavours to expose him as a
                    cheat only made others think the better of him, especially as these gentlemen
                    were supposed to be unfriendly to revelation. In this instance at least,
                    easiness of belief was no great evidence of penetration. He was employed to
                    translate the church catechism into the Formosan language, which was examined,
                    approved, and laid up as a valuable manuscript; and the author, after writing
                    his well-known History of Formosa, was rewarded and sent to Oxford to study what
                    he liked, whilst his patrons and opponents were learnedly disputing at London on
                    the merits of his work. The learned members of the university were no better
                    agreed in their opinions than the savans of London; but at length the sceptics
                    triumphed. Some absurdities were discovered in his history, of such a nature as
                    to discredit the whole narration, and saved him the trouble of an open
                    declaration of his imposture, which, however, he owned at length to his private
                    friends. For the remainder of his life, his learning and ingenuity enabled him
                    to procure a comfortable support by his pen; and he was concerned in several
                    works of credit, particularly The Universal History. He lived irreproachably for
                    many years, and died some time in 1763.</p>
