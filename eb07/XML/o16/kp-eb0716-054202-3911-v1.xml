                <p><label type="entry">ORME, <hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi></label>, the historian
                    of British India, born at Anjengo, in Travancore, was the son of Dr Alexander
                    Orme; and his mother was a Miss Hill, a sister of Mrs Robert Adams.</p>
                <p>He was sent to England at the age of two years, and placed under the care of Mrs
                    Adams, who lived in Cavendish Square. His literary education commenced very
                    early, for he went to Harrow at six, having been previously, for a twelvemonth,
                    under the private tuition of a clergyman in the neighbourhood. For seven or
                    eight years he applied to his classical studies as a school-boy with great
                    diligence; and when he was thirteen, he was placed in the office of the
                    accountant of the African Company, in order to gain some practical knowledge of
                    the principles of commerce.</p>
                <p>In 1742 he went out to Calcutta, and was there engaged in a mercantile house of
                    respectability; he made a voyage to Surat in their concerns, and on his return,
                    in 1743, he received from England the appointment of a writer. Five years
                    afterwards he was promoted to the rank of factor in the company’s service. In
                    1752, having been desired to give his opinion on the regulation of the police of
                    Calcutta, he drew up a memorial on the subject, which did great credit to the
                    accuracy and profoundness of his views of the manners, the habits, and the
                    interests of the country.</p>
                <p>He returned to England in 1753, upon a visit to his aunt, and he was much
                    consulted, during his stay in London, by Lord Holderness, then secretary of
                    state, with regard to the policy to be observed towards the French government
                    respecting the affairs of India. He went out again in 1754, and took his seat as
                    a member of the council at Fort St George. He had here an opportunity of
                    effectually serving the company by the vigour of his political conduct, and of
                    greatly contributing to the establishment of the decided preponderance of the
                    English interest in India. After the well-known affair of the Black Hole of
                    Calcutta, he was particularly active in promoting the appointment of Colonel
                    Clive to the command of the expedition destined to punish the cruelty of the
                    tyrant who was the author of that outrage; although his friendship with Colonel
                    Clive did not continue uninterrupted through life. Mr Orme’s exertions on this
                    and other occasions were so highly appreciated by the directors, that he was
                    nominated as eventual successor to the government of Madras; but he did not stay
                    long enough to profit by the appointment. In the capacity of accountant-general,
                    he became intimate with Mr Alexander, afterwards Lord Caledon, who was his
                    deputy, and with Mr Dalrymple the hydrographer, to whom he showed many
                    civilities, from a conviction of his merits. Mr Benjamin Robins, the
                    historiographer of Anson’s Voyage, had also been one of his early friends, that
                    is, during his first residence in India; for this singularly active person died
                    in 1751.</p>
                <p>Mr Orme’s situation in India was extremely favourable for the acquisition of
                    historical information, which it was the delight of his life to collect; but his
                    health requiring a change of climate, he sailed for Europe on board of the
                    Grantham in 1758. The ship, however, was captured in January 1759, off the Cape
                    of Good Hope, and carried to the Mauritius; but after having been detained there
                    for some time, Mr Orme was allowed to proceed to the Cape, and thence to France.
                    Having landed at Nantes in the spring of 1760, he paid a visit to Paris, where
                    he amused himself for some months with the literatureand the theatres of the
                    day; and his biographer has preserved some interesting remarks that they
                    suggested to him. In October he arrived in London, and engaged a house which had
                    been lately built in Harley Street.</p>
                <p>He employed himself for the two succeeding years upon his Military History,
                    sparing no pains nor expense to complete the collection of materials, which he
                    had begun to form in India, and to prepare the work, with all possible care, for
                    the press. The first volume appeared in 1763, and was received with great
                    approbation. The company not only granted him free access to their records, but
                    gave him also the appointment of their historiographer, with a salary of L.400 a
                    year. After this time, he resumed some of his classical studies, which he had
                    discontinued so long as to have forgotten almost all that he had learned; but he
                    soon recovered his knowledge of the ancient languages, and added to them
                    afterwards such of the modern ones as he found likely to be subservient to his
                    pursuits. His hours of leisure were chiefly passed in the enjoyment of literary
                    society; he became a fellow of the Society of Antiquaries in March 1770; and
                    about the same time he became intimate with Lord Sandys, and with Sir James
                    Harris. Sir William Jones, Dr Robertson the historian, Dr Pemberton, Dr Wilson,
                    Athenian Stuart, and Nourse the bookseller, were also among his particular
                    friends; as well as Mr Rouse Boughton,afterwardsSir Charles Rouse Boughton,
                    towhose urbanity and thorough acquaintance with the Persian language he was
                    indebted for several of his historical documents. He obtained additional
                    information for the completion of his History from the French general De Bussy,
                    who had been much concerned in some of the transactions narrated in his first
                    volume, and who was so much satisfied with his candour and impartiality that he
                    invited him to his house in the country, and entertained him there, in 1773,
                    with great kindness and hospitality.</p>
                <p>After the publication of the second volume of his History, he had ample leisure
                    to amuse himself with literary pursuits of a more general nature; but in 1784 he
                    suffered a severe affliction from the loss of his nephew, Mr Hosea, who was
                    shipwrecked, with his wife and family, upon their return from India, on board of
                    the Grosvenor. In 1792 he retired to Ealing, where he continued to reside till
                    the time of his death, which happened on the 13th of January 1801.</p>
                <p>Good sense and sound judgment were the principal features of his character. His
                    works are more distinguished by simplicity, clearness, and precision, than by
                    any very powerful eloquence, or a very nice discrimination of cha <pb break="no"

                    not, however, deficient either in command of language or in poetical feeling.
                    Sir William Jones and Dr Robertson paid him some very high compliments, in their
                    private correspondence, for the elegance and purity of his style; and the former
                    of these writers has also characterized him, in his third Discourse, as
                    possessing an “exquisite taste for every fine art.” We find also, amongst a few
                    miscellaneous poems collected by his biographer, a remarkable little Address to
                    the Moon, written at Madras in 1757, which is manifestly the original of a
                    well-known Greek epigram and a Latin ode of Sir William Jones; and certainly the
                    compliment of having been “set to music, and much admired,” must be considered
                    as far inferior to that of having been repeatedly imitated and translated by a
                    poet of a judgment so correct, and a taste so refined, and having been called
                    the production of “a man of great talents, and a particular friend of the
                    translator.”</p>
                <p>1. Of his works, the earliest in its origin-was his General Idea of the
                    Government and People of Indostan. It was principally written in 1752, and
                    finished during his return to England in the next year. A part of it was
                    prefixed to his Military History, and it is printed in its entire state among
                    his posthumous works.</p>
                <p>2. History of the Military Transactions of the British Nation in Indostan, from
                    the year 1745. A Dissertation on the Mahommedan Conquests and Establishments in
                    Indostan is prefixed to the first volume. “No historian,” says the author of the
                    Annual Register for 1764, “seems to have been more perfectly informed of the
                    subject on which he has undertaken to write; and very few have possessed more
                    fully the talent of impressing it, in the clearest and most vivid manner, on the
                    imagination and understanding of his reader.” The first volume, published in
                    1763, extends to 1756; and the second, published in 1778, carries the history
                    down to the peace of 1763.</p>
                <p>3. Historical Fragments of the Mogul Empire, from the year 1659, 8vo, London,
                    1782; first published anonymously, but acknowledged and reprinted in 4to in
                    1805; together with the Origin of the English Establishment at Broach and Surat,
                    the General Idea of the Government and People of Indostan, and a Life of the
                    Author. The Historical Fragments is a work of considerable research, making a
                    sort of episode to the Military History, to which it affords some additions and
                    corrections. It relates principally to the sanguinary Aurungzebe and his
                    immediate successors, and to his contemporary, Sevagi the “Morattoe,” the
                    professed descendant of Porus. The Essay on the Trade of Surat is a fragment
                    which was left unfinished by the author.</p>
                <p>4. Several hundred volumes of Mr Orme’s manuscript collections, together with
                    some scarce printed tracts relating to oriental history, are carefully preserved
                    in the library of the East India Company.</p>
