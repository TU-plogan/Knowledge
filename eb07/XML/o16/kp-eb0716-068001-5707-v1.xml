                    of which it is the capital. It is situated between the rivers Nalon and Nora, on
                    a hill of granite, and enjoys a serene atmosphere, although generally rather
                    rainy. Its fields are fertile, and yield abundance of fruits and horticultural
                    vegetables; and near it there are good meadows, where cattle are depastured, and
                    hay made for the winter consumption of stock. The city contains a population of
                    6000 inhabitants, amongst whom there are some of the most distinguished families
                    of the province, who unfortunately prefer a residence in cities to living on
                    their own estates. It is not a place of trade, but rather the resort of lawyers
                    and clergy. It has a very magnificent cathedral in the Gothic style, with a
                    remarkable lofty tower, an university, a well-endowed hospital, and a beautiful
                    public walk. It is supplied with water by a fine aqueduct, which conveys it from
                    two fountains in the neighbouring hills. Long. 5. 56. 22. W. Lat. 43. 21. 55.

                    recompense of his talents and bravery that Ferdinand appointed him director of
                    the gold and silver mines in the island of Haïti, which Columbus named first <hi
                    rend="italic">Espanola·,</hi> and then <hi rend="italic">San-Domingo.</hi>
                    Oviedo proceeded to his destination in 1513; and employed in working the mines,
                    which were poor compared with those afterwards discovered in the continent of
                    America, the natives of the island, a good and gentle race, naturally indolent,
                    and by no means robust, with constitutions already enfeebled by the ravages of
                    syphilis, a disease previously unknown in the old world. This unfortunate
                    people, who had received the companions of Columbus with so mueh cordiality,
                    Oviedo treated worse than beasts of burden; compelling them to labour without
                    intermission, and exercising the greatest cruelties to enforce submission to his
                    commands on the part of a race which had previously lived in idleness,
                    subsisting on the abundant natural productions of the elimate, and on fish,
                    which they caught without difficulty, as an amusement rather than an occupation.
                    The abominable tyranny to which the natives were thus subjected soon caused a
                    considerable diminution of their number; and Oviedo, in order to justify himself
                    for the oppression and cruelty which he exercised, had the bad faith to allege,
                    in his writings, that the Haitians were dissolute, unprincipled, and in every
                    respect deserving of extermination. Nor was this all. Not content with
                    calumniating the people he had so cruelly treated, he added the ridiculous
                    falsehood, that amongst them syphilis was the result of debauchery; whereas,
                    according to the testimony of all impartial historians, it had been ascertained
                    by Columbus that the Haitian people were comparatively indifferent to sexual
                    pleasure, a eireumstance by no means common in a burning elimate, and whieh can
                    only be explained by the weak physical organization of these islanders, or by a
                    deficiency of vital power. A residence of nearly twelve years in Haïti enabled
                    Oviedo to study the natural history <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the island in all
                    its parts, to observe syphilis in all its types, and to ascertain the remedies
                    which the natives employed in their treatment of the disease. The principal of
                    these was the gaiae, which is still classed amongst die number of the
                    antisyphilitics. On his return to Spain in 1525, Oviedo published a journal of
                    his researches under the title of <hi rend="italic">Summario</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">de la</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >General</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Natural de las
                    Indias</hi><hi rend="italic">Occidentales,</hi> Toledo, one vol. folio,
                    dedicated to Charles V. At a later period, however, the author recast this
                    production, to which he added numerous facts connected with the natural history
                    of Haiti, and, in 1535, he published the first twenty books of his great work
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">La</hi><hi rend="italic">Historia</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">General</hi><hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic">Natural de
                    las Indias</hi><hi rend="italic">Occidentales;</hi> but the entire work, which
                    is divided into fifty books, did not appear till 1783, when it eame out under
                    the auspices of the Marquis of Truxillo. Oviedo affirms, in his narrative, that
                    the syphilis is an endemic malady in the island of Haïti, and that having been
                    contracted there by the Spaniards belonging to the expedition of Columbus, it
                    was by them communicated to the Neapolitans belonging to the expedition of
                    Gonealvo de Cordova; and, in point of fact, the syphilis appeared at Naples
                    immediately after the return of the squadron of Gonçalvo. Several writers, who
                    pretend that syphilis existed in Europe anterior to the discovery of the new
                    world, have attempted to prove this hy-ιothetieal assertion from the writings of
                    Oviedo himself; ĭut these, so far from countenancing any sueb notion,
                    con-ainineontestible proof of the error into which those persons ιave fallen who
                    ascribe the origin of this fearful scourge to he old continent. Some authors
                    assure us that Oviedo, having been infected by syphilis during his sojourn at
                    Naples about the year 1513, came to the conclusion that if had been imported
                    from Haïti; and conceiving that there must exist in that island a remedy for the
                    disease, solicited the employment whieh led him thither, and in fact discovered
                    that the wood of gaiac was the infallible antidote employed by the natives, and
                    by whieh also he effected his own eure. It is added that, on his return to
                    Spain, Oviedo commenced physician for syphilitic maladies, in the treatment of
                    which he made use of the wood of gaïac, with a success which considerably
                    augmented the fortune he had acquired in working the mines of Haiti, at the
                    expense of the lives of a great number of the natives. <hi rend="smallcaps"
