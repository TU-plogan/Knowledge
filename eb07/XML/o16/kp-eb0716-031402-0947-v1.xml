                <p><label type="entry">OAK</label>. The oak has long been known by the title of
                    “monarch of the woods,” and, we may add, justly.</p>
                <p>The ancient Druids had a profound veneration for oak trees. Pliny says that “the
                    Druids, as the Gauls call their magicians or wise men, held nothing so sacred as
                    the misletoe, and the tree on which it grows, provided it bean oak. They make
                    choice of oak groves in preference to all others, and perform no rites without
                    oak leaves; so that they seem to have the name of Druids from thcnce, if we
                    derive their name from the Greek.”</p>
                <p>'1 his useful tree grows to such surprising magnitude, that were there not many
                    well-authenticated instances in our own country, it would certainly appear
                    difficult to believe that it could attain sueh size. In the eighteenth volume of
                    the Gentleman’s Magazine we have the dimensions of a leaf twelve inches in
                    length and seven in breadth; and all the leaves of the same tree were equally
                    large. On the estate of Woodhall, purchased in 1775 by Sir Thomas Rumbold, an
                    oak was felled which sold for L.43, and measured twenty-four feet in
                    circumference. We are also told of one in Mill wood Forest, near Chad-desley,
                    which was in full verdure in winter, getting its leaves again, after the
                    autumnal ones fell off. In Evelyn’s <hi rend="italic">Sylva,</hi> we have an
                    account of a very remarkable oak at Greendale, which Gough, in his edition of
                    Campden, thus minutely describes: “The Greendale oak, with a road cut through
                    it, still bears one green branch. Such branches as have been cut or broken off
                    are guarded from wet by lead. The diameter of this tree at the top, whence the

                    feet and a half, circumference there thirty-five feet; height of the trunk
                    fifty-three; height of the arch ten, width six. Mr Evelyn mentions several more
                    oaks of extraordinary size in Worksop Park.”</p>
                <p>M. Hamel du Monçeau, a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, gave an
                    account, in the year 1749, of an oak which he had kept in water eight years, and
                    which yielded fine leaves every spring. The tree, he says, had four or five
                    branches; the largest nineteen or twenty lines round, and more than eighteen
                    inches in length. It throve more in the first two years than it would have done
                    in the best earth; but it afterwards lost its vigour, and rather decayed, which
                    he attributed more to a defect in the roots than to a want of aliment.</p>
                <p>Buffon made some experiments upon oak trees, the result of which is recorded in
                    the Gentleman’s Magazine, 1754. He had compared barked with unbarked trees, and
                    concluded, from a variety of trials, that timber barked and dried standing, is
                    always heavier and considerably stronger than timber kept in its bark.</p>
                <p>The use of oak bark in tanning, and in hot-beds, is generally known. For the
                    latter of these purposes, however, oak leaves are now found to answer equally
                    well, or rather better. In the notes to Dr Hunter’s edition of Evelyn’s Treatise
                    on Forest Trees, we find certain directions for their use, by Mr Speechly. The
                    leaves are to be raked up as soon as possible after they fall from the trees.
                    When raked into heaps, they should immediately be carried into some place near
                    the hot-houses, where they may lie to couch. It is the custom of some to fence
                    them round with charcoal hurdles, or any thing to keep them from being blown
                    about the garden in windy weather. They arc then trodden well, and watered in
                    case they happen to have been brought in dry. The heap is made six or seven feet
                    thick, and covered over with old mats, or any thing else, to prevent the upper
                    leaves from being blown away. In a few days the heap will attain a strong heat.
                    For the first year or two in which he used these leaves, Mr Speedily did not
                    continue them in the heap longer than ten days or a fortnight; but by this
                    method of management they settle so much when brought to the hot-house, that a
                    supply was very soon required; and he afterwards found, that it was proper to
                    let them remain five or six weeks in the heaps before they were brought to the
                    hot-house. In getting them into the pine pots, if they appear dry, they are to
                    be watered, and again trodden down exceedingly well, in layers, till the pits
                    are quite full. The whole is then covered with tan bark, to the thickness of two
                    inches, and well trodden down, till the surface becomes smooth and even. The
                    pine pots are then to be placed in the manner in which they are to stand,
                    beginning with the middle row first, and filling up the spaces between the pots
                    with tan. In this manner we are to proceed to the next row, till the whole be
                    finished ,∙ and the operation is performed in the same manner as when tan only
                    is used. The leaves require no further trouble through the whole season, as they
                    will retain a constant and regu∙</p>

                <p>lar heat during twelve months without stirring or turning; and Mr Speechly
                    informs us, that if he might judge from their appearances when taken out, being
                    always entire and ^perfect, it was probable they would continue their heat
                    through a second year; but, as an annual supply of leaves is easily obtained,
                    the experiment is hardly worth making. After this, the pines will have no
                    occasion to be moved except at stated times of their management, as at the
                    shifting them in their pots, when at each time a little fresh tan should be
                    added to make up the deficiency arising from ’ fthe settling of the beds; but
                    this will be inconsiderable, as the leaves do not settle much after their long
                    couching. During the first two years of our author’s practice he did not use any
                    tan, but plunged the pine pots into the leaves, and merely covered the surface
                    of the beds, when finished, with a little saw-dust, to give it a neatness. This
                    method, however, was attended with one inconvenience; for, by the caking of the
                    leaves, they shrunk from the sides of the pots, by which they became exposed to
                    the air, and at the same time the heat of the beds was permitted to escape. See
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Planting.</hi><hi rend="italic">OΛK-Leaf Galls.</hi> These
                    are of several kinds. The remarkable species called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >mushroom gall</hi> is never found on any other vegetable substance than these
                    leaves; and, besides this, there is a great number of other kinds.</p>
                <p>The double gall of these leaves is very singular, because the generality of
                    productions of this kind affect only one side of a leaf or branch, and grow all
                    one way; whereas this kind of gall extends itself both ways, and is seen upon
                    sack side of the leaf, in the form of two protuberances, the me opposite to the
                    other. These are of differently irregular shapes; but their natural figure seems
                    that of two tones, with broad bases and very obtuse points, though hey are
                    sometimes round, or very nearly so.</p>
                <p>These make their first appearance on the leaf in April, md remain on it till
                    June, or even longer. They are at irst green, but afterwards yellowish, and are
                    softer to the ouch than many other of the productions of this kind. They are
                    usually about the size of a large pea, but some-imes they grow to the size of a
                    nut. When opened, they re found to be of that kind which is inhabited each by ne
                    insect only, and contains but one cavity. The cavi-y in this, however, is larger
                    than in any other gall of the ize, or even in many others of three times its
                    size; the ides of it being very little thicker than the substance of he
                    leaf.</p>
