                <p><label type="entry">OZANAM, <hi rend="smallcaps">James</hi></label>, a laborious
                    mathematician, was born in the year 1640, at Bouligneux, in the principality of
                    Dombes. His family was of Hebrew extraction, but had Jong been converts to the
                    Catholic faith; and some of them had held considerable places in the parliament
                    of Provence. Nature had given him a decided taste for the exact sciences; but
                    his father, who intended him for the church, took care not to foster an
                    inclination adverse to his views; and, during four years, young Ozanam studied
                    divinity, though with little pleasure or success. As he advanced in years, his
                    aversion to this study increased in the same proportion as his ardour for the
                    sciences, to which he was denied access, became more and more intense. His
                    father, however, died just as he was about to complete his course of theology;
                    and being now his own master, he renounced all idea of entering the church, and,
                    devoting himself entirely to the mathematics, made so great progress that, at
                    the age of fifteen, he composed a work in which he afterwards found some things
                    deserving of publication. As, by the custom of Bresse, the estate went to the
                    eldest son, the subject of this notice had no other resource than to teach
                    mathematics, which he had not been permitted to study; and, accordingly, having
                    established himself at Lyons, he there supported himself for some time by the
                    produce of his lessons, supplying the deficiency by his gains at play. Some
                    foreigners, pupils of his, to whom he had lent fifty pistoles without taking any
                    note or obligation for repayment, having mentioned the circumstance to the
                    father of Chancellor d’Aguesseau, that magistrate, touched with so generous a
                    trait of character, invited Ozanam to come to Paris, where he would necessarily
                    find greater facilities for teaching than at Lyons. Ozanam accepted this
                    proposition the more readily, because he desired above all things to make the
                    acquaintance of the great geometers whose works he had studied; and having
                    abandoned play in order to devote himself entirely to the mathematics, he had
                    soon a great number of pupils. But at first he wanted the prudence necessary to
                    profit by his success. He was young, handsome, and sprightly, and being addicted
                    to gallantry, he became entangled in some intrigues which, besides the annoyance
                    they gave him, exposed him to considerable ridicule. Reflection followed, and
                    celibacy appearing to him a dangerous state, he married a young woman almost
                    without fortune, who had interested him by an air of gentleness, modesty, and
                    virtue. Nor, adds Fontenelle, did these fair appearances deceive him. Satisfied
                    with his condition, he divided his time between<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:194565824?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5824-0689"/> study and
                    teaching. He gave lessons during peace; and the time of war he employed in
                    composing works which added to his ease and comfort as well as to his
                    reputation. He had as many as twelve children, who nearly all died at an early
                    age, and whom he regretted, says his panegyrist, “comme s’il eût été riche, ou
                    plutôt comme ne l’étant point; car ce sont les plus riches qui se tiennent les
                    plus incommodés d’une nombreuse famille.” He lost his wife in 1701, and with her
                    all the comfort and happiness of his life. Neither did this misfortune come
                    single. The war of the succession, by depriving him of his scholars, reduced him
                    to a melancholy condition. But his patience was never for an instant ruffled,
                    and notwithstanding the difficulties in which he found himself involved, he lost
                    nothing of his gaiety. About this time he was admitted into the Academy of
                    Sciences as an <hi rend="italic">élève,</hi> a title which it was intended to
                    elevate in general estimation by bestowing it on a man of Ozanam’s age and
                    merit. He appears to have had a presentiment of approaching death, arising
                    perhaps from some latent disorder within; and under this impression he refused
                    to receive some foreign noblemen who wished to become his pupils, alleging that
                    he should not live long enough to carry them through a regular course. At
                    length, on the 3d of April 1717, immediately after dinner, which he had eaten
                    with some relish, he felt himself unwell, and asked to be put to bed; but a few
                    minutes afterwards he was struck with an apoplexy, which in less than two hours
                    carried him off. Ozanam was a man of a mild and calm disposition, of a cheerful
                    and pleasant temper, and endeared by a generosity almost unparalleled. After
                    marriage his manners were irreproachable. He was sincerely pious, although in
                    matters of religion he did not allow himself to know more than the people, and
                    studiously avoided intermeddling in theological disputes. He used to say that it
                    was the business of the doctors of the Sorbonne to dispute, of the pope to
                    decide, and of a mathematician to go to paradise in a perpendicular line. He
                    composed with extreme facility, and never made any erasure or correction on his
                    manuscripts, his first copy being always the last.</p>
