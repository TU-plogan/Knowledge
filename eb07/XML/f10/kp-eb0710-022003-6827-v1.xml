                    History,</hi> are the members of the religious order established by St Francis
                    in the year 1208. Francis was the son of a merchant of Assisi, in the province
                    of Umbria. After leading for some time a dissolute life, he was reclaimed by a
                    fit of sickness, and fell into the opposite extreme of devotion. Soon after this
                    event, hearing the passage repeated (Mat. x. 9, 10), in which Christ addresses
                    his apostles, <hi rend="italic">Provide neither gold, nor silver,</hi> &amp;c.
                    he was led to believe that a voluntary and absolute poverty was the essence of
                    the gospel, and to prescribe this poverty as a sacred rule both to himself and
                    to his followers. This new society, which appeared to Innocent III. extremely
                    well adapted to the state of the church at the time, and calculated to restore
                    its declining credit, was solemnly approved of and confirmed by Honorius III. in
                    1223, and had made considerable progress before the death of its founder, which
                    took place in 1226. Francis, through an excessive humility, would not suffer the
                    monks of his order to be called <hi rend="italic">fratres,</hi> brethren or
                    friars, but <hi rend="italic">fraterculi,</hi> little brethren, or friars-minor,
                    by which denomination they still continue to be distinguished. They were also
                    called <hi rend="italic">gray friars,</hi> on account of the colour of their
                    clothing, and sometimes <hi rend="italic">cordeliers.</hi> The Franciscans and
                    Dominicans were zealous and active friends of the papal hierarchy, and, in
                    return for their devotion to its interests, were distinguished by peculiar
                    privileges and honourable employments. The Franciscans, in particular, were
                    invested with ample and extensive indulgences, the distribution of which was
                    committed to them by the popes, as a means of subsistence, and a rich
                    indemnification for their voluntary poverty. In consequence of this grant, the
                    rule of the founder, which absolutely prohibited both personal and collective
                    property, so that neither the individual nor the community<pb break="no"

                    possess either fund, revenue, or any worldly goods, was considered as too strict
                    and severe, and dispensed with soon after his death. In 1231 Gregory IX.
                    published an interpretation of this rule, mitigating its rigour; and it was
                    further confirmed by Innocent IV. in 124&gt;5, and by Alexander IV. in 1247. But
                    these mitigations were zealously opposed by a branch of the Franciscans called
                    the <hi rend="italic">spiritual;</hi> and their complaints were attended to by
                    Nicholas III. who, in 1279, published a ∞nstitution, confirming the rule of St
                    Francis, and containing an elaborate explanation of the maxims which it
                    recommended, and the duties which it prescribed. In 1287, Matthew of Aqua
                    Sparta, being elected general of the order, discouraged the ancient discipline
                    of the Franciscans, and allowed his monks to abandon even the appearance of
                    poverty. This conduct inflamed the indignation of the spiritual Franciscans; so
                    that from the year 1290 seditions and schisms arose in an order that had been
                    distinguished, in appearance at least, for its disinterestedness and humility.
                    Such was the enthusiastic frenzy of the Franciscans, that they impiously
                    maintained that the founder of their order was a second Christ, in all respects
                    similar to the first; and that their institution and discipline were the true
                    gospel of Jesus. Accordingly, in 1303, Albizi, a Franciscan of Pisa, published a
                    book, with the applause of his order, entitled <hi rend="italic">The book of the
                    Conformities of St Francis with Jesus Christ.</hi> In the beginning of the
                    fourteenth century the whole Franciscan order was divided into two parties; one
                    of which embraced the severe discipline and absolute poverty of St Francis, and
                    were called <hi rend="italic">spirituals}</hi> and the other, who insisted on
                    mitigating the austere injunctions of their founder, were denominated <hi
                    rend="italic">brethren of the community.</hi> The latter wore long and loose,
                    but good habits, with large hoods; the former were clad in a strait, coarse, and
                    short dress, pretending that their habiliments were enjoined by St Francis, and
                    that no power on earth had a right to alter them. But neither the moderation of
                    Clement V. nor the violence of John XXII. could appease the tumult occasioned by
                    their contentions; their rage, however, subsided after the year 1329. In 1368
                    these two parties were formed into two large bodies, comprehending the whole
                    Franciscan order, which subsist to this day; namely, the <hi rend="italic"
                    >conventual brethren,</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">brethren of the
                    observance,</hi> from whom sprung the Capuchins and Recollects. The general
                    opinion is, that the Franciscans came into England in the year 1224, and had
                    their first house at Canterbury, and their second at London; but there is no
                    certain account of their being here until King Henry VII. built two or three
                    houses for them. On the dissolution of the monasteries, the conventual
                    Franciscans owned about fifty-five houses, which were under seven custodies or
                    wardenships, namely, those of London, York, Cambridge, Bristol, Oxford,
                    Newcastle, and Worcester. In the eighteenth century the whole number of
                    Franciscans and Capuchins amounted to 115,000 monks, who occupied 7000 convents.
                    At present, however, their number is not nearly so great, as the order has been
                    suppressed in various countries.</p>
