                <p><label type="entry">LAMBECIUS, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Lambeck,
                    Peter</hi></label>, one of the first bibliographers of Germany, was born at
                    Hamburg, on the 13th of April 1628. He was the son of Heino Lambeck, a good
                    arithmetician, who published several works, and of a sister of Lucas Holstein,
                    called in Latin Holstenius. After he had completed his early studies, his uncle
                    counselled him to visit the most celebrated schools, and generously undertook to
                    bear the expense of his travels. He set out from Hamburg at the close of the
                    year 1645, and stopped some time at Amsterdam, where he attended the prelections
                    of Vossius and of Baerle, to whom his uncle had recommended him. He then visited
                    Leyden, and other principal cities in the Low Countries; after which he
                    proceeded to Paris, where he resided a year with Cardinal Barberini, who, out of
                    consideration for Holstenius, showed him every attention, and introduced him to
                    many of the most learned men of the time. At length, in 1647, he rejoined his
                    uncle at Rome. Ho’stenius received him in the kindest manner; but he soon had
                    occasion to appreciate the character of his nephew, which exhibited a singular
                    mixture of pride and baseness, and, at the end of two years, they separated in
                    mutual dislike. Lambecius quitted Rome in 1649, studied law for a short period
                    at Toulouse, and then revisited Paris, where he occupied himself in collecting
                    materials for his history of Hamburg, to which place he returned in 1651. Some
                    time after his return to his own country, he was appointed professor of history
                    in the college of Hamburg, and commenced his prelections by a discourse <hi

                    coeteris</hi><hi rend="italic">Studiis conjunctione,</hi> which confirmed the
                    favourable opinion that had been formed of his talents. In 1659, he succeeded
                    Joachim Jungius in the rectorship, and, by his zeal for the prosperity of the
                    school, proved himself worthy of this promotion. But his religious principles
                    began to be suspected; and as it seems certain that, during his travels, he had
                    secretly abjured Lutheranism, he became exposed to every species of annoyance in
                    consequence. Sensible that he could not preserve his situation, and desirous to
                    make some provision for the future, he married an old maid whom he believed to
                    be wealthy; but finding himself deceived, he fled from Hamburg, fifteen days
                    after this ridiculous marriage, with the resolution never again to return
                    thither. He took his departure upon the 14th of April 1662, and proceeded to
                    Vienna, where he met with a flattering reception from the Emperor Leopold, to
                    whom he had the honour of presenting his first work, being the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Prodromus Historice</hi><hi rend="italic">Literariae.</hi> In May he left
                    Vienna for Italy, and, on reaching Venice, sent to the senate of Hamburg a
                    formal resignation of his appointments as rector and professor. On his arrival
                    at Rome, he introduced himself to Christina, queen of Sweden, who kindly
                    endeavoured to console him for the persecutions he had experienced at the hands
                    of the Protestant theologians. He there also solemnly abjured the errors in
                    which he had been educated, and returned to Vienna, which he reached in the
                    month of September. The emperor immediately conferred on him the title of
                    historiographer, with the situation of sub-librarian; and some months
                    afterwards, on the demise of Mathias Manchter, he became principal keeper of the
                    imperial library. He immediately set about arranging in the best order the vast
                    collection confided to his care; he removed the manuscripts from an obscure
                    corner, where they had been abandoned to neglect and decay, classed them, and
                    commenced a catalogue of this part of the collection. He made two journeys, one
                    to Innspruck, and another to Baden, whence he brought back a large quantity of
                    rare books and manuscripts, with which he enriched the imperial library, to
                    which his own was afterwards added. Lambecius, being naturally frugal, lodged
                    with an advocate named Strellmayer, who managed all his affairs, and whom, in
                    return, he made his heir. He died at Vienna in the month of April 1680, at the
                    very time when he was pre-paving<pb break="no"

                    his labours with the greatest vigour. His works are, 1. Prodromus Lucubrationum
                    criticarum in A. Gellii Noctes Atticas, Paris, 1647, in 8vo; 2. Animad-versioncs

                    vols. 4to; 4. Prodromus Historiae Literariae, ibid. 1659, in folio; 5.a
                    Collection of Discourses pronounced in the Gymnasium of Hamburg; 6. Commentarii

                    vols, folio. Bayle has devoted to Lambecius an article in his Dictionary, and
