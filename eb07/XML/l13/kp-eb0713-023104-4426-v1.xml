                <p><label type="entry">LEON</label>, a province, or, as it is more commonly called
                    by the natives, a kingdom, of Spain. Asturias bounds it on the north side,
                    Galicia on the west, Estremadura and Old Castile on the south, and New Castile
                    on the east. Its extent is 1207 square leagues, and the number of its
                    inhabitants is 714,037. It is frequently divided into six departments, those of
                    Leon, Palencia, Valladolid, Tora, and Zamora; but the more recent division into
                    two departments, each clearly defined by the course of the river Duero, is more
                    natural, and less likely to perplex. The two divisions are denominated that of
                    Leon to the north, and that of Salamanca to the south, of the Duero. Of the
                    various rivers that cross Leon, the most considerable is the Pisuerga, in the
                    northern limits, to the eastward of the fountains of the Ebro and Reynosa. This
                    is one of the points of separation which divide those streams that run to the
                    Atlantic, from those which run to the Mediterranean, and is consequently one of
                    the most elevated districts in Spain. From its great elevation, it is
                    necessarily cold; and some of its summits reach the line of perpetual snow.
                    These hills produce the loftiest and best oaks in the peninsula, and are highly
                    useful in the construction of ships. Many bears and some wolves are found in
                    this range of mountains. The principal part of the labour of the mountaineers is
                    directed to the iron mines, and to the manufactory of hardware. In the intervals
                    between the highest hills they have good pastures, and feed many cows, from
                    whose milk butter is made, which, if the natives understood, or rather
                    practised, the simple art of salting, and packing in casks, might become a
                    valuable branch of commerce with the other parts of Spain, which draw their
                    supplies of that commodity from Holland or from Ireland. The mountains which
                    diverge from these towards the west are very steep, and gradually increase in
                    height till they Teach the border of Asturias, with which the communication is
                    held by fissures in the mountains called the Puertos de Piedrafita, de Pajares,
                    de Somceda, &amp;c.</p>
                <p>The height of these mountains has never been accurately ascertained; but if the
                    various plants that grow on their tops is a certain criterion of their
                    elevation, they are equal to the Pyrenees, and to most of the points of the
                    Alps. The inhabitants of these mountains are a detached race, and are thus
                    described by Don Mariano Lagasca, a recent and very intelligent traveller. “The
                    villages have few inhabitants, and are mostly in the valleys. The inhabitants
                    are robust and simple in their manners; they are equally ignorant of luxury and
                    drunkenness; all are clothed very coarsely, but warmly, from the looms of their
                    own females, and have their garments made in, the simplest fashion. Without
                    physician, surgeon, or apothecary; without irregular pleasures, they live
                    happily, drinking the milk of their cows, and eating their barley-bread and
                    salted meat. They have no other bed than a table fixed to the wall at one end of
                    their dwellings, which in shape resembles a coffin. They cultivate a few
                    vegetables, and grow barley in some of the least cold parts of the district, but
                    not sufficient for even their scanty consumption. From June to September they
                    have abundant pasture for their own cattle, as well as for the migratory flocks
                    of merino sheep that pass through their confines. In the valleys they have
                    meadows, on which they make hay for winter food for their cattle. The only
                    industry that is exercised is in making wooden shoes, and bowls and platters of
                    the same substance, which they sell in the neighbouring lower districts. Some
                    are also employed in collecting medicinal plants, which are sold to the city of
                    Leon. Before the year 1803, it was not known that the district abounded in the
                    Iceland moss. Since that period considerable quantities of that substance have
                    been collected, and it is now sold in Madrid at twenty reals the pound, whereas
                    before it was sold at 160. It has beļŗun to form a branch of commerce with the
                    mountaineers, and in time it may become an important article of subsistence for
                    them, as it is for the natives of Iceland.”</p>
                <p>The river Pisuerga, descending to the plains, receives on the right the river
                    Carrion, and on the left the Arlanza, and passes by Palencia, and through the
                    fertile valley of Tierra de Campos, abounding in wine and oil, till it is joined
                    by the Esgueva near the city of Valladolid, whence it has a short course to the
                    Duero. The other rivers of Leon are the Esla, the Torio, the Bernesga, the Sil,
                    and the Boeza, all of which unite ultimately with the <pb break="no"

                    southern part of Leon, the department of Salamanca, the population is thicker,
                    and the country more fertile. There are some mines of copper, and quarries of
                    marble. Many cows, sheep, horses, and mules, are bred; and, though not a rich,
                    yet, when compared with the mountain districts, it is a fertile tract of land.
                    The principal rivers that water it are the Daraton, the Eresma, the Adaja, the
                    Tormes, and the Agueda, which run to the Duero, and the Alogon, which runs
                    south, and, after crossing part of Estremadura, loses its name in the Tagus.</p>
                <p>The different agricultural and commercial productions of the kingdom of Leon will
                    be found under the places in which they are created; and the history of Leon,
                    long a separate kingdom, is included in the general history of Spain. The
                    province of Leon, one of the five in the kingdom, according to the ancient mode
                    of dividing it, is 493 square leagues in extent, and is inhabited by 239,810
                    people. It contains two cities, 197 towns, and 1284 villages, in 1373 parishes;
                    and has fifty monasteries, and sixteen charitable institutions.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Leon,</hi> a city of Spain, in the province of the same
                    name, and capital of it, as it was of the ancient kingdom of Leon before its
                    union with Castile. It is situated on a kind of peninsula, formed by two rivers,
                    the Torio and the Bernesga. It contains a population of about 7000 souls, who
                    are employed principally in spinning thread, and making it into coarse linen.
                    The country around it yields wheat, barley, and particularly flax; and they have
                    meadows where the cattle are pastured, and, what is not usual in Spain, where
                    they make hay. It is the see of a bishop, and, among various public buildings
                    that attract attention, the most remarkable is his cathedral, a most beautiful
                    specimen of the Gothic style of architecture. It contains thirteen parish
                    churches, nine monasteries, four hospitals, 1500 houses, and 6170 inhabitants.
                    Lat. 42. 45. N. The inhabitants make worsted stockings and caps, in forty looms;
                    leather and leathern gloves; and have some tanneries.</p>

                    things, that he resolved to commit them to writing. The first part of his
