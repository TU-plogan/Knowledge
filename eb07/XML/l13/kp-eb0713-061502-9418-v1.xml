                    Sicyon, in the Peloponnesus, flourished about 324 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.</hi>
                    c. He was at first a worker in brass, but afterwards devoted himself to
                    statuary, studying nature, by the advice of Eupompus, rather than following the
                    manner of any master. He excelled all those who had preceded him, in the nicety
                    of individual parts, and more particularly in the beauty of the hair. He
                    lessened the size of the head, which had been exaggerated by the ancient
                    sculptors, and made the body more slim, so as to increase the appearance of the
                    height. He used to say, that former sculptors represented men as they should be,
                    whilst he merely made them as they seemed to be. His reputation was such that
                    his name was included in the famous edict published by Alexander, when he
                    conferred on Apelles the sole right of painting his form, on Lysippus that of
                    executing it in bronze, and on Pyrgoteles that of engraving it on precious
                    stones. He is said (Plin. xxxiv. 7) to have produced fifteen hundred works of
                    art, any one of which was sufficient to stamp him as a man of talent. Of these
                    we can only mention a few of the most celebrated. There was one at Rome, the
                    removal of which from the baths of Agrippa to the palace of the emperor, by
                    order of Tiberius, had nearly caused a sedition. The populace clamoured for its
                    being replaced, and Tiberius did not deem it prudent to deny their request. It
                    was a statue called Apoxyomenos, representing, as its name implies, a man
                    scraping himself in the bath with a strigilis, an instrument to clean the body
                    of the particles of sweat. He executed many statues of Alexander, representing
                    him at different periods of his life; and he so managed, that a slight bend of
                    the head, for which Alexander was remarkable, became rather a beauty than a
                    deformity. One of these statues was so much admired by Nero, that he caused it
                    to be covered with gold, to the great grief of all true lovers of the art of
                    sculpture. He executed a very fine bronze statue of Cupid with a bow, for the
                    inhabitants of Thespis; also equestrian statues of twenty-five Macedonians who
                    fell at the passage of the Granicus, and which Metellus caused to be transported
                    to Rome. It has been supposed, though without any clear proof, that the
                    celebrated horses of Venice formed part of this group. There is a statue of
                    Hercules in the Palazzo Pitti at Florence, which bears his name, and has in
                    every respect a strong resemblance to the Farnese Hercules, excepting the
                    position of the legs(j‰s. <hi rend="italic">Pio-Clem.</hi> iii. p. 66). This
                    likewise has made it be supposed that the statue of the Palazzo Pitti is a copy
                    of the Hercules of Lysippus, and that the Farnese is an imitation, on which
                    Glycon thoughthe might engrave his name, on account of the change he had made in
                    its position. Lysippus had as pupils his own sons, Dahip-pus, Bedas, and
                    Euthycrates (Plin. xxxiv. 8. See Müller, <hi rend="italic">Handbuch der</hi><hi
