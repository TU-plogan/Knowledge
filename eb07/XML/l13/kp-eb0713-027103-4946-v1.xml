                <p><label type="entry">LIBERTY</label> denotes a state of freedom, in
                    contradistinction to slavery or restraint, and may be considered either as <hi
                    rend="italic">natural</hi> or as <hi rend="italic">civil.</hi></p>
                <p>The absolute rights of man, considered as a free agent, endowed with a
                    discernment to distinguish good from evil, and with a power of choosing those
                    measures which appear to him to be most desirable, are usually summed up in one
                    general appellation, and denominated the <hi rend="italic">natural liberty of
                    manhind.</hi> This natural liberty consists properly in a power of acting as one
                    thinks fit, without any restraint or control, unless by the law of nature; being
                    a right inherent in us by birth, and one of the gifts of God to man at his
                    creation, wnen he endowed him with the faculty of free-will. But every man, when
                    he enters into society, gives up a part of his natural liberty, as the price of
                    so valuable a purchase; and, in consideration of receiving the advantages of
                    mutual commerce and of protection, obliges himself to conform to those laws
                    which the community has thought proper to establish. This species of legal
                    obedience and conformity is therefore infinitely more desirable than that wild
                    and savage liberty which is sacrificed to obtain it. For no man, who considers
                    for a moment, would wish to retain the absolute and uncontrolled power of doing
                    whatever he pleased, because every other man would have the same power, and then
                    there would be no security to individuals in any of the enjoyments of life.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Civil</hi> liberty, therefore, which is that of a member of
                    society, is no other than natural liberty, restrained by human laws, as far as
                    is necessary and expedient for the advantage of the public. Hence we may
                    collect, that the law, which restrains a man from doing mischief to his
                    fellow-citizens, though it diminishes the natural, increases the civil liberty
                    of mankind; but every wanton and causeless restraint of the will of the subject,
                    whether practised by a monarch, a nobility, or a popular assembly, is a degree
                    of tyranny. Even laws themselves, whether made with or without our consent, if
                    they regulate and constrain our conduct in matters of mere indifference, without
                    any good end in view, are laws destructive of liberty; but if any public
                    advantage can arise from observing such precepts, the control of our private
                    inclinations, in one or more points, will conduce to preserve our general
                    freedom in others of more importance, by supporting that state of society which
                    alone can secure our independence. Thus <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193204959?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-4959-0272"/> the statute of
                    Edward IV. which forbade the fine gentlemen of his time to wear pikes upon their
                    shoes or boots of more than two inches in length, was a law that savoured of
                    oppression, because, however ridiculous the fashion then in use might appear,
                    the restraining it by pecuniary penalties could serve no purpose of general
                    utility. But the statute of Charles II. which prescribed a thing apparently as
                    indifferent, viz. a dress for the dead, who were ordered to be buried in
                    woollen, was a law consistent with public liberty; for it encouraged the staple
                    trade, on which in great measure depended the prosperity of the nation. Hence
                    laws, when prudently framed, are by no means subversive, but rather
                    introductive, of liberty; for, as Mr Locke has well observed, where there is no
                    law there is no freedom. But then, on the other hand, that system of laws is
                    alone calculated to maintain civil liberty, which leaves the subject entire
                    master of his own conduct, excepting as to those points in which the public good
                    requires some direction or restraint.</p>
                <p>The idea and practice of this civil liberty flourish in their highest vigour in
                    these kingdoms, where it falls little short of perfection, and can only be lost
                    or destroyed by the folly or demerits of its owner; the legislature, and of
                    course the laws of Britain, being peculiarly adapted to the preservation of this
                    inestimable blessing even in the meanest subject. And this spirit of liberty is
                    so deeply iιr <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>- planted in our constitution, and
                    rooted even in our very soil, that a slave or a negro, the moment he lands in
                    Britain, falls under the protection of the laws, and so far becomes a freeman,
                    though his master’s right to his service may possibly still continue.</p>
                <p>The absolute rights of every Briton, as they are founded on nature and reason, so
                    they are coeval with our form of government, though subject at times to
                    fluctuation and change; their establishment, excellent as it is, being still
                    human. At some periods we have seen them depressed by overbearing and tyrannical
                    princes; at others, so luxuriant as even to tend to anarchy, a state worse for
                    the time than tyranny itself, as any government is better than none at all. But
                    the vigour of our free constitution has always delivered the nation from these
                    embarrassments; and, as soon as the convulsions consequent orr the struggle have
                    ceased, the balance of our rights and liberties has settled at its proper level;
                    whilst their fundamental articles have been asserted in parliament, asofteħ as
                    they were thought to be in danger. See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps"
