                <p><label type="entry">LABYRINTH</label>, amongst the ancients, was a large,
                    intricate edifice, cut out into various aisles and meanders running into one
                    another, so as to render it difficult to find a passage through them. Mention is
                    made of several of those edifices amongst the ancients; but the most celebrated
                    were the Egyptian and Cretan labyrinths. That of Egypt, according to Pliny, was
                    the oldest of all the known labyrinths, and subsisted in his time, after having
                    stood three thousand six hundred years. According to him, it was built by King
                    Petesucus, or Tithoes; but Herodotus makes it the work of several kings. It
                    consisted of twelve large contiguous palaces, containing three thousand
                    chambers, fifteen hundred of which were under ground. Strabo, Diodorus Siculus,
                    Pliny, and Mela, speak of this monument with the same admiration as Herodotus;
                    but not one of them tells us that it was so constructed as to bewilder those who
                    attempted to explore it; although it is manifest that, without a guide, they who
                    entered it would be in danger of losing their way. It was this danger, no doubt,
                    which introduced a new term into the Greek language. The word <hi rend="italic"
                    >labyrinth,</hi> taken in the literal sense, signifies a circumscribed space,
                    intersected by a number of passages, some of which cross each other in every
                    direction like those in quarries and mines, whilst others make larger or smaller
                    circuits round the place from which they depart, like the spiral lines we see on
                    certain shells. In the figurative sense, it was applied to obscure and captious
                    questions, to indirect and ambiguous answers, and to those discussions which,
                    after long digressions, bring us back to the point from which we had set out.
                    The Cretan labyrinth is the most famous in history or fable, having been
                    rendered particularly remarkable by the story of the Minotaur, and of Thcseus,
                    who found his way through all its windings by means of Ariadne’s clue. Diodorus
                    Siculus relates as a conjecture, and Pliny as a certain fact, that Daedalus
                    constructed this labyrinth on the model of that of Egypt, though on a smaller
                    scale. It was formed by the command of Minos, who kept the Minotaur shut up in
                    it; but in their time it no longer existed, having been either destroyed by
