                    celebrated Roman poet and philosopher, who was born <hi rend="smallcaps">b.
                    c.</hi> 95 and died <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> 55, according to Donatus

                    rend="smallcaps">b. c.</hi> according to Eusebius. We have no precise
                    information respecting his parents, his education, or the circumstances of his
                    life; and even whether he studied at Athens under Zeno is a matter of
                    considerable doubt. We know, however, that he must have witnessed the
                    proscriptions of Marius and Sylla, and have lived during all the horrors of the
                    civil war, a period full of popular commotions, and crimes of the deepest dye. *
                    An ingenious writer has attempted to draw a parallel between those horrible
                    times and the peculiar doctrines which Lucretius advocated. It is said that, not
                    daring to attribute the misery of his country to the justice and wisdom of the
                    gods, he was anxious to dethrone a Providence which seemed to abandon the world
                    to the" passions of ambitious tyrants. He borrowed his philosophy from the
                    school of Epicurus, and was evidently well acquainted with the language and
                    manners of the Greeks. His poem entitled <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Rerum Natura</hi> is divided into six books, and addressed to his
                    friend Memmius, one of the most virtuous and enlightened men of his age. There
                    is a tradition that it was composed during the lucid intervals of a madness
                    caused by a love potion which had been administered to him by his wife Lucilia.
                    The talent of Lucretius is displayed by the skilful manner in which he treats
                    his subject, even when its nature is such that it does not admit of poetical
                    embellishment, and by the dignity with which he unfolds his philosophical views.
                    He indulges but seldom in declamation, and every thing is simple and without
                    ornament. The poet has bestowed much care upon the introductory parts of each
                    book, and <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209119?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9119-0592"/> throughout the work there are many beautiful
                    passages and episodes, such as the description of the plague at Athens. The most
                    celebrated passages are the invocation to Venus, the powerful description of
                    love, &amp;c.; but, to form a just idea of his talents, we must read the fifth
                    book, in which he narrates the formation of society. The materials for this work
                    were taken principally from the writings of Epicurus. In the design he seems to
                    imitate the unadorned and almost prosaic poetry of Empedocles. The language,
                    rich in antique forms and expressions, is thus full of power and energy; but
                    that he had many difficulties with which to contend, is proved by his complaints
                    of the poverty of the Latin language, and by the introduction of many Greek
                    words, which are seldom to be met with in other Roman authors. His philosophy is
                    that of the atheist; he denies the existence of a Deity and of a Providence; he
                    disbelieves the immortality of the soul, and laughs at the idea of death. From
                    the depths of this heartless scepticism, however, he darts at times to the very
                    heights of enthusiasm and poetry. But the character of his system experiences no
                    change. He destroys all those gods with whom the poets loved to people the
                    universe; he ridicules the idea of a future life, and of future rewards and
                    punishments; he represses all hopes, and stifles all fear; yet all ages have
                    admired this poem of Lucretius, as one of the most wonderful productions of
                    human genius. It is said by Eusebius that Cicero revised and published this
                    work, and yet it is remarkable that he only mentions Lucretius once, and then
                    his praise is but equivocal (Cic. <hi rend="italic">ad Q. Fratr.</hi> ii. 2).
                    Ovid promises immortality to his verses.</p>
                <p>Carmina sublimis tunc sunt peritura Lucreti, Exitio terris cum dabit una
                    dies.</p>
                <p>There have been many editions of this work. The first edition known is in folio,
                    without date, and appears to be that of Thomas Ferrand, printed at Brescia in
                    1473. The others are, Veron. 1486; Venetiis apud Aldum, 1500; cum comment.
                    Lambini, Paris, 1564,1570; cum notis Creech, Oxon. 1695; ed. Wakefield, Lond.
