                <p><label type="entry">LANCH</label>, a peculiar sort of long boat, employed by the
                    French, Spanish, and Italian shipping, and in general by those of other European
                    nations, when voyaging in the Mediterranean Sea. A lanch is proportionally
                    longer, lower, and more flat bottomed, than the long boat; it is consequently
                    less fit for sailing, but better calculated for rowing, and approaching a flat
                    shore. But its principal superiority over the long boat consists in being by its
                    construction much fitter to under-run the cable; which is a very necessary
                    employment in the harbours of the Levant, where the cables of different ships
                    are fastened across each other, and frequently render this exercise extremely
                    necessary.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lanch,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Launch,</hi> is also the
                    movement by which a ship or boat descends from the shore, either when she is at
                    first built, or at any time afterwards. To facilitate the operation of
                    launching, and prevent any interruption, the ship is supported by two strong
                    platforms, laid with a gradual inclination to the water, on the opposite side of
                    her keel, to which they are parallel. Upon the surface of this declivity are
                    placed two corresponding ranks of planks, which compose the base of a frame
                    called the <hi rend="italic">cradle,</hi> the upper part of which envelopes the
                    ship’s bottom, to which it is securely attached. Thus the .lower surface of the
                    cradle, conforming exactly to that of the frame below, lies flat upon it
                    lengthwise, under the opposite sides of the ship’s bottom; and as the former is
                    intended to slide downwards upon the latter, carrying the ship along with it,
                    the planes or faces of both are well daubed over with soap and tallow. The
                    necessary preparations for the launch being made, all the blocks and wedges by
                    which the ship was formerly supported are driven out from under her keel, till
                    her whole weight gradually subsides upon the platforms above described, which
                    are accordingly called the <hi rend="italic">ways.</hi> The shores and
                    stanchions, by which she is retained upon the stocks <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193202120?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2120-0055"/> till the
                    period approaches for launching, are at length cut away, and the screws applied
                    to move her if necessary. The motion usually begins on the instant when the
                    shores are cut, and the ship slides downward along the ways, which are generally
                    prolonged under the surface of the water, to a sufficient depth to float her as
                    soon as she arrives at the farther extremity. When a ship is to be launched, the
                    ensign, jack, and pendant are always hoisted, the last being displayed from a
                    staff erected in the middle of the ship. Ships of the first rate are commonly
                    constructed in dry docks, and afterwards floated out, by throwing open the
                    flood-gates, and suffering the tide to enter as soon as they are finished.</p>
