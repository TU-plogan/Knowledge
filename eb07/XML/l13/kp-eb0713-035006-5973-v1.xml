                    physician, was born at Canterbury about the year 1460, and educated there under
                    the learned William Selling. He thence removed to Oxford, and in 1484 was chosen
                    fellow of All-Souls’ College. Selling, his former instructor, being at this time
                    appointed ambassador from King Henry VII. to the court of Rome, Mr Linacre
                    accompanied him to Italy, where he attained a high degree of perfection in the
                    Greek and Latin languages. At Rome he applied himself particularly to the study
                    of Aristotle and Galen, in the original. On his return to Oxford, he was
                    incorporated doctor of physic, and chosen public professor in that faculty. But
                    he had not been long in England before he was commanded by Henry VII. to repair
                    to court, to attend the young Prince Arthur as his tutor and physician. Fie was
                    afterwards appointed physician to the king, and after his death to his successor
                    Henry VIII. Dr Linacre founded two medical lectures at Oxford, and one at
                    Cambridge; but that which has most effectually immortalized his name amongst the
                    faculty, is his being the founder of the College of Physicians in London. He
                    beheld with vexation the wretched state of physic in those times; and, by an
                    application to Cardinal Wolsey, obtained a patent in 1518, by which the
                    physicians of London were incorporated. The intention of this corporation was to
                    prevent illiterate and ignorant persons from practising the art of healing. Dr
                    Linacre was <pb break="no" facs="nls:193205986?mode=fullsize"

                    as he lived. Their meetings were held in his own house in Knightrider Street,
                    which he bequeathed to the college. But, when he was about the age of fifty, he
                    took it into his head to study divinity, entered into orders, and, in 1509, was
                    collated to the rectory of Mersham. In the same year he was installed as
                    prebendary of Wells, in 1518 as prebendary of York, and in the following year
                    was admitted precentor of that cathedral. This, we are told, he resigned for
                    other preferments. He died of stone in the bladder in October 1524, at the age
                    of sixty-four, and was buried in St Paul’s. Thirty-three years after his death,
                    Dr John Caius caused a monument to be erected to his memory, with a Latin
                    inscription, whieh contains the outlines of his life and character. He was a man
                    of great natural sagacity, a skilful physician, a profound grammarian, and one
                    of the best Greek and Latin scholars of his time. Erasmus, in his epistles,
                    speaks highly of his translations from Galen, preferring them even to the
                    original Greek. His works are, 1. <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic"

                    London, printed by Pynson, 1524, 8vo, and by Stephens, 1527, 1532; 2. Rudiments
                    of Grammar, for the use of the Princess Mary, printed by Pynson, and translated
                    into Latin by Buchanan, Paris, 1536. He likewise translated into Latin several
                    of Galen’s works, which were at different times printed abroad; also <hi
