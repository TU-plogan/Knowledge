                <p><label type="entry">LANARK</label>, the head burgh of the county of that name, is
                    situated on an eminence half a mile from the Clyde, on its northern bank, at the
                    distance of thirty-two miles west from Edinburgh, and twenty-five miles
                    south-east from Glasgow. The derivation of the name has been the subject of much
                    dispute, and is still involved in doubt. Lanark is one of the most ancient towns
                    in Scotland. It appears to have been of considerable importance as early as the
                    tenth century; for the first parliament ever held in Scotland was assembled here
                    by Kenneth II. in 978; and at the royal castle of Lanark, the charter of William
                    the Lion in favour of the town of Ayr was dated, in 1197. It was also the scene
                    of the first military exploit of Sir William Wallace, who there slew the English
                    governor for his cruelty and oppression, and in the neighbouring rocky
                    fastnesses raised the standard of deliverance.</p>
                <p>Lanark was originally erected into a royal burgh by Alexander I. There were
                    several subsequent charters granted by other kings; but the last onc,
                    confirmatory of all the rest, was given by Charles I. in 1632.</p>
                <p>Till the beginning of the present century, Lanark presented a mean and deserted
                    appearance, and was said to be a “finished town but the rapid increase of the
                    cotton manufacture at Glasgow, of the benefit of which Lanark reflectively
                    enjoys a portion, has done much in reviving a spirit of improvement. The old
                    houses are being rapidly modernised, and many new houses have been added. A
                    branch of the Commercial Bank has been established, and a handsome house erected
                    for the accommodation of their agent. A new jail and splendid county buildings
                    have been erected, reading-rooms instituted, and many other indications of
                    growing prosperity and wealth are manifested in a marked manner.</p>
                <pb break="no" facs="nls:193202042?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0713-2042-0049"/>
                <p>The staple occupation, previously to the introduction of the cotton manufacture,
                    was the making of shoes and stockings; but latterly these manufactures have been
                    mostly limited to the consumption of the district. About 700 persons are engaged
                    in weaving, and about 100 in shoemaking.</p>
                <p>Lanark, along with Hamilton, Airdrie, and Falkirk, sends one representative to
                    parliament. The municipal government is vested in a provost, two bailies, and
                    fourteen councillors.</p>
                <p>The population of the burgh in 1794 was 2000, in 1831 it was 4266, and it must
                    have increased considerably since that period. The population of the parish in
                    1831 was 7672.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Lanark,</hi><hi rend="italic">New,</hi> a manufacturing
                    village, the most extensive for spinning cotton in Scotland. It is situated on
                    the northern bank of the Clyde, a little below the celebrated falls, and about a
                    mile distant from the town of Lanark. It was erected about the year 1785, by Mr
                    David Dale, an enterprising and benevolent individual.</p>
                <p>New Lanark afterwards came into the possession of Mr Robert Owen, son-in-law of
                    its founder, who, by his exertions in the cause of education, brought the
                    establishment into great notoriety. Mr Owen, in the prosecution of the grand
                    object of his life, was, fortunately <hi rend="italic">for</hi> his reputation
                    as a philanthropist, early led to perceive the benefits to be derived from
                    receiving infants into his educational institution; and thus originated that
                    system which subsequently attracted so much attention. Messrs Walker and
                    Company, the present proprietors, continue the infant school, and give gratis
                    instruction to the more advanced children belonging to the village, in all the
                    more useful branches of education; and the regulation adopted by Mr Owen, that
                    no child under ten years of age, and who cannot read and write, and understand
                    accounts, shall be received into the work, continues to be strictly
                    enforced.</p>
                <p>About fifteen years ago one of the mills was burned down; but in 1835 the
                    proprietors rebuilt it on a greatly enlarged scale, and, it is said, are about
                    to fit it up as a power-loom weaving factory. A gas-work has also been
                    completed, on a scale sufficiently adequate to light up both the works and the
                    village.</p>
                <p>The population of New Lanark, about ten years ago, was 2260; but, according to
                    the returns of 1831, the number was then reduced to 1901. It is now (1836)
                    farther reduced to 1850 souls, of whom about 1100 are employed in the works.
                    Owing to the improvements in machinery, more work is now performed by these than
                    was done by 1500 or 1600, the number employed at the period of its greatest
                    population. Besides, it is worthy of remark, as a greater triumph of machinery,
                    that in the change thus effected, the number of men required has been greatly
                    reduced, and their places occupied by women and boys.</p>
                <p>The people of New Lanark are better informed, and their moral character and
                    general deportment rank higher, than usually obtains amongst those of their
                    class.</p>
                <p>The situation of the village is low, but the cleanliness of its spacious and
                    well-ventilated streets gives an idea of comfort exceedingly gratifying to the
                    stranger, and must be highly conducive to health.</p>
