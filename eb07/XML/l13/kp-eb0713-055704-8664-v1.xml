                <p><label type="entry">LONGINUS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Dionysius
                    Cassius</hi></label>, a celebrated Greek critic and grammarian, was, according
                    to Fabricius, grandson of Cassius Longinus, who is mentioned by Plutarch <hi
                    rend="italic">{Symp.</hi> ix. 1); but this is a mere conjecture, unsupported by
                    any adequate proof. The precise period of his birth is unknown, though it is not
                    unlikely that it took place about <hi rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> D. 213, in the
                    reign of Caracalla, as he maybe supposed to have preceded by at least twenty
                    years his pupil Porphyry, who was born <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 233.
                    There is no doubt that his death took place <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 273,
                    when the Emperor Aurelian took Palmyra. The place of his birth is also a matter
                    of much uncertainty, as it is nowhere distinctly stated. The circumstance of his
                    understanding the Syrian language, and his uncle being from Emesa in Syria, has
                    caused some to fix on that city as his native place; and others have suspected,
                    though with still less appearance of probability, that he was from Palmyra. His
                    uncle Fronto enjoyed considerable reputation as a teacher of philosophy at
                    Athens; and, amongst other pupils, he had Philostratus, who is known to us by
                    his life of the philosopher and prophet Apollonius of Tyana, which is still
                    preserved. It would appear that Fronto was much attached to his nephew, whom he
                    made his heir; and from him Longinus most probably derived the rudiments of his
                    education. In his earlier years we find, from a fragment of one of his works
                    preserved by Porphyry in his life of Plotinus, that he travelled much, and
                    enjoyed the opportunity of becoming acquainted with all the most distinguished
                    philosophers of his time. He gives the names of upwards of twenty, but, with the
                    exception of Ammonius Saccas, Origen, Plotinus, and Amelius, their celebrity was
                    not sufficient to rescue them from oblivion. Ammonius taught the Platonic
                    philosophy at Alexandria in Egypt, and at this time appears to have enjoyed a
                    high reputation. The doctrines <pb break="no" facs="nls:193208677?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-8677-0558"/> which he advocated, and his particular system,
                    are known to us from the works of his pupil Plotinus, and the epitome of
                    Hierocles in Photius. (<hi rend="italic">Cod.</hi> ccxiv. p. 550.) The
                    philosopher Origen, the master of Longinus, is not to be confounded with the
                    Christian bishop of the same name, who was born at Alexandria, A. D. 185.</p>
                <p>After Longinus had made himself completely master of the philosophy of Plato,
                    which he preferred to that of every other sect, he took up his residence at
                    Athens, and devoted himself to the instruction of youth in grammar and
                    philosophy. Here Porphyry attended him, and derived much of that information
                    which he afterwards employed against the Christian religion. After a long
                    residence at Athens, he proceeded to the East, and joined Zenobia, queen of
                    Palmyra, who had a little before succeeded to the government of the kingdom upon
                    the death of her husband Odenathus. He became her preceptor in the Greek
                    language, and she even consulted him respecting the administration of her
                    affairs. Zenobia was persuaded by her courtiers that she was sufficiently
                    powerful to refuse obedience to.the commands of Aurelian, who had some time
                    before succeeded to the Roman empire. Aurelian was more particularly amazed by
                    the haughty style of a letter which was sent by Zenobia in answer to his
                    demands, and which was said to have been dictated by Longinus. This letter is
                    found in the life of Aurelian by Flavius Vopiscus <hi rend="italic">{Aug.
                    Script,</hi> vol. ii. p. 174, ed. Bipont.). Palmyra was taken after an obstinate
                    siege, and Aurelian was ungenerous enough to punish him by death for the insult
                    which had been offered to his dignity by the letter he had dictated. Longinus
                    died without indulging in vain regrets, and in a manner worthy of his character
                    as a philosopher, consoling the companions of his misfortunes. (Zosim. i.
                    56.)</p>
                <p>He was the author of many works of criticism, but, with the exception of a few
                    fragments, and of his treatise ∏εg∕ 'γ&gt;ψouς, On the Sublime, they have all
                    perished. This treatise is addressed to his friend Posthumus Terentianus, and is
                    an able disquisition on the various sources from which sublimity in writing is
                    derived, illustrated by examples selected from the works of the most
                    distinguished authors of antiquity. The Old Testament was not unknown to him, as
                    he has quoted as one of the noblest specimens of the sublime, the celebrated
                    passage in Genesis: “And God said, Let there be light; and there was light.” We
                    find also in a fragment <hi rend="italic">{E. Cod. MS. to Vat.)</hi> that he
                    ranks Paul of Tarsus, as he styles the apostle, with Demosthenes and the more
                    celebrated orators of Greece. He was no doubt acquainted with the doctrines of
                    Christianity; and the noble sentiments which he at times expresses may not
                    unreasonably be ascribed to this circumstance. In the epilogue to his treatise,
                    he speaks most feelingly of the corruption which pervaded every part of the
                    world, and of the little attention which was paid to the cultivation of the
                    intellect. The moral degeneracy of the age he in a great measure ascribes to the
                    absence of free institutions, and quotes the well-known lines of the Odyssey,
                    which Pope has thus translated :—</p>
                <p>Jove fixed it certain, that whatever day Makes man a slave, takes half his worth
                    away.</p>
                <p>It is remarkable that such sentiments should be found at this period of the
                    world; but there can be no doubt that they were the genuine expression of his
                    feelings. This treatise has been frequently edited, and one of the best editions
                    is that by Hudson, Oxford, 1710. It has also been edited by Weiske, Weigel,
                    1809; and by Toup, Oxford, 1778. It has been translated into English by Smith,
                    1739; and into German by J. G. Schlosser, Leipzig, 1781, and by Von Heineken,
                    Basel, 1784.</p>
