                <p><label type="entry">LUCIANUS</label>, a celebrated Greek writer, was born at
                    Samosata, the chief city of Commagene, a district situated upon the right bank
                    of the river Euphrates. The precise dates of his birth and death are unknown;
                    but it seems to be generally allowed that he flourished during the reign of the
                    Antonines and of Commodus. Reitz, who has examined this point with much
                    minuteness, makes his life extend between the years 120 and 200 of our era. His
                    own writings supply us with what scanty information we have respecting his
                    private history. His parents, he tells us, were poor, and*found it necessary
                    that their son should at an early period choose the profession by which he was
                    to gain his livelihood. IÍis maternal uncle was a sculptor of some fame at
                    Samosata, and was willing to teach his nephew his own profession; but the youth
                    having contrived awkwardly to break a marble slab which he was set to polish,
                    received a severe beating from his cross-grained uncle. Lucian refused to submit
                    to such treatment, and gave up all thoughts of succeeding to the lucrative
                    business of his uncle. He then turned his attention to a more liberal
                    profession, and devoted himself to the study of law; but becoming disgusted with
                    the chicanery and deceit of which he was obliged to be cognisant, he abandoned
                    his new profession, and applied himself to philosophy. He then visited the
                    different parts of the civilized world; he resided several years in Gaul and in
                    Italy, of which he gives an account in his treatises entitled <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nigrinus,</hi> but chiefly in Athens, where he became thoroughly master of the
                    Greek language. It is believed, from incidents mentioned in <hi rend="italic"
                    >Nigrinus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Hermotimus,</hi> that Lucian approached his
                    fortieth year when he left Gaul, where he appears to have resided from ten to
                    fifteen years. Massieu imagines that he returned to Samosata, and remained in
                    his native place till Marcus Aurelius conferred upon him a lucrative situation
                    in Egypt. Wieland, however, who examined this part of his life minutely, gives
                    satisfactory reasons for believing that he spent most of his time at Athens,
                    where he composed the greater part of his finest dialogues. He was certainly
                    resident in Greece <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d.</hi> 165, where he witnessed the
                    self-sacrifice of the enthusiast Peregrinus Proteus on the funeral pile, during
                    the celebration of the Olympic games. He spent the latter part of his life in
                    Egypt, but he does not state the precise nature of the office which he filled in
                    that country.</p>
                <p>Lucian is distinguished as a writer for fertility of genius, wit, taste, and
                    elegance, and for the talent of conferring the grace of novelty upon the most
                    common and familiar topics. Notwithstanding the great change in customs and
                    manners, after a lapse of seventeen hundred years, the wit of Lucian is still
                    amusing, his satire still applicable, and his pictures of manners still fresh
                    and vivid. It must be confessed that he sometimes exceeds reasonable bounds
                    whilst he ridicules the absurd superstitions of his countrymen, and laughs at
                    the mountebanks who were decked out with the name of philosophers. Whilst he
                    merely intends <pb break="no" facs="nls:193209080?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0713-9080-0589"/> to attack superstition, he is often so carried
                    away by his wit as to ridicule all religious sentiments. He strikes at the very
                    foundation of morality; and the blows which he aims at the hypocrites amongst
                    philosophers, sometimes fall on the good and virtuous. In depicting the manners
                    of the vicious, he is at times obscene and licentious. Amongst the most spirited
                    of his works we may mention, the <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of the Gods,</hi>
                    in which Lucian makes the gods converse, as it were, in their domestic capacity
                    and undress, and in moments of weakness, when, not being aware that they were
                    privily overheard by men, they exposed themselves to the view of their
                    worshippers in all their nakedness. In these dramatic scenes they show
                    themselves, by their follies, baseness, and vices, unworthy of the esteem and
                    confidence of mankind. <hi rend="italic">Dialogues of the Dead,</hi> in which he
                    ridicules with his peculiar humour the vulgar tenets respecting the state of
                    souls after death, hell-torments, and the deification of dead persons. <hi
                    rend="italic">Timon,</hi> in which there is considerable resemblance to the <hi
                    rend="italic">Plutus</hi> of Aristophanes; <hi rend="italic">the Dream of
                    Micyllus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the Cock</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Jupiter</hi><hi rend="italic">Tragoedus,</hi> the comic title of a
                    little drama of much wit and humour, in which Jupiter gets such serious wounds
                    as he has never since been able to recover. <hi rend="italic">The Convicted
                    Jupiter,</hi> in which Lucian shows the inconsistency of the pagan doctrines
                    concerning fate, the providence of the gods, and the rewards and punishments
                    after death. <hi rend="italic">The Sale of the Philosophers,</hi> in which he
                    exposes the absurd tenets, manners, and principles of every sect. <hi
                    rend="italic">The Angler,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the resuscitated
                    Philosophers.</hi> In the story of <hi rend="italic">Lucius,</hi> or the <hi
                    rend="italic">Enchanted Ass,</hi> there are several indecent and licentious
                    scenes, though it abounds with humour. This story has been ascribed by some to
                    Lucius of Patrae, and there seems good reason for believing that Lucian merely
                    abridged it; but no one has ever doubted his claim to the story entitled <hi
                    rend="italic">The True History,</hi> a long tissue of incredible adventures, and
                    extraordinary voyages made in seas full of wonders. His intention was to
                    ridicule the impostures which Etesias and lambulus had attempted to palm upon
                    the world as true (stories. The tract entitled <hi rend="italic">How to write
                    History</hi> has been ^unanimously pronounced one of the best and most
                    instructive of his writings. There have been numerous editions jf the works of
                    Lucian. The first was published in 1496; Dut the best is that of Hemsterhuys and
                    Reitz, Amster-Ïam, 1743, three vols. 4to, to which is added a fourth olume, <hi
                    rend="italic">Lexicon Lucianeum,</hi> by Conrad Reitz, 1746. It ιas been
                    translated into German by Wieland, into Italian ιy Gozzi, and into English by
                    Franklin (1780), and Tooke 1820).</p>
