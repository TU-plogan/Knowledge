                    Duke of Coimbra, was the fourth child and second surviving son of King John of
                    Portugal, and was born on the 4th of March 1394. His father gave him an
                    excellent education, which, joined to strong natural abilities and much
                    application, rendered him one of the most accomplished princes of his time. He
                    was not only very learned himself, but a great lover of learning, and also a
                    patron of learned men. It was chiefly with a view to im-. prove his knowledge
                    that he spent four years in travelling throughout different countries in Europe,
                    Asia, and Africa, with a train suitable to his quality. There is a relation of
                    these travels still extant, but so loaded with fabulous circumstances, that it
                    wounds the reputation it was designed to raise. At his return he espoused
                    Isabella, daughter to the Count of Urgel, and grand-daughter to Dorn Pedro, the
                    fourth king of Portugal; which was esteemed a very great advancement of his
                    fortune. He was elected a member of <pb break="no"

                    order of the Garter on the 22d of April 1417, in the fifth year of the reign of
                    his eousin Henry V. a grandson of John of Gaunt by the father’s side, as our
                    Duke of Coimbra was by the mother. In 1440 he was declared regent during the
                    minority of his cousin Dorn Alonzo V. son of King Edward, who died of the
                    plague. He found <hi rend="subscript"> b</hi> some difficulty at first in the
                    discharge of his office, both from the queen-mother and others. But, upon the
                    whole, his administration was so mild and so just, that the magistrates and the
                    people of Lisbon concurred in demanding permission to ereet a statue to him. The
                    regent thanked them, said he should be unwilling to see a work of theirs
                    demolished, and that he was sufficiently rewarded by this publie testimony of
                    their affections. The queen dowager wished to raise disturbances in Portugal, by
                    aiming at recovering the regeney to herself; but the steadiness of the regent’s
                    administration, the attachment of the greater part of the nobility to him, and
                    his enjoying in so absolute a degree the confidence of the people, not only
                    secured the interior tranquillity of the state, but likewise raised the eredit
                    of the erown of Portugal to a very great height in the estimation of its
                    neighbours. In the eourse of his regeney he had made it his continual study to
                    pursue die publie good; to ease the people in general, and the inhabitants of
                    Lisbon in particular, of several impositions; to maintain the laws in their full
                    vigour; to give the king an excellent education; and, if that had been at all
                    practicable, to diffuse a perfect unanimity throughout the eourt, by assuaging
                    the malice and envy of his enemies. The king, when he eame of age, and the <hi
                    rend="italic">cortes</hi> or parliament, expressed their entire satisfaction
                    with the regent’s administration; and all parties entirely approved of the
                    king’s marriage with Donna Isabella, the regent’s daughter, whieh was celebrated
                    in 1446. The enmity of his enemies, however, was not in the least abated by the
                    regent’s being out of offiee. They still persecuted him with their unjust
                    calumnies, and unfortunately induced the king to hearken to their falsehoods.
                    The unfortunate duke, when ordered to appear before the king, was advised to
                    take with him an eseort of horse and foot. In his passage he was proclaimed a
                    rebel, and almost immediately surrounded by the king’s troops. Soon afterwards
                    he was attacked, and killed in the heat of aetion. Nor was the envy of his
                    enemies even then satiated. His body was denied burial, and at length taken away
                    privately by the peasants. But his virtue, however hated in eourts, was adored
                    by the uneorrupt part of his countrymen. At length, by an inspection of his
                    papers, the king saw, when it was too late, the injustice whieh had been done to
                    the man who had behaved so well in a high and difficult office; and his papers
                    discovered indications of further benefit contemplated for the king and his
                    dominions. In eonsequenee of these discoveries, the duke’s adherents were
                    declared loyal subjects, all prosecutions were ordered to cease, and the king
                    desired the body of Coimbra to be transported with great pomp from the eastle of
                    Abrantes to the monastery of Batalha, where it was interred in the tomb whieh he
                    had eaused to be ereeted there for himself.</p>
