                <p><label type="entry">PARIA</label>, a province of Bolivia, in South America,
                    situated in the department of Oruro. On the north and northeast it is bounded by
                    the provinces of Pacajes and Oruro, on the east and south-east by Porco, on the
                    south-west by Lipes, and on the west by Caranjas. This province is traversed by
                    a rapid river called the Desaguadero, or Drain, which is invariably represented
                    in maps of Peru and Bolivia as flowing into the lake of Titicaca, whilst the
                    reverse is the fact. It issues from this celebrated sheet of water, and, after
                    flowing a considerable distance, its waters are dissipated by spontaneous
                    evaporation. The province of Paria is situated in a mountainous tract of
                    country, and being very elevated, the temperature is consequently cold. Like
                    Oruro and other provinces in this region, it is a mining district, and contains
                    several mines of silver. There are some lakes in the province, from which salt
                    is extracted; and also some hot springs. The lake of Paria is from three to four
                    leagues in length and two in width, and abounds in excellent fish. Alcedo says
                    that it has a whirlpool, which sucks down floating bodies, and finds a passage
                    to the sea under the cordillera, and through the shore, close to the port of
                    Iqueique. In 1748 its waters rose to an immense height, a phenomenon which
                    Alcedo attributes to the stoppage of its subterranean passage; but this was far
                    more likely to arise from volcanic agency, so frequent in this country, raising
                    and depressing the land in various directions. Farming operations are carried on
                    in Paria, but little grain is produced; the rearing of cattle, which are
                    plentiful, chiefly occupying the attention of the inhabitants. The cheese made
                    here of sheep’s milk is esteemed a great delicacy, and is much sought after. The
                    capital of the province, which bears the same name, is situated 210 miles
                    west-north-west of Chuquisaca, in 18° 50' south latitude, and 68° 20 ’ west
                    longitude. The population amounts to 50,000, of which number 37,000 are Indians,
                    and 13,000 Creoles.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Paria,</hi><hi rend="italic">Gulf of,</hi> a gulf of South
                    America, situated to the north-west of the embouchure of the river Orinoco, and
                    having on the west the province of Cumana, and on the east the large island of
                    Trinidad. On Terra Firma, and north-west from the mouths of the Orinoco, a
                    peninsula or neck of land projects towards the east, in the exact direction of
                    another but much smaller neck of land which juts out from the north-western
                    extremity of the island of Trinidad. These projections approach within a few
                    leagues of each other, but the passage is interrupted by two or three islands,
                    which, from their relative position, form four openings called Boccas del Drago,
                    or the Mouths of the Dragon. Again, at the south-western extremity of Trinidad,
                    a neck of land advances in a westerly direction, towards a part of the delta of
                    the Orinoco, and approaches to within twelve or fourteen miles of it. This
                    passage is likewise interrupted by islands, and is called the Serpent’s Mouth.
                    Thus the mainland embosoms an immense bay, whilst the island of Trinidad, which
                    lies at its mouth, forms also a bay, facing the other, by its northern and
                    southern extremities projecting forwards. Both shores thus bend and mutually
                    approach each other, so as to form two comparatively narrow entrances, by which
                    the waters of the gulf communicate with those of the ocean. The Gulf of Paria,
                    at its widest part, that is, from the shores of Trinidad to those of Colombia,
                    is eighty-three miles across. In the other direction<pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193492036?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0717-2036-0073"/>, from the
                    Bocca on the south to the Boccas del Drago on the north, it measures forty-three
                    miles. In depth it varies from eight to thirty fathoms; but there is anchorage
                    throughout its whole extent, though on the coast of Paria its soundings are much
                    less. On the south side of the Serpent’s Mouth, which communicates with the
                    Atlantic Ocean, and receives in the rainy season the vast flood of waters which
                    pour as from an inland ocean through the mouths of the Orinoco, a considerable
                    current is found setting into the gulf, which is thus reported to have its
                    waters raised four or five inches above their usual level. The surface-water at
                    this time, which is during the months of July, August, and September, is also
                    said to be fresh. This is by no means an unlikely circumstance, arising from the
                    inferior specific gravity of fresh water as compared with that of the sea; and
                    the surface of the gulf will also continue a longer time partially fresh, from
                    its being embayed on all sides by land, so as to shut out the swell and
                    agitation of the ocean, which would cause a more rapid commixture of the fresh
                    and salt water. It was this current which Columbus encountered, and which gave
                    him so unfavourable an opinion of the Gulf of Paria, which he accordingly called
                    the Melancholy Gulf. It is of course most violent during the rainy months; but a
                    current generally sets into the gulf through the Serpent’s Mouth to the
                    northward during the dry season; it is, however, partial and unimportant. In the
                    months of December, January, and February the tide sets through the Dragon’s
                    Mouth from the northward, by which the current is occasionally overpowered. The
                    water of the Gulf of Paria is generally of a turbid and dull green cast, but in
                    the interior it presents everywhere a tranquil and glassy surface. The winds are
                    in general light, never increasing to more than a gentle breeze, excepting in
                    autumn, when a few transient squalls disturb its serenity. It may indeed be
                    regarded as a spacious harbour, affording secure anchorage in all its parts, and
                    perfectly free from gales, storms, and accidents; for if vessels happen to get
                    aground, the soft muddy bottom receives them without injury. The nights are
                    generally calm and quiet, the principal annoyance to the mariner being the want
                    of wind; so that coasting along the shores of the gulf is extremely troublesome
                    and tedious. Its waters abound with various kinds of fish; and numerous flocks
                    of terns and pelicans may at all seasons be seen here and there, busily employed
                    in catching their prey. The western shore of the gulf, which forms part of a
                    province of Colombia formerly called Paria, is remarkable for its fertility and
                    beauty. Columbus spoke with rapture of this luxuriant land, and in his
                    enthusiasm he concluded that it was the terrestrial paradise which had received
                    the progenitor of the human race pure from his Creator’s hands. (See the article

                    great many leagues into the sea opposite the island of Trinidad, is called Point
                    Paria, and is situated in latitude 9. 12. north, and longitude 62. 1. west from
