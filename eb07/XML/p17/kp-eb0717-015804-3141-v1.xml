                <p><label type="entry">PAULO, <hi rend="smallcaps">Marco</hi></label>, a celebrated
                    traveller, was son of Nicholas Paulo, a Venetian, who, with his brother Matthew,
                    about the year 1255, visited Constantinople, in the reign of Baldwin II.
                    Nicholas, at his departure, left his wife pregnant; and she brought to the world
                    the famous Marco Paulo, the subject of this notice. The two Venetians, having
                    taken leave of the emperor, crossed the Black Sea, and travelled into Armenia,
                    whence they passed over land to the court of Barka, one of the greatest lords of
                    Tartary, who loaded them with honours. This prince having been defeated by one
                    of his, neighbours, Nicholas and Matthew made the best of their way through the
                    deserts, and arrived at the city where resided Kublai, khan of the Tartars.
                    Kublai was entertained with the account which they gave him of the European
                    manners and customs; and appointed <pb break="no"

                    aιhbassadors to the pope, in order to demand of his holiness a hundred
                    missionaries. They accordingly returned to Italy, obtained from the pontiff two
                    Dominicans, the one an Italian and the other an Asiatic, and carried along with
                    them young Marco, for whom Kublai expressed a singular affection. This young
                    man, having learned the different dialects of Tartary, was employed in embassies
                    which gave him the opportunity of traversing Tartary, China, and other eastern
                    countries. At length, after a residence of seventeen years at the court of the
                    khan, the three Venetians returned to their own country, in the year 1295, with
                    immense fortunes. A short time after his return, Marco, serving his country at
                    sea against the Genoese, lost his galley, in a great naval engagement, and was
                    himself taken prisoner and carried to Genoa. He remained there many years in
                    confinement; and, to amuse his melancholy as well as to gratify his friends, he
                    sent for his notes from Venice, and composed the history of his own and his

                    was translated into different languages, and inserted in various collections.
                    The editions most esteemed are the Latin one published by Andrew Muller at
                    Cologne, 1671, in 4to, and that in French, to be found in the collection of
                    voyages published by Bergeron, at the Hague, 1735, in two vols. 4to. In the
                    writings of Marco Paulo there are some things true, and others highly
                    incredible. It is indeed difficult to believe, that as soon as the khan was
                    informed of the arrival of the two Venetian merchants, who were come to sell
                    theriaca, or treacle, at his court, he sent before them an escort of forty
                    thousand men, and afterwards despatched these Venetian ambassadors to the pope,
                    to beseech his holiness to send him a hundred missionaries. It is equally
                    difficult to believe that the pope, who doubtless had an ardent zeal for the
                    propagation of the faith, should, instead of a hundred, have sent him only two
                    missionaries. There are, therefore, some errors and exaggerations in Marco
                    Paulo’s narrative; but many other things which were afterwards verified, and
                    which have been of no little service to succeeding travellers, prove that in
                    several respects his relation is valuable. He not only gave better accounts of
                    China than had before been received, but likewise furnished a description of
                    Japan, of many of the islands of the East Indies, of Madagascar, and of the
                    coasts of Africa; so that from his work it might be easily collectéd, that a
                    direct passage by sea to the Indies was not only possible, but practicable. It
                    may be worth while to add, that, in the opinion of the authors of the Universal
                    History, what he wrote down from his own knowledge is both curious and true; so
                    that where he has erred, his father and uncle must have deceived him.</p>
