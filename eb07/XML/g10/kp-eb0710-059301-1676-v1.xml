                <p><label type="entry">GOA</label>, a celebrated city of Hindustan, in the province
                    of Bejapoor, and the capital of all the Portuguese settlements in the East
                    Indies. It is the residence of the viceroy, and of the chief Portuguese
                    inhabitants; the seat of the supreme court of judicature, and the see of an
                    archbishop, who is primate of the East. It is situated on the north side of an
                    island, is about twelve miles long and six broad, and stands at the mouth of the
                    Mandova river. Goa consists of two distinct cities. The old one is eight miles
                    up the river, and is now almost deserted by the secular Portuguese, on account
                    of its being unhealthy. It contains many magnificent churches, and exhibits
                    specimens of architecture superior to any thing attempted by Europeans in other
                    parts of India, particularly the church and convent of St Augustin. The city is
                    large, the streets are straight, the houses regularly and handsomely built of
                    stone in the European style, many of them large and magnificent, though they are
                    now no longer inhabited. The viceroy and principal inhabitants reside in the new
                    city, which is at the mouth of the river, and within the forts. It possesses two
                    harbours, one on each side of the island, both of which are well defended by
                    various castles and batteries mounting heavy cannon. The towns are also
                    fortified, but they are of too great an extent to withstand a siege. Algoada
                    Point, which is in longitude 67.73. 53. east, latitude 15. 29. north, forms the
                    northern extremity of Goa Bay. It has a lighthouse and small fort on it; but the
                    principal fort is situated close to the sea, on the south-east side of the
                    headland, where there is a well of excellent water, from which the shipping are
                    supplied. Nostra Senhora de la Cabo, a large monastery, of a white appearance,
                    is situated on the summit of the bluff point of land, about two miles and a half
                    south-east of Algoada, which forms the south side of the bay. The common
                    anchorage is abreast of Algoada fort, the flag-staff bearing about north at half
                    a mile distance from the shore. The bar at the entrance of the river is about
                    two miles to the eastward of Algoada Point, having sixteen or eighteen feet on
                    it at high-water of spring-tides. The bottom is hard and rocky; and the channel
                    so winding and intricate, that a ship ought not to enter the river without a
                    pilot. After the early part of May, when it is considered unsafe to remain at
                    the anchorage in the roads, the Portuguese send their large ships, which cannot
                    run into the river, to Marma-gon roads, four or five miles to the southward of
                    Algoada fort, where they are sheltered from the south-west monsoon by mooring
                    close under the north-east side of that peninsula. The colonial settlement at
                    Goa seems now to be almost abandoned by the mother country, and the inhabitants
                    scarcely retain the national language ar manners. The trade has also greatly
                    fallen off, and the people are impoverished, so that the best families are
                    reduced to gain a scanty subsistence by working at lace or muslin. Not more than
                    three ships arrive from Portugal in the course of the year, and these generally
                    proceed to the British settlements to complete their cargoes for Europe.</p>

                <p>The trade from Goa to China is carried on by one or two ' ships in the year,
                    which are called China ships. These carry to Surat, and the ports to the
                    northward, Chinese and European goods, and returning with cotton and other
                    articles, call at Goa to complete their cargoes for China. They commence their
                    trade at the most southern settlement, which is Ajengo, and thence they proceed
                    to Cochin, Calicut, Tellicherry, and Mangalore, and then to Goa; at these
                    different places they take in pepper, cardamoms, cassia, lignea, and other
                    articles, which they resell at their northern settlements, and complete the
                    voyage within the year. A coasting trade is harried on in small vessels with the
                    different ports on the coast, whence they return to Goa with produce, which
                    forms the home cargoes of their ships. With Macao and the British settlements an
                    inconsiderable trade is carried on: the imports consisting principally of piece
                    goods, raw silk, grain, sugar, woollens, and a few European articles, whilst the
                    exports are piece goods, betel nut, hemp, and other articles of trifling
                    amount.</p>
                <p>Goa was taken from its Hindu rajahs of Bijanagur, by the Bhamenee sovereigns of
                    the Deccan. On the arrival of the Portuguese on the Malabar coast it was an
                    opulent place, well fortified, and subject to Zabaim, a potent prince, from whom
                    it was taken by the Portuguese general Albuquerque. It was retaken by the native
                    prince, after which Albuquerque, having received reinforcements, again succeeded
                    in 1510 in making himself master of the city after a bloody assault. He improved
                    its defences, and constituted it the capital of all his conquests; and it has
                    ever since remained in possession of the Portuguese, who during the sixteenth
                    century extended their conquests, and obtained possession of numerous places on
                    the sea-coasts of India. In the course of diese operations they were involved in
                    hostilities with the Mahrattas; and advancing inland, laid siege to the town of
                    Pondah. Here they were surrounded by a large Mahratta force, and effected their
                    retreat with great difficulty and serious loss. Having formed an alliance with
                    Aurungzebe, they succeeded in repulsing the Mahrattas, with whom they at length
                    concluded a peace. In 1518 the Portuguese power in India was at its height, and
                    from this period it began to decline. In 1580 the Portuguese possessed the
                    following places in India, namely, Diu Damaun, Choul, Baheen, Salsette, Bombay,
                    and Goa. They had factories at Dabu], Onore, Barcelore, Mangalore, Cananore,
                    Calicut, Cranganore, Cochin, and Quilon. They had establishments on the coast of
                    Ceylon, and factories in the Bay of Bengal, at Masulipatam, Negapatam, and St
                    Thome, with commercial stations in Bengal. They possessed, besides, the city of
                    Malacca, and factories on the coasts of the Burman empire and the province of
                    Chittagong. They acquired possession of the Spice Islands in the Eastern
                    Archipelago, and carried on a considerable intercourse with Japan and China.
                    They did not acquire Macao until 1586. After the conquest of Portugal in 1580,
                    by Philip II. of Spain, the intercourse of the colonies with the mother country
                    was much abridged; and this eastern empire, composed of the loose materials of
                    recent conquest, began to decay, from the vices of its internal administration,
                    and from the power of the priests. It has now altogether declined, and forms a
                    very inconsiderable appendage to the mother country. The travelling distance
                    from Poonah is 245 miles, from Bombay 292, from Delhi 1158, and from Calcutta
                    1300 miles. Long. 73. 42. E. Lat. 15. 30. N. (Milburn, <hi rend="italic"
