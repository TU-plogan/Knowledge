                <p><label type="entry">GOWER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John</hi></label>, one of the
                    most ancient of the English poets, was contemporary with Chaucer, the father of
                    English poetry, and his intimate friend. Of what family, or in what part of the
                    kingdom, he was born, is uncertain. He studied the law, and was some time a
                    member of the society of Lincoln’s Inn, where his acquaintance with Chaucer
                    commenced. Some have asserted that he was chief justice of the common pleas; but
                    this is by no means certain. In the first year of Henry IV. he became blind; a
                    misfortune which he laments in one of his Latin poems. He died about the year
                    1400, and was buried in St Mary Overy, which church he had rebuilt chiefly at
                    his own expense. His tomb, which was magnificently and curiously ornamented,
                    still remains, but it has been repaired in later times. From the collar round
                    the neck of his effigy on the tomb, it is conjectured that he had been knighted.
                    As to his character as a man, it is impossible, at this distance of time, to
                    state any thing with certainty. With regard to his poetical talents, he was
                    admired at the time when he wrote, though a modern reader may find it difficult
                    to discover much harmony or genius in any of his compositions. He wrote, 1. <hi

                    >Amantis,</hi> printed at Westminster by Caxton in 1493, also London, 1532,
                    1554, a sort of poetical system of morality, interspersed with a varięty of
                    moral tales: and, 4. <hi rend="italic">De</hi><hi rend="italic">Rege</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Henrico IV.,</hi> printed in Chaucer’s works. There are likewise
                    several historical tracts, in manuscript, written by Gower, which are to be
                    found in different libraries, besides short poems printed in Chaucer’s works. At
                    a very early period Gower had become obsolete. Skelton, in the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Boke of Philip Sparrow,</hi> says, “Gower’s Englishe is old and, about the
                    beginning of the sixteenth century, his language was out of use. A second
                    edition of the <hi rend="italic">Confessio</hi><hi rend="italic">Amantis</hi>
                    was printed by Barthelet in 1532, a third in 1544, a fourth in 1554, and, at the
                    distance of two centuries and a half, a fifth was published in a modern editiou
                    of the English poets. Gower was esteemed a man of great learning, and he appears
                    to have lived and died in affluence.</p>
