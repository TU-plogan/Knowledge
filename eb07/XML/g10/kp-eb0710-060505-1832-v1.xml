                <p><label type="entry">GOLDONI, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles</hi></label>, the most
                    celebrated comic writer of Italy in the eighteenth century, and in his own
                    country styled the Italian Molière, was born at Venice in the year 1707, in
                    which city his father acted in the capacity of <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193521845?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1845-0606"/> physician. His
                    attachment to the drama became conspicuous even in childhood, and this his
                    father countenanced and cherished, by erecting a theatre in his own house, where
                    young Goldoni and some of his companions were the actors. It is said that he
                    even drew the outline of a comedy of his own invention when he was not more than
                    eight years of age; a most extraordinary, though not very credible, indication
                    of future eminence. He was taught rhetoric at Perugia, in the college of the
                    Jesuits, and prosecuted his philosophical studies at Rimini. The stage, however,
                    had too many attractions for him, to admit of his paying much attention to
                    Aristotle or Quintilian, and he eloped from Rimini with a company of comedians,
                    when they removed to Chiozza. His father attempted in vain to induce him to
                    study either physic or the law; yet his ardent imagination was so forcibly
                    struck with a particular ceremony of the church, that he conceived the intention
                    of turning capuchin: but the dissipation of Venice soon extinguished this fancy.
                    After the demise of his father he was prevailed upon by his surviving parent to
                    engage in the profession of the law for immediate support; but some unknown
                    causes induced him to leave the bar, after which he proceeded to Milan, and was
                    there appointed secretary to the Venetian resident</p>
                <p>At Milan he brought out his first performance, under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">II</hi><hi rend="italic">Gondoliere</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Veneziano,</hi> which had all the success that could be expected from such a
                    composition. He afterwards removed to Verona, where he joined himself to a
                    company of players, and also entered into the state of wedlock. He composed a
                    number of pieces for the company to which he attached himself, and amongst these
                    his tragedy of Belisarius, which was performed for the first time at Venice on
                    the 24th of November 1734, with the greatest success. Whilst as Venice he formed
                    the laudable resolution of reforming the Italian stage, which at that time was
                    disgraced by contemptible farce and low buffoonery. With this view, having made
                    himself acquainted with the true nature of comedy, ne kept within the limits of
                    nature and decorum; and such was the fertility of his genius, such his
                    indefatigable industry, that he produced no fewer than sixteen comedies and
                    forty-two other theatrical pieces in the course of about twelve months. Nor is
                    it a less remarkable circumstance that some of these hasty performances are
                    considered as his masterpieces. His works, in ten volumes 8vo, were first
                    printed in 1753, and in 1761 his new pieces amounted to fifty-nine. And here
                    ends the literary life of Goldoni in Italy; for about this time he accepted an
                    engagement of two years in Paris, where he found a numerous company of excellent
                    performers in the Italian theatre. His first attempt was unsuccessful, because
                    he had to contend with the pantomimic drollery which was most agreeable to the
                    depraved taste of the times. When about to leave Paris on the expiration of his
                    engagement, he was introduced to the court, and appointed teacher of the Italian
                    languages to the princesses. He had lodgings assigned him in Versailles, but his
                    allowance was not sufficient to enable him to dispense with writing for the
                    stage. Meanwhile, being anxious to show the French nation that he merited a high
                    place among their dramatic writers, he neglected no means calculated to render
                    him master of the French language; and, at the age of sixty-two, he ventured to
                    write a comedy in French, which was brought out under the title of <hi
                    rend="italic">Le Bourru Bienfaisant,</hi> and received great applause in the
                    court theatre. His next production was <hi rend="italic">Ľ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Avare Fastueux,</hi> also a comedy·, and this was succeeded by <hi
                    rend="italic">Volponi,</hi> which he wrote after he had retired from court. The
                    last work which he undertook was the <hi rend="italic">Mémoires pour servir</hi>
                    à <hi rend="italic">ľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Histoire de sa Vie et à celle de son
                    Théâtre,</hi> which, after having been about three years occupied with the
                    composition, appeared in 1787., when he entered into the eightieth year of his
                    age. These Memoirs, written with unaffected simplicity and ∣ sincerity, display
                    the real character both of the author and the man, and supply the most ample
                    Information respecting the history of his life. Deprived of his pension soon
                    after the commencement of the revolution, Goldoni was reduced to absolute
                    indigence, and passed the evening of his life in extreme distress. At length he
                    fell sick; and it was only in his last moments, on the 7th of January 1793, that
                    the Convention, apprised of his situation, decreed, on the report of Chenier,
                    that his pension should in fiιture be paid out of the national treasury, and
                    that the arrears due to him should be immediately discharged. But it was too
                    late. Goldoni died on the day after this decree was passed. But, on the
                    recommendation of Chenier, a pension of 1200 francs was granted to his widow,
                    aged seventy-six, and the arrears due to her husband were also paid to her. If
                    the rapidity with which Goldoni composed prevented him from attaining the first
                    rank as a comic writer, it will easily be conceded that he stands foremost in
                    the second. His fertility is prodigious, and if his works betray marks of haste
                    or of carelessness, they at least show ready invention, and, considering the
                    diversity of his subjects, extraordinary resources as a comic writer. The
                    greatest fault witlι which he is reproached is having contributed to corrupt the
                    language of his country, which he seems to have been unable to write with
                    purity, elegance, and propriety; and, in fact, we find ease, originality, and,
                    if we may so express it, purity of style only in his comedies written in the
                    Venetian dialect, which was his vernacular idiom. His merits are, having
                    contributed to reform the Italian stage, supplanted farce and low buffoonery,
                    naturalised genuine comedy in his native country, and replaced the extravagances
                    which had so long corrupted the public taste, by pieces in which a regular plot
                    and natural characters supply the place of nonsensical ribaldry and ridiculous
                    exaggeration. His comic opera entitled <hi rend="italic">Buona Figliuola,</hi>
                    with music by Piccini, was the first production which introduced both the poet
                    and the composer to the knowledge of our countrymen. The only complete edition
                    of Goldoni’s works is that printed at Leghorn, 1788, 1791, in thirty-one vols.
