                <p><label type="entry">GIRONDE</label>, a department in the south-west of France,
                    created out of the ancient principality of Guienne. It is bounded on the north
                    and north-east by the department of the Lower Charente, on the east by those of
                    Dordogne and of Lot-Garonne, on the south by the Landes, and on the west by the
                    ocean. It comprehends 3428 square miles, or, according to the <hi rend="italic"
                    >Statistique</hi><hi rend="italic">de la France,</hi> 975,100 hectares. The
                    civil divisions are six arrondissements, forty-eight cantons, and543communes,
                    which in 1836 contained a population of 555,809 persons. The whole department is
                    a fine level plain, excepting that on the eastern side there are some gentle
                    elevations. That division consists of a soil composed of broken tuffstein,
                    fertile sand, and calcareous matter, and is well cultivated and highly
                    productive; on the western side, and especially towards the south of the
                    department, the land is either a morass or barren sands, where, for leagues
                    together, no human habitation is visible, and nothing to be seen but a few
                    wandering sheep, some corktrees, and numerous fir-trees. The latter seem to
                    flourish, and to yield large quantities of turpentine, pitch, and tar.</p>
                <p>None of the departments of France is better watered than the Gironde; most of the
                    streams, which are numerous, discharge their water into that river which gives
                    its name to this division of the country. Several of these rivers are navigable,
                    and by their means fuel is conveyed from the woods, which cover one tenth of the
                    surface, to the several cities whose consumption requires it. The chief object
                    of cultivation is the vine; the wine is chiefly red, known by the names of
                    Medoc, Haut-Brion, St Emil-lian, Latour, Lafitte, and Chateaux-Margaux, but by
                    the generic names of Bordeaux or claret. The most valued white win.es are known
                    as Carbonnieux, Serons, Graves, Barsac, Prignac, Sauterne, Baume, and
                    Sainte-Croix-duMont, The management of the grapes, as well as of the wine, is
                    well understood; and the produce of the vineyards, besides wine, is very
                    considerable in brandy, liqueurs, spirits of wine, and vinegar.</p>
                <p>The corn of the department is insufficient for the consumption; and large
                    quantities, chiefly of rye, are brought from other districts for the maintenance
                    of the poor. There are few horses bred or kept, and the plough is for the most
                    part worked by oxen, which, as well as the cows, are of an indifferent race. The
                    sheep are not numerous, and commonly afford meat and wool of an inferior
                    quality. Besides grapes, the other fruits are abundant, especially chestnuts,

                    hemp, and flax. There are no mines except those of iron, which yield but little.
