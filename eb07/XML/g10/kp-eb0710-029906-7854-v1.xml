                    designated as a kingdom. The whole of it formerly constituted a part of the
                    kingdom or republic of Poland, and, by the successive dismemberments of that
                    unfortunate country, has been transferred to the house &lt;jf Austria. It is a
                    long tract of land, one part being the most northern territory of the empire,
                    whilst another part enters into the middle region of it. It extends between
                    47.10. and 50.44. of north latitude, and between 18 47. and 26. 25. east
                    longitude, over 32,508 square miles. It is bounded on the north by the republic
                    of Cracow and the kingdom of Poland, on the east by Russia, on the south-east by
                    Turkish Moldavia, on the south and south-w'est by Hungary, and on the west by
                    the circle of Teschen, in Moravia.</p>
                <p>According to the census of 1817, Gallicia contained ninety-eight cities, 191
                    market-towns, 6175 villages, and 617,210 dwelling-houses. The inhabitants then
                    amounted to 3,761,922, of whom 182,650 were Jews. Since that period the
                    population has rapidly increased, and in 1834 it was calculated at 4,548,334.
                    The prevailing religion is the Catholic, but divided into the Latin and the
                    Greek ritual. There are a bishop and thirty-six churches of the Greek church,
                    nineteen congregations of Lutherans, and thirteen of Calvinists, while the Jews
                    have 294 synagogues, which are governed by a rabbi and six elders. All are alike
                    established and paid by the government.</p>
                <p>The land stretches out gradually from the north side of the Carpathian Mountains,
                    and terminates in that vast plain which extends to the Baltic Sea, with scarcely
                    an intervening hill. The Carpathians form part of Gallicia, extending in some of
                    their projections to the banks of the Vistula. The more eastern circles are very
                    mountainous, and those of Bukovina and Czernowitz peculiarly so. The declination
                    of the land is generally towards the north, and the streams, which all fall into
                    the Vistula, are emptied into the Baltic Sea, excepting a small portion of the
                    eastern part, the waters of which run to the BÎack Sea, after joining the
                    Danube. The Vistula is not a river of Gallicia, but merely forms part of the
                    boundary between it and the kingdom of Poland. It receives the waters of the
                    following rivers: 1st, those of the Dunajew, which rises in the Carpathians,
                    receives the waters of the Poprad, also a navigable river, and some smaller
                    streams, and after a course of 115 miles through the circles of Sandec,
                    Boclιnia, and Tarnow, falls into the Vistula near Nowopole; 2rf, those of the
                    Wisloka, which rises in the Carpathians, and after a course of eighty miles
                    through the circles of Jaslow and Tarnow, enters the Vistula; <hi rend="italic"
                    >3d,</hi> those of the San, which receives the tributary streams of the Wislok
                    and Tanew, and, after a tortuous course of nearly 200 miles, is lost in the
                    Vistula near Lapiszow; <hi rend="italic">4tΛ,</hi> those of the Bug, which rises
                    near Soligory, in the circle of Zloczow, and above Sokal enters the kingdom of
                    Poland. The rivers which run to the Black Sea are but small till they quit
                    Gallicia, though their sources are within the province. They are, the Dniester,
                    the Stry, the Podhorze, the Pruth, the Sereth, and the Moldawa. There are no
                    canals, and no lakes of any extent.</p>
                <p>From the nature and extent of the country', the soil is very various. . In the
                    west and in the north there are many sandy tracts, in the vicinity of the rivers
                    many morasses, and, taken as a whole, only indifferent land; but in the east and
                    south-east divisions the soil is for the most part excellent and easily worked,
                    and with moderate agriculture is found highly productive.</p>
                <p>That part of the land which is most naturally fertile is so badly cultivated as
                    to yield but little increase. Wheat and rye are said not to produce more than
                    five times the measure of the seed that is sown, and barley and oats not more
                    than six times. The poverty and the ignorance of the peasantry are impediments
                    to their gaining much more produce than they consume; and for what little
                    surplus corn they gain, it is generally sold to the usurious Jews before it is
                    thrashed out. The working cattle and utensils are of the most miserable kind;
                    and very little manure is applied to renovate the exhausted soil. About one
                    third of the land is covered with forests, and some fine timber is annually
                    supplied to commerce. The chief production is corn, some small portion of which
                    is sent by the Vistula to Dantzick, but the larger part is sold to the
                    inhabitants of the eastern parts of Hungary. Oxen, horses, and cows, are few,
                    and of bad races, though the Austrian government have taken much pains to
                    introduce better breeds.</p>
                <p>The chief mineral production is rock-salt, from the great mine near Cracow, which
                    supplies a considerable part of Gallicia, Bohemia, and Austrian Silesia. The
                    mine in question, Wieliczka, yields annually near 25,000 tons of culinary salt.
                    There are also some mines of iron, and others of zinc, but they are not very
                    productive.</p>
                <p>There is scarcely any commerce except for the native productions, but the
                    contraband trade is very extensive, being conducted by the Jews from Lemberg and
                    Brody, over the boundaries of the Russian empire, and with Cracow for colonial
                    wines. The manufactures are almost exclusively of a domestic kind.</p>
