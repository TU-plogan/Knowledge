                <p><label type="entry">GLOVE</label>, a covering for the hand and wrist. To throw
                    the glove was a practice or ceremony very usual amongst our forefathers, being
                    the challenge by which one man defied another to single combat. It is still
                    retained at the coronation of our kings, when the king’s champion casts his
                    glove in Westminster hall, and thus challenges all men to dispute the royal
                    title.</p>
                <p>Favyn supposes the custom to have arisen amongst the eastern nations, who in all
                    their sales and deliveries of lands, goods, and the like, used to give the
                    purchaser their glove by way of delivery or investiture. To this effect he
                    quotes Ruth (iv. 7), in which the Chaldee paraphrase has <hi rend="italic"
                    >glove</hi> where the common version renders the Hebrew word by <hi
                    rend="italic">shoe.</hi> He adds, that the Rabbin interpret by <hi rend="italic"
                    >glove</hi> that passage in the 108th Psalm, <hi rend="italic">In
                    Idιuneam</hi><hi rend="italic">extendam calceamentum meum,</hi> Over Edom will I
                    cast out my shoe. Accordingly, amongst us, he who took up the glove, thereby
                    declared his acceptance of the challenge, and as a part of the ceremony, took
                    the glove off his own right hand, and cast it upon the ground, that it might be
                    taken up by the challenger. This had the force of a mutual engagement to meet at
                    the time and place which might be appointed by the king, the parliament, or the
                    judges.</p>
                <p>Gloves are now a common article of dress. They are most commonly made of leather;
                    but there are others made of silk, thread, cotton, or worsted. Leather gloves
                    are made of the skins of the chamois, kid, lamb, beaver, doe, elk, and other
                    animals. The leather of gloves is not, properly speaking, tanned, but cured with
                    alum, by which it is rendered soft and pliable. Some sorts of leather gloves
                    admit of being washed, others do not. Woodstock and Worcester, but particularly
