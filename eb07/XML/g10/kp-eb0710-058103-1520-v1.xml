                <p><label type="entry">GLAUBER, <hi rend="smallcaps">John Rodolph</hi></label>, a
                    German chemist, born at the commencement of the sixteenth century, was one of
                    those who were most ardently occupied with “the great work,” namely, the
                    discovery of the philosopher’s stone. Full of love and enthusiasm for the
                    marvellous, he abandoned himself without reserve to the extravagant ideas which
                    then prevailed in chemistry. His long and painful labours, pursued with
                    indefatigable perseverance, and an energy worthy of a nobler object, were almost
                    always directed towards the discovery of the panacea, the philosopher’s stone,
                    and other chimeras with which the alchymists amused the imagination. Infatuated
                    with the doctrine of the adepts, he may be said to have passed his life over
                    alembics and furnaces, and, in fact, he is regarded as a second Paracelsus. Not
                    less presumptuous than his model, he boasted of the discovery of several
                    wonderful secrets. Whether he was truly convinced of the reality <pb break="no"
                    facs="nls:193521533?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0710-1533-0582"/> of his
                    inventions, or whether, like empirics of all classes, he proposed to profit by
                    the ignorance and blind credulity of men, he had the art to seduce many persons
                    by promises as vain as they were exaggerated. He is even reproached with having
                    carried on a vile traffic in pretended secrets, which he sometimes sold at an
                    exorbitant price to different individuals, and afterwards published with his
                    name in order to enhance his reputation. Devoid of the instruction and force of
                    mind necessary to enable him to deduce just inferences from the numerous
                    experiments which he had performed with ability and address, Glauber only
                    attained a subaltern or secondary rank amongst the chemists. But he,
                    nevertheless, discovered several important facts, which have materially
                    contributed to make better known certain salts and some metals, which,
                    eventually, had a marked influence on the progress of chemistry and materia
                    medica. Thus, in examining the residue of the decomposition of sea-salt by the
                    sulphuric acid, this laborious chemist discovered the sulphate of soda, to which
                    his name is irrevocably attached under the denomination of Glauber’s Salt. His
                    writings on dry baths and sulphurous fumigations entitle him, in certain
                    respects, to be regarded as the inventor of confined vapour baths, which have
                    been latterly brought forward as a new discovery; and he is equally the inventor
                    of several chemical medicaments, the use of which is still preserved in most of
                    the pharmacopoeias. We are also indebted to him for a great number of works
                    (thirty in all), an exact list of which may be found in the curious article
                    entitled Glauber, in the fourth volume of Adelung’s <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Human Folly.</hi> A collection of them was printed in several volumes 8vo, and
                    in two volumes 4to, at Frankfort, 1658, 1659, and translated into English by
                    Pack, London, 1689, in folio. Of these the principal are, 1. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Deutschlands Wallfahrt,</hi> or Prosperity of Germany, Amsterdam, 1656, often
                    reprinted; 2. <hi rend="italic">Fumi Nσυi</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Philosophici,</hi> or Description of a new Method of Distilling, Amsterdam,
                    1648, in 8vo, translated into French by Duteιl, Paris, 1659, in 8vo; 3. De
                    Medicina Universali, sive de Auro potabili vero, Amsterdam, 1658, in 8vo;</p>
                <p>4. Miraculum Mundi, Amsterdam, 1653, in 8vo; 5. Pharmacopoeia Spagyrica,
                    Amsterdam, 1654, in 8vo; 6. De Tartaro ex Vini foecibus, 1655, in 8vo; 7.
                    Dissertatio Medica Hermetica et Catholica magni Naturae magiste-rialis Mysterii,
                    Frankfort, 1656, in 8vo; 8. Consolation of Navigators, Amsterdam, 1659, in 8vo;
                    9. Opus Minerale, Amsterdam, 1651, in 8vo; 10. De Elia Artiste, Amsterdam, 1668,
                    in 8vo. Glauber published many other alchy-mical productions, which are neither
                    less obscure nor less enigmatical than the preceding, and in which vague
                    hypotheses and chimerical conceptions supply the place of facts and of
                    reasoning. All his works are in German; and although most of them have the first
                    words of the title in Latin, there is good ground for believing that Glauber did
                    not understand that language. <hi rend="smallcaps">(a.)</hi></p>
