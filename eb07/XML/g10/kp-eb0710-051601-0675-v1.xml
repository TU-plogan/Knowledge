                <p><label type="entry">GIBSON, <hi rend="smallcaps">Richard</hi></label>, an English
                    painter, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">Dwarf,</hi> was originally page
                    to a lady at Mortlake, who, observing that his genius led him to painting, had
                    the generosity to get him instructed in the rudiments of that art. Having
                    devoted himself to Sir Peter Lely’s manner, he copied his pictures*to
                    admiration, especially his portraits; and his paintings in water colours were
                    also esteemed. He was in great favour with Charles I. who made him page of the
                    back stairs; and he had the honour to instruct in drawing Queen Mary and Queen
                    Anne when they were princesses. He married one Mrs Anne Shepherd, who was also a
                    dwarf, on which occasion King Charles I. honoured their marriage with his
                    presence, and gave away the bride. Mr Waller wrote a poem on this occasion,
                    entitled The Marriage of the Dwarfs; in which are these lines:</p>
                <p>Design or chance makes others wive. But nature did this match contrive; Eve might
                    as well have Adam fled. As she deny’d her little bed To him for whom heav’n
                    seem’d to frame And measure out this only dame.</p>
                <p>Mr Fenton, in his notes on this poem, observes that he had seen this couple
                    painted by Sir Peter Lely; and that they were of an equal stature, each being
                    three feet ten inches high. They had nine children, five of whom arrived at
                    maturity, and were well proportioned, being of the usual standard of mankind.
                    But what nature denied this couple in stature, she gave them in length of days;
                    for Mr Gibson died in the seventy-fifth year of his age, and his wife having
                    survived him almost twenty years, died in 1709, aged eighty-nine.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Gibson,</hi><hi rend="italic">Dr Edmund,</hi> bishop of
                    London, was born in Westmoreland in 1699. He applied himself early and
                    vigorously to learning, and displayed his knowledge in several writings and
                    translations, which recommended him to the patronage of Archbishop Tennyson. He
                    was appointed domestic chaplain to his grace; and soon afterwards became rector
                    of Lambeth, and archdeacon of Surrey. Becoming thus a member of the convocation,
                    he engaged in a cęntroversy, which was carried on with great warmth by the
                    members of both houses, and defended his patron’s rights, as president, in
                    eleven pamphlets; he then formed and completed his more comprehensive scheme of
                    the legal duties and rights of the English clergy, which was at length published
                    under the title of <hi rend="italic">Codex Juris</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Ecclesiastici</hi><hi rend="italic">Angliaιni,</hi> in folio. Archbishop
                    Tennyson having died in 1715, and Dr Wake bishop of Lincoln having become
                    archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Gibson succeeded the latter in the see of Lincoln,
                    and in 1720 was promoted to the bishopric of London. He now not only governed
                    his diocese with the most exact regularity, but by his great care promoted the
                    spiritual affairs of the church of England colonies in the West Indies. He was
                    extremely jealous of the privileges belonging to the church; and therefore,
                    though he approved of the toleration of the Protestant Dissenters, he
                    continually guarded against all the attempts made to procure a repeal of the
                    corporation and test acts; but his opposition to those licentious assemblies
                    called <hi rend="italic">masquerades</hi> gave great umbrage at court, and
                    effectually excluded him from all further favours. He spent the latter part of
                    his life in writing and printing pastoral letters, visitation-charges,
                    occasional sermons, and tracts against the prevailing immoralities of the age.
                    His pastoral letters are justly esteemed as the most masterly productions
                    against infidelity and enthusiasm. His most celebrated work, the <hi
                    rend="italic">Codex,</hi> has been already mentioned. His other publications
                    are, 1. An edition of Drummond’s <hi rend="italic">Polemo-Miđdinia,</hi> and
                    James V. of Scotland’s <hi rend="italic">Cantilena</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Rustica,</hi> with notes; 2. the <hi rend="italic">Chroniam</hi><hi
                    rend="italic">Saxonicum,</hi> with a Latin translation, and notes; 3. <hi
                    rend="italic">Reliquia:</hi><hi rend="italic">Spelmanniance,</hi> the posthumous
                    works of Sir Henry Spelman, relating to the laws and antiquities of England; 4.
                    An edition of Quintilian <hi rend="italic">De Arte</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >Oratoria,</hi> with notes; 5. An English translation of Camden’s <hi
                    rend="italic">Britannia,</hi> with additions, two volumes folio; and, 6. A
                    number of small pieces, which have been collected together and printed in three
                    volumes folio. His intense application to study impaired his health;
                    notwithstanding which, he attained the age of seventy-nine. He expired in
                    September 1748, after an episcopate of nearly thirty-three years.</p>
