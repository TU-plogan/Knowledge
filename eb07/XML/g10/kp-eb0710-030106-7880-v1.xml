                <p><label type="entry">GALVANI</label>, Louis, a celebrated natural philosopher, was
                    bom in 1737, at Bologna in Italy, where many of his relations had arrived at
                    distinguished eminence in jurisprudence and divinity. From boyhood he became
                    enamoured of the austerities of the Catholic religion, and attached himself to a
                    convent, the monks of which were celebrated for their attention to the solemn
                    duty of visiting the dying. He wished much to become a member of this order, but
                    was prevailed on by one of the brotherhood to relinquish the idea, and then
                    turned his attention to the study of medicine in its various branches. He
                    studied under Beccaria, Tacconi, Galli, and especially Galleazzi, whose daughter
                    he afterwards married. In 1762 he acquired great reputation by his inaugural
                    thesis <hi rend="italic">Be</hi><hi rend="italic">Ossibus,</hi> and was soon
                    afterwards chosen as public lecturer in the university of Bologna, and reader in
                    anatomy to the institute of that city. His talent for lecturing was so much
                    admired that vast numbers constantly attended him; and he employed his few
                    leisure hours in making experiments and in the useful study of comparative
                    anatomy. We find in the Memoirs of the Institute of Bologna a number of curious
                    observations by Galvani on the urinary organs, and also on the organs of hearing
                    in birds.</p>
                <p>Soon after his reputation for anatomical and physiological knowledge had been
                    fully established in the Italian schools, a mere accident led him to that
                    interesting discovery which will transmit his name to the latest posterity. His
                    wife, for whom he cherished the most ardent affection, and w ith whom he had
                    been united for a number of years, being in a declining state of health, was
                    using a soup made of frogs by way of restorative. Some of these animals, skinned
                    for the purjx&gt;se, happened to be lying on a table in Galvani’s laboratory,
                    where also stood an electrical machine, when one of the persons who assisted him
                    in conducting his experiments unintentionally brought the point of a βcapel near
                    the crural nerves of a frog which lay near the conductor, and immediately the
                    muscles of the limb were violently convulsed. Signora Galvani, a woman of a
                    penetrating understanding, and a lover of science, having witnessed the
                    phenomenon, instantly informed her husband. On his arrival Galvani repeated the
                    experiment, and discovered that the convulsions only happened when the sca-pel
                    was in contact with the nerve, and when a spark was at the same time drawn from
                    the conductor. After an almost endless variety of experiments, conducted with
                    great ingenuity, but which it would be foreign to the design of this article to
                    enumerate here, he concluded that all animals have within them an electricity of
                    a peculiar nature; that this fluid is contained in other parts, but is most
                    apparent in the nerves and muscles; and that it is secreted by the brain, and
                    diffused by the nerves through various parts of the body. To this new principle,
                    which is now commonly called <hi rend="italic">Galvanism,</hi> he gave the name
                    of <hi rend="italic">Animal Electricity.</hi></p>
                <p>He compared each muscular fibre to a small Leyden phial, and attempted to explain
                    the phenomena of muscular motion by analogies taken from that instrument. He
                    also thought of its pathological influence in rheumatic, convulsive, paralytic,
                    and other nervous affections. His first publication on this grand discovery was
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Aloysii Galvani de</hi><hi rend="italic"
                    >viribus</hi><hi rend="italic">Ľlectricitatis in</hi><hi rend="italic">Motu
                    Musculari Commentarius,</hi> which made its appearance in 4to in the year 1791,
                    and was printed for the Institute of Bologna. This work instantly attracted the
                    attention of philosophers both <pb break="no" facs="nls:193517893?mode=fullsize"
                    xml:id="kp-eb0710-7893-0302"/> in Italy and other countries; and it was soon
                    followed bj ' numerous publications, in some of which the sentiments of Galvani
                    were defended, and in others opposed. The celebrated Volta turned his attention
                    to the subject, and produced a number of arguments to prove that Galvani’s
                    opinion respecting animal electricity was erroneous, deriving the phenomena from
                    the electric matter of the atmosphere, and allowing the nerves and muscles no
                    higher function than that of being the most sensible tests hitherto discovered.
                    The doctrine of Volta met with many admirers and advocates; yet there are still
                    to be met with in the learned world many persons who support the opinions of
                    Galvani, and adhere to his original theory, in the defence of which he displayed
                    equal candour and ingenuity, and by which he may be justly considered as
                    deserving that distinguished place amongst experimental philosophers, which the
                    union of his name with the most interesting natural phenomena will probably for
                    ever secure to him.</p>
                <p>These important inquiries, joined to the duties of his office as professor, and
                    his extensive practice as surgeon and accoucheur, in both of which capacities he
                    eminently excel* led, afforded abundant scope for his indefatigable industry. He
                    composed a variety of memoirs upon topics connected with his profession; but
                    these have not, as far as we know, been published. He delighted to converse with
                    men of science, and to read and investigate the merits of new publications in
                    their society, which he found a valuable source of intellectual improvement.</p>
                <p>The character of Galvani in private life is allowed to have been most exemplary;
                    and his sensibility, which was naturally strong, received a violent shock in the
                    death of his wife, Lucia Galleazzi, in 1790. This event brought on an alarming
                    melancholy, which he delighted to encourage, by visiting her tomb in the nunnery
                    of St Catharine, and pouring out his unavailing lamentations over her grave. He
                    was punctual in the discharge of his religious duties, and retained through life
                    the pious impressions which had been early made on his mind. To this may
                    probably be traced the misfortune which afterwards befel him, and which
                    undoubtedly hastened his end. The Cisalpine republic having required of all
                    those holding public employments an oath to the government, Galvani refused to
                    take it. Who can blame him, says Μ. Alibert, for having followed the voice of
                    his conscience, that internal and sacred voice which alone prescribes the duties
                    of men, and which preceded all human laws? Who can avoid commending him for
                    having sacrificed, with exemplary resignation, all the emoluments attached to
                    the office which he held? Besides, this learned professor entertained strict
                    notions as to those solemn obligations, which are so often abused in the hope of
                    strengthening the laws of empires; he thought, with reason, that they were only
                    suitable to nations incapable of violating them. Deprived of his rank and
                    employment, and almost reduced to indigence, Galvani retired to the residence of
                    his brother James, and soon afterwards fell into a state of extenuation and
                    languor, which, notwithstanding all the skill and attention, equally enlightened
                    and generous, of Doctors Uttini and Cingari, continued to gain ground. Moved by
                    his great celebrity, and ashamed of the severity with which they had treated a
                    man who valued his conscience above all earthly possessions or distinctions, the
                    Cisalpine government now decreed that, notwithstanding his obstinacy, he should
                    be reinstated in his chair. But the indulgence was useless; it came too late.
                    His sensibility had received too many violent shocks to leave a hope of
                    recovery; and death, which he had for some time desired, at length came to his
                    relief on the 4th December 1798. In the Memoirs of the Institute of Sciences of
                    Bologna are to be found the works, few in number, but of the highest importance,
                    which have immortalized the name of Galvani. These are, 1. De renibus atque
                    ureteribus volatilium; 2. De volatilium aure; 3. De viribus Electricitatis in
                    motu musculari Commentarius, already mentioned.</p>
