                    29° 20' of south latitude. On the continent, four miles south-east of the
                    capital, stands the town of San Jose, the inhabitants of which are principally
                    occupied in sawing timber into planks, making bricks, and growing rice. To the
                    north of this town the shores are studded with houses, pleasantly situated amid
                    bananarias, orangeries, and plantations of rice, coffee, and mandioca. Nine
                    leagues from San Jose is the village of Armaçao, situated at the extremity of
                    the Bay of St Miguel. It is a fishing station for whales, which were formerly
                    very numerous on the coast, and in the bays that indent it. The conveniencies
                    for the manufacture of oil are extensive and well contrived, and all the fish on
                    the coast are brought to this quarter. Beyond the point of Armaçao is that of
                    Dos Ganchos, forming the southern extremity of the spacious Bay of Tejuco or
                    Tejucas, into which a river of the same name, fifty fathoms wide, discharges
                    itself. Ten leagues north of this place is the fine capacious harbour of
                    Gua-roupas, with its handsome town. Further northward is the Bay of St
                    Francisco, in which there is an island with a town, both of the same name. The
                    harbour is fine, and has three entrances, defended by forts. Ship-building is
                    carried on at this place to some extent; the cutting of the fine timber in the
                    neighbourhood, and other labours connected with this art, being the chief
                    occupation of the inhabitants, who may amount to about two thousand. The largest
                    continental town in the province is Laguna, prettily situated upon the eastern
                    margin of the lake from which it derives its name, two miles from the bar, and
                    sixty miles south of Desterro. In the months of November, and December
                    particularly, a prodigious quantity of a long fish, with a forked tail, called
                        <hi rend="italic">bagre,</hi> enter the lake, supplying a lucrative branch
                    of commerce. This place contains four thousand inhabitants. Fifteen miles north
                    of Laguna is Villa Nova, or Santa Anna, situated on an elevation near the
                    northern extremity of the same lake. More flax is ma<pb break="no"

                    villages of Santa Catharina are small and of little importance. In 1812 the
                    population, according to Cazal, was 31,530; but it has greatly increased. The
                    province is divided into seven parishes, three of which are situated on the
                    island of Santa Catharina, and four on the continent. The whole are included
                    within the see of Rio de Janeiro. For a description of the island of Santa
                    Catharina, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Catherine, St</hi>.</p>

                        Croix,</hi> a small and unhealthy island, situated in about sixty-four
                    degrees west longitude and eighteen north latitude. In 1643 it was inhabited by
                    the Dutch and the English, who soon became enemies to each other; and in 1650
                    they were both driven out by twelve hundred Spaniards, who arrived there in five
                    ships. The triumph of these lasted but a few months. The remains of that
                    numerous body, which were left for the defence of the island, surrendered
                    without resistance to a hundred and sixty French, who had embarked, in the year
                    1651, from St Christopher’s, to make themselves masters of the island. It
                    continued without inhabitants and without cultivation till 1733, when it was
                    sold by France to Denmark for L.30,750. Soon afterwards the Danes built there
                    the fortress of Christianstadt. It was then that this northern power seemed
                    likely to take deep root in America; but, unfortunately, she laid her
                    plantations under the yoke of exclusive privileges. Industrious people of all
                    sects, particularly Moravians, strove in vain to overcome this great difficulty.
                    Many attempts were made to reconcile the interests of the colonists and their
                    oppressors, but without success. The two parties kept up a continual struggle of
                    animosity, and not of industry. At length the government purchased, in 1754, the
                    privileges and effects of the company. The price was fixed at L.4l2,500; and the
                    navigation of the islands opened to all the subjects of the Danish dominions. It
                    is the most valuable of the Danish possessions in the West Indies. The soil is
                    fertile and well cultivated, and the principal productions are sugar, rum, and
                    coffee. It is about eighty-one square miles in extent, and contains about 37,000
                    inhabitants, of whom 3000 are whites, 1200 free blacks and mulattoes, and the
                    remainder slaves.</p>

                    Granada, and in the province of Andalusia. When, under Ferdinand and Isabella,
                    the court of Spain determined to reduce to the Christian dominion the last
                    refuge of the Moors in the city of Granada, as the siege was likely to be very
                    protracted, this city was founded near it, as the head-quarters of the Catholic
                    forces. It is in a fine situation, surrounded by the best cultivation, and
                    enjoying the best soil in Spain, perhaps in the world; and its powers of
                    irrigation are always greater in proportion to the heat of the weather, as the
                    waters are supplied from the melting of the snows on the summit of the Sierra
                    Nevada. This city has been frequently injured by earthquakes, which have at
                    times almost destroyed its edifices. One in 1807 was especially destructive;
                    but, from the richness of the soil, it has speedily risen from its ruins, and
                    been as flourishing as before the visitation. It is said that a narrow strip of
                    land, extending the whole distance across the plain, and on one part of which
                    this city is built, is periodically subject to this calamity, which, however the
                    inhabitants may dread it, has not power to drive them from it. Near to this
                    place is the residence and estate granted by the Spanish government to the Duke
                    of Wellington for his services during the war. It is called the Sota de Roma,
                    and is finely situated.</p>

                    and the seat of an audiencia and a university, and contains magnificent houses,
                    five bridges, and thirty thousand inhabitants. The air is constantly temperate.
                    The wheat of Europe and the sesame of Asia produce abundant crops, and at all

                    resemblance in several respects to that which encloses the Mexican lakes. They
                    are both more elevated than the convent of St Bernard, the former being 8190,
                    the latter 7008 feet above the level of the sea. Long. 74.10. W. Lat. 4. 35.
