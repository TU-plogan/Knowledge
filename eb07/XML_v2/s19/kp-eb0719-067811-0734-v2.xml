                        William</hi></label>, was bom on the 19th of December 1742, at Stralsund,
                    where his father had kept a shop. When he was very young, he received the usual
                    instructions of a private school; and was afterwards advanced to an academy. At
                    a very early age he showed a strong desire to follow the profession of an
                    apothecary, and his father suffered him to gratify his inclinations. With Mr
                    Bauch, an apothecary at Gottenburg, he served his apprenticeship, which was
                    completed in six years. He remained, however, some time longer at that place,
                    and it was there that he so excellently laid the foundations of his knowledge.
                    Among the various books which he read that treated of chemical subjects,
                    Kunckell’s Laboratory seems to have been his favourite. He used to repeat many
                    of the experiments contained in that work privately in the night, when the rest
                    of the family had retired to rest. A friend of Scheele’s had remarked the
                    progress which he had made in chemistry, and had asked him by what inducements
                    he had at first been led to study a science in which he had gained such
                    knowledge. Scheele replied, “The first cause, my friend, arose from yourself.
                    Nearly at the beginning of my apprenticeship you advised me to read Neuman’s
                    Chemistry, from the perusal of which I became eager to make experiments myself;
                    and I remember very well how I mixed together, in a conserve-glass, oil of
                    cloves and fuming acid of nitre, which immediately took fire. I see also still
                    before my eyes an unlucky experiment which I made with pyrophorus. Circumstances
                    of this kind did but the more inflame my desire to repeat experiments.” After
                    Scheele’s departure from Gottenburg in the year 1765, he obtained a place with
                    Kalstrom, an apothecary at Malmo Two years afterwards he went from thence to
                    Stockholm, and managed the shop of Mr Scharenberg. In 1773, he changed this
                    appointment for another at Upsal, under Mr<pb break="no"
                        facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=735" xml:id="kp-eb0719-0735-0679"
                    /> Loock. Here he was fortunately situated, as, from his acquaintance with
                    learned men, and from having free access to the university laboratory, he had
                    opportunities of increasing his knowledge. At this place also he happily
                    commenced the friendship which subsisted between him and Bergman. During his
                    residence at this place, Prince Henry of Prussia, accompanied by the Duke of
                    Sudermania, visited Upsal, and chose this opportunity to see the academical
                    laboratory. Scheele was accordingly appointed by the university to exhibit to
                    them some chemical experiments. This office he undertook, and showed some of the
                    most curious processes in chemistry. The two princes asked him many questions,
                    and expressed their approbation of the answers which he returned to them. The
                    duke asked him of what country he was, and seemed to be much pleased when
                    Scheele informed him that he was born at Stralsund. At their departure they told
                    the professor, who was present, that they should esteem it a favour if he would
                    permit the young man to have free access to the laboratory as often as he chose
                    to make experiments.</p>
                <p part="N">In the year 1777 Scheele was appointed by the Medical College to be
                    apothecary at Koping. It was at that place that he soon showed the world how
                    great a man he was, and that no place or situation could confine his abilities.
                    When he was at Stockholm he showed his acuteness as a chemist, as he discovered
                    there the new and wonderful acid contained in the fluor spar. It has been
                    confidently asserted that Scheele was the first who discovered the nature of the
                    aerial acid, and that whilst he was at Upsal he made many experiments to prove
                    its properties. This circumstance might probably have furnished Bergman with the
                    means of treating this subject more fully. At the same place he began the series
                    of excellent experiments on that remarkable mineral substance manganese; from
                    which investigation he was lcd to make the very valuable and interesting
                    discovery of oxymuriatic acid. At the same time he examined the properties of
                    ponderous earth.</p>
                <p part="N">At Koping he finished his Dissertation on Air and Fire; a work which the
                    celebrated Bergman most warmly recommended in the friendly preface which he
                    wrote for it. The theory which Scheele endeavours to prove in this treatise is,
                    that fire consists of pure air and phlogiston. According to more recent
                    opinions, if inflammable air be phlogiston, water is composed of these two
                    principles. Of these opinions we may say, in the words of Cicero, “Opiniones tam
                    variae sunt tamque inter se dissidentes ut alterum profecto fieri potest ut
                    earum nulla, alterum certe non potest ut plus una vera sit.” The author’s merit
                    in this work, exclusive of the encomiums of Bergman, was sufficient to obtain
                    the approbation of the public; as the ingenuity displayed in treating so
                    delicate a subject, and the many new and valuable observations which are
                    dispersed through the treatise, justly entitled the author to that fame which
                    his book procured him. It was spread abroad throughout every country, became
                    soon out of print, and was reprinted, and translated into many languages. The
                    English translation is enriched with the notes of that accurate and truly
                    philosophical genius Mr Richard Kirwan.</p>
                <p part="N">Scheele now diligently employed himself in contributing to the
                    Transactions of the Academy at Stockholm. He first pointed out a new way to
                    prepare the salt of benzoin. In the same year he discovered that arsenic, freed
                    in a particular manner from phlogiston, partakes of all the properties of an
                    acid, and has its peculiar affinities to other substances.</p>
                <p part="N">In a Dissertation on Flint, Clay, and Alum, he clearly overturned
                    Beaumé’s opinion of the identity of the siliceous and argillaceous earths. He
                    published an Analysis of the Human Calculus. He showed also a mode of preparing
                        <hi rend="italic">mercurius dulcis</hi> in the humid way, and improved the
                    process of making the powder of algaroth. He analysed the mineral substance
                    called molybdena, or flexible black lead. He discovered a beautiful green
                    pigment. He showed us how to decompose the air of the atmosphere. He discovered
                    that some neutral salts are decomposed by lime and by iron. He decomposed
                    plumbago, or the common black lead. He observed, with peculiar ingenuity, an
                    acid in milk, which decomposes acetated alkali; and in his experiments on the
                    sugar of milk, he discovered another acid, different in some respects from the
                    above-mentioned acids and the common acid of sugar. He accomplished the
                    decomposition of tungsten, the component parts of which were before unknown, and
                    found in it a peculiar metallic acid united to lime. He published an excellent
                    dissertation on the different sorts of ether. He found out an easy way to
                    preserve vinegar for many years. His investigation of the colouring matter in
                    Prussian blue, the means he employed to separate it, and his discovery that
                    alkali, sal ammoniac, and charcoal, mixed together, will produce it, are strong
                    marks of his penetration and genius. He found out a peculiar sweet matter in
                    expressed oils after they have been boiled with litharge and water. He showed
                    how the acid of lemons may be obtained in crystals. He found the white powder in
                    rhubarb, which Model thought to be selenite, and which amounts to one seventh of
                    the weight of the root, to be calcareous earth united to the acid of sorrel.
                    This suggested to him the examination of the acid of sorrel. He precipitated
                    acetate of lead with it, and decomposed the precipitate thus obtained by the
                    vitriolic acid, and by this process he obtained the common acid of sugar; and by
                    slowly dropping a solution of fixed alkali into a solution of the acid of sugar,
                    he regenerated the acid of sorrel. From his examination of the acids contained
                    in fruits and berries, he found not one species of acid alone, viz. the acid of
                    lemon, but also another, which he denominated the malaceous or malic acid, from
                    its being found in the greatest quantity in apples.</p>
                <p part="N">By the decomposition of Bergman’s new metal, siderite, he showed the
                    truth of Meyer’s and Klaproth’s conjecture concerning it. He boiled the calx of
                    siderite with alkali of tartar, and precipitated nitrate of mercury by the
                    middle salt which he obtained by this operation. The calx of mercury which was
                    precipitatcd was found to be united to the acid of phosphorus, so that he
                    demonstrates that this calx was phosphoretted iron. He found also that the
                    native Prussian blue contained the same acid. He discovered, by the same means,
                    that the perlate acid, as it was called, was not an acid <hi rend="italic">sui
                        generis,</hi> but the phosphoric united to a small quantity of the mineral
                    alkali. He suggested an improvement in the process for obtaining magnesia from
                    Epsom salt; and he advises the adding of an equal weight of common salt to the
                    Epsom salt, so that an equal weight of Glauber’s salt may be obtained; but this
                    will not succeed unless during the cold of winter. These are the valuable
                    discoveries of this great philosopher, which are to be found in the Transactions
                    of the Royal Society at Stockholm. Most of his essays have been published in
                    French by Madame Pi-cardet and M. Morveau of Dijon. Dr Beddoes also has made a
                    very valuable present to his countrymen of an English translation of a great
                    part of Scheele’s dissertations, to which he has added some useful and ingenious
                    notes.</p>
                <p part="N">Viewing Scheele as a philosopher, we must judge of him from his many and
                    important discoveries. What concerns him as a man we are informed of by his
                    friends, who affirm that his moral character was irreproachable. It was matter
                    of remark, that his chemical apparatus was neither neat nor convenient; his
                    laboratory was small and confined; nor was he particular in regard to the
                    vessels which he employed in his experiments, so that we may justly wonder how
                    such discoveries and such experiments could have been made. He understood none
                    of the modem languages except the German and Swedish; and he had not the
                        advan-<pb break="no" facs="ht:chi.28490931&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=736"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0719-0736-0680"/> tage of being benefited by the early
                    intelligence of discoveries made by foreigners, but was forced to wait till the
                    intelligence was conveyed to him in the slow and uncertain channel of
                    translation.</p>
                <p part="N">It was often wished that he would quit his retirement at Koping, and
                    move in a larger sphere. It was suggested to him that a place might be procured
                    in England, which might afford him a good income and more leisure; and indeed
                    latterly an offer was made to him of an annuity of L.300 if he would settle in
                    this country. But death put an end to this project. For half a year before this
                    melancholy event his health had been declining, and he himself was sensible that
                    he would not recover. On the l9th of May 1786 he was confined to his bed; on the
                    21st he bequeathed all of which he was possessed to his wife, who was the widow
                    of his predecessor at Koping, and whom he had lately married; and on the same
                    day he departed this life. Thus, in less than two years, the world lost Bergman
                    and Scheele, of whom Sweden may justly boast, as philosophers who were beloved
                    and lamented by all their contemporaries, and whose memory posterity will never
                    cease to revere.</p>
