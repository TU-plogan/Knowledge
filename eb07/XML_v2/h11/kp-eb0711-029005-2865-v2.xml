                        Gottlob</hi></label>, an illustrious classical scholar and archaeologist,
                    was born on the 25th of September 1729, in a suburb of the city of Chemnitz, in
                    Saxony, where his father, having been compelled by some religious persecutions
                    to abandon his native country of Silesia, had settled, supporting his family in
                    great poverty by exercising the trade of a weaver. It was only by the liberality
                    of his godfathers that Heyne was enabled to obtain his primary instruction in
                    the elementary school of Chemnitz, and afterwards to prosecute his classical
                    studies in the gymnasium of that city. In 1745 he entered the University of
                    Leipsic. There he was so scantily supported by those on whose assistance he
                    relied, that he was frequently in want even of the common necessaries of life,
                    and was sometimes indebted for food to the generosity of a maid-servant in the
                    house where he lodged. In this situation, without even the hope of future
                    distinction, he continued to struggle against every difficulty and
                    disappointment in the acquisition of knowledge. For six months he is said to
                    have allowed only two nights in the week to sleep, and was at the same time
                    forced to endure the reproaches which his godfather thought himself entitled to
                    inflict on him for negligence in the prosecution of his studies. His distress
                    had almost amounted to despair, when he procured the situation of preceptor in
                    the family of a French merchant resident in Leipsic. He was thus enabled to
                    continue his studies, though with much interruption; the emoluments of his
                    appointment being sufficient to support him in what was at least comparative
                    comfort. Under Ernesti, he was initiated into the criticism of the classical
                    authors; from the prelections of the celebrated Bach he acquired a competent
                    knowledge of the Roman jurisprudence; and through the instructions of Christius,
                    who lectured on archaeology, and with whom he was intimately acquainted, his
                    attention was strongly directed to the works of ancient art. Having finished his
                    studies at the university, he was exposed for many years to all the accumulated
                    distresses of poverty and neglect. The first situation he was able to procure
                    was that of copyist in the library of Count de Bruhl, with a salary of only an
                    hundred dollars, which he obtained in the year 1753. From the necessity of
                    adding something to this scanty pittance, he was forced to employ himself in the
                    drudgery of translation; and, besides some French novels, he <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193642878?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2878-0291"/>translated
                    into German the Greek romance of Chariton. He published his first edition of
                    Tibullus in 1755, and in 1756 his Epictetus. In 1756, his emoluments as copyist
                    were doubled, and the education of Prince Maurice de Bruhl was intrusted to him,
                    but without any additional salary. The invasion of Saxony by the Prussians
                    deprived him of his appointment, and even destroyed the library on which it
                    depended. The period of the seven years’ war was that in which he was chiefly
                    exposed to the storms of fortune; and his marriage with Theresa Weisse, a young
                    woman of distinguished genius, but equally poor with himself, increased his
                    misery. Having been obliged to retire into Lausatia, he lived for some years as
                    steward in the family of the Baron de Leoben. He was enabled, however, to return
                    to Dresden in 1762, where he was intrusted, by Lippert, with the care of writing
                    the Latin text of the third volume of his <hi rend="italic"
                    >Ωactyliotheca.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">At length, in the commencement of the year 1763, his merit met with its
                    reward, and a new and illustrious career was opened to him. On the death of John
                    Matthew Gesner, in 1761, it became necessary for the curators of the university
                    of Göttingen to look around for a successor capable of sustaining the reputation
                    which the institution had acquired by the learning and talents of that
                    distinguished scholar. The appointment was offered to Ernesti, who, whilst he
                    declined leaving the university of Leipsic, proposed Ruhnkenius of Leyden or
                    Saxius of Utrecht for the situation. Ruhnken likewise refused the appointment,
                    but having been strongly impressed by the taste and learning displayed by the
                    editor of Tibullus and Epictetus, he advised Munckhausen, the Hanoverian
                    minister and principal curator of the university of Göttingen, to bestow the
                    professorship on Heyne, whose merit, though known to few, he ventured to promise
                    would do honour to the choice. The minister had the good sense to acquiesce in
                    the recommendation of this great scholar, and Heyne, after some delay, became
                    professor of eloquence in Göttingen. Though his appointments were at first few,
                    and his emoluments inconsiderable, these were gradually augmented in proportion
                    as his usefulness was approved, and ąs his growing celebrity rendered it an
                    object with the other governments of Germany to secure for their literary
                    institutions the services of so distinguished a scholar. He refused the most
                    advantageous and honourable overtures from Cassel, Berlin, and Dresden. In his
                    different capacities of professor, principal librarian, member of the Royal
                    Society, and chief editor of the Literary Gazette, and still more by his
                    publications, he mainly contributed to raise the university of Göttingen to the
                    distinguished rank it holds among the academies of Europe. After a long and
                    useful career, graced with all the distinctions which in Germany are conferred
                    on literary eminence, he died, full of years and honour, on the 14th of July
                    1814.</p>
                <p part="N">In Greek literature he has given us editions of Homer’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Iliad,</hi> Pindar, Diodorus Siculus, Apollodorus, and
                    Epictetus; and, in Latin, editions of Virgil and Tibullus; all illustrated with
                    copious commentaries. His <hi rend="italic">Opuscula Academica,</hi> in five
                    volumes, contain a series of 116 academical dissertations, of which the most
                    valuable are those respecting the antiquities of Etruscan art and history, and
                    the researches regarding the colonies of Greece. He has left us also a great
                    number of papers on almost every subject of erudition, more especially on
                    ancient mythology, amongst the <hi rend="italic">Commentationes

                    valuable collection of essays on different subjects connected with the history
                    of ancient art. In the earlier part of his life he translated, or rather wrote
                    anew, a great part of the <hi rend="italic">Universal History.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">After this notice of the chief events of his life, and of his literary
                    productions, it may be proper to say somewhat in regard to the distinctive merit
                    which has raised Heyne to so eminent a place amongst the promoters of classical
                    literature. And here it is chiefly as an interpreter of the ancient poets, and
                    as an original investigator of the ancient mythology, that he must rest his
                    claims to the celebrity he has acquired. As a critic of the works of art, his
                    desert is great, but he has no pretentions to original or peculiar
                    discoveries.</p>
                <p part="N">The example of the great philologists of Holland, and the more immediate
                    influence of Ernesti and Gesner on the taste and pursuits of their countrymen,
                    had, before the middle of the last century, awakened in Germany a new zeal for
                    the study of the ancient authors, and had advanced the criticism of classical
                    literature to a rapid and vigorous maturity. The great writers of antiquity
                    ought not, however, to be read with a regard limited merely to their language;
                    they more especially deserve a close and enthusiastic study, for the admirable
                    means which they afford of improving the understanding and of cultivating the
                    taste. From the year 1760, about which period the Germans had begun to devote
                    themselves, with an enthusiasm as zealous as it was tardy, to the cultivation of
                    their native language and literature, several intelligent philologers displayed
                    a more refined and philosophical method in their treatment of the different
                    branches of classical learning, and, without neglecting either the grammatical
                    investigation of the language, or the critical constitution of the text, no
                    longer regarded a Greek or Roman writer as a subject for the mere grammarian and
                    critic, but, considering the study of the ancients as a school for thought, for
                    feeling, and for taste, they initiated us into the great mystery of reading
                    every thing in the same spirit in which it had originally been written. They
                    demonstrated, both by doctrine and example, in what manner it was necessary for
                    us to enter into the thoughts of the writer, to pitch ourselves in unison with
                    his peculiar tone of conception and expression, whether erroneous or correct,
                    and in every instance accurately to investigate the circumstances by which the
                    mind of the poet or philosopher was affected, the motives by which he was
                    animated, and the influences which co-operated in giving the intensity and
                    character to his feelings. It was shown how generally the conception of the
                    reader was merely a veil thrown over the thought of the original. It was no
                    longer allowed to combine modern with ancient ideas, to convert the derivative
                    with the original thought, or to translate it by a new and factitious
                    signification. At the head of this school stands Heyne, both as its founder and
                    principal ornament; and, however some of his disciples may have exposed
                    themselves to ridicule in their application of the principles on which this
                    system of interpretation rests, yet it cannot be denied that nothing has
                    contributed so decisively to maintain and promote the study of classical
                    literature, as the combination which Heyne has effected of philosophy with
                    erudition, both in his commentaries on the ancient authors, and in those works
                    in which he has illustrated various points of antiquity, or discussed the habit
                    of thinking and spirit of the ancient world.</p>
                <p part="N">The poverty of Germany in manuscripts has compelled her scholars to rest
                    satisfied in general with the critical apparatus which the philosophers of other
                    nations have collected. What they necessarily wanted in the originality of
                    subsidiary stores, they have, however, endeavoured to supply, by a sound and
                    rational employment of those already compiled; and the praise of useful
                    diligence cannot certainly, with justice, be denied to their labours in this
                    department. Originality, however, was possible in the higher criticism, which
                    does not rest on the collection of readings or the authority of manuscripts, and
                    in the mode of the illustration applied to the ancient writers: in <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193642891?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-2891-0292"/>
                    these respects the later pbilologers of Germany have earned a glory peculiar to
                    themselves, and which must be remembered as long as learning and ingenuity are
                    respected. How cogently have they reasoned on the authenticity or spuriousness
                    of particular writings, and how skilfully have they applied the test to the
                    interpolations of later times; towhat new conclusions are we now brought in
                    regard to Orpheus, Homer, Anacreon, Longinus, &amp;c. by the critical
                    investigations of Schneider, Wolf, Fischer, Hermann, Weiske, and others; how
                    differently has the controversy in regard to the authenticity of certain
                    orations of Cicero been recently concluded by Wolf, compared with the result of
                    Markland’s and Gesner’s investigations. In this department Heyne does not,
                    however, hold the same pre-eminence which he has attained as an enlightened and
                    popular interpreter; for though his discussions in the higher criticism are both
                    numerous and valuable, he is as much surpassed in boldness and originality by
                    Wolf, as he is inferior to Hermann in the minuteness and ingenuity of his
                    reasoning.</p>
                <p part="N">There is, however, another department in which the labours of Heyne are
                    more original, and in which he merits all the honour to which a discoverer is
                    entitled. Until the middle of the eighteenth century, mythology was nothing else
                    than the nomenclature of divinities, a collection of the manifold and discordant
                    legends of their several relations, actions, and destinies, and the delineation
                    of their forms from the works of the poets and artists, illustrated, perhaps, by
                    a mystical and allegorical commentary. About this period some more profound
                    thinkers began to regard the mythical traditions in a higher view, as sources of
                    human history; but, from too confined an acquaintance with the circumstances and
                    condition of the ancient world, they took too high a standard for their
                    explanations, and, through a mystical and allegorical interpretation, thinking
                    they had discovered, under the veil of mythological narration, ideas of the
                    deepest wisdom, they confidently framed thereon hypotheses for the history of
                    mankind, for the arts, for philosophy, and the other sciences, which threatened
                    altogether to extinguish the glimmering light that was still afforded us for the
                    periods of remote antiquity.</p>
                <p part="N">Heyne opened a less ambitious but more certain path. Following the
                    observations which travellers had collected in regard to new and uncivilized
                    nations, he applied these to the condition of the Greeks, who, as history
                    informs us, from a rude and sensual barbarism, gradually advanced to a state of
                    civilization and intellectual refinement. He thus arrived at the simple
                    conclusion, that the mythical tales of antiquity contain the first attempts at
                    reasoning, the most ancient history, philosophy, and theology embodied in a
                    poor, unformed, and consequently figurative language; and, therefore, that
                    mythology is a system comprehending partly the original form of representation
                    through objects of sense peculiar to a rude age, expressed in fables,
                    ceremonies, and monuments, transplanted into later times; partly a kind of
                    poetical apparatus derived and formed from this original mythology, and intended
                    only by its authors for the purposes of poetical effect. He hence justly
                    concluded that it is impossible to attain any real insight into the nature of
                    mythical narration, unless the <hi rend="italic">mythi</hi> of the most ancient
                    poets are carefully distinguished from the abusive applications made of them in
                    the poetry of after times, and unless mythology be kept separate from the
                    philosophy conversant about mythology. In conformity with these fundamental
                    rules, Heyne has illustrated Apollodorus; and in the same spirit he has
                    conducted those researches into the nature and tendency of the different mythi
                    of Greece, which he has published in the <hi rend="italic">Transactions of the
                        Poyal Society of Gottingen.</hi> His views have been almost universally
                    admitted to be correct in principle, and his applications to have been conducted
                    with the most profound learning and almost unequalled ingenuity. A great number
                    of followers have pursued the path he opened; and his theory has now attained
                    the form and stability of a system, through the labours of his disciples.
                    Amongst these, the names of Martin Hermann (not the philologer), of Voss, and of
                    Manso, are especially to be distinguished. The theologians of Germany have
                    likewise applied the same theory to the interpretation of the Sacred Books; and
                    the researches of Eichhorn, Bauer, Ilgen, Hartmann, Vater, De Wette, and a host
                    of other philosophical divines, into the pretended biblical mythi, have been
                    pursued with a learning and acuteness equalled only by the impious audacity of
                    their conclusions, (v. v.)</p>
