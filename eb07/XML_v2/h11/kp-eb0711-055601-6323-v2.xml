                    returned to England, he soon afterwards visited France, intending to proceed to
                    Spain and Italy; but he was prevented by a declaration of war. He therefore
                    returned to England, and fixed his residence in hiş native city, where, having
                    married, he was in 1554 elected chamberlain, being the first person who held
                    that office, and in 1571 represented his fellow-citizens in parliament. He died
                    in the year 1601, and was buried in the cathedral church at Exeter. He wrote,
                    amongst other works, 1. Order and Usage of keeping Parliaments in Ireland; 2.
                    The events of Comets or blazing stars, made upon the sight of the comet Pagonia,
                    which appeared in November and December 1577; 3. An addition to the Chronicles
                    of Ireland from 1546 to 1568, in the second volume of Holinsheďs work; 4. A
                    Description of the city of Exeter, and of the sundry assaults given to the same
                    (Holinshed, <hi rend="italic">Clιτon.</hi> vol. iii.); 5. A Book of Ensigns; 6.
                    Translation of the History of the Conquest of Ireland, from the Latin of
                    Giraldus Cambrensis (Holinshed, <hi rend="italic">Chron.</hi> vol. ii.); 7. <hi
                        rend="italic">Synopsis Chorograpĥica,</hi> or an historical record of the
                    province of Devon, never printed.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Hooker,</hi><hi rend="italic">Richard,</hi> a very
                    eminent writer and divine, was born at Heavytree, near Exeter, in the year 1553.
                    Some of his ancestors were mayors of that city, and he was nephew to John Hooker
                    the historian. He was first supported by this uncle at the university of Oxford,
                    with the addition of a small pension from Dr Jewel, bishop of Salisbury, who in
                    1561 got him admitted as one of the clerks of Corpus Christi College. In 1573 he
                    was elected scholar. In 1577 he took the degree of master of arts, and was
                    admitted a fellow the same year. In July 1579 he was appointed deputy professor
                    of the Hebrew language; and in October the same year he was, for some trivial
                    misdemeanour, expelled the college, but immediately restored. In 1581 he took
                    holy orders; and being appointed to preach at St Paul’s Cross, he went to
                    London, where he was unfortunately drawn into an unhappy marriage with Joan
                    Churchman, the daughter of his hostess. Having thus lost his fellowship, he
                    continued in the utmost distress till the year 1584, when he was presented to
                    the rectory of Drayton Beauchamp in Buckinghamshire. In this retirement he was
                    visited by Mr Edwin Sandys and Mr George Cranmer, his former pupils. They found
                    him, with a Horace in his hand, tending some sheep in the common field, his
                    servant having been ordered home by his Xantippe. Mr Sandys’s representation to
                    his father, of his tutor’s situation, procured the latter the mastership of the
                    Temple. In this situation he met with considerable molestation from one Travers,
                    lecturer of the Temple, and a bigoted puritan, who in the afternoon endeavoured
                    to confute the doctrine delivered in the morning. From a situation so
                    disagreeable he solicited Archbishop Whitgift to remove him to some country
                    retirement, where he might prosecute his studies in tranquillity. Accordingly,
                    in 1591 he obtained the rectory of Boscomb in Wiltshire, together with a prebend
                    in the church of Salisbury, of which he was also made subdean. In 1594 he was
                    presented to the rectory of Bishopsbourne in Kent, where he died in the year
                    1600. He was buried in his own parish church, where a monument was erected to
                    his memory by William Cooper. His great work on Ecclesiastical Polity, first
                    published in 1594, is a strenuous defence of the English establishment; but it
                    is at the same time remarkable for its liberal views of civil government. In
                    this respect it coincides nearly with the theory of Locke; and, indeed, Hoadley
                    says that the author was “styled the father of the Whigs.” Hooker is beyond all
                    question one of the most dignified and eloquent of our early writers. “I know
                    not,” says Mr Hallam, in his <hi rend="italic">Constitutional History of
                        England,</hi><hi rend="italic">“</hi> whether any later writer has more
                    admirably displayed the capacities of our language, or produced passages more
                    worthy of comparison with the splendid monuments of antiquity.” He was the
                    author of several sermons and tracts. His life, by Isaac Walton, is well known.
                    Dr Garden, bishop of Worcester, published his works in folio, with a life by
                    himself, in 1662. This collection has been several times reprinted, both in
                    folio and in octavo. The last edition, in three vols. 8vo, with Walton’s life
                    prefixed, was published in 1830.</p>
