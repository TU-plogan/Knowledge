                    Paris in 1685. He early discovered a sprightly, benevolent disposition; and

                    success of his studies. On quitting college, Hénault entered the Oratory, where
                    he soon attached himself to the study of eloquence; and on the death of the Abbé
                    René, reformer of La Trappe, he undertook to pronounce his panegyric; but as
                    this did not meet the approbation of Massillon, he quitted the Oratory after two
                    years; and his father bought for him, of Mareschal Villeroi, the office of <hi

                    government of Corbeli. In 1707, he gained the prize of eloquence at the French
                    academy; and next year he carried off another at the Académie des Jeux Floraux.
                    In 1713 he brought out a tragedy on the stage, under the disguised name of
                    Fuselier. As he was known to the public only by some lighter pieces, <hi
                        rend="italic">Cornelia the Vestal</hi> met with little sueeess; and he
                    therefore locked it up without printing. But in his old age his passion for
                    these subjects revived; and Horace Walpole happening to be at Paris in 1768,
                    where he formed a friendship with Hénault, obtained this piece, and had it
                    printed at his own press. In 1751 Μ. Hénault, under a borrowed name, brought out
                    a second tragedy, entitled <hi rend="italic">Marius,</hi> which was well
                    received and printed. He had been admitted as counsellor in parliament in 1706,
                    with a dispensation on account of his age; and in 1710 he was appointed
                    president of the first chamber of inquests. These important places, which he
                    determined to fill in a becoming manner, engaged him in the most solid studies.
                    He spent several years in making himself master of the Roman law, and the
                    ordonnances of the French kings, with their customs and public law. On the death
                    of the Cardinal Dubois, in 1732, he succeeded in his place at the French
                    academy. Cardinal Fleury recommended him to succeed himself as director; and he
                    pronounced the éloge of Μ. de Malezieux.</p>
                <p part="N">Μ. Hénaulťs favourite study was history, not a bare collection of dates,
                    but a knowledge of the laws and manners of nations; and to obtain this he drew
                    instruction from private conversations, a method he so strongly recommends in
                    his preface. After having thus discussed the most important points of public
                    law, he undertook to collect and publish the result of his inquiries; and he is
                    deservedly accounted the first framer of chronological abridgments, in which,
                    without stopping at detached facts, he attends only to those forming a chain of
                    events which perfect or alter the government and character of a nation, and
                    traces only the springs which exalt or humble a nation, extending or contracting
                    the space it occupies in the world. The first edition of his work, the result of
                    forty years’ reading, appeared in the year 1744, under the auspices of the
                    Chancellor d’Aguesseau, and with the modest title of Essay. The success it met
                    with surprised him. He made continual improvements in it, and it has gone
                    through many editions, and been translated into Italian, English, and
                    German.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1755, he was chosen an honorary member of the Academy of Belles
                    Lettres, being then a member of the academies of Nanei, Berlin, and Stockholm.
                    He composed three comedies, namely, <hi rend="italic">La Petite</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Maison, Le Jaloux de Lui-même,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">La
                        Réveil</hi><hi rend="italic">cľ</hi><hi rend="italic">Epiménide.</hi> The
                    subject of the last was the Cretan philosopher, who is pretended to have slept
                    twenty-seven years. He is introduced fancying that he had slept but one night,
                    and astonished at the change in all around him; he mistakes his mistress for his
                    mother; but discovering his mistake, offers to marry her, which she refuses,
                    though he still continues to love her. The queen was particularly pleased with
                    this piece, and ordered the president to restore the philosopher’s mistress to
                    her former youth; he accordingly introduced Hebe, and this episode produced an
                    agreeable entertainment.</p>
                <p part="N">A delicate constitution made him liable to much illness, which, however,
                    did not interrupt the serenity of his mind. One morning, after a quiet night, he
                    felt an oppression, which the faculty pronounced a suffocating cough. He then
                    received the sacraments. It was believed the next night would be his last; but
                    by noon the following day he was out of danger. “Now I know what death is,” said
                    he; “it will not be new to me any more.” He never forgot it during the remaining
                    seven years of his life, which, like all the rest, were gentle and calm. He died
                    on the 24th of November 1770, in his eighty-fifth year. The principal works of
                    President Hénault are, 1. Nouvelle Abrégé Chronologique de l’Histoire de la
                    France, 1768, in 4to; 2. Histoire Critique de l’établissement des Français, dans
