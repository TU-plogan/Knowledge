                <p part="N"><label type="entry">HOSPITALITY</label>, the practice of entertaining
                    strangers. Dr Robertson, speaking of the middle ages, says, “Among people whose
                    manners are simple, and who are seldom visited by strangers, hospitality is a
                    virtue of the first rank. This duty of hospitality was so necessary in that
                    state of society which took place during the middle ages, that it was not
                    considered as one of those virtues which men may practise or not, according to
                    the temper of their minds and the generosity of their hearts. Hospitality was
                    enforced by statutes, and those who neglected the duty were liable to
                    punishment. The laws of the Salvi ordained that the moveables of an inhospitable
                    person should be confiscated, and his house burnt. They were even so solicitous
                    for the entertainment of strangers, that they permitted the landlord to steal
                    for the support of his guest.”</p>
                <p part="N">The hospitality of our British ancestors, particularly of the great and
                    opulent barons, has been much admired, and considered as a certain proof of
                    nobleness and generosity of spirit. The fact indeed is well attested. The
                    castles of the powerful barons were capacious palaces, daily crowded with
                    numerous retainers, who were always welcome to plentiful tables. They had their
                    privy councillors, their treasurers, marshals, constables, stewards,
                    secretaries, chaplains, heralds, pursuivants, pages, henchmen or guards,
                    trumpeters, minstrels, and, in a word, all the officers of a royal court. The
                    etiquette of their families was an exact copy of that of the royal household;
                    and some of them lived in a degree of pomp and splendour little inferior to that
                    of the greatest kings. Richard Neville, earl of Warwick, we are told, “was ever
                    had in great favour of the commons of the land, because of the exceeding
                    household which he daily kept in all countries wherever he sojourned or lay; and
                    when he came to London, he held such an house, that six oxen were eaten at a
                    breakfast, and every tavern was full of his meat.” The Earls of Douglas in
                    Scotland, before the fall of that great family, rivalled or rather exceeded
                    their sovereigns in pomp and profuse hospitality. But it is highly probable
                    these great chieftains were prompted to indulge this style of living by a desire
                    of increasing the number and attachment of their retainers, on which, in those
                    turbulent times, their dignity, and even their safety, depended, as much as to
                    the innate generosity of their tempers. Those retainers did not constantly
                    reside in the families of their lords; but they wore their liveries and badges,
                    frequently feasted in their halls, swelled their retinues on all great
                    solemnities, attended them in their journeys, and followed them into the field
                    of battle. Some powerful chieftains had constantly at their command so great a
                    number of these retainers, that, setting the laws at defiance, they became
                    formidable to their sovereigns, and terrible to their fellow-subjects; and
                    several laws w ere made against giving and receiving liveries. But these laws
                    produced little effect at this period.</p>
                <p part="N">Hospitality was not confined to the great and opulent, but was practised
                    rather more than it is at present by persons in the middle and lower ranks of
                    life. But this was owing to necessity, arising from the scarcity of inns, wdιich
                    obliged travellers and strangers to apply to private persons for lodging and
                    entertainment; and those who received them hospitably acquired a right to a
                    similar reception. This was evidently the case in Scotland in the first part of
                    this period. In the year 1424, James I. procured the following act of parliament
                    :—“It is ordanit, That in all burrow townis, and throuchíàiris quhair commoun
                    passages ar, that thair be ordanit hostillaries and resettis, havand stables and
                    chahners; and that men find with thame bread and aill, and all uther fude.
                    alsweil for horse as men, for reson-able price.” But travellers had been so long
                    accustomed to lodge in private houses, that these public inns were quite
                    neglected; and those who kept them presented a petition to parliament,
                    complaining, “That the liegis travelland in the realme, quhen they cum to
                    burrowis and throuchfairis, herbreis thame not in hostillaries, bot with thair
                    acquaintance and freindis.” This produced an act prohibiting travellers to lodge
                    in private houses where there were hostelries, under the penalty of forty
                    shillings, and subjecting those who lodged them to the same penalty»</p>

                <p part="N">The inhabitants of the Highlands of Scotland and the Western Isles were
                    anciently remarkable for their hospitality to strangers, and still happily
                    retain, in no inconsiderable degree, the same kindly disposition.</p>
