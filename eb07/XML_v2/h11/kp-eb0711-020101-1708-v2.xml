                    the food for conjecture to the visionary antiquary.</p>

                    that he visited the remoter parts; and that he had also seen Thule, the land of
                    romance amongst the ancients; which all might pretend to have seen; but every
                    voyager, to swell his fame, made the island he saw last the Ultima Thule of his
                    travels. If Pytheas had reached these parts, he might have observed, floating in
                    the seas, multitudes of gelatinous animals, the <hi rend="italic">medusae
                        of</hi> Linnaeus, and out of these have formed his fable. He made his Thule
                    a <hi rend="italic">composition of neither earth, sea, nor air</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi><hi rend="italic">but like a composition of them
                        all</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> then, catching his simile from what floated
                    before him, compares it to the <hi rend="italic">lungs</hi> of the sea, the
                    Aristotelian idea of these bodies, and from him adopted by naturalists,
                    successors to that great philosopher. Strabo very justly explodes these absurd
                    tales; yet allows him merit in describing the climate of the places he had seen.
                    As a farther proof of his having visited the Hebrides, he mentions their
                    unfriendly sky, that prohibits the growth of the finer fruits; and that the
                    natives are obliged to carry their corn under shelter to beat the grain out,
                    lest it should be spoiled by the effect of sun and violence of the rains. This
                    is the probable part of his narrative; but when the time that the great
                    geographer wrote is considered, at a period that these islands had been
                    neglected for a very long space by the Romans, and when the difficulties of
                    getting among a fierce and unfriendly nation must be almost insuperable, doubts
                    innumerable respecting the veracity of this relater must arise. All that can be
                    admitted in favour of him is, that he was a great traveller; and that he might
                    have either visited Britain from some of the nations commercing with our isle,
                    or received from them accounts, which he afterwards dressed out, mixed with the
                    ornaments of íable. A traffic must have been carried on with the very northern
                    inhabitants of our islands in the time of Pytheas; for one of the articles of
                    commerce mentioned by Strabo, the ivory bits, were made either of the teeth of
                    the walrus, or of a species of whale, native of the northern seas.</p>
                <p part="N">“The geographer Mela, who flourished in the reign of Claudius, is the
                    next who takes notice of our lesser islands. He mentions the Orcades as
                    consisting of 30, the AEmodae <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641721?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1721-0202"/>of seven. The Romans had then made a conquest
                    of the former, and might have seen the latter: but, from the words of the
                    historian, it is probable that the Shetland Islands were those intended; for he
                    informs us that the ‘ AEmodae were carried out over against Germany.’ The site
                    of the Hebrides will not admit this description, which agrees very well with the
                    others; for the ancients extended their Germany, and its imaginary islands, to
                    the extreme north.</p>
                <p part="N">“Pliny the Elder is the next that mentions these remote places. He lived
                    later than the preceding writers, and of course his information is fuller. By
                    means of intervening discoveries, he has added ten more to the number of the
                    Orcades; is the first writer that mentions the Hoebudes, the islands in
                    question; and joins in the same line AEmodae, or, as it is in the best editions
                    more properly written, the <hi rend="italic">Acmodae,</hi> or extreme point of
                    the Roman expeditions to the north, as the Shetland Isles in the highest
                    probability were. Pliny and Mela agree in the number of the AEmodae or Acmodae;
                    the former makes that of the Hoebudes 30; an account extremely near the truth,
                    deducting the little isles, or rather rocks, that surround most of the greater,
                    and many of them so indistinct as scarcely to be remarked, except on an actual
                    survey.</p>
                <p part="N">“Solinus succeeds Pliny. If he, as is supposed, was contemporary with
                    Agricola, he has made very ill use of the light he might have received from the
                    expeditions of that great general; his officers might have furnished the
                    historian with better materials than those he has communicated. He has reduced
                    the number of the Hoebudes to five. He tells us that <hi rend="superscript">
                        t</hi> the inhabitants were unacquainted with corn; that they lived only on
                    fish and milk; that they had one king, as the islands were only separated from
                    each other by narrow straits; that their prince was bound by certain rules of
                    government to do justice, and was prevented by poverty from deviating from the
                    true course, being supported by the public, and allowed nothing That he could
                    call his own, not even a wife; but then he was allowed free choice, by turns one
                    out of every district, of any female that caught his affection; which deprived
                    him of all ambition about a successor.’</p>
                <p part="N">“By the number of these islands, and by the minute attention given by
                    the historian to the circumstance of their being separated from each other by
                    very narrow straits, I should imagine that which is now called the <hi

                    South Uist, and Barra, to have been the five Hoebudes of Solinus; for the other
                    great islands, such, as Sky, &amp;c. are too remote from each other to form the
                    preceding very characteristic description of that chain of islands. These might
                    naturally fall under the rule of one petty prince, almost the only probable part
                    of Solinus’s narrative.</p>

                    of Agricola performed the circumnavigation of Britain. All that he takes notice
                    of is the discovery and the conquest of the Orkneys: it should seem, that with

                <p part="N">“From all that has been collected from the ancients, it appears that
                    they were acquainted with little more of the Hebrides than the bare names: it is
                    probable that the Romans, either from contempt of such barren spots, from the
                    dangers of the seas, the violence of the tides, and horrors of the narrow
                    sounds, in the inexperienced ages of navigation, never attempted their conquest,
                    or saw more of them than what they had in sight during the few circumnavigations
                    of Great Britain, which were expeditions more of ostentation than of
                    utility.</p>
                <p part="N">“The inhabitants had probably for some ages their own governors, one
                    little king to each island, or to each group, as necessity required. It is
                    reasonable to suppose that their government was as much divided as that of Great
                    Britain, which, it is well known, was under the direction of numbers of petty
                    princes before it was reduced under the power of the Romans.</p>
                <p part="N">“No account is given in history of the time these islands were annexed
                    to the government of Scotland. If we may credit our Saxon historians, they
                    appear to have been early under the dominion of the Picts; for Bede and
                    Adamnanus inform us, that soon after the arrival of St Columba in their country,
                    Brude, a Pictish monarch, made the saint a present of the celebrated island of
                    Iona. But neither the holy men of this island, nor the natives of the rest of
                    the Hebrides, enjoyed a permanent repose after this event. The first invasion of
                    the Danes does not seem to be easily ascertained. It appears that they ravaged
                    Ireland, and the Isle of Rathry, as early as the year 735. In the following
                    century their expeditions became more frequent; Harold Harfager, or the <hi
                        rend="italic">light-haired,</hi> pursued, in 875, several petty princes,
                    whom he had expelled out of Norway; who had taken refuge in the Hebrides, and
                    molested his dominions by perpeţual descents from those islands. He seems to
                    have made a rapid conquest; he gained as many victories as he fought battles; he
                    put to death the chief of the pirates, and made an indiscriminate slaughter of
                    their followers. Soon after his return, the islanders repossessed their ancient
                    seats; and, in order to repress their insults, he sent Ketil the <hi
                        rend="italic">flat-nosed</hi> with a fleet and some forces for that purpose.
                    He soon reduced them to terms, but made his vietories subservient to his own
                    ambition; he made alliances with the reguli he had subdued; he formed
                    intermarriages, and confirmed to them their old dominions. This effected, he
                    sent back the fleet to Harold; openly declared himself independent; made himself
                    prince of the Hebrides; and caused them to acknowledge him as such, by the
                    payment of tribute and the badges of vassalage. Ketil remained, during life,
                    master of the islands; and his subjects appear to have been a warlike set of
                    freebooters, ready to Join with any adventurers. Thus when Eric, son of Harold
                    Harfager, after being driven out of his own country, made an invasion of
                    England, he put with his fleet into the Hebrides, received a large reinforcement
                    of people fired with the hopes of prey, and then proceeded on his plan of
                    rapine. After the death of Ketil, a kingdom was in after times composed out of
                    them, which, from the residence of the little monarch in the Isle of Man, was
                    styled that of <hi rend="italic">Man.</hi> The islands became tributary to that
                    of Norway for a considerable time, and princes were sent from thence to govern;
                    but at length they again shook off the yoke. Whetheι the little potentates ruled
                    independent, or whether they put themselves under the protection of the Scottish
                    monarchs, does not clearly appear; but it is reasonable tc suppose the last, as
                    Donald-bane is accused of making the Hebrides the price of the assistance given
                    him by the Norwegians against his own subjects. Notwithstanding they might
                    occasionally seek the protection of Scotland, <pb break="no"

                    never were without princes of their own: policy alone directed them to the
                    former. From the chronicles of the kings of Man we learn that they had a
                    succession of princes.</p>
                <p part="N">“In 1089 is an evident proof of the independency of the islanders on
                    Norway; for, on the death of Lagnan, one of their monarchs, they sent a

                    govern them during the minority of their young prince. They probably might in
                    turn compliment in some other respects their Scottish neighbours; the islanders
                    must have given them some pretence to sovereignty; for,</p>

                    Magnus the Barefooted, king of Norway, and bribes him with the promise of all
                    the islands. Magnus accepts the terms; but at the same time boasts, that he does
                    not come to invade the territories of others, but only to resume the ancient
                    rights of Norway. His conquests are rapid and complete; for, besides the
                    islands, by an ingenious fraud he adds Cantyre to his dominions.</p>
                <p part="N">“The Hebrides continued governed by a prince dependent on Norway, a
                    species of viceroy appointed by that court; and who paid, on assuming the
                    dignity, ten marks of gold, and never made any other pecuniary acknowledgment
                    during life: but if another viceroy was appointed, the same sum was exacted from
                    him. These viceroys were sometimes Norwegians, sometimes natives of the isles.
                    In 1097 we find that Magnus deputes a nobleman of the name of <hi rend="italic"

                    an unfortunate invasion of Scotland, terminating in his defeat at Largs, so
                    weakened the powers of his kingdom, that his successor Magnus IV. was content to
                    make a cession of the islands to Alexander HI.: but not without stipulating for
                    the payment of a large sum, and a tribute of 100 merks for ever, which bore the
                    name of the <hi rend="italic">annual of Norway.</hi> Ample provision was also
                    made by Magnus in the same treaty, for the security of the rights and properties

                    marrying the daughter of Olave, king of Man, left a divided dominion to his sons
                    Dugal and Reginald; from the first were descended the Macdougals of Lorn, from
                    the last the powerful clan of the Macdonalds. The lordship of Argyle, with Mull,
                    and the islands north of it, fell to the share of the first; Hay, Cantyre, and
                    the southern isles, were the portion of the last; a division that formed the

                    royalty, and the turbulence of the times, which gave their monarchs full employ,
                    they exercised a regal power, and often assumed the title; but are more

                    Donald and John. This encou raged them to commit fresh hostilities against their
                    natural prince. Donald, under pretence of a claim to the earldom of Ross,
                    invaded and made a conquest of that county; but, penetrating as far as the shire

                    had no other motive in war but the infamous inducement of plunder.</p>
                <p part="N">“In the reign of James II. in the year 1461, Donald, another petty
                    tyrant, an Earl of Ross, and Lord of the Isles, renewed the pretence of
                    independency; surprised the castle of Inverness; forced his way as far as Athol;
                    and obliged the carl and countess, with the principal inhabitants, to seek
                    refuge in the church of St Bridget, in hopes of finding security from his
                    cruelty by the sanctity of the place; but the barbarian and his followers set
                    fire to the church, put the ecclesiastics to the sword, and, with a great booty,
                    carried the earΓand countess prisoners to his castle of Claig, in the island of
                    Hay. In a second expedition, immediately following the first, he suffered the
                    penalty of his impiety: a tempest overtook him, and overwhelmed most of his
                    associates; and he, escaping to Inverness, perished by the hands of an Irish
                    harper; his surviving followers returned to Hay, conveyed the Earl and Countess
                    of Athol to the sanctuary they had violated, and expiated their crime by
                    restoring the plunder, and making large donations to the shrine of the offended
                    saint.</p>
                <p part="N">“John, successor to the late Earl of Ross, entered into alliance with
                    Edward IV. and sent ambassadors to the court of England, where Edward empowered
                    the Bishop of Durham and Earl of Winchester to conclude a treaty with him,
                    another Donald Balloch, and his son and heir John. They agreed to serve the king
                    with all their power, and to become his subjects: the earl was to have 100 marks
                    sterling for life in time of peace, and L.200 in time of war; and these island
                    allies, in case of the conquest of Scotland, were to have confirmed to them all
                    the possessions benorth of the Scottish sea; and in case of a truce with the
                    Scottish monarch, they were to be included in it. But about the year 1476,
                    Edward, from a change of politics, courted the alliance of James HI. and dropt
                    his new allies. James, determined to subdue this rebellious race, sent against
                    them a powerful armyunder the Earl of Athol; and took leave of him with this
                    good wish, <hi rend="italic">Exιrth, fortune, and fill the fetters</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">;</hi> as much as to say, “Go forth, be fortunate, and bring
                    home many captives ;” which the family of Athol has used ever since for its
                    motto. Ross was terrified into submission; obtained his pardon; but was deprived
                    of his earldom, which by act of parliament was then declared unalienably annexed
                    to the crown; at the same time the king restored to him Knapdale and Cantyre,
                    which the earl had resigned; and invested him anew with the lordship of the
                    isles, to hold them of the king by service and relief.</p>
                <p part="N">“Thus the great power of the isles was broken: yet for a considerable
                    time after, the petty chieftains were continually breaking out into small
                    rebellions, or harassed each other in private wars; and tyranny seems but to <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:193641747?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-1747-0204"
                    />have been multiplied. James V. found it necessary to make the voyage of the
                    isles in person in 1536, seized and brought away with him several of the most
                    considerable leaders, and obliged them to find security for their own good
                    behaviour and that of their vassals. The names of these chieftains were
                    (according to Lindesay), <hi rend="italic">Mydyart, Mac-connel, Alac-loyd</hi>
                    of the Lewis, <hi rend="italic">Mac-niel, Mac-lane, Mac-intosh, John Mudyαrt,
                        Mac-hay, Moe-kenzie,</hi> and many others; but, by the names of some of the
                    above, there seem to have been continental as well as insular malecontents. He
                    examined the titles of their holdings; and finding several to have been usurped,
                    reunited their lands to the crown. In the same voyage he had the glory of
                    causing a survey to be taken of the coasts of Scotland, and of the islands, by
                    his pilot Alexander Lindesay; which was published in 1583, at Paris, by Nicholas
                    de Nicholay, geographer to the French monarch.</p>
                <p part="N">“The troubles that succeeded the death of James occasioned a neglect of
                    these insulated parts of the Scottish dominions, and left them in a state of
                    anarchy. In 1614, the Mac-donalds made a formidable insurrection, oppugning the
                    royal grant of Cantyre to the Earl of Argyle and his relations. The petty
                    chieftains continued in a sort of rebellion; and the sword of the greater, as
                    usual in weak governments, was employed against them; the encouragement and
                    protection given by them to pirates employed the power of the Campbells during
                    the reign of James VI. and the beginning of that of Charles I.</p>
                <p part="N">“But the turbulent spirit of the old times continued down till a
                    comparatively late period. The heads of clans were, by the divisions, and a
                    false policy that predominated in Scotland during the reign of William III.
                    flattered with an ideal importance: instead of being treated as bad subjects,
                    they were courted as desirable allies; instead of feeling the hand of power,
                    money was allowed to bribe them into the loyalty of the times. They would have
                    accepted the subsidies, notwithstanding they detested the prince that offered
                    them. They were taught to believe themselves of such consequence, that in these
                    days turned to thcir destruction. Two rebellions gave the legislature a late
                    experience of the folly of permitting the feudal system to exist in any part of
                    its dominions. The act of 1748, for abolishing heritable jurisdictions, at once
                    deprived the chieftains of all power of injuring the public by their
                    commotions.”</p>
