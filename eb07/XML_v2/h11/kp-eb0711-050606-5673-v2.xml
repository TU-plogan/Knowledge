                    in the circle of Freyburg, formerly the capital of the mediatized principality
                    of the same name. It stands on the side of a remarkable mountain, in which are
                    veins of gold, silver, and arsenic. It contains 450 houses, and 3400
                    inhabitants, some employed in the mines, but more in spinning and weaving cotton
                    goods.</p>

                    principality in the ancient division of· Suabia, in Germany. It is surrounded by
                    the kingdom of Wurtemberg, except towards the south, where it is bounded by the
                    principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen. It extends over 120 square miles, and
                    comprehends one town and fourteen parishes, with 14,900 inhabitants. It is
                    generally a hilly country, some of the most lofty points being 2600 feet above
                    the sea. It is moderately fertile, but a part is covered with woods. It is
                    watered by only small brooks, some of which run to the Danube, and others to the
                    Neckar. The revenue amounts to about L. 12,000 annually, and die debt is heavy,
                    which the prince is lessening by contracting the expenditure. The chief products
                    of the land are wood, potatoes, flax, hemp, and more especially gentian. The
                    people find some employment in making wooden toys and articles of household
                    furniture. The military contingent to the German confederation is 145 men.</p>

                    principality in the south of Germany. Except on the north side, where it is
                    bounded by Hohenzollern-Hechingen, it is surrounded by the kingdom of Wurtemberg
                    and the duchy of Baden. It is 400 square miles in extent, and contains four
                    cities, seven market-towns, and seventy villages and hamlets, formed into forty
                    parishes. It contains 7100 houses, and 38,000 inhabitants. The land is
                    mountainous and woody, and the soil mixed with many stones; but the valleys
                    afford good pasture and dairy land, especially on the banks of the rivers. The
                    Danube, here a small stream, receives the waters of all the brooks and rivulets,
                    excepting two, which run to the Neckar. The produce of corn, aided by potatoes,
                    is greater than the consumption; but the excess consists more of winter barley
                    than of wheat. Some portions of the land yield excellent flax. The chief
                    articles to be exchanged for foreign articles are wood, corn, flax, yarn,
                    potashes, and some glass and iron goods. The latter are fabricated from some
                    mines of that metal within the territory. Excepting a few Jews, the inhabitants
                    are all Catholics; and in no part of Germany is education in so backward a
                    state. The revenues of the principality amount to about L.30,000 annually, one
                    third of which arises from the patrimonial estates of the sovereign. There are
                    no military except a small body guard. The contingent to be furnished to the
                    German confederation is 370 men. The capital is Sigmaringen, a fortified town,
                    with 1340 inhabitants.</p>
