                    because the first hanse towns were all situated on the sea-coast; and hence the

                        >Towns.</hi> The Hanseatic society was a league between several maritime
                    cities of Germany, for the protection of their commerce. Bremen and Amsterdam
                    were the first two that formed it; and the trade of these towns experienced such
                    advantage by their fitting out two men of war in each to convoy their ships,
                    that more cities entered into the league. Even kings and princes made treaties
                    with the league, and were often glad of their assistance and protection; by
                    which means they became so powerful both by sea and land, that they raised
                    armies as well as navies, possessed countries in sovereignty, and made peace or
                    war, though always in defence of their trade, as if they had been an united
                    state or commonwealth.</p>
                <p part="N">At this time many cities, though they had no great interest in trade, or
                    intercourse with the ocean, entered into this alliance for the preservation of
                    their liberties; so that in 1200 wc find no less than seventy-two cities in the
                    list of the towns of the Hanse, particularly Bremen, Amsterdam, Antwerp,
                    Rotterdam, Dort, Bruges, Ostend, Dunkirk, Middleburg, Calais, Rouen, Rochelle,
                    Bordeaux, St Malo, Bayonne, Bilboa, Lisbon, Seville, Cadiz, Carthagena,
                    Barcelona, Marseilles, Leghorn, Naples, Messina, London, Lubeck, Rostock,
                    Stralsund, Stettin, Wismar, Königsberg, Dantzig, Elbing, and Marienburg.</p>
                <p part="N">The alliance was now so powerful that their ships of war were often
                    hired by other princes to assist them against their enemies. They not only awed,
                    but often defeated, all that opposed their commerce; and in 1358 they took such
                    revenge on the Danish fleet in the Sound, for having interrupted their commerce,
                    that Waldemar III. king of Denmark, for the sake of peace, gave them up Schonen
                    for sixteen years, by which they commanded the passage of the Sound in their own
                    right. In 1428 they made war on Erick, king of Denmark,"with two hundred and
                    fifty sail, carrying on board 12,000 men. These so ravaged the coast of Jutland,
                    that the king was glad to make peace with them.</p>
                <p part="N">Many privileges were bestowed upon the Hanse Towns by Louis XI., Charles
                    VIII., Louis XH., and Francis I., kings of France, as well as by the emperor
                    Charles V., who had different loans of money from them, and by King Henry HL,
                    who also incorporated them into a trading body, in acknowledgment of money which
                    they had advanced to him, as well as for the good services they did him by their
                    naval forces in 1206.</p>
                <p part="N">These towns exercised a jurisdiction amongst themselves; and for this
                    purpose they were divided into four colleges or provinces, distinguished by the
                    names of their four principal cities, viz. Lubeck, Cologne, Brunswick, and
                    Dantzig, in which were held their courts of judicature. They had a common stock
                    or treasury at Lubeck, and power to call an assembly as often as was necessary.
                    They kept magazines or warehouses for the sale of their merchandises in London,
                    Bruges, Antwerp, Berg in Norway, Revel in Livonia, and Novogorod in Muscovy,
                    which were exported to most parts of Europe, in English, Dutch, and Flemish
                    bottoms. One of their principal magazines was at London, where a society of
                    German merchants was formed, called the Steelyard Company. To this company great
                    privileges were granted by Edward I.; but these were revoked by act of
                    parliament in 1552, in the reign of Edward VI., upon a complaint of the English
                    merchants that this company had so completely engrossed the cloth trade, that in
                    the preceding year they had exported 50,000 pieces, whilst the English had only
                    shipped 1100 pieces. Queen Mary, who ascended the throne the following year,
                    having resolved to marry Philip, son of the emperor Charles V., suspended the
                    execution of the act for three years; but after that term, whether by reason of
                    some new statute, or in pursuance of that of King Edward, the privileges of the
                    company were no longer regarded, and all efforts of the Hanse Towns to recover
                    this loss were unavailing.</p>
                <p part="N">Another accident which contributed to their mortification occurred
                    whilst Queen Elizabeth was at war with the Spaniards. Sir Francis Drake
                    happening to meet sixty ships in the Tagus, loaded with corn belonging to the
                    Hanse Towns, took out all the corn as contraband goods, which they were
                    forbidden to carry by their original patent. The Hanse Towns having complained
                    of this to the diet of the empire, the queen sent an ambassador thither to
                    declare her reasons. The king of Poland likewise interested himself in the
                    affair, because the city of Dantzig was under his protection. At last, though
                    the queen strove hard to preserve the commerce of the English in Germany, the
                    emperor excluded the English company of merchant-adventurers, who bad
                    considerable factories at Stade, Emden, Bremen, Hamburg, and Elbing, from all
                    trade in the empire. In short, the Hanse Towns, particularly in Germany, were
                    not only in so flourishing, but in so formidable a state, from the fourteenth to
                    the sixteenth century, that they gave umbrage to all the neighbouring princes,
                    who threatened a strong confederacy against them, and, as the first step towards
                    this, commanded all the cities within their dominion or jurisdiction to withdraw
                    from the union or Hanse, and have no further concern therein. This immediately
                    separated from them all the cities of England, France, and Italy. The Hanse, on
                    the other hand, prudently put themselves under the protection of the empire; and
                    as the cities just mentioned had withdrawn from them, they withdrew from several
                    more, and made a decree amongst themselves, that none should be admitted into
                    their society but such as stood <pb break="no"

                    limits of the German empire, or were dependent thereon, except Dantzig, which
                    continued a member, though in nowise dependent on the empire. By this means they
                    maintained their confederacy for the protection of trade, without being any more
                    envied by their neighbours; but they were reduced to Lubeck, Bremen, Hamburg,
                    and Dantzig, in the first of which they kept their register, and held assemblies
                    once in three years at least. In the middle of the seventeenth century, Lubeck,
                    Bremen, and Hamburg were all that continued to acknowledge the authority of the
                    league; and even to this day the shadow of its power still exists, these places
                    having been acknowledged in the act for the establishment of the Germanic
                    confederation signed at Vienna on the 8th of June 1815, as free Hanseatic
                    cities.</p>
