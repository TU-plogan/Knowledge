                    hall miles from the former capital. Haddington is a place oi considerable
                    antiquity, but the exact date of its origin is unknown. In records which belong
                    to the twelfth century, it comes into notice as a demesne of David I., who
                    occupied it as his burgh, with a church, a mill, and other apur-tenants of a

                    monarch, came into possession of the town, and was very attentive to its
                    interests, founding here in 1178 a convent of Cistertian nuns, which she endowed
                    with the lands of Clerkington. Other lands, and several churches, likewise
                    belonged to the nuns of this place; but these were of course confiscated at the
                    reformation. There was also a monastery of Franciscan or Grey Friars at
                    Haddington. The choir of the church, which is now in ruins, was anciently called
                    the Lamp of Lothian <hi rend="italic">(^Lucerna</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >LaudonicT)</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> because of its beautiful
                    structure, and from its being kept constantly lighted, and thus rendered visible
                    by night at a considerable distance. Oh the east of what is called the Nungate
                    are the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St Martin. After the death of Ada above
                    mentioned, the town became the property of her son William the Lion, whose son
                    Alexander II. was born here. For some time Haddington seems to have been exempt
                    from the miseries of war; but in 1216 it was burned by king John of England. In
                    1244, and again about two hundred years ago, it suffered a similar fate; but
                    these were accidental occurrences. By the overflowings of the Tyne, it has
                    likewise been repeatedly inundated. So late as 1775, the suburb of the Nungate
                    was overwhelmed, and the whole town was submerged beneath the waters of the
                    river, which had risen to seventeen feet above their ordinary level. Haddington
                    was formerly surrounded by strong walls, which were provided with gates and
                    ports, and also fortified. It was taken possession of by the English after the
                    battle of Pinkie, arid in the year following endured a siege by the Scotch,
                    which makes some figure in history. Little, however, now remains of the ancient
                    defences of this place; and although, as we have said, it was a royal residence,
                    the only relics which tradition points to as those of a palace or castle, are
                    found at a short distance from the western port of Haddington, within the walls,
                    on the site of which the county buildings or court-house was recently erected.
                    The town at present consists of a main or High Street, which stretches in a
                    direction from cast to west, and forms a portion of the road from London to
                    Edinburgh. It is a spacious and handsome street, and possesses some elegant
                    buildings. Parallel to it, on the north, runs the Back Street, having two cross
                    streets at their eastern extremity. The town-house is a respectable fabric,
                    provided with a handsome spire 150 feet in height. Connected with this edifice
                    are the departments used as a jail for the town and county. The town is
                    connected with the ancient suburb of Nungate, by a bridge of four arches thrown
                    over the Tyne. The old Franciscan church is a fine Gothic building, although
                    partly dilapidated. It is 210 feet in length, and is surmounted by a square
                    tower ninety feet in height, and of handsome architecture. Some years ago the
                    chancel, or west end of the cross, was repaired, and now forms a handsome parish
                    church. Haddington, being situated in the midst of a rich and populous
                    agricultural district, serves as the depot of inland trade, and by this means
                    its prosperity has been greatly advanced. The market, which is held on Friday,
                    is a favourite place of resort for the sale and purchase of grain by the East
                    Lothian farmers, and corn-dealers from different quarters. The town possesses no
                    manufactories of any importance, if we except a few tan-works; and there are two
                    distilleries and two breweries; but a number of extensive trades are also
                    carried on. For facilitating business, branches of two banking establishments
                    are here settled. As a royal burgh, the civic government of Haddington is vested
                    in a provost, two merchant-bailies, a trades-bailie, a dean of guild, a
                    treasurer, and twelve councillors. Since the passing of the burgh reform act,
                    the deacons no longer sit as councillors, the distinction between merchant and
                    trades-councillors having ceased to exist. The county courts of the sheriff are
                    held here every Thursday during session time, and a sheriff small debt court
                    every alternate Thursday. There is also a justice of peace court held at various
                    times during the year. Haddington is the seat of a presbytery; and, besides the
                    parish church, there are several chapels and meeting-houses, where dissenting
                    bodies assemble. There is here an excellent academy, under the patronage of the
                    magistrates, a parochial school, and several private educational establishments.
                    There is also a school of arts institution, connected with which is a library,
                    and a collection of philosophical apparatus. Besides a number of benefit and
                    friendly societies, there have been recently established in Haddington The
                    United Agricultural Society of East Lothian, and the East Lothian Horticultural
                    Society. The population of the burgh and parish of Haddington amounted in 1821
                    to 5255, and in 1831 to 5883.</p>
