                    King James he was created a knight of the bath. Being a courtier, he presented
                    to Prince Henry a manuscript, directed chiefly against the married bishops. This
                    production was intended for the private use of the prince; but being afterwards
                    published, it raised a great clamour against the author, who had otherwise
                    incurred suspicion, if not odium, by supporting Raleigh in his suit for the
                    manor of Banwell, belonging to the bishopric of Bath and Wells, on the
                    presumption that the right reverend incumbent had incurred a <hi rend="italic"

                    epigrams, which were the most popular of his works, though possessing little
                    poetical merit, appeared first in 1618, and afterwards in 1625. The <hi

                    was born in January 1611, at Upton in Northamptonshire. After being educated at
                    Oxford, he travelled into Holland, France, Denmark, and Germany, and learned the
                    languages of these countries. Upon his return to England, he was admitted one of
                    the privy chamber extraordinary to King Charles I. He served the king with great
                    fidelity, and made use of his interest with his friends in parliament to procure
                    matters to be accommodated with all parties. The king loved his company, except
                    when the conversation happened to turn upon commonwealths. He found means to see
                    the king at St James’s; and attended him on the scaffold, where, or a little
                    before, he received a token of his majesty’s affection. After the death of King
                    Charles, <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641097?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1097-0154"/>he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Oceana·,</hi> a
                    kind of political romance, in imi∙ <hi rend="superscript"> i</hi> tation of
                    Plato’s Commonwealth, which h <hi rend="subscript"> l</hi> e dedicated tc
                    Cromwell. It is said, that when the latter perused it he declared, that “the
                    gentleman had wrote very well but must not think to cheat him out of his power
                    ant authority; for that what he had won by the sword he would not suffer himself
                    to be scribbled out of.” This work was attacked by several writers, against whom
                    he defended it. Besides his writings to promote republican principles, he
                    instituted a nightly meeting of several ingenious men in the New Palace-Yard,
                    Westminster. This club was called the <hi rend="italic">Pota,</hi> and continued
                    till the secluded members of parliament were restored by General Monk. In 1661,
                    he was committed to the Tower for treasonable designs and practices; and
                    Chancellor Hyde, in a conference with the Lords and Commons, charged him with
                    being concerned in a plot. But a committee of Lords and Commons could make
                    nothing of the alleged plot. He was conveyed to St Nicholas’s Island, and thence
                    to Plymouth, where his imagination became disordered. Having obtained his
                    liberty through the Earl of Bath, he was carried to London, and died in 1677.
                    Besides the above works, he published several others, which were first collected
                    by Toland in 1700, one vol. folio; but a more complete edition was published in
                    1737, by the Reverend Dr Birch.</p>
