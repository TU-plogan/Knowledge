                    of Lyx-as and Dryo, was a native of Halicarnassus, a city of Asia Minor. He was
                    born 484 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. c.</hi> being descended of a family not less
                    distinguished for its love of literature than for its wealth and political
                    influence. His uncle Panyasis was highly esteemed as an epic poet, his writings
                    being regarded by his contemporaries as only second to those of Homer. We are
                    therefore justified in believing that the youthful mind of Herodotus was
                    cultivated with an assiduity which contributed in no small degree to the
                    eminence of his maturer years. (Suidas, ’ Hooδoros and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Hαvυaff∕ς,</hi> Schol. Aristoph. Nab. 331.) The period of history which he
                    selected had nothing of novelty to recommend it; many writers of great celebrity
                    had preceded him, but their high name and reputation, far from discouraging him,
                    served only to excite his emulation and to develope his talents. Xanthus of
                    Lydia, Hecataeus of Miletus, Pherecydes, Acesi-laus, Hellanicus of Lesbos,
                    Charon of Lampsacus, had each treated different parts of his subject with a
                    masterly hand, and it required no small confidence in his own powers to venture
                    on a period of history which had been so nearly exhausted. To enable him to do
                    justice to his subject, he determined to visit those countries the transactions
                    of which he was about to narrate. It is impossible to trace the exact route
                    which he pursued with any degree of precision, or to say with certainty whether
                    he visited Greece and the adjoining isles before he proceeded to the more remote
                    parts of the East. But be this as it may, Egypt was one of the first and most
                    constant objects of his attention and research. This country, which had long
                    been inaccessible to strangers, from the defensive policy of its sovereigns and
                    the inhospitable nature of its inhabitants, had been recently thrown open to the
                    Greeks. Thither Herodotus proceeded; and it is curious to remark, that though
                    many since that period have visited the country, and published the results of
                    their inquiries, no one has given a more exact description, either of the
                    physical appearance of Egypt, or of the manners of its inhabitants, than the
                    father of history. It was not merely to the geography of the country that he
                    directed his attention, but to its productions, its peculiar customs, its
                    strange superstitions, and the history of the princes who reigned immediately
                    before its conquest by the Persians. In his second book we have the fruits of
                    his voyage to Egypt; and it may be still referred to as the purest source for
                    acquiring a minute knowledge of its ancient history and institutions.
                    (Herodotus, ii.)</p>
                <p part="N">From Egypt he must have passed into Libya, for we cannot believe that
                    his accurately detailed account of the whole coast, from the frontiers of Egypt
                    to the remote districts beyond Gibraltar, even as far as the promontory of
                    Solocis, could have been acquired otherwise than by personal examination. It is
                    too minute, and too conformable with what we know of these countries at the
                    present time, to have been collected from the hearsay statements of travellers.

                <p part="N">His visit to Tyre, the splendid city of the Phoenicians, is attested by
                    himself (ii. 44); and he must at the same time have examined the coasts of
                    Palestine, as he mentions having seen the pillar, and the disgraceful emblem
                    engraved on it, intended by Sesostris to commemorate his victory, about 1350 <hi

                    east as Babylon, and the rich plains of Assyria: yet if he had not been on the
                    spot, he could scarcely have delineated with such minuteness the topography of
                    that mighty city. Besides, in recording the existence of the temple of Jupiter
                    Belus, he adds that he did not see the celebrated golden statue which had
                    adorned its shrine, because Xerxes had carried it elsewhere (i. 181). We may
                    add, that his frequent intercourse with the Chaldaeans, and the conversations he
                    held with them, could scarcely have taken place in any part of the world beyond
                    the confines of Assyria.</p>
                <p part="N">Colchis, as the theatre of an adventure depicted in all the glowing
                    colours with which the creative genius of the poets could adorn it, was a
                    natural object of curiosity. He traversed its rugged coast; and finding himself
                    in the vicinity of the wandering Scythians, he penetrated into their wild and
                    desolate solitude as far as the commercial speculations of the Greeks had
                    reached (iv. 81). The country of the Getae, Thrace, Macedon, and Epirus, were
                    each in their turn examined; but Greece was the chief object of his labours; and
                    though we are unable to specify the time when he first visited it, he no doubt
                    did so before his work was begun.</p>
                <p part="N">On his return to his native city, he found its government usurped by the
                    tyrant Lygdamis ∙. his uncle Panyasis was soon afterwards put to death: and he
                    himself becoming an object of suspicion, retired to the island of Samos. Here
                    probably he composed his history, in the soft Ionic dialect, preferring it to
                    the harsher sounds of his native Doric. Yet, amidst the pursuits of literature,
                    he did not forget the claims of the city which gave him birth. He organized a
                    conspiracy by which Lygdamis was expelled; but the tyranny of the aristocracy
                    which succeeded proved even more hateful to the citizens than that from which
                    they had been delivered. They probably ascribed to Herodotus the crimes of his
                    associates, which he had no power to avert; and, disgusted with the ingratitude
                    of his fellowcitizens, the historian left for ever the shores of Caria, and
                    proceeded to Greece. (Lucian <hi rend="italic">in Herod,</hi> iv. p. 116.)</p>
                <p part="N">He arrived at the beginning of the eighty-first Olympiad (456 A.c.),and
                    found a vast concourse of people assembled to celebrate the games at Olympia. He
                    was unknown to all; but, ambitious of fame, he invited an audience to come and
                    hear him recite a portion of his history; and as he no doubt selected the parts
                    most likely to flatter the pride and to excite the enthusiasm of his
                    compatriots, his success was complete, the acclamations with which he was
                    received were overwhelming, and from that moment he was considered one of the
                    first men of his age. It is supposed that it was at this recitation that
                    Thucydides, then in his fifteenth year, shed tears of emulation when he saw the
                    honours showered on the head of the historian. Herodotus foretold to the father
                    the future fame of his son, and the sanction of posterity has verified the
                    prediction. (Suid.; Marcellii <hi rend="italic">Vit.</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Thucyd.</hi> p. 32.) Of the next twelve years, we can only conjecture that
                    he spent them in Greece, and that he employed them in travelling leisurely over
                    the country, examining with attention the archives of different people,
                    verifying on original monuments the genealogies of the most illustrious
                    families, and collecting the local traditions of great events at their source.
                    It is said he was in the habit of reading to the different states the portions
                    of history which more particularly referred to them, and was thus able to
                    correct any error into which he might have fallen. At Athens, at the festival of
                    Panathenaea, 446 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. c.,</hi> he again recited a portion of
                    his history, and received from the hands of that discerning people a donation of
                    ten talents. (Eusb. <hi rend="italic">Chron.</hi> p. 104.) In 444 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a. c.</hi> Athens was preparing to send a colony to
                    Thurium, and Herodotus determined to accompany it as a volunteer. Here he must
                    have spent the remainder of his life in dignified repose, employing his time in
                    retouching his history, and rendering the style still more harmonious. The
                    period of his death is uncertain; but from a fact which he records, and which we
                    know to have happened 408 <hi rend="smallcaps">a. c.</hi> he must have been
                    employed in his history till that time. (Herodot. i. 130; iii. 15.)</p>
                <p part="N">The work is contained in nine books, each dedicated to one of the muses;
                    but whether this was done by himself or by posterity we are unable to decide. To
                    it we are indebted for our knowledge of the origin and progress of the Persian
                    monarchy; of that of the Medes and Assyrians which preceded it; the origin of
                    the kingdom of Lydia, its destruction by Cyrus the elder, and the numerous
                    expeditions of that monarch; the conquest of Egypt by Cambyses, with a minute
                    description of that country; the various wars in which the successors of Cyrus
                    were engaged, and particularly the expedition of Darius against the Scythians,
                    where he takes an opportunity of introducing an account of that people in the
                    north of Europe and Asia. Then follows his narrative of the Persian expedition
                    against the Greeks, and their noble struggle against the overwhelming power of
                    that monarchy. This narrative breaks off at the siege of Sestos, 478 <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">a.</hi> c.; and though he alludes to events that happened
                    seventy years later, he does not seem to have continued his history further.
                    (Diodor. xi. 37.) Some have ascribed to him a life of FIomer, which is generally
                    bound up with his work; but there are strong reasons for believing that it is
                    the composition of a later age. He seems also to allude to a work on Assyria <hi
                        rend="italic">(As-syriaca),</hi> i. 184; but as no notice is taken of it by
                    subsequent writers, it was probably never executed.</p>
