                    in Asia Minor. The exact period of his birth and death is unknown, but the
                    active part he took in the affairs of his country proves that he flourished
                    about 500 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> at a time when the Ionians were
                    attempting to throw off’ the yoke of the Persians, who were then governed by
                    Darius. He was the son of Hegesandrus (Suid.), and descended of a noble family.
                    Like Herodotus, whom he preceded only by a few years, he visited many countries,
                    and, making himself acquainted with the peculiarities of their customs, and the
                    history of different nations, he wrote numerous works on these subjects.
                    (Herodot· ii. 143.) We find Hecataeus present at the deliberations of the
                    Ionians, 501 <hi rend="smallcaps">b. c.,</hi> before they revolted against
                    Darius, when he pointed out to his countrymen the folly of their intended
                    proceedings. War, however, was resolved on at all hazards, and Hecataeus then
                    recommended that they should devote their attention to secure maritime
                    supremacy. This advice was also neglected; and, 497 <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >b.c.,</hi> Aristagoras, who headed the war faction, was obliged to fly,
                    being a slιort time afterwards slain in Thrace (v. 36, 125). Hecataeus was one
                    of the earliest writers in prose, and is said by Porphyry to have furnished
                    materials for the history of Herodotus. His works were divided into three
                    classes; histories, genealogies, and geographical pieces. The fragments, which
                    are numerous, have been collected by Creuzer, <hi rend="italic">Historicorum

                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Hecataeus,</hi> a native of Abdera, in Thrace, who
                    was a contemporary of Alexander the Great, and lived at the court of Ptolemy,
                    son of Lagus king of Egypt <hi rend="smallcaps">(b. c.</hi> 323- 283). He had
                    there an opportunity of becoming acquainted with the Jewish nation; for, after
                    the battle of Gaza, where Ptolemy defeated Demetrius Poliorcetes, the whole of
                    Palestine came into the possession of the king of Egypt; and a large body of
                    Jews, charmed by the humanity and moderation of Ptolemy, went along with him
                    into Egypt, and, amongst others, the high-priest Hezekiah. From him it would
                    appear that Hecataeus received such minute information respecting the customs
                    and habits of his countrymen, that he was induced to write a detailed history of
                    the Jews. Both Josephus (Ap. i. 22, ii. 4) and Eusebius have preserved passages
                    which are of great value, as confirming the accounts which we have elsewhere
                    received of that people. In this work he described the nature and position of
                    the country of Palestine, and gave an account of their fastnesses, Jerusalem,
                    the temple, with the remarkable customs of the people and priests. In later
                    times it has become a matter of dispute whether we ought to consider this work
                    as the genuine production σf Hecataeus. Scaliger regarded it as spurious,
                    following the opinion of Herennius Philo, as quoted by Origen <hi rend="italic"
                        >{Contr. Cels.</hi> lib. i∙); but we think that Sainte Croix <hi
                        rend="italic">{Exam. Grit, des Hist, d</hi> ’ <hi rend="italic"
                        >Alexandre,</hi> p. 558) has completely proved that it is the work of the
                    author whose name it bears. (See <hi rend="italic">Hecataei</hi><hi
