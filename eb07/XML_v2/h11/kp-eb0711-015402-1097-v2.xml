                    English gentleman distinguished by his writings on the subject of grammar, was
                    born on the 20th of July 1709. He received his early educational Salisbury,
                    whence he was removed to Oxford at the age of sixteen; and having passed the
                    usual number of years as a gentleman commoner of W <hi rend="superscript">
                        r</hi> adham College, he was entered at Lincoln’s Inn as a student of law,
                    though not intended for the bar. When he had attained his twentyfourth year, his
                    father died; and this event having at once freed him from all control, and
                    placed him in the possession of an independent fortune, enabled him to exchange
                    the study of law for other pursuits more congenial to his taste. The decided
                    bent of his mind had always been towards the Greek and Latin classics, which he
                    preferred to every other kind of reading; and to the study of these authors he
                    now applied himself with unremitting assiduity during a period of fourteen or
                    fifteen years. The first fruit of this lengthened course of application was a
                    volume which he published in 1744, containing three treatises; one on art,
                    another on music, painting, and poetry, and a third on happiness. These
                    treatises are illustrated with a variety of learned notes and observations; and
                    one of them, that upon art, has been commended by Lord Monboddo as
                    containing“the best specimen of the dividing or diaeretic manner, as the
                    ancients called it, that is to be found in any modern book.” But the work by
                    which he is best known is his <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> a philosophical
                    inquiry concerning universal grammar, which appeared in 1751,8vo. “Those who
                    would enter deeply into the subject” (of universal grammar), says Dr Lowth,
                    “will find it fully and accurately handled, with the greatest acuteness of
                    investigation, perspicuity of application, and elegance of method, in a treatise
                    entitled <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> by James Harris, Esq.; the most
                    beautiful example of analysis that has been exhibited since the days of
                    Aristotle.” To this culogium, however, the philosophical grammarians of the
                    present time are not by any means disposed to subscribe. Without questioning the
                    learning displayed in the <hi rend="italic">Hermes,</hi> we may venture to
                    affirm, that the arrangement of the parts of speech into substantives,
                    attributives, definitives, and connectives, is entirely arbitrary; that nothing
                    whatever is gained by this departure from the ordinary classification, excepting
                    perhaps to impart to the work an appearance of originality, which, upon
                    examination, will be found to vanish; that, though professing to treat the
                    subject of grammar in a philosophical manner, Mr Harris is in reality the slave
                    of authority; and that there is no quality for which his work is less
                    distinguished than that rigid analysis which Bishop Lowth has somewhat hastily
                    given him credit for. This, we think, has been fully established in the article
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Grammar</hi> of the present work, to which accordingly
                    the reader is referred for more ample information. Mr Harris’s attention seems
                    to have been first directed to this subject by the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Minerva</hi> of Sanctius, to which he has confessed himself indebted for
                    much valuable information; but it is somewhat remarkable, that with the treatise
                    of Apollonius <hi rend="italic">{De</hi><hi rend="italic">Constructione
                        Orationis)</hi> also before him, he should not have avoided the narrow and
                    confined views which he has adopted on particular points, or should have missed
                    principles which would have served to guide him through the intricacies in which
                    he is frequently entangled. Mr Harris’s other productions are, Philosophical
                    Arrangements, published in <pb break="no" facs="nls:193641110?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-1110-0155"/>1775, being part of a larger work which he had
                    meditated, but did not complete, on the peripatetic logic; and Phi- • lological
                    Inquiries, printed in 1780, but not published till 1781, containing not so much
                    a regular system, as a summary of the conclusions to which the philosophy of the
                    ancients had conducted them in their critical inquiries. After having been quite
                    exhausted by illness, Mr Harris expired on the 22d of December 1780, in the
                    seventy-second year of his age. In 1801, his son Lord Malmesbury published an
                    edition of his works in two volumes quarto; prefixed to which is a biographical
                    sketch of the author from the pen of the editor. <hi rend="smallcaps"
                        >(a.)</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Harris,</hi> a district of the Hebrides,
                    forming, with the larger district of Lewis, one considerable island. In one part
                    it is divided into nearly two parts by the approximation of West Loch Tarbet and
                    East Loch Tarbet, which leave only a neck of land of about half a mile in
                    breadth. At the head of the former is situated the solitary village of Tarbet
                    Harris is about twenty miles in length, by eleven in breadth in the northern
                    part, and from six to seven in the southern. It is bleak, rocky, and
                    unproductive. On the shores, however, there are small patches of cultivated
                    land; the rearing of cows and black cattle further tends to support the
                    inhabitants; but until the duty on barilla was lowered, their chief source of
                    profit was the manufacture of kelp. This, however, is now considerably reduced.
                    Harris is an independent parish in the presbytery of Wick, and its kirk-town and
                    capital is Rowadill or Rowdill, a small village at the south-east corner of the
                    island. The population amounted in 1821 to 3909, and in 1831 to 3900.</p>
