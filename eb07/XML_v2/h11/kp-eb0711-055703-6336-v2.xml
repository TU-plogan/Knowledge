                        >Liberata</hi> of Tasso, was the son of Samuel Hoole, watchmaker, London,
                    and born at Moorfields in 1727. Having receiv-. ed some elementary instruction
                    from his uncle, a tailor in Grub Street, he was sent to a private school in
                    Hertfordshire, kept by Bennet, the publisher of Roger Ascham’s works, where he
                    acquired a knowledge of the Latin and French languages, and some smattering of
                    Greek. It was the wish of the father to bring up his son to his own trade of
                    watchmaker, in which he had met with considerable success; but the
                    shortsightedness of young Hoole proving an insuperable objection, he was, at the
                    age of seventeen, placed as a clerk in the accountant’s department in the East
                    India House. About this time, having accompanied to the theatre his father, who
                    had access behind the scenes, he contracted a fondness for the stage, which, if
                    indulged, might have proved fatal to him, seeing he was entirely devoid of
                    histrionic talents; but his attention having been diverted from this pursuit, he
                    employed his leisure in improving himself in Latin, and in learning Italian,
                    which he studied with the view of being able to read in the original the <hi
                        rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi rend="italic">Furioso</hi> of Ariosto, of
                    which, while a boy, he had become enamoured in the translation of Sir John
                    Harrington. From admiring he soon proceeded to translate his favourite
                    production; but after having made some progress in his task, he laid it aside
                    for a time, in order to execute a translation of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Gierusalemnιe</hi><hi rend="italic">Liberata,</hi> which, accordingly, he
                    commenced in 1758. ∙ In 1761 he printed ?ı specimen, which appears to have met
                    the approbation of his friends; for the whole was published in 1763, with a
                    dedication to the queen, written by Dr Johnson. This translation is
                    distinguished for cold correctness and elaborate elegance; but, in the
                    transfusion, the essential spirit of poetry has in a great measure evaporated,
                    leaving a residuum, the general character of which is insipidity. In 1773 Hoole
                    published the first volume of his <hi rend="italic">Orlando</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">Furioso,</hi> which was favourably received by the public; but
                    the further prosecution of the translation was interrupted by his receiving an
                    appointment as auditor of accounts to the East India Company, an office which
                    occupied much of his time and attention; nor did the whole make its
                        appearance<pb break="no" facs="nls:193646349?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-6349-0558"/> until 1783, when it was published in five
                    vols. 8vo. In 1785 he wrote the life of his friend Mr Scott, the poet of Amwell,
                    with whom he had become acquainted in 1757; in 1791 he published the Orlando
                    reduced to twenty-four books, in two vols.8vo; and, in 1792, he gave to the
                    English public Tasso’s juvenile production, <hi rend="italic">Rinaldo.</hi> He
                    also published, in three vols. 8vo, the dramas and other poems of Metastasio,
                    his versions of which display more spirit and variety than his translations of
                    Tasso and Ariosto, of which the chief characteristic is an uniform and
                    monotonous smoothness of versification. He was also the author of several
                    dramas, namely, <hi rend="italic">Cyrus,</hi> which appeared in 1768, <hi
                        rend="italic">Timanťhes</hi> in 1770, and <hi rend="italic">Cleonice</hi> in
                    1775; but none of these had any success on the stage. Mr Hoole lived in habits
                    of intimacy with Dr Johnson, whom he attended in his last illness; and died at
                    Dorking on the 2d of August 1803, in the seventy-sixth year of his age. In his
                    private character he was amiable and estimable; but though a man of taste and a
                    good scholar, he had not the slightest pretension to poetical genius, though,
                    from long practice, he had acquired considerable skill in the mechanical
                    construction of verse. He had no kindred sympathies with the <hi rend="italic"
                        >mens</hi><hi rend="italic">divinior</hi> of true poetry, and in his hands,
                    accordingly, its finer spirit generally escaped, <hi rend="smallcaps"
