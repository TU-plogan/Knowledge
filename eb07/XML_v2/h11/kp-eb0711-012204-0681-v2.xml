                    Normandy in 1624, was the son of an advocate esteemed for his knowledge,
                    probity, and conciliating spirit. He commenced his studies at Caen, and
                    completed them at Paris. His progress in philosophy was rapid, and at eighteen
                    he wrote a treatise, in which he explained the <hi rend="italic">Spherics</hi>
                    of Theodosius, to which was added a tract upon Trigonometry, designed as an
                    introduction to astronomy. Natural philosophy, as then taught, was only a

                    questions; but Duhamel undertook to establish it upon right principles, and with
                    this view published his <hi rend="italic">Astronomia Physica.</hi> In 1666
                    Colbert having proposed to Louis XIV. a scheme, which was approved of by his
                    majesty, for establishing a Royal Academy of Sciences, Duhamel was appointed
                    perpetual secretary; a situation for which he was eminently qualified, both by
                    his acquirements and by his talent for managing the different parties into which
                    that learned society was divided. Besides, he wrote in Latin with remarkable
                    purity and elegance (a great advantage at a period when the French had not
                    become an European language); and, by reason of this accomplishment, he
                    accompanied Colbert first to the congress of Aix-la-Chapelle, and afterwards to
                    England, when his patron proceeded to that country in the capacity of French
                    ambassador. He subsequently visited Holland, and then returned to France, where,
                    between 1670 and 1673, he gave to the world the results of his observations, in
                    three publications. His next production was a course of philosophy, which he
                    composed for the use of the students in the College of Burgundy; a work in
                    which, if he did not exclude the ancient systems, the weakness and absurdity of
                    which already began to be perceived, he at least combated their grosser errors,
                    and succeeded in recommending new truths, without in any degree involving
                    himself in trouble by doing so. He then published a course of theology, which
                    met with great success, and of which he was required to execute an abridgment
                    for the use of the schools. But all his labours did not prevent him from
                    assiduously attending the sittings of the Academy, of which he was preparing a
                    history: his zeal enabled him to surmount all difficulties; even the very
                    infirmities which announced his approaching dissolution could not abate his
                    ardour for study; and he was still meditating new undertakings, when death
