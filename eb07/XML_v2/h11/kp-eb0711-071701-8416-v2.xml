                        <hi rend="italic">Law,</hi> the pursuit of a person who has committed felony
                    on the highway. Of this custom, which is of British origin, the following
                    deduction is given by Mr Whitaker. “When it was requisite for the Britons to
                    call out their warriors into the field, they used a method that was particularly
                    marked by its expeditiousness and decisiveness, and remains partially among us
                    to this moment. They raised a cry, which was immediately caught by others, and
                    in an instant transmitted from mouth to mouth through all the region. And, as
                    the notice passed along, the warriors snatched their arms, and hurried away to
                    the rendezvous. We have a remarkable description of the fact in Caesar, and
                    there see the alarm propagated in sixteen or seventeen hours through a hundred
                    and sixty miles in a line. And the same practice has been retained by the
                    Highlanders almost till our own time. When the lord of a clan received
                    intelligence of an enemy’s approach, he immediately killed a goat with his own
                    sword, dipped the end of a half-burnt stick in the blood, and then gave it and
                    the notice of the rendezvous to be carried to the next hamlet. This was called
                    the cross-tarric, or fiery cross. It symbolically threatened fire and sword to
                    all his followers that did not instantly repair to the rendezvous. The notice
                    was despatched from hamlet to hamlet with the utmost expedition, and in three or
                    four hours the whole clan was in arms, and assembled at the place appointed.
                    This was the ordinary mode by which the chieftains assembled their followers for
                    war. The first person who received the notice set out with it at full speed,
                    delivered it to the next he met, who instantly set out with the same speed, and
                    handed it to a third. In the rebellion of 1745 it was sent by an unknown hand
                    through the region of Breadalbane; and flying as expeditiously as the Gallic
                    signal in Caesar, traversed a tract of thirty-two miles in three hours. This
                    quick method of giving a diffusive alarm is even preserved among ourselves to
                    the present day; but is applied, as it seems from Caesar’s account above to have
                    been equally applied among the Celtae, to the better purposes of civil polity.
                    The <hi rend="italic">hutesium and clamour</hi> of our laws, and the <hi
                        rend="italic">hue and cry</hi> of our own times, is a well-known and
                    powerful process for spreading the notice and continuing the pursuit of any
                    fugitive felons. The cry, like the clamour of the Gauls or the summons of the
                    Highlanders, is taken from town to town and from county to county; and a chain
                    of communication is speedily carried from one end of the kingdom to the
                    other.”</p>
