                <p part="N">He soon afterwards connected himself as a partner in Mr Dingley’s house
                    in St Petersburg, where he arrived on the 10th of June 1743. The trade of the
                    English nation by the Caspian Sea to Persia had at this period been intrusted to
                    the care of Mr Elton, who, not content with the pursuit of commercial affairs,
                    had injudiciously engaged in the service of Nadir Shah, to build ships on the
                    Caspian after the European manner. This had alarmed the merchants engaged in the
                    Russian trade, and a resolution was formed that one of their body should make a
                    journey into Persia. On this occasion Mr Hanway offered his service, and was
                    accepted. He set out on the 10th of September, and, after experiencing a great
                    variety of hazards in that kingdom during the course of twelve months, returned
                    to St Petersburg on the first of January 1745, without hav ing been able to
                    establish the intended trade by the Caspian, partly through the jealousy of the
                    Russian court on account of Elton’s connections with the Persians, and partly
                    from the troubles and revolutions by which the' latter kingdom was
                    distracted.</p>
                <p part="N">He now settled at St Petersburg, where he remained five years. During
                    this time he interested himself greatly in the concerns of the merchants who had
                    engaged in the Caspian trade; but the independence he had acquired having
                    excited a desire to revisit his native country, he left St Petersburg on the 9th
                    of July 1750. In 1753 he published an Historical Account of the British Trade by
                    the Caspian Sea, with a Journal of Travels from London through Russia into
                    Persia, and back again through Russia, Germany, and Holland; a work which was
                    received with great attention by the public. In 1754, we find Mr Hanway
                    commending a plan offered for the advantage of λVestminstcr, and suggesting
                    hints for the further improvement of it, in a letter to Mr John Spranger on his
                    excellent proposal for paving, cleansing, and lighting the streets of
                    Westminster, 8vo. A few years afterwards, when a scheme of the same kind was
                    carried into effect, many of Mr Hanway’s ideas, thrown out in this pamphlet,
                    were adopted. In 1756, he printed a Journal of Eight Days’Journey from
                    Portsmouth to Kings ton-upon-Thames, with an Essay upon Tea, which was
                    afterwards reprinted in two volumes 8vo, 1757.</p>
                <p part="N">At this juncture, Great Britain being on the eve of a war with France,
                    Hanway published Thoughts on the Duty of a good Citizen with regard to War and
                    Invasion, in a Letter from a Citizen to his Friend, 8vo. About the same time,
                    several gentlemen formed a plan which was matured and perfected by the assiduity
                    of Hanway, for providing the navy with sailors, by furnishing poor children with
                    necessaries to equip them for the service of the country. The success and
                    propriety of this scheme soon became apparent. Mr Hanway wrote and published
                    three pamphlets on the occasion; and the treasurer of the society, accompanied
                    by Mr Hanway, having waited on the king, the society received L.1000 from his
                    majesty, L.400 from the prince of Wales, and L.200 from the princess dowager.
                    This excellent institution was through life the favourite object of Mr Hanway’s
                    care, and it continued to flourish under his auspices, greatly to the advantage
                    of the community. In 1758 he became an advocate for another charitable
                    institution, which derived considerable emolument from his patronage. This was
                    the Magdalen Charity, to assist which he published a Letter to Robert Dingley,
                    Esq. containing a Proposal for the Relief and Employment of friendless Girls and
                    repenting Prostitutes, 4to. He also printed other small performances on the same
                    subject.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1759, Mr Hanway wrote Reasons for an Augmentation of at least Twelve
                    Thousand Mariners to be employed in the Merchants’ Service and Coasting Trade,
                    4to. The next year he published several productions, viz. 1. A candid historical
                    Account of the Hospital for the reception of exposed and deserted young
                    Children, 8vo; 2. An Account of the Society for the Encouragement of the British
                    Troops in Germany and North America, 8vo; 3. Eight Letters to Duke of , on the
                    Custom of Vails giving in England, 8vo. In 1761, he produced Reflections,
                    Essays, and Meditations on Life and Religion, with a collection of Proverbs, and
                    eighteen Letters written occasionally on several subjects, in 2 vols. 8vo.</p>
                <p part="N">In July 1762, he was appointed one of the commissioners for victualling
                    the navy; a post which he held above twenty-one years. His attention having been
                    particularly directed towards alleviating the miseries of young
                    chimney-sweepers, he published, in 1773, the State of the Chimney-sweepers’
                    Young Apprentices, showing the <pb break="no" facs="nls:193640941?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0711-0941-0142"/>wretched condition of these distressed boys,
                    the ill conduct of such masters as do not observe the obligation of Indentures,
                    and the necessity of a strict inquiry in order to support the civil and
                    religious rights of these apprentices, 12mo. In the succeeding year, 1774, he
                    enlarged a former publication, entitled Advice from a Farmer to his Daughter,
                    and republished it under the title of Virtue in Humble Life, containing
                    Reflections on the Reciprocal Duties of the Wealthy and Indigent, the Master and
                    the Servant, 2 vols. 8vo. This edition being sold, in a few months he reprinted
                    it in two'quarto volumes, with a dedication to Mrs Montagu.</p>
                <p part="N">In 1783, finding his hea!th decline, he determined to resign his office
                    at the victualling board, which he did on the 2d of October that year; and
                    immediately received a grant of his whole salary by way of pension during his
                    life. In the summer of 1786 Mr Hanway’s health declined visibly. He had long
                    felt the approach of a disorder in the bladder, which, increasing by degrees,
                    caused a strangury, and at length, on the 5th of September 1786, put a period to
                    a life spent almost entirely in the service of his fellow-creatures. On the 13th
                    he was interred in -the family-vault at Hanwell, being attended to the grave by
                    a numerous retinue of friends; and after his death the public regard for his
                    virtues was displayed by a subscription of several hundred pounds for erecting a
                    monument to perpetuate his memory.</p>
