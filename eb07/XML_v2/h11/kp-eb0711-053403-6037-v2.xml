                    Lord Chief-Justice of the Court of King’s Bench in the reign of King William,
                    eldest son of Sir Thomas Holt, serjeant-at-law, was born at Thame, Oxfordshire,
                    in 1642. He entered himself at Gray’s Inn in 1658, and applied to the common law
                    with so much industry that he soon became an eminent barrister. In the reign of
                    James II. he was made recorder of London, an office which he discharged with
                    much approbation for about a year and a half; but he lost his place by refusing
                    to expound the law suitably to the king’s designs. On the arrival of the Prince
                    of Orange he was chosen a member of the Convention Parliament, which afforded an
                    opportunity of displaying his abilities; and as soon as the government was
                    settled, he was made Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench and a privy
                    counsellor. In 1700, when Lord Somers resigned the great seal, King William
                    pressed Chief-Justice Holt to accept of it; but he replied that he never had in
                    his life but one chancery cause, which he lost, and that consequently he could
                    not think himself qualified for so great a trust. He continued as chief justice
                    for twenty-two years, during which time he obtained great reputation for
                    steadiness, integrity, and thorough knowledge in his profession. Upon great
                    occasions he asserted the law with intrepidity, though he thereby ventured to
                    incur by turns the indignation of both houses of parliament. Holt was a perfect
                    master of the common law, and as his judgment was sound, his capacity great, and
                    his understanding clear, so he possessed a firmness of mind, and a vigour of
                    resolution, which nothing could overcome when he found himself called upon to
                    assert the authority of the law, and to vindicate the purity of justice. Several
                    causes of the utmost importance, as affecting the lives, rights, liberties, and
                    property of the people, came in judgment before him, and his decisions were all
                    marked by the same high qualities. His definitions<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:193646050?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0711-6050-0535"/> were
                    remarkable for clearness and perspicuity; his arguments displayed equal powers
                    of analysis and arrangement; and he possessed the invaluable faculty of
                    rendering perceptible and obvious the natural differences of things, at the same
                    time that he discriminated, with the nicest tact, between real and fanciful
                    resemblances. His great secret consisted in the rigid and scrupulous adjustment
                    of his premises; and hence he seldom erred in his conclusions. His arguments
                    were instructive and convincing, whilst his integrity shrunk from any
                    accommodation of judicial opinion to existing interests or prejudices. His
                    decisions are, most of them, faithfully and judiciously reported by
                    Chief-Justice Raymond, himself an eminent lawyer; and his integrity and
                    uprightness as a judge are celebrated by the author of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tatter</hi> (No. 14), under the character of Verus the magistrate. The
                    following reports were published by him, in 1708, folio, with notes: “A Report
                    of divers Cases in Pleas of the Crown, adjudged and determined in the reign of
                    King Charles II. with directions for justices of the peace and others, collected
                    by Sir John Keyling, knight, Lord Chief Justice of the Court of King’s Bench,
                    from the original manuscript under his hand; to which is added, the Report of
                    three modern cases, viz. Armstrong and Lisle, the King and Plumer, the Queen and
                    Mawgridge.” A pretended second edition appeared in 1739, but the title only was
                    new.</p>
