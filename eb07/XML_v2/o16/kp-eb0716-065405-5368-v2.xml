                    one of the gods of ancient Egypt, and by many believed to have been the Sun, or
                    at least the mind actuating that luminary.</p>
                <p part="N">The Egyptians derived all things from two principles; one active, and
                    the other passive. Their active principle, according to Jablonski, was an
                    infinite and eternal Spirit; and their passive principle was Night. This spirit
                    they considered sometimes as a male, sometimes as a female divinity, and
                    occasionally they attributed to it both sexes; but it does not appear to have
                    been the object of their worship. The earliest objects of Pagan adoration were
                    the sun, moon, and planets; and that the philosophers and priests of ancient
                    Egypt worshipped the Sun by the name of Osiris, may be proved by numberless
                    testimonies from the most authentic records of antiquity. Diogenes Laertius
                    affirms, that they held the Sun and Moon as divinities, and that they called the
                    latter Isis; and Macrobius says expressly, “Nec in occulto est, neque aliud esse
                    Osirin quam Solem, nec Isim aliud esse quam Terram.” The same writer informs us,
                    that in the hieroglyphical writings of ancient Egypt, “Osiris was represented by
                    a sceptre and an eye,” to denote that this god was the Sun looking down from
                    heaven on all things upon earth. In the hieroglyphical inscriptions the symbol
                    of Osiris is an eye surmounting a chair or throne.</p>
                <p part="N">It must not, however, be concealed, that some of the ancients, and a few
                    of the most learned of the moderns, have contended, that by Osiris the Egyptians
                    understood the Nile or spirit of the Nile, whilst others have confounded him
                    with the Grecian Bacchus. Scaliger and Selden have adopted the former of these
                    opinions, and Servius on Virgil has given countenance to the latter. But that
                    they are all mistaken has been proved by Jablonski in such a manner as to
                    enforce the fullest conviction. « When the Egyptians,” says he, “in their sacred
                    books, sometimes gave the name of Osiris to the Nile and its wonderful increase
                    during the heat of summer, they meant nothing more than to attribute to their
                    god Osiris the gift which fertilizes their country.” This they would the more
                    readily have done, because they believed the Nile to have its source in heaven.
                    Hence Eusebius tells us, <hi rend="italic">O∙&gt;ιyς εστιν</hi> ó Νί/λο;, <hi
                        rend="italic">ον iξ ουξανου</hi><hi rend="italic">καταφεξεσάαι</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">οιoνται, Osiris is the Nile, because they think it is sent
                        down from heaven.</hi> In one sense Osiris might be Bacchus, because the
                    original Bacchus was himself the Sun; but that the Egyptian god could not be
                    worshipped as the inventor of wine is undeniable, iζ as Jablonski labours to
                    prove, the primitive religion of that country inculcated upon its votaries that
                    wine was the gift, not of a benevolent god, but of an evil genius, the enemy of
                    the human race. In support of this opinion he quotes from Plutarch a passage,
                    whence it appears, that, before the era of Psammetichus, the Egyptians neither
                    drank wine themselves, nor offered it in libations to the gods; because they
                    believed that the first vine which sprung from the earth was impregnated by the
                    blood of those giants who perished in the war with the gods. It is indeed true,
                    that the Greeks, who borrowed their religion as well as the first principles of
                    their science from Egypt, attributed to Bacchus many of the actions of Osiris;
                    but it is likewise true, that they ascribed to him other attributes, which the
                    Egyptian god could not possess, consistently with the established superstitions
                    of that country. Salmasius, however, attempts to prove, from the import of the
                    name, that the Osiris of Egypt must have been the Bacchus of Greece, <hi
                        rend="italic">^∑ηζ,</hi> or ∑∕g∕, he says, signifies <hi rend="italic">a
                        son</hi> in the Egyptian language; and hence he concludes that the god was
                    called Osiris by the Egyptians, for the same reason that by the Greeks he was
                    called <hi rend="italic">Kουξος,</hi> and by the Romans <hi rend="italic"
                        >Liber.</hi> But this seems to be all a mistake. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Siτis</hi> forms a part of many Egyptian proper names, as <hi rend="italic"
                        >Bu∙siris, Thermo∙siris, Tapo∙siris,</hi> and the like, and is by some
                    derived from the Hebrew word <hi rend="italic">Sar,</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >Sur,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sir,</hi> which signifies a prince,
                    potentate, or grandee. As the name of the god was in Egypt not Osiris, but <hi
                        rend="italic">Isiris,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Ysiris,</hi> it was probably
                    composed of <hi rend="italic">Sir</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Siris,</hi> and the
                    Hebrew prefix <hi rend="italic">I</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ish,</hi> denoting
                    strength; so that the whole word would signify the strong or mighty prince. And
                    if so, we cannot doubt, as Diodorus Siculus, Eusebius, Sextus Empiricus, and
                    others affirm, that the Egyptians worshipped the Sun by the name of Osiris, but
                    that by this name they meant the power or governing mind of the Sun, as the
                    Greeks and Romans seem to have done by their Phoebus and Apollo.</p>
                <p part="N">But although-the original Osiris was undoubtedly the Sun, or the
                    intelligence actuating the Sun, yet there is reason to believe that there was a
                    secondary Osiris, who at a very early period reigned in Egypt, and was deified
                    after his death, for the benefits which he had rendered to his country. This is
                    indeed so generally admitted, that amongst the learned great controversies have
                    arisen respecting the time when he flourished, and whether he was the civilizer
                    of rude barbarians or the victorious sovereign of a polished nation. Newton, it
                    is well known, has adopted the latter opinion, and with much plausibility
                    endeavoured to prove that Osiris was the same with Sesostris or Sesak; but it
                    must be confessed that his conclusion is contrary to all the most authentic
                    records of antiquity, and that it would be easy, by the same mode of arguing, to
                    give a show of identity to two persons universally known to have flourished in
                    very distant ages. The annals of Egypt, as may be seen in the writings of
                    Herodotus, Diodorus Siculus, Strabo, Plutarch, and others, who copied from them,
                    expressly asserted the distinct personality of Osiris and Sesostris, and placed
                    them in eras very distant from each other. If any credit be due to the
                    historians just named, Osiris was the founder of the Egyptian monarchy; and, as
                    was customary in those days, the same personage, having either received the name
                    of the Sun, or communicated his own to that luminary, was after his death
                    deified for the benefits which he had rendered to his country; and, being at
                    first worshipped only as a demigod, was in process of time advanced to full
                    divinity, and confounded with his heavenly godfather. The Greeks, who, although
                    original in nothing, were always prompted by their vanity to hold themselves out
                    as the first of the nations, claimed this Osiris as their own, and pretended
                    that he was the son of Jupiter and Niobe. According to them, he reigned over the
                    Argives; but afterwards, having delivered his kingdom to his brother Aigialeus,
                    took a voyage into Egypt, of which he made himself master, and there married Io
                    or Isis. He established many good laws in.</p>

                <p part="N">that country, and both Osiris and Isis were after their deaths
                    worshipped as gods. But that this is a ridiculous fiction needs no proof;
                    because every one knows that good laws were established in Egypt long before the
                    Argives had any king, or indeed existed either as a tribe or a nation.</p>
