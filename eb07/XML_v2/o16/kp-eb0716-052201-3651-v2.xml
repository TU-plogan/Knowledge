                        >Architecture,</hi> is a system of the several members, ornaments, and
                    proportions of columns and pilasters; or a regular arrangement of the projecting
                    parts of a building, especially the column, so as to form one beautiful whole.
                    See <hi rend="smallcaps">Architecture.</hi><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> is
                    also used to signify a division or class of any thing. Thus the tribe of animals
                    called <hi rend="italic">birds</hi> is subdivided into orders.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Order,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Rhetoric,</hi> is
                    the placing of each word and member of a sentence in such a manner as will most
                    contribute to the force, beauty, or evidence of the whole; according to the
                    genius and custom of different languages. With regard to order, we may observe
                    in general, that, in English, the nearer we keep to the natural or grammatical
                    order, so much the better; but in Latin we are to follow the use of the best
                    writers, a joint regard being always had to the judgment of the ear, and the
                    perspicuity of the sense, in both languages.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> is also used to signify a class or
                    division of the members of a state, with regard to assemblies, precedence,
                    levees, and other circumstances.</p>

                        rend="italic">IIolιj</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Orders,</hi> denote a
                    character peculiar to ecclesiastics, by which they are set apart for the holy
                    ministry.</p>
                <p part="N">In no reformed church are there more than three orders, namely, bishops,
                    priests, and deacons. In the Roman Catholic church there are seven, exclusive of
                    the episcopate, all of which the council of Trent enjoins to be received and
                    believed, on pain of anathema. They are distinguished into petty, or secular
                    orders; and major, or sacred orders.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Orders,</hi> the petty, or minor, are four; those
                    of doorkeeper, exorcist, reader, and acolyte. Persons in petty orders may marry
                    without any dispensation. In effect, the petty orders are loohted on as little
                    other than formalities, and as degrees necessary to arrive at the higher orders.
                    The Greeks disavow these petty orders, and pass immediately to the subdeaconate;
                    and the reformed churches to the deaconate. Their rise Fleury dates in the time
                    of the Emperor Justinian. There is no call nor benefice required for the four
                    petty orders; and even a bastard may enjoy them without any dispensation, nor
                    does a second marriage disqualify.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Orders,</hi> sacred, or major, are, as has already
                    been observed, three, viz. those of deacon, priest, and bishop. The council of
                    Trent, reviving the ancient discipline, forbids any person being admitted to the
                    major orders, unless he be in peaceable possession of a benefice sufficient for
                    a decent subsistence, and allows no ordinations on patrimonies or pensions,
                    except where the bishop judges it for the service of the church. A person is
                    said to be promoted to orders <hi rend="italic">per</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >saltum,</hi> when he has not before passed the inferior orders. The council
                    of Constantinople forbids any bishop being ordained without passing all the
                    degrees; yet ecclesiastical history furnishes us with instances of bishops
                    consecrated without having passed the order of priesthood; and Panormus still
                    thinks that such an ordination is valid.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Military</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Orders</hi>
                    are companies of knights, instituted by kings and princes, either for defence of
                    the faith, or to confer marks of honour and grant distinctions to meritorious
                    subjects.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Religious</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Orders</hi>
                    are congregations or societies of monastics, living under the same superior, in
                    the same man· ner, and wearing the same habit. Religious orders may be reduced
                    to five kinds, namely, monks, canons, knights, mendicants, and regular clerks.
                    Father Mabillon shows, that till the ninth century, almost all the monasteries
                    in Europe followed the rule of St Benedict that the distinction of orders did
                    not commence till after the reunion of several monasteries into one
                    congregation; that St Odo, abbot of Cluny, first began this reunion, bringing
                    several houses under the dependence of Cluny; and that, a little afterwards, in
                    the eleventh century, the Camaldulians arose, then the congregation of
                    Vallombrosa, the Cistercians, Carthusians, Augustines, and at last, in the
                    thirteenth century, the Mendicants. He adds, that Lupus Servatus, abbot of
                    Terrières, in the ninth century, is the first who seems to distinguish the order
                    of St Benedict from the rest, and to speak of it as a particular order.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">White</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Order</hi>
                    denoted the order of regular canons of St Augustin.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Black</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Order</hi>
                    denoted the order of Benedictines.</p>
                <p part="N">These names were at first given to the two orders in question, from the
                    colour of their habit; but were disused after the institution of several other
                    orders, who adopted the same colours.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="italic">Gray</hi><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Order</hi> was
                    the ancient name of the Cistercians; but, since the change of the habit, the
                    name is no longer applicable.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Orders,</hi> religious military, are those
                    instituted in defence of the faith, and privileged to say mass; but who are
                    prohibited marriage, and subjected to other restraints.</p>
                <p part="N">Of this kind were the knights of Malta, or of St John of Jerusalem, the
                    Knights Templars, the knights of Calatrava, the knights of St Lazarus, the
                    Teutonic kgights, and various others.</p>
