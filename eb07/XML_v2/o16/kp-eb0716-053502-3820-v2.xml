                <p part="N"><label type="entry">ORIGEN</label>, a celebrated ecclesiastical winter,
                    and one of .he greatest geniuses, as well as most learned men, of the church,
                    during the third century, was born at Alexandria in the year 185. He was
                    surnamed <hi rend="italic">Adamantius,</hi> either rom his indefatigable
                    application to study, or from the irmness he discovered amidst the torments
                    which he suffered for the faith. Leonidas, his father, trained him with great
                    care, and caused him, from his infancy, to apply to the tudy of the Scriptures,
                    in which he made surprising progress. The son’s inclination and turn of mind
                    suited exactly with the father’s design; for he pursued his studies with
                    extraordinary zeal and ardour; and, being endowed with a quick apprehension and
                    a strong imagination, he did not content himself with that sense which at first
                    presented itself, but endeavoured to discover mysterious and allegorical
                    explications of the sacred books. He would ometimes even puzzle his father, by
                    soliciting the latter or recondite meanings; which obliged the good man to
                    eprehend him a little, and withal to advise him not to ttempt to penetrate too
                    far in the study of the Scriptures, but to content himself with their clear,
                    obvious, and natural sense. Hence it appears how early he was seized with that
                        <hi rend="italic">furor allegoricus,</hi> as a learned modern calls it, hat
                    rage of expounding the Scriptures allegorically, which fterwards became a
                    distemper, and carried him to excesses which can never be excused. In philosophy
                    he had the celebrated Ammonius as his teacher, and St Clement of Alexandria for
                    his master in divinity. At eighteen years of age he succeeded the latter in the
                    office of catechist; an important employment, which consisted of teaching
                    divinity, and in expounding the Scriptures, Leonidas his father had suffered
                    martyrdom the year before, during the persecution of Severus, in 202; and Ori-en
                    had shown such eagerness to follow his father to martyrdom, that his mother was
                    obliged to hide his clothes to prevent him going abroad. Origen had a great
                    con-ourse of auditors who attended his school, some of whom ere of the faithful,
                    and the others Pagans. He confirmed and strengthened the former in their faith,
                    and converted most of the latter; and there were such a number of martyrs
                    amongst his disciples, that it might be said that he kept a school of martyrdom
                    rather than one of divinity.</p>
                <p part="N">He taught the doctrines of Christianity to the women and girls, as well
                    as to the men; and taking in a too literal sense what Christ says of becoming
                    voluntary eunuchs, castrated himself, to prevent his deserving or suffering
                    scandal. He took a voyage to Rome in 211, in the beginning of the reign of
                    Caracalla, under the pontificate of Zepherinus. On his return he published many
                    works, whereby he acquired an extraordinary reputation, which drew to him a
                    great number of auditors. But Demetrius, bishop of Alexandria, conceiving a
                    jealousy of him, endeavoured upon various pretences to injure him. At length
                    Origen went to Antioch, whither the Empress Mammaea had sent for him to hear him
                    discourse on the Christian religion. He did not however stay long there, but
                    returned to Alexandria, where he continued to teach till the year 228, when he
                    left that city and travelled into Achaia. He then went into Palestine, and was
                    ordained by the bishops of that province at forty-two years of age. But the
                    circumstance of his being ordained by foreign bishops, without the permission of
                    Demetrius, renewed that prelate’s resentment against him; upon which Origen
                    hastily returned to Alexandria, to endeavour to mollify him. Demetrius, however,
                    drove him thence in the year 231, and caused him to be excommunicated, and even
                    deposed, in a council which was held in Egypt. Origen then retired to Caesarea
                    in Palestine, where he raised a celebrated school, and had St Gregory
                    Thaumaturgus, and a great number of other persons who were illustrious for their
                    virtue and learning, as his disciples. He afterwards travelled to Athens, and,
                    at the desire of Firmilianus, staid some time at Caesarea in Cappadocia; whence
                    he was invited into Arabia, to convince and bring back to the truth Beryllus
                    bishop of Bostra, who maintained that the Word had no existence before his
                    incarnation. Origen had the happiness to make him sensible of his mistake; and
                    some years afterwards he was sent into Arabia by an assembly of bishops, to
                    dispute against certain persons who maintained that the souls of the dead
                    remained in a state of insensibility till the general resurrection. At length
                    the seventh persecution of the Christians began in the reign of Decius, and none
                    was treated with greater severity than Origen. He supported with incredible
                    constancy the dreadful torments which the persecutors of the Christians invented
                    against them; torments which were the more insupportable, as they were made to
                    continue for a long time, and as the persecutors took the greatest care to
                    prevent his expiring in the midst of his tortures. But in the most excruciating
                    agony he discovered an heroic courage, and suffered nothing to escape him which
                    was unworthy a disciple of Jesus Christ. Origen died at Tyre in the year 254,
                    aged sixty-nine. He was the author of a great number of excellent works. The
                    principal of those which have descended to us are, 1. A Treatise against Celsus,
                    of which a good edition in Greek and Latin, with notes, has been published by
                    Spencer; 2. A number of Homilies, with Commentaries on the Holy Scriptures; 3.
                    Philocalia, and several other treatises; 4. Fragments of his Hexapla, collected
                    by Montfaucon, in two volumes folio. Of all Origen’s works, the loss of the
                    Hexapla is most to be regretted. This work was thus named from its containing
                    six columns, in the first of which was the Hebrew text of the Bible; in the
                    second, the same text in Greek characters; in the third, the Greek version of
                    the Septuagint; in the fourth, that of Aquila; in the fifth, that of Symmachus;
                    and in the sixth, Thcodosian’s Greek version. This admirable work first
                    suggested the idea of our Polyglot Bibles. Of the book of Principles we have
                    only an incorrect Latin version. The most complete edition of the works of
                    Origen is that of Father Delarue, a Benedictine, in Greek and Latin. Montfaucon
                    likewise published, in two volumes folio, some remains and fragments of his
                    Hexapla. He ought not to be <pb break="no" facs="nls:194563833?mode=fullsize"

                    philosopher, and the disciple and friend of Porphyry, who studied philosophy
                    under Ammonius. This Origen was perhaps the founder of the sect of
                    Origenians.</p>
