                    north it is bounded by Michigan and Lake Erie; on the east by Pennsylvania and
                    the river Ohio; on the south by the Ohio River, which separates it from Virginia
                    and Kentucky; and on the west by Indiana. Ohio may extend about 220 miles from
                    north to south, and as much from east to west; but as Lake Erie projects
                    considerably into the northern borders, and the Ohio cuts off much of its
                    southern quarter, the area of the state cannot be computed at more than 200
                    miles square. Ohio occupies about one third of the plane which declines from
                    Pennsylvania to the Mississippi, and may be considered generally as a surface of
                    table-land, sloping in one direction towards the Ohio, and in the other towards
                    Lake Erie. The state is divided by nature into four grand divisions, which are
                    named after the principal waters on which they are situated. These are the Miami
                    country, the Scioto country, the Muskingum country, and the Lake country. The
                    interior and northern parts of Ohio are generally level, but the northern belt
                    has large tracts of wet and marshy soil. They are however placed in such
                    positions as render them easily drained; and when they are cleared of the
                    forests which cover them, they will form not the least valuable parts of the
                    state. In its primitive condition, Ohio was, with the exception of some central
                    prairies, overspread with a dense forest, to which the great fertility of the
                    soil gave a stupendous development; indeed the size, majesty, and variety of the
                    trees of the Ohio basin has been a theme of just admiration. There are still
                    extensive tracts of land heavily timbered, and which are as level as prairies.
                    The forest-trees are the same as those of Kentucky and Indiana, excepting that
                    the peccan tree, which is common on the waters of the Wabash, is seldom found
                    here. The forests are deep, and some of them are in the richest soils, where,
                    however, the trees are less remarkable for their size than for their
                    straightness. On the head waters of the two Miamis, the Muskingum, and the
                    Scioto, there are rich and extensive prairies, some of which are low and marshy,
                    and others are elevated and dry, the latter being by no means so fertile as the
                    former. Immediately on the borders of the Ohio, there are numerous tracts of
                    intervale or meadow-land of exuberant fertility. In the interior parts,
                    bordering on both sides of the Scioto, and on the two Miamis, are the most
                    extensive tracts of rich and level land. About one quarter of the eastern and
                    south-eastern divisions of Ohio is hilly, in some places too broken, and
                    precipitous to admit of cultivation; but in no parts are the hills very large or
                    high, and nine tenths of the surface of the state are susceptible of
                    cultivation, “On its whole wide surface,” says Mr Flint, “there is scarcely any
                    land so hilly, sterile, or marshy, as, with moderate labour, may not be subdued,
                    drained, or cultivated. The whole region seems to have invited a hardy and
                    numerous body of freeholders to select themselves moderate and nearly
                    equal-sized farms, and to intersperse them over its surface. In respect to the
                    smallness of the farms, the number, equality, and compactness of the population,
                    not confined, as farther west, to the water-courses, but diffused over the whole
                    state, it compares very accurately with New England.”</p>
                <p part="N">The principal river of Ohio is the noble and beautiful stream to which
                    it owes its name; but this will demand a separate notice. T he next largest and
                    most interesting river in this state is the Great Miami, which rises between 40
                    and 41 degrees of north latitude, and interlocks with the Massissineway of the
                    Wabash, and the St Mary’s and Au Glaize, branches of the 2∙1aumee and Scioto. It
                    has a south-westerly course of above fifty miles, flowing in a strong but
                    generally smooth and unbroken current, through a valley of uncommon width and
                    fertility, receiving several tributaries in its course. The Little Miami rises
                    in the southwest corner of Madison county, and, after traversing several
                    counties, joins the Ohio seven miles above Cincinnati. It is of little
                    importance as a navigable stream; but it is valuable in a manufacturing point of
                    view, there being upwards of sixty mills upon it. It has a number of branches;
                    and about one hundred miles from its mouth it forms singular rapids, the stream
                    being compressed to ten yards in width, and falling two hundred feet within no
                    great distance. The country between the Great and Little Miami is in general
                    finely watered, healthy, pleasant, and fertile, and may be characterised as the
                    garden of the state. The Scioto is a considerable river of Ohio, and has the
                    whole of its course in the state, being little short of two hundred miles, one
                    hundred and thirty of which are navigable. It rises in a morass north of Logan
                    county, in the southern division of the state, and has generally a
                    south-easterly course. The banks of the Scioto now rank amongst the most
                    fertile, eligible, and pleasant parts of the state. Between this river and the
                    Muskingum is situated the great Hockhocking and its waters. It has a deep and
                    still but narrow channel, and is navigable for boats forty miles above its
                    mouth, having also a number of mills erected on it. The Muskingum rises near the
                    sources of the Cuyahoga of Lake Erie, in the southern part of Connecticut
                    Reserve. Its course is remarkably sinuous, but its general direction is to the
                    southward. It has a long course, traversing a number of counties, is boatable in
                    good stages of the water one hundred miles by the course of the river, and
                    enters the Ohio at Marietta by a mouth two hundred and fifty yards wide. The
                    Mahoning is also a large stream, which, with those already described, may be
                    considered as belonging to the southern division of the state. In the north
                    there is the Maumee, which rises in the north-eastern angle of the state of
                    Indiana, and flows in a north-eastern direction, across the north-western
                    borders of the state of Ohio, into the western extremity of Lake Erie. This
                    important river has a course of one hundred miles, and is a broad, deep,
                    navigable stream. It has a valuable fishery, and its banks in the season of
                    vegetation are remarkable for the luxuriance of their verdure. The St Joseph,
                    the St Mary’s, and the Great and Little Au Glaize, are considerable tributary
                    streams of the Maumee. The Sandusky rises in the western limits of Richland
                    county, and runs in a general northwest direction ninety miles to the lake. It
                    is more rapid than the other lake streams, but yet affords good navigation.
                    Cuyahoga rises in the central parts of Geauga county, and falls into the lake at
                    Cleveland, after a course of sixty miles, for the greater part of which distance
                    it is boatable. Chagrin, Grand, Ashtabula, and Coneaught, are considerable
                    streams, which rise near the lake, run in a northerly direction, and discharge
                    their waters into it.</p>
                <p part="N">Ohio possesses an extensive and rich coal region in its eastern and
                    north-eastern divisions, on the Muskingum, the Hockhocking, and the Scioto. The
                    mineral is not only in great abundance, but of the best quality; and in the same
                    region vast quantities of iron ore are found. Limestone, marble, and freestone
                    abound; they are easily accessible, and are admirably adapted to building and
                    public works. The useful earths and fossils are also in abundance. Specimens of
                    gypsum are procured from Sandusky Bay. Salt springs are common, and some of them
                    contain as much saline matter as the waters of the ocean. Nearly half a million
                    bushels of salt are annually manufactured in the state. Those springs the waters
                    of which are drank for medicinal purposes are most of them more or less
                    impregnated with muriate of soda. The Yellow Springs, the most celebrated
                    watering-place after Harrodsburgh Springs in the western country, are situated
                    near the falls of the Miami, sixty-three miles from Cincinnati. The antiquities
                    which belong to this state are somewhat similar to those described in the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">New York</hi>; mounds of earth, in which have been
                    found domestic utensils, pottery, vases, and trinkets.</p>

                <p part="N">Instruments of warfare have likewise been dug up, amongst which Mr Flint
                    mentions a curious sword and an iron horseshoe of a diminutive size.</p>
                <p part="N">Except along the deep vales of the Ohio, and those of the other streams
                    near their influx into that great recipient, the climate is as uniform as the
                    surface, and considerably more severe in the winter season than in corresponding
                    latitudes on the Atlantic. But the other seasons are warmer, and the nature and
                    luxuriance of the vegetation indicates a temperature of greater mildness in
                    general. The summers are warm, and pretty regular, although to a certain extent
                    subject to tornadoes. The central parts of the state are in the same latitude
                    with Philadelphia. The mean temperature of the year at this city was found to be
                    53°; but during the same year that of Ohio was two degrees higher. As we recede
                    from the Ohio, the temperature diminishes in a greater ratio than the latitude
                    would indicate; but in general throughout the state there is a striking
                    correspondence between the two. Whilst the summers are warm, the winters are
                    very severe, and the river Ohio has occasionally been crossed at Cincinnati for
                    nine consecutive weeks. At other times this season of the year is mild; but
                    during the winter months the transitions from heat to cold and the reverse are
                    frequent and violent. In that part of the state which slopes to the south, the
                    snow seldom falls deep or lies long; but in Connecticut Reserve, and in the
                    points which slope towards the lakes, they have deep and durable snows. Autumn
                    is almost uniformly temperate, dry, and beautiful; and spring is also a pleasant
                    season. The winds of Ohio, whether high or low, generally blow from the west and
                    south-west at all times. In some parts, near marshes and stagnant waters, fevers
                    and agues frequently prevail; but the climate in general is decidedly
                    healthy.</p>
                <p part="N">The soil and the climate of Ohio together are admirably adapted to the
                    most valuable vegetable productions which grow in such a latitude. The soil is
                    very productive, without, however, being so remarkable in this respect as some
                    parts of Illinois and Missouri. After the severity of winter abates, which is
                    early in February, vegetation begins to put forth its powers; and as the heat of
                    spring and summer takes effect upon the soil, it advances with astonishing
                    rapidity. Ohio, generally, has a soil admirably adapted to wheat. Indian corn is
                    the staple grain, and it is nowhere raised more easily, or in greater abundance.
                    On rich alluvial soils 110 bushels have been produced from an acre; but fifty
                    may be considered as about the average crop. Rye, barley, oats, spelts,
                    buckwheat, and all other grains, are raised in great abundance and perfection.
                    Melons, squashes, pumpkins, the pulses, garden vegetables both bulbous and
                    others, as potatoes, onions, beets, carrots, parsnips, asparagus of the best
                    description, and various culinary products of the soil, attain the highest
                    development. From its stiff, clayey nature, the soil retains moisture well, and
                    is better fitted for gardens than the soils farther west. Fruits of all kinds
                    are raised in the greatest profusion; and apples in particular are very
                    plentiful. Pears, plums, peaches, cherries, strawberries, grapes, and what not,
                    are cultivated to such an extent as amply to supply the markets. “In a few
                    years,” says Mr Flint, “this state will take place of any in the Union, in the
                    abundance and excellence of its fruits of all kinds. From the fulness and
                    richness of the clusters of cultivated grapes, it is clear that this ought to be
                    a country of vineyards. The Germans have already made a few establishments of
                    the kind with entire success. Apricots, nectarines, and quinces succeed; and
                    this state is the appropriate empire of Pomona. Recently, tobacco has been added
                    to the articles cultivated. ...Hemp is an article of cultivation in some parts
                    of the state. Agricultural improvement, however, proceeds with slow pace. The
                    people generally are not at all given to experiment, and continue to farm in the
                    old and beaten routine....Besides trees, shrubs, and vines, this state produces
                    a great abundance of indigenous productions that are useful in medicine. We may
                    mention <hi rend="italic">actea</hi><hi rend="italic">racemosa,</hi> squaw root,
                    Virginia snake root, Indian turnip, ginseng, which is dug in considerable
                    quantities as an article of commerce, Colombo, labelia, valerian, blood root or
                    sanguinaria, canadensis, and various other herbaceous medicinal plants.”</p>
                <p part="N">This state, being more populous than any other in the west, and
                    possessing in many respects manufacturing capabilities, has taken precedence of
                    all the rest in manufactures. Cotton yarn, cloth, and woollen goods, are already
                    manufactured to a considerable extent, as are also flour and spirits; and family
                    manufactures are likewise industriously prosecuted. The principal domestic
                    articles of trade are horses, cattle, swine, whisky, flour, and tobacco. Those
                    articles which are exported from the northern and some interior counties are
                    frequently sent to Montreal and New York markets, by way of Lake Erie. From the
                    southern parts of the state they are transported down the Ohio and Mississippi
                    to New Orleans. Foreign goods are received from the same place by the
                    steam-boats, and from Philadelphia and Baltimore across the Alleghany Mountains.
                    “The surplus produce of the state of Ohio,” says Mr Pitkin, in his Statistical
                    View of the Commerce of the United States, “it is believed, may be calculated at
                    about ten millions. The exports of Cincinnati alone, in 1833, were valued at
                    five millions of dollars. This amount does not probably exceed the truth, when
                    it is considered that the number of hogs slaughtered in that city in 1833 was
                    123,859, which would make as many, and probably more, barrels of pork, and, in
                    the same year, 21,880 barrels of pork came to that city by the Miami Canal,
                    making about 150,000 barrels in the whole, and which, at nine dollars per
                    barrel, would be 1,359,000 dollars; and that in 1834, the number slaughtered was
                    150,000. And we cannot but here remark, that the whole quantity of pork exported
                    from the United States in 1833 was only 105,870 barrels, leaving in favour of
                    Cincinnati 45,000 barrels.” It is of course taken for granted, that of the
                    150,000 barrels of pork said to be made at this city, all above the 45,000
                    entered as having been exported was reserved for home consumption. Mr Pitkin
                    continues, “the exports of Cleveland on Lake Erie, in the same year, was
                    1,794,000 dollars coastwise, and 250,000 to foreign places, and from Huron
                    274,840 dollars; and from the country of Muskingum, on the river of that name,
                    and from the flourishing village of Zanesville, with her numerous flourishing
                    mills, as ascertained by those well acquainted with the facts, was 500,000
                    dollars. The value of the exports from these places alone make about seven
                    millions and three quarters; and when it is considered that the quantity of
                    tobacco raised in Ohio in 1833 was 10,000 hogsheads, only 3000 of which is
                    included in the above exports from Muskingum, and when to these are added the
                    exports from the Sciota valley, and from many other places on the Ohio River,
                    and on the lake, we apprehend that the surplus produce of Ohio cannot be less
                    than ten millions of dollars.”</p>

                <p part="N">Although the first permanent settlement was made in Ohio not more than
                    fifty years ago, and although it was admitted into the Union as a state as
                    recently as 1802, yet it has now become one of the most considerable states in
                    the union, has entered largely into the system of internal improvement, and has
                    constructed one of the longest canals in the world. The state canals are under
                    the direction of a board of canal commissioners; and the Ohio and Miami Canals,
                    which, together with their branches, are more than four hundred miles in extent,
                    have been constructed at the expense of the state. For an account of the canals
                    of Ohio, see the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Navigation, Inland.</hi></p>
                <p part="N">Railroads have likewise been constructed on the same extensive scale,
                    and numbers of them are in course of being laid. Mad River and Lake Erie
                    Railroad, extending from Dayton to the city of Sandusky, is to be 153 miles in
                    length. The Pennsylvania and Ohio Railroad is designed to commence at
                    Pittsburgh, and terminate at Massillon on the Ohio Canal, the length being 180
                    miles. There are some others of smaller size; and some idea may be formed of the
                    extent to which these works are carried, from the fact that no less than
                    twenty-eight companies were incorporated in the year 1836. In connection with
                    trade and internal improvement may be mentioned the banks of Ohio. In the year
                    1835 there were thirty-one banks in this state; and the condition of twenty-nine
                    of these, from which returns were received, was, that they had of specie
                    1,906,715, and of capital 6,390,741; and that their circulation was 5,654,048.
                    The legal interest in Ohio is six per cent.; but there is no law against usury,
                    so that in some parts it is seldom less, and often more, than ten per cent.</p>
                <p part="N">A laudable zeal has been shown to diffuse education throughout this
                    state. In the year 1825 the New England system of tuition was introduced into
                    Ohio, and by various emendatory enactments it has now acquired a degree of form
                    and consistency. By an act of the state the trustees of every incorporated
                    township are required to divide it into a suitable number of school districts,
                    the prudential concerns of which are managed by three school directors, a clerk,
                    and a treasurer. The funds for maintaining this vast system arise from various
                    sources besides the easy tax of one mill upon a dollar, constituting a large and
                    growing revenue. By this act it is provided that the youth of every class,
                    without distinction, shall be instructed in reading, writing, and arithmetic, as
                    well as in other necessary branches of education. There are no less than nine
                    colleges or universities, viz. the university of Ohio, at Athens, with five
                    instructors, seventy-two alumni, twenty-six ministers, forty-five students, and
                    about a thousand volumes in the college library, and as many in that of the
                    students; the Miami university, at Oxford, with eight instructors, eighty
                    alumni, seventeen ministers, one hundred and twenty-six students, and 1200 and
                    2500 volumes respectively in the college and students’ libraries; the Franklin
                    university, at New Athens; the Western Reserve university, at Hud-^ son; the
                    Kenyon university, at Gambier; the Granville university, at Granville; the
                    Marietta university, at Marietta; the Oberlin institution, at New Illyria; and
                    the Willoughby university, at Chagrin; all of which are smaller than the first
                    two, but have from fifty to one hundred students. There are five theological
                    seminaries, a presbyterian college at Cincinnati, and another at Hudson, a
                    Protestant episcopal college at Gambier, a Lutheran theological school at
                    Columbus, and a Baptist institution of the same kind at Granville. There are two
                    medical schools; one at Cincinnati, having six professors, and another at
                    Northing, with four professors. There is a law college at Cincinnati, which has
                    three professors. Amongst institutions of a public character may be mentioned an
                    asylum for the deaf and dumb, which has been established at Columbus. Literature
                    is making considerable progress in Ohio. In 1810 there were only fourteen
                    newspapers in the state, and in 1834 their number amounted to 140. There are,
                    besides, several other periodicals of a literary and scientific nature.</p>
                <p part="N">Almost every religious denomination is found in this state, but the
                    Presbyterians and Methodists predominate. In 1831, which is the latest complete
                    return that we have obtained, the numbers were, of Presbyterians, 22,150
                    communicants, having 346 churches; of Baptists, 8801 communicants, having 240
                    churches; of Methodists, 36,064 members; of Lutherans, 8706 communicants; of
                    Associate Presbyterians, sixty-five congregations; of German Reformed,
                    eighty-two congregations. The Episcopalians had also sixteen ministers, and the
                    New Jerusalem church four societies; and there were, besides, a number of
                    Friends and Roman Catholics, and some Universalists, Unitarians, and Shakers.
                    “It is affirmed by a gentleman,” says Mr Flint, “well known for his researches
                    into the antiquities of this state, that there is a greater number of professors
                    of religion, in proportion to the whole number of the people, than in any state
                    in the Union. There are a vast number of religious societies; but there is not a
                    great number that have regularly established pastors. The custom of itinerating
                    preaching, as a supply, is very prevalent. The people are generally a quiet,
                    orderly, peaceable, moral, and industrious race. Suicide, excesses, murders in
                    affray, and instances of deliberate and atrocious cruelty, are rare; and the
                    general moral character of the people is highly respectable.”</p>
                <p part="N">From the census of 1830 we learn that there were at tlιat time in Ohio
                    the remains of Indian tribes, amounting to 2350 persons. They then owned 390,846
                    acres of land, besides 16,200 acres which were secured to individuals belonging
                    to the several tribes. These lands are secured by treaty to the Wyandotes,
                    Shawnees, Senecas, Delawares, and Ottawas; the other remnants of tribes being
                    classed with these. Some of them have sold their shares; but to those which
                    still hold them, considerable annuities are paid by the national government. The
                    number of individuals belonging to these tribes is gradually diminishing, and
                    they must soon entirely disappear in the tide of white population which is fast
                    overspreading their native territories. There are not many negroes in Ohio,and
                    none are held as slaves. Few descriptions of the inhabitants are exempted from
                    military duty. The militia of this state is principally composed of hardy
                    agriculturists, and exceeds one hundred and fifty thousand men. A portion of the
                    land in Ohio still belongs to the United States. In the north-east part of the
                    state there is a tract containing 3,300,000 acres, called New Connecticut, or
                        Connec-tient<pb break="no" facs="nls:194561142?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-1142-0329"/> Western Reserve. The fee of these lands is in
                    the state of Connecticut, but Ohi has the jurisdiction. I he state of Virginia
                    also owns a tract of above four millions of acres, called the Virginia military
                    lands, which are situated between the Scioto and Little Miami Rivers. The

                <p part="N">The increase of population in the state of Ohio has been rapid almost
                    beyond example. In the year 1790 it was only about 3000; in 1800, 45,365; in
                    1810, 230,760; in 1820, 581,434; and in 1830, 937,679.</p>
                <p part="N">For an account of Cincinnati, the principal city of Ohio, see the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Cincinnati.</hi> Columbus, the political
                    metropolis, is situated near the centre of the state, upon the east bank of the
                    Scioto River. The beautiful slope on which it stands, just below the confluence
                    of the Whetstone River with the Scioto, was a compact forest in 1812. It is now
                    cleared and well cultivated, and the city contains some excellent public
                    buildings, including a penitentiary, an asylum for the deaf and dumb, and above
                    three thousand inhabitants. Steubenville, the seat of justice for Jefferson
                    county, is situated on the western bank of the Ohio, near the Pennsylvania
                    boundary. It was laid out with great regularity in 1798, and is situated in the
                    centre of a rich and populous country. It has the usual number of public
                    buildings found in towns of the same size, and it possesses cotton, woollen, and
                    other manufactures. Chillicothe is finely situated upon a level alluvial plain
                    on the west bank of the Scioto, forty-five miles in a right line from its
                    entrance into the Ohio. It was laid out with great regularity in 1796, and
                    contains some handsome buildings. It possesses several cotton factories, and a
                    number of flour and other mills. Marietta, the oldest town in the state, is
                    situated on the Ohio, a little above the mouth of the Muskingum River. Ships
                    were formerly built here, but this business has been discontinued, and the town,
                    although very advantageously placed, has not prospered like many others in the
                    state less favourably situated. Sixty miles north of Marietta, on the Muskingum,
                    is the town of Zanesville, principally distinguished for its manufactures of
                    iron. Here there are likewise a number of flour and other mills, driven by the
                    waters of the Muskingum; and two or three glasshouses. Cleveland, situated upon
                    the southern shore of Lake Erie, at the mouth of Cuyahoga River, is destined,
                    from its position, to become an important town. It is one of the principal
                    points for embarkation on the lake, and during the last American war was a
                    provision dépôt, and a place where many boats and other lake craft were built.
                    Cleveland is intermediate between Buffalo and Cincinnati, and is the dépôt of
                    that vast quantity of merchandise which is destined for the east and west. One
                    of the most important places on Lake Erie is Sandusky, situated on the southern
                    shore of a bay of the same name. Although it is comparatively a young
                    settlement, it has a great number of stores, and is one of the chief points of
                    landing and embarkation between the Mississippi Valley and New York, Buffalo,
                    and Detroit. The other ports or harbours on Lake Erie are Put-in Bay, Maumee
                    Bay, Fair Port, and Ashtabula Creek. The relative importance of these, as well
                    as the other towns belonging to Ohio, will be seen from our tabular view of the
                    counties and county towns.</p>
                <p part="N">The first permanent settlement in the state of Ohio was made at
                    Marietta, on the 7th of April 1788, by forty-seven persons from Massachusetts,
                    Rhode Island, and Connecticut. In the year following a settlement was made at
                    Columbia, six miles above Cincinnati, by a company principally from
                    Pennsylvania. In September 1799, the first territorial legislature assembled at
                    Cincinnati, under the ordinance of congress of the 13th July 1786, for the
                    government of the territory of the United States north-west of the river Ohio.
                    On the 30th of April 1802, congress passed an act authorizing the calling of a
                    convention to form a state constitution for that part of the North-west
                    Territory which now constitutes the state of Ohio. On the 1st of November
                    following the convention met at Chillicothe, and formed the present
                    constitution, by which Ohio was admitted into the union. The following is an
                    outline of the constitution of Ohio. The legislative power is vested in a senate
                    and house of representatives, which together are styled the General Assembly of
                    the State of Ohio. The representatives are elected annually on the second
                    Tuesday in October; and they are apportioned amongst the counties according to
                    the number of white male inhabitants above twenty-one years of age. Their
                    numbers cannot be less than thirty-six, nor more than seventy-two. The senators
                    are chosen biennially, and are apportioned according to the number of white male
                    inhabitants of twenty-one years of age. Their number cannot be less than one
                    third, nor more than one half of the number of representatives. The executive
                    power is vested in a governor, who is elected by the people for two years, on
                    the second Tuesday in October; and his term of service commences on the first
                    Monday in December. The general assembly meets annually at Columbus, on the
                    first Monday in December. The right of suffrage is granted to all white male
                    inhabitants above the age of twenty-one years, who have resided in the state one
                    year next preceding the election, and who have paid or are charged with a state
                    or county tax. The judicial power is vested in a supreme court, in courts of
                    common pleas for each county, and such other courts as the legislature may from
                    time to time establish.</p>

                        rend="smallcaps">Ohio,</hi> a great river of the valley of the Mississippi,
                    in North America, formed by the confluence of the /ïlleghany and Monongahela
                    Rivers at Pittsburgh, in the western part of Pennsylvania. The highest sources
                    of the Alleghany are in Potter county, Pennsylvania, twelve miles to the
                    eastward of Condersport, where they interlock with the head waters of
                    theGenessee River, and the eastern and western branches of the Susquehannah.
                    During its course through Pennsylvania, which is exceedingly irregular, it is
                    joined by several streams, the most considerable of which arc, Toby’s Creek,
                    extending one hundred miles into the interior of Pennsylvania, and the
                    Kiskiminitas, formed by the junction of the Conemaugh and Loyalhanna, which rise
                    near the Alleghany Mountains, one hundred miles distant. This branch of the
                    Ohio, although its volume is not apparently wider than the other, is by far the
                    most important tributary. It has a swift, sweeping, and rapid current, and often
                    a rocky bottom, whence huge blocks rise to the surface of the water. In the
                    spring time, when it is full, flat and keel boats descend it rapidly, without
                    any danger. It has been navigated by steam-boats, but has been found one of the
                    most difficult currents to stem ever attempted by these vessels. Monongahela
                    River, the other fork of the Ohio, rises in Virginia, about seventy miles
                    north-west of Morgantown. It traverses a rich and well-settled country,
                    celebrated for its whisky, flour, and iron manufactures. The banks are often
                    bold and high bluffs, and in some places the country is hilly. In good stages of
                    the water, it is boatable by large boats for about one hundred miles from its
                    mouth. During its course it receives the waters of a number of tributary
                    streams, the most important of which is the Youghiogeny River, or, as it is
                    commonly called, the Yough, which rises near the upper waters of the Potomac,
                    the rivers being only separated by a spur of the mountains. From the western
                    declivity of these mountains, both this and the main river receive a great
                    accession of mountain streams. The united current, which has now become broad
                    and majestic, flows in a north-west course to Pittsburgh, and where it unites
                    with the Alleghany it is more than four hundred yards in breadth. At the
                    confluence of the two great branches, the Ohio is somewhat more than six hundred
                    yards wide, and it immediately assumes that broad, placid, and beautiful aspect
                    which it maintains to its junction with the Mississippi, in latitude 37. 0.
                    north, and longitude 88. 52. west. Its length from Pittsburgh to its mouth is
                    about nine hundred miles, including the windings of the river; but the direct
                    distance is only six hundred and fourteen miles. Its breadth varies exceedingly,
                    being in some parts fourteen hundred yards, whilst in others it is only four
                    hundred yards across. At Cincinnati it is about eight hundred yards wide, and
                    this is nearly its average breadth. For thirty miles below Pittsburgh its course
                    is north-west. It then turns slowly to the west-south-west, and pursues that
                    general direction for some five hundred miles. It flows south-west for above one
                    hundred and fifty miles, then westward above two hundred and fifty miles, and
                    finally south-west about one hundred and seventy miles through that low and
                    swampy country in which it joins the “Father of waters.” Between Pittsburgh and
                    its mouth it is diversified with about one hundred considerable islands, besides
                    a great number of tow-heads and sand-bars, which in low stages of the water
                    greatly impede navigation. Some of these islands are of exquisite beauty, and
                    afford most lovely situations for retired farms. The passages between them and
                    the sand-bars at their head are amongst the difficulties of the navigation of
                    the river. Notwithstanding these obstacles, however, it is well adapted for boat
                    navigation, the i current being remarkably smooth and gentle, excepting at
                    Louisville in Kentucky, where it is broken by falls, the water running for
                    several miles with great rapidity, although not so much so as to be
                    insurmountable by boats. A canal round these falls, a work of great magnitude
                    and utility, has been completed. The annual range of the Ohio, from low to high
                    water, is about fifty feet; the extreme range is ten feet more. When lowest it
                    may be forded at several places above Louisville. It is generally lowest in
                    August, September, and October, and highest in December,· March, May, and June.
                    Throughout the year it is subject to sudden and very considerable elevations and
                    depressions. Near Pittsburgh it is frequently frozen over for several weeks
                    during the winter, and this has sometimes been the case four hundred miles lower
                    down. Generally, the navigation upward is suspended by floating ice for eight or
                    ten weeks in winter. When the river is at its mean height, its current is about
                    three miles an hour; when higher and rising it is more, and when very low it
                    does not exceed two miles an hour. Above two hundred steam-boats ply on the
                    Ohio, a great part of which are employed in the commerce of the states bordering
                    on the river; but they also connect with it the commerce of the states on the
                    Mississippi. The produce of the contiguous states is readily transported to this
                    channel by the numerous navigable rivers which it receives, and is thence
                    conveyed to New Orleans, the grand commercial emporium of the valley of the
                    Mississippi. The Ohio and all its tributaries cannot, it is believed, have less
                    than five thousand miles of boatable waters; and, taking all circumstances into
                    account, few rivers in the world can vie with it, either in utility or beauty.
                    From its very commencement it affords most delightful prospects. Rivers of a
                    romantic and beautiful character flow into it almost at equal distances, like
                    lateral canals. Its valleys are of extraordinary depth and fertility; generally
                    high and dry, and for the most part healthy; whilst the configuration of the
                    country <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> on the banks has much grandeur, softness,
                    and variety. Of the rivers and creeks which join the Ohio, the number is very
                    great. The following are all navigable, in moderate or high stages of the water,
                    by steam-boats, for considerable distances, viz. the Muskingum, Great Kenhawa,
                    Big Sandy, Scioto, Great Miami, Kentucky, Green, Wabash, Cumberland, and
                    Tennessee. The last is by far the largest and most important tributary of the
                    Ohio, watering considerable portions of Alabama, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Of
                    creeks and smaller rivers there arc probably nearly two hundred which enter the
                    Ohio; but a list of them would only be a dry catalogue of uncouth names. <hi
