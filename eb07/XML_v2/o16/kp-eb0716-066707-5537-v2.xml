                    greater proportion of the native population of Siberia. They chiefly inhabit the
                    banks of the Obi, in the government of Tobolsk, extending northward along the
                    river to the frontier of the Samoiedes. They are extremely rude in their habits

                    they labour only from necessity. They are diminutive in their persons, being
                    rather under than above the middle size; slender in their figures, with thin
                    legs, and their faces pale and not at all strikingly marked. The visages of the
                    men are particularly repulsive; nor do the women possess any superior
                    attractions. They are simple, timid, and full of prejudices; and their only
                    virtue seems to consist in hospitality, which they share in common with other
                    savages. They are clothed in skins, without any shirt; and their lower garment
                    consists of a species of jacket with sleeves, which reaches to the middle,
                    whilst an upper garment, with a cap, is worn in cold weather. The female’s
                    attire is not particularly becoming. The headdress is adorned with bands of
                    cloth fastened by ribbons, and by ear-rings of little coloured pearls. They
                    tattoo also the back of the hand, and the fore part of the arm and of the leg.
                    They are by no means distinguished for cleanliness, owing probably to the hard
                    labour to which they are exposed; the men, as in all barbarous countries,
                    regarding them as slaves. The Ostiaks live chiefly by fishing, and, with all the
                    disgusting filthiness of savages, they eat their fish raw. Some of the rich have
                    herds of rein-deer. With these they migrate along the banks of the rivers in
                    portable tents, composed of pieces of bark sewed together; but in winter they
                    dwell in wooden habitations, covered with earth to increase the heat. The filth
                    and stench of their abodes cannot be described. In winter they sometimes engage
                    in hunting, performing for this purpose long journeys on sledges. They are in
                    general healthy; but when they advance in years they become liable to nervous
                    and scorbutic disorders. The small-pox, in particular, has committed dreadful
                    ravages amongst them. They are exceedingly rude in their religious notions,
                    being generally pagans, and addicted to the grossest idolatries. They have in
                    all their cottages idols, which are like dolls: these are placed in the neatest
                    corner of the tent, with a little table before them to receive the offerings.
                    Here they deposit, for the use of the idol, a large horn of snuff, with little
                    pieces of willow bark, such as are here used for putting into their nostrils;
                    and they often bedaub it with fish oil: but if any misfortune befall them which
                    they imagine the idol might have averted, they cast it on the ground, and break
                    it to pieces. The idols which are the chief objects of worship are in a wooded
                    valley, the approaches to which are carefully guarded. They consist of a man and
                    woman clothed in the Ostiak dress, finely adorned with their richest furs and
                    cloths. The surrounding country is considered as sacred, so that they neither
                    hunt upon it, nor cut down the grass nor any tree. They place great confidence
                    in their sorcerers, and are deluded by the grossest and most absurd
                    superstitions. They were governed, before the Russian conquest, by their own
                    hereditary chiefs, who still administer justice amongst them; and the obedience
                    exacted from them consists chiefly in the regular payment of their tribute of
                    furs. Their amusements consist in dancing, or in romantic tales of their
                    exploits and amorous adventures; and their language has a considerable affinity
                    with that of the Finns. According to the census of 1784, the Ostiaks of the Obi
                    amounted to 30,891 males.</p>
