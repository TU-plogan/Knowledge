                <p part="N"><label type="entry">OXFORDSHIRE</label>, an inland county of England,
                    chiefly celebrated on account of its capital, which is one of the principal
                    seats of learning in the British dominions, and from which city it has derived
                    its name. It is bounded on the east by Buckinghamshire; on the south,
                    south-west, and south-east by Berkshire; on the north-east by Northamptonshire;
                    and on the north-west by the county of Warwick. The river Thames (called
                    sometimes the Isis till it reaches Oxford) is the line of demarcation on the
                    whole of its southern boundary; running between this county and Berkshire with
                    various, and, in the latter part of its course, most beautiful sinuosities. The
                    county is of a most irregular figure. Near the centre, in which the city of
                    Oxford stands, it is not more than seven miles in breadth, and at no great
                    distance to the north it is thirty-eight miles. Towards the north it resembles a
                    çonc, and to the south it is similarly contracted. Its extreme length is fifty
                    miles. The extent is estimated at 742 square miles, or 474,880 English acres. It
                    contains one city, twelve market-towns, and 207 parishes, and is divided into
                    fourteen hundreds.</p>
                <p part="N">This county is by no means uniformly beautiful. On the north, the
                    absence of hedges, which are supplied by stone walls, gives a dreary appearance
                    to the face of the country. In the centre it is generally flat and woody,
                    affording few pleasant prospects, though its trees and verdure give it the
                    semblance of wealth. The southern part, from the beauty of its rivers, the
                    gentle swelling of its hills, the verdant meadows between them, and the number
                    of highly embellished residences of rich proprietors, is a district abounding
                    with rural charms. The Chiltern Hills, the highest range in England south of the
                    river Trent, belong to this portion. They are in many parts adorned with
                    beech-woods, and in every interval of these woods cultivated quite to their
                    summits.</p>
                <p part="N">The climate of the county varies according to the elevation and
                    exposure. In the north, where no hedges impede the winter winds, the cold is
                    somewhat severe; and the Chiltern Hills are frequently enveloped in damp fogs,
                    especially in the more woody parts of them. Mr Arthur Young, in his Agricultural
                    Survey of Oxfordshire, has formed a classification of the soils in the different
                    districts of the county, which, like all similar estimates, must be received
                    with hesitation, or at least with many exceptions. The red soil, found chiefly
                    in the north, and by far the most fertile, he estimates at 79,635 acres. The
                    land, provincially called <hi rend="italic">stone-brash,</hi> found in the
                    centre, and the surface of which is often covered with stones, amounts to
                    164,023 acres. The Chiltern lands, the soil of which is a loam resting
                    everywhere on a bed of chalk, and covered with flint stones, are 64,778 acres.
                    To these are added 166,400 acres under the description of miscellaneous, which
                    comprehends all sorts of soil, from loose sand to the heaviest clay, and
                    includes the rich meadows on the banks of the rivers.</p>
                <p part="N">Although this is wholly an agricultural county, and although much
                    progress in improvement has been made of late years, yet the general practices
                    are by no means equal to the average of those of the rest of England. The most
                    beneficial husbandry is founded upon the valuable water-meadows on the banks of
                    the different streams. These are naturally so fertile that they appear to have
                    prevented that care which would render them still more productive. Little
                    attention is paid to draining, and still less to irrigation; though the good
                    effects of both these practices are obvious, and their accomplishment easy in
                    many circumstances. Some few oxen are fattened, and butter and cheese made in
                    the dairies, but the facility of navigation induces the farmers to make more hay
                    than is consumed by their stock, and to send it to distant and higher markets
                    than their own, nearer to the metropolis. On the arable fields, especially on
                    the stony lands near Burford, the use of oxen for the plough is very common; and
                    the Herefordshire breed is generally preferred for that purpose. The practice of
                    paring and burning the surface prevails in many parts of the county; and in the
                    newly enclosed lands the application of lime as a manure is highly beneficial;
                    whilst on the Chiltern lands it is not found to produce a good effect equal to
                    the expense which attends it.</p>
                <p part="N">Where the soils are so very various, the rotation of crops must
                    necessarily vary with them. On the red soils, the most usual course is, 1st,
                    turnips; 2d, barley, or springwheat; 3d, clover; 4th, wheat; 5th, peas or beans;
                    and, 6th, oats. On the stone-brash lands, the usual rotation is, 1st, turnips;
                    2d, barley; 3d, clover, to stand for two years; 4th, wheat; and, ðth, oats,
                    peas, or sometimes, but rarely, beans. On the Chiltern lands the rotations are
                    the same, with only slight variations. On both these last tracts of country, the
                    cultivation of sainfoin is very extensive; occupying on most farms from one
                    seventh to one eighth of the whole. This valuable artificial grass produces
                    heavy crops. When it was first introduced, it would remain productive for
                    fifteen or sixteen years; but since it has become more familiarized to the soil,
                    it seldom lasts more than seven years so as to be fit to make hay, but yields
                    food for sheep for one or two years afterwards. The sheep, which were formerly
                    almost all of the Berkshire breed, have of late years been superseded by the
                    race of the South Downs.</p>
                <p part="N">Oxfordshire is not a manufacturing district. Witney was long celebrated
                    for its blankets, and still retains its fame; but, in spite of the machinery
                    which has been introduced to diminish the price, the manufacturers of Yorkshire
                    and Lancashire excel those produced here. At present, however, this trade gives
                    employment to 270 persons in the town and two adjoining hamlets. At Banbury, and
                    its adjacent hamlet Neithrop, 125 persons are occupied in making plushes and
                    girth-webs, and a number in some other parishes within the county. Gloves of a
                    superior kind are made at Woodstock and its vicinity; and <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194565798?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5798-0687"/>there are
                    some of the finer kinds of cutlery made in that town. Sacking is made at
                    Abingdon and at Henley; and many axles and coach-wheels at Henley-on-Thames.</p>
                <p part="N">The rivers all discharge themselves into the Thames. They are formed by
                    the numerous small springs which are everywhere to be seen; and before they join
                    the Thames, are called the Windrush, coming from Burford and Witney; the
                    Evenlode, from Wichwood and Charlbury; and the Cherwell, from the vicinity of
                    Banbury. The Thames, composed of the stream of that name and the Isis (on which
                    a strange confusion has arisen), is navigable from near one of its sources, not
                    far from Leachlade, to the sea. The barges navigating it are from seventy-five
                    to one hundred tons burden, but the larger ones ascend no higher than Oxford.
                    From the frequent recurrence of shoals, owing to the floods in winter, and the
                    scarcity of water in summer, it is a dilatory navigation; so that frequently the
                    passage from America to London occupies less time than from Leachlade to that
                    city. The scarcity of fuel was severely experienced till within these last few
                    years; but the completion of a canal which connects the city of Oxford with the
                    collieries of Staffordshire has removed the evil, and proved highly profitable
                    to the proprietors of that important work.</p>

                <p part="N">The antiquities of this county have been accurately described, and are
                    deserving of the closest inspection. Amongst them are traces of the various
                    roads formed by the Romans, whose principal station was at Dorchester; besides
                    many funereal mounds, and the Vallum, called the Devil’s Ditch. The Priory of
                    Godstow, and the ruins of many other religious houses, exhibit the architecture
                    of different and remote ages.</p>
