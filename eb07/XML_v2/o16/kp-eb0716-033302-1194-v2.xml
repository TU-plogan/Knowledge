                    present generation, have grown up with rapidity since the establishment of the
                    cotton manufacture. It is situated in the hundred of Salford, in the county of
                    Lancaster, eight miles from Manchester, and 186 from London. It stands on the
                    river Medlock, very near the source of that and of another stream called the
                    Irk, in a district abounding in coal. Oldham had been created into a
                    market-town; and was by the reform act constituted a borough, with the power of
                    returning two members to the House of Commons. It is parochially united with
                    Prestwick, and these places comprehend ten townships, extending over 21,160
                    acres, with a population, in 1831, of 67,579 persons. The whole is a <pb

                    manufacturing district, making fustians and spinning cotton yarn, and also
                    haying a great trade in making hats. The town of Oldham is, for the most part,
                    of very recent erection, containing many large piles of buildings destined for
                    manufacturing purposes, and a proportional number of small dwellings for the
                    workmen; but all are discoloured by the smoke which issues from numerous
                    steam-engines, few of the proprietors of which reside within the town. It has a
                    fine large parish church, and, as is usual with such a population, a very great
                    variety of places of worship for the several discordant and dissenting sects. At
                    the first election for this borough, it was distinguished by its selection of Mr
                    Cobbett as one of its representatives. The population of the township of Oldham
