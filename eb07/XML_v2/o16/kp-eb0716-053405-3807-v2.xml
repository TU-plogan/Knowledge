                        >Aurichalcum</hi></label>, a metallic substance resembling gold in colour,
                    but very inferior in value. It was well known to the Romans, who often took
                    advantage of its resemblance to gold; for some sacrilegious characters, who
                    could not resist the temptation of taking gold from temples and other public
                    places, chose to conceal their guilt by replacing it with orichalcum. It was
                    thus that Julius Caesar acted when he robbed the capitol of three thousand
                    pounds weight of gold; in which he was followed by Vitellius, who despoiled the
                    temples of their gifts and ornaments, and replaced them with this inferior
                    metal. It has been a matter of dispute with philosophers and others, what the
                    composition of this metal could be, or how it was procured; it is probable, at
                    least, that it was analogous to our brass, if not wholly the same with it.</p>
                <p part="N">The Romans were not only in possession of a metallic substance, called
                    by them <hi rend="italic">orichalcum,</hi> and resembling gold in colour, but
                    they knew also the manner of making it; and the materials from which they made
                    it were the very same with those from which we make brass. There are, indeed,
                    authors of great repute who think very differently, and consider the art of
                    making brass as an invention wholly modem. Thus Μ. Cronstedt does not think it
                    just to conclude from old coins and other antiquities, that the making of brass
                    was known in the most ancient times; and the authors of the French <hi
                        rend="italic">Encyclopédie</hi> assure us that our brass is a very recent
                    invention. It appears, however, from Pliny <hi rend="italic">(Nat. Hist.</hi>
                    lib. xxxiv. § 2), and from the concurring testimony of other writers, that <hi
                        rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> was not a pure or original metal; but that its
                    basis was copper, which the Romans changed into <hi rend="italic"
                        >orichalcum</hi> by means of <hi rend="italic">cadrnia,</hi> a species of
                    earth which they threw upon the copper, and which it absorbed. It has indeed
                    been contended that the <hi rend="italic">cadmia</hi> of Pliny was native
                    arsenic; an opinion which scarcely merits confutation, but which must appear
                    extremely groundless, when we reflect that it is impossible to make either brass
                    or copper from arsenic, and that Pliny expressly calls the substance from which
                    brass was made a <hi rend="italic">stone.</hi> The testimony of Ambrose bishop
                    of Milan in the fourth century, and of Primasius bishop of Adrumetum, in Africa,
                    in the sixth, and of Isidorus bishop of Seville in the seventh, all seem to
                    confirm Pliny’s account We may therefore safely conclude, that the Romans knew
                    the method of making brass by mixing <hi rend="italic">cadmia</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic">calamine</hi> with copper. Yet it is probable they were not
                    the inventors of this art, but borrowed it from some other country. It appears
                    from a variety of testimonies that brass was made in Asia, in a manner similar
                    to that employed at Rome; and a variety of places are mentioned where it was
                    commonly made. It is supposed by some that in India, as well as in other parts
                    of Asia, it was made in the remotest ages.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to <hi rend="italic">orichalcum,</hi> it is generally
                    supposed that there were two sorts of this metal, one factitious, and the other
                    natural. The factitious, whether we consider its qualities or its composition,
                    appears to have been the same with our brass. As to the natural <hi
                        rend="italic">orichalcum,</hi> there is no impossibility in supposing that
                    copper ore may have been so intimately blended with an ore of zinc, or of some
                    other metallic substance, that the compound, when smelted, might yield a mixed
                    metal of a paler hue than copper, and resembling the colour of gold or of
                    silver.</p>
                <p part="N">We know of no country in which <hi rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> is
                    found at present; nor was it anywhere found in the age of Pliny, who does not
                    seem to have known the country where it had ever been obtained. He admits,
                    indeed, that it had been formerly dug out of the earth; but it is remarkable,
                    that in the very passage where he mentions by name the countries most celebrated
                    for the production of different kinds of copper, he only says in general,
                    concerning <hi rend="italic">orichalcum,</hi> that it had been found in other
                    countries, but without specifying any particular country. Plato acknowledges
                    that <hi rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> was a thing only talked of even in his
                    time; it was then nowhere to be met with, although in the island of Atlantis it
                    had been formerly extracted from the mine. The Greeks were in possession of a
                    metallic substance called <hi rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> before the
                    foundation of Rome. It is mentioned by Homer and by Hesiod, and by both of these
                    poets in such a manner as shows that it was then held in great esteem. Other
                    ancient writers have expressed themselves in similar terms of commendation; and
                    it is principally from the circumstance of the high reputed value of <hi
                        rend="italic">orichalcum</hi> that authors have been induced to suppose that
                    the ancient metal of this name was a natural substance, very different from the
                    factitious one in use at Rome, and probably in Asia, and which, it has been
                    shown, was in no respect different from our brass.</p>
                <p part="N">But this conclusion cannot be validly deduced from their <pb break="no"

                    would enhance its value; at east there can be no absurdity in supposing, that
                    when first introduced it was greatly prized, even though it be granted that it
                    possessed no other properties than such as uppertain to brass.</p>
                <p part="N">With respect to the etymology of the word there exists great diversity
                    of opinions. Those who write it <hi rend="italic">αuτichal-vrn</hi> think it is
