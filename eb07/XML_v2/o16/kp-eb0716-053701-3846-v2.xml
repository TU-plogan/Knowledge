                    Jupiter, Neptune, and Mercury. As these gods were visiting the earth, they
                    entered the house of Hyrieus, a native of Tanagra, in Boeotia, under the
                    character of benighted travellers, on account of his being famed for hospitality
                    to strangers. Hyrieus treated them in the best manner possible; and even killed
                    an ox, the only one he had, for their entertainment. W’ith this the gods were so
                    pleased, that they offered the old man whatever he should ask; and he having let
                    them know that he desired nothing so much as a son, they, anxious to gratify his
                    wish, caused the ox’s hide to be brought before them, and having deposited in it
                    their urine, bade him keep it under ground for nine months. He then dug for the
                    skin, and found in it a beautiful child, whom he called <hi rend="italic"
                        >Urion.</hi> The name was afterwards changed into Orion, by the corruption
                    of one letter, as Ovid observes: <hi rend="italic">Perdidit</hi><hi
                        rend="italic">antiquum</hi><hi rend="italic">littera</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >prima</hi><hi rend="italic">sonum.</hi> Orion soon became conspicuous, and
                    Diana admitted him amongst her attendants, and even became deeply enamoured of
                    him. His gigantic stature, however, displeased OEnopion king of Chios, whose
                    daughter Hero or Merope he requested in marriage. The king, not willing to deny
                    him openly, promised to make him his son-in-law as soon as he should have
                    delivered that island from wild beasts. This task, which OEnopion supposed to be
                    impracticable, was soon performed by Orion, who eagerly demanded his reward.

                    illustrious guest drunk, and in this state put out his eyes on the sea-shore,
                    where he had laid himself down to sleep, so that Orion, when he awoke from his
                    debauch, found himself blind. Directed by the sound, he then went to a
                    neighbouring forge, where he placed one of the workmen on his back, and by his
                    directions proceeded to a place where the rising sun was seen with the greatest
                    advantage. Here he turned his face towards the luminary; and, according to
                    report, he immediately recovered his eye-sight, and hastened to punish the
                    perfidious cruelty of OEnopion. Orion was believed to have been an excellent
                    workman in iron, and to have fabricated a subterranean palace for Vulcan.</p>
                <p part="N">Some say that Orion was the son of Neptune and Euryale, and that he had
                    received from his father the privilege and power of walking over the sea without
                    wetting his feet; but others assert that he was a son of Terra, like the rest of
                    the giants. He had married a nymph called Sida before his connection with the
                    family of OEnopion; but Sida was the cause of her own death, by boasting herself
                    fairer than Juno. Diodorus says that Orion was a celebrated hunter, superior to
                    the rest of mankind by his strength and uncommon stature. He built the port of
                    Zancle, and fortified the coast of Sicily against the frequent inundations of
                    the sea, by heaping up a mound of earth called Pe-lorum, on which he built a
                    temple to the gods of the sea. After his death Orion was placed in heaven, where
                    one of the constellations still bears his name. The constellation of Orion was
                    placed near the feet of the bull. It was composed of seventeen stars, in the
                    form of a man holding a sword; for which reason the poets often speak of Orion’s
                    sword. As the constellation of Orion, which rises about the 9th day of March,
                    and sets about the 21st of June, is generally supposed to be accompanied at its
                    rising with great rains and storms, it has acquired the epithet of <hi
                        rend="italic">aquo-</hi><hi rend="italic">sus,</hi> which is applied to it
                    by Virgil.</p>
