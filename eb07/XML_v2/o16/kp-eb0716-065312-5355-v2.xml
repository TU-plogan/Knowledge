                    Athenians, and which receives its name άπο <hi rend="italic">του</hi><hi

                        rend="superscript"> r</hi> Γhe original institution is mentioned by
                    Plutarch. Theseus, on returning from Crete, forgot to hang out the white sail,
                    by which his father was to be apprized of his success. This neglect proved fatal
                    to AEgeus, who threw himself into the sea, and perished. Theseus no sooner
                    reached the land, than he sent a herald to inform his father of his safe return,
                    and in the mean time he began to perform the sacrifices which he had vowed to
                    make when he first set sail from Crete. The herald, on his entrance into the
                    city, found the people in great agitation. Some lamented the king’s death,
                    whilst others, elated at the sudden news of the victory of Theseus, crowned the
                    herald with garlands in token of their joy. The herald carried back the garlands
                    on his staff to the sea-shore; and, after waiting until Theseus had finished his
                    sacrifice, he related the melancholy account of the king’s death; upon which the
                    people ran in crowds to the city, showing their grief by cries and lamentations.
                    From this circumstance, therefore, at the feast of Oschophoria, not the herald,
                    but his staff, was crowned with garlands, and the people who were present
                    exclaimed iλsλeu, ∕ou, ∕oυ, the first of which expresses haste, and the others
                    consternation or depression of spirits. The same author further mentions, that
                    Theseus, when he went to Crete, did not take with him the usual number of
                    virgins, but that instead of two of them, he took youths of his own
                    acquaintance, whom he caused to pass for women, by changing their dress, and
                    accustoming them to the ointments and perfumes of women, as well as by a long
                    and successful imitation of the female voice. The imposition succeeded. Their
                    sex was not discovered in Crete; and when Theseus had triumphed over the
                    Minotaur, he with these two young men led a procession with branches in their
                    hands, and wearing the same habits, which were afterwards worn at the
                    celebration of the festival. The branches they carried were in honour of Bacchus
                    or Ariadne, or because they returned in autumn, when the grapes were ripe.
                    Besides this procession, there was also a race, in which young men only whose
                    parents were both alive had permission to engage. It was customary for them to
                    run from the temple of Bacchus to that of Minerva, which was on the sea-shore.
                    The place where they stopped was called <hi rend="italic">δσχοφοpw,</hi> because
                    the boughs which they carried in their hands were there deposited. The reward of
                    the conqueror was a cup called <hi rend="italic">πενταπ</hi><hi rend="italic"
                        >∖</hi><hi rend="italic">οα,βve-fold,</hi> because it contained a mixture of
                    five different ingredients, wine, honey, cheese, meal, and oil.</p>
