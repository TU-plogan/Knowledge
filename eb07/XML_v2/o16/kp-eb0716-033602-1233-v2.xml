                <p part="N"><label type="entry">OLYMPIC <hi rend="smallcaps">Games</hi></label> were
                    solemn games amongst the ancient Greeks, and so called from Olympian Jupiter, to
                    whom they were dedicated. By some they are said to have been first instituted by
                    him after his victory over the sons of Titan; whilst others ascribe their
                    institution to Hercules (not the son of Alcmena, but one of much greater
                    antiquity), others to Pelops, and others to Hercules the son of Àlcmena. The
                    festival, which lasted five days, began and ended with a sacrifice to Olympian
                    Jupiter. The intermediate time was chiefly filled up by the gymnastic exercises,
                    in which all freemen of Grecian extraction were invited to contend, provided
                    they had been born in lawful wedlock, and had lived untainted by any infamous or
                    immoral conduct. The preparation for this part of the entertainment was made in
                    the gymnasium of Elis, a spacious edifice surrounded by a double range of
                    pillars, with an open area in the middle. Adjoining were various apartments,
                    containing baths, and other conveniences for the combatants. The neighbouring
                    country was gradually adorned with porticoes, shady walks, and groves,
                    interspersed with seatsand benches; the whole being originally destined to
                    relieve the fatigues and anxiety of the candidates for Olympic fame, and
                    frequented in later times by sophists and philosophers, who were fond to
                    contemplate wisdom and communicate knowledge in those delightful retreats. The
                    order of the athletic exercises, or combats, was established by Lycurgus, and
                    corresponded almost exactly to that described by Homer in the twenty-third book
                    of the Iliad, and the eighth of the Odyssey. Iphitus, we are told, appointed the
                    other ceremonies and entertainments; settled the regular return of the festival
                    at the end of every fourth year, in the month of July; and gave to the whole
                    solemnity that form and arrangement which it preserved with but little variation
                    for more than a thousand years; a period exceeding the duration of the most
                    famous kingdoms and republics of antiquity. Amongst the benefactors of Olympia
                    at a much later period was reckoned Herod, afterwards king of Judaea. On his way
                    to Rome, seeing the games neglected or dwindling into insignificance, from the
                    poverty <hi rend="italic">of</hi> theEleans, be displayed great munificence as
                    president, and provided an ample revenue for their future support and dignity.
                    Such an institution, even in its least perfect form, must have been attended
                    with advantages to society. It is sufficient to mention the suspension of
                    hostilities which took place, not only during the celebration <hi rend="italic"
                        >of</hi> the festival, but for a considerable time both before and after it.
                    Considered as a religious ceremony, to which the whole Grecian race was invited,
                    and even enjoined to assist in its celebration, it was well adapted to
                    facilitate intercourse, to promote knowledge, to soften prejudice, and to
                    accelerate the progress of civilization. Greece, particularly Peloponnesus, was
                    the centre from which the adventurous spirit of its inhabitants had diffused
                    innumerable colonies throughout the surrounding nations. To these
                    widely-separated communities, which, notwithstanding their common origin, seemed
                    to have lost all connection and correspondence, the Olympiad served as a common
                    bond of alliance and a point of re-union. The celebrity of this festival
                    continually attracted to it the characters most distinguished for genius and
                    enterprise, whose fame would have otherwise been unknown and lost in the extent
                    of the Grecian territory. The remote inhabitants, not only of European Greece,
                    but of Asia and Africa, being assembled at the worship of their common gods,
                    were thus trained to the sense of a general interest, and excited to the pursuit
                    of national honour and prosperity. Strangers of similar dispositions might
                    confirm in Elis the sacred and indissoluble ties of hospitality. If their
                    communities were endangered by any barbarous power, they might there solicit
                    assistance from their Grecian brethren; and, upon other occasions, they might
                    explain the benefits which, in peace or war, their respective countries were
                    best qualified to communicate. And thus the Olympic festival might serve the
                    purpose of resident ambassadors, and of other institutions alike unknown to
                    antiquity.</p>
