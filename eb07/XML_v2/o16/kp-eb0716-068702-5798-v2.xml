                    This great river of Central Asia has its source in the high lands of Pamer, a
                    branch of the main ridge of the Hindu Coosh Mountains, which, extending
                    northward, forms the boundary between Thibet and Great Bukharia. It issues from
                    a glacier in a narrow valley 200 or 300 yards broad, which is enclosed on three
                    sides by the high snowy mountain called Pooshtikhur. The stream is seen flowing
                    from under the ice, which is stated to be at least forty spears in depth. The
                    spring itself is buried under the great mass of ice whence it issues, and cannot
                    be seen; but there is no doubt of its issuing from this spot, as there is no
                    other open or break from which it could issue at any more distant point. The
                    small but swelling stream is carried north in this narrow valley for five coss
                    or ten miles; at eight miles it is twenty yards broad, and breast deep; and on
                    leaving the valley, after being joined by many other springs from the same hill,
                    it is fifty yards broad, and about four feet deep. It is joined by the Shiber
                    about sixty miles from its source, which is sixty yards broad. The Oxus,
                    however, is much broader, having been joined by seven or eight streams from knee
                    to middle deep, and from ten to thirty yards broad. It flows in a south-west
                    direction for 120 miles, and then meets a high ridge of mountains running from
                    west-north-west to east-south-east. From this point it takes a west-south-west
                    course through the wild and mountainous regions which separate the country of
                    Balkh from Independent Tartary, until it breaks through the ridge in its
                    progress southward, and meets some of the ridges which diverge from the main
                    ridge of Hindu Coosh. In this part of its upper course, being a distance of more
                    than 300 miles, it is confined between the mountains, and is joined by numerous
                    streams, from two to four of which are crossed in each day’s journey along its
                    left or southern bank, besides two very considerable rivers, namely, the
                    Soorkhab or Kurategeen River, and the Kok-cha or Budukshan River. It also
                    receives the tribute of many streams from the north, the names of which are
                    unknown in Europe. Its course is now west-north-west; and it passes the
                    far-famed city of Samarcand, which, however, is not situated on its banks, but
                    on a river flowing into it. To Bukharia, which is situated on one of its
                    tributary streams, it has a northerly course of 250 miles, being forced off in
                    this direction by the high land of Hindu Coosh, which extends north of the ridge
                    a considerable distance, and runs over a flat country, sandy, and little better
                    than a desert. From this point to Ourgunge is a distance of 400 miles, over a
                    desert of at least 300 miles, with only a few habitations of horse-breeders
                    along the banks. On the left bank is a forest the greater part of the way,
                    through which those who pass are obliged to carry their provisions for eight or
                    ten days at a time. Mr Elphinstone has thus traced <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194565811?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-5811-0688"/>its course
                    for 900 miles; and other travellers in the East have gleaned scanty information
                    respecting its lower course till it terminates in the Sea of Aral after a course
                    of 1200 miles. Frazer mentions, on the authority of a native traveller or
                    merchant, that after passing the town of Ourgunge, it makes a turn to the east,
                    and is joined by the Seer or Sihon (the Jaxartes), when both spread out into a
                    large lake, which has no outlet, its waters being absorbed by the sand of which
                    the surrounding country is composed. Frazer seems to think that this account
                    corresponds so well with that of the Arabian and the Persian geographers, that
                    there is no denying credit to it. But the accounts of native travellers are
                    proverbially so erroneous, that no reliance can be placed upon them. They
                    generally travel for the purposes of trade, and pay little attention to
                    thegeography of the country, or other details; and this, joined to their known
                    careless-nessof truth, renders their testimony of little value. Colonel Kinneir
                    mentions, that Sir John Malcolm conversed with a native, who assured him that
                    the termination of the river was in the Caspian Sea. This opinion is, however,
                    strongly combated by Mr Frazer, who affirms that there is nothing like evidence
                    to prove that the Oxus ever reached the Caspian Sea; that this notion rests on
                    vague tradition, founded on ignorance; and that all the native authorities who
                    speak directly to this point constantly say that the Jeyhoon or Ammu falls into
                    the lake of Khaurezm. The ancient geographers were ignorant that there were two
                    distinct lakes in Asia, namely, the Caspian Sea, and that of Aral. They supposed
                    that both formed one lake; and hence their error was extremely natural, in
                    giving a termination to the Oxus in the Caspian, the only outlet which they knew
                    to exist in the direction of its stream. But we know for certain that no river
                    falls into the Caspian to the south of the bay of Mangulshuck; for the caravans
                    that pass and repass from Astrabad to Khyvah, and from thence to Mangulshuck, do
                    not cross a single stream, or meet with a drop of running fresh water, after
                    crossing the river Attruck near Λstrabad. It is equally certain, from the same
                    evidence, that no branch of the Oxus falls into the Caspian to the northward of
                    Mangulshuck. Mr Frazer, in answer to his inquiries concerning the rise of the
                    Oxus or Ammu, was informed by a traveller who saw it in the summer season near
                    Balkh, that it was as large as the Jumna in its fullest season, and perfectly
                    navigable for boats, which are in common use for crossing the stream, and for
                    the conveyance both of goods and passengers from Balkh and from Bukharia to
                    Ourgunge and Khyvah. At Bukharia it is a very large river, the stream being at
                    no time less than a thousand yards wide; and in summer, when the snow melts, it
                    sometimes spreads to the breadth of four miles. It is deep, and navigable for
                    boats, by which means an active intercourse is maintained in most parts of its
                    course. <hi rend="smallcaps">(f.)</hi></p>
