                    north-east of Germany, but consisting also of two other portions separated from
                    it, though both of them are of small extent. One of these smaller divisions in
                    the north is called the principality of Lubeck, consisting of a small territory
                    surrounded by the Danish territory of Holstein, and some small spots on the
                    banks of the 1rave, and near Schwartau, adjoining to the territory of the
                    republic of Lubeck. The other of these small divisions is on the western side of
                    the Rhine; it is called the principality of Birkenfeld, and is whol!y surrounded
                    by the Prussian province of the Lower Fhme. The whole of these three divisions
                    extend over 2 21 square miles, and comprehend nine cities, ten mar ket-towns,
                    and 776 villages and hamlets, with 233,400 inhabitants, of whom 161,420 adhere
                    to the Lutheran church, 68,000 are Catholics, and the remainder, excepting 900
                    Jews, are Calvinists. The population of the principality of Lubeck is 19,070,
                    that of Birkenfeld is 21,180, and the remainder is found in Oldenburg proper.
                    The revenues of the state amount to about L. 130,000 annually, arising partly
                    from tolls on the Weser, and partly from taxes on foreign goods, but chiefly
                    from domains. The state has no debt. The army consists of 1650 men; but the
                    state is bound to contribute to the force of the German confederacy a contingent
                    of 2177 men. The principal rivcr is the Weser, into which the smaller streams
                    flow, and it is the ordinary channel of marine commerce. The soil is in general
                    poor and sandy, but near to the rivers there are some rich marshes, obtained by
                    draining and embankments, which fatten cattle, and afford the productions of the
                    dairy. The cultivation is badly conducted in the large division. There are a
                    great number of small proprietors, who cultivate their own fields, and thereby
                    procure a bare subsistence. The climate is raw, cold, and exceedingly
                    variable.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Oldenburg,</hi> a city, the capital of the duchy of
                    the same name in the north-east of Germany. It is situated on the river Hunte,
                    which is navigable to the Weser, and is surrounded with walls planted with lime
                    trees, being well built and clean, but in an antique style. The duke has a large
                    and old, but not an elegant palace, on the grand parade, adjoining to the city.
                    The city contains two churches, two hospitals, and 660 houses, with 5420
                    inhabitants, who subsist chiefly from the expenditure of the court, of the
                    tribunals, and of the civil officers of the government. It has little trade
                    excepting at its two great fairs. Long. 8. 6.1. E. Lat. 53. 8. 33. N.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Oldenburg,</hi><hi rend="italic">Henry,</hi> was
                    born in the duehy of Bremen, in Lower Saxony. During the long parliament, he was
                    appointed consul for his countrymen, at London, after the usurpation of
                    Cromwell; but being discharged of that employment, he was appointed tutor to the
                    Lord Henry O’Bryan, an Irish nobleman, whom he attended to the university of
                    Oxford, where lie was admitted to study in the Bodleian Library in the beginning
                    of the year 1656. He was afterwards tutor to William Lord Cavendish, and was
                    acquainted with Milton the poet. During his residence at Oxford he became
                    acquainted with the members of that body, which there gave birth to the Royal
                    Society, upon the foundation of which he was elected a fellow; and when the
                    society had found it necessary to have two secretaries, he was chosen as
                    assistant secretary to Dr Wilkins. He applied himself with extraordinary
                    diligence to the business of his office, and in the year 1664 began the
                    publication of the <hi rend="italic">Philosophical Transactions,</hi> which he
                    continued to publish to No. xxxvi. 25th June 1677. After this the publication
                    was discontinued till the January following, when it was again resumed by his
                    successor in the office of secretary, Mr Nehemiah Grew, who carried it on till
                    the end of February 1678. Mr Oldenburg died at his house at Charlcton, near
                    Greenwich, in Kent, in August 1678.</p>
