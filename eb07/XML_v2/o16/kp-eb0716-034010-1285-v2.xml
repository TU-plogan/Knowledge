                        >Proselyte,</hi> a famous rabbi of the first century, and author of the
                    Chaldaic Targum on the Pentateuch. He flourished in the time of Jesus Christ,
                    according to the Jewish writers, who all agree that he was, at least in some
                    part of his life, contemporary with Jonathan Ben Uzziel, author of the second
                    Targum upon the prophets. Prideaux thinks that he was the elder of the two, for
                    several reasons, the chief of which is the purity of the style of his Targum, in
                    which it comes nearest to that part of Daniel and Ezra which is in the Chaldaic,
                    and being the truest standard of that language, is consequently the most
                    ancient, since that language, as well as others, was in a constant fluctuation,
                    and in every age continued deviating from the original. Nor does there appear to
                    be any reason why Jonathan Ben Uzziel, when he undertook his Targum, should pass
                    over the law, and begin with the prophets, except it be that he found Onkelos
                    had done this work before him, and with a success which he could not exceed.</p>
                <p part="N">Azarias, the author of a book entitled <hi rend="italic">Meor
                        Enαirn,</hi> or the “light of the eyes,” tells us, that Onkelos was a
                    proselyte in the time of Hillel and Samnai, and lived to see Jonathan Ben
                    Uzziel, one of the prime scholars of Hille). These three doctors flourished
                    twelve years before Christ, according to the chronology of Gauz, who adds, that
                    0n- kelos was contemporary with Gamaliel the elder, St Paul’s master, who was
                    the grandson of Hillel. However, he same Gauz, by his calculation, places
                    Onkelos a hundred years after Christ, and, in order to adjust his opinion with
                    that of Azarias, extends the life of Onkelos to a great length. The Talmudists
                    tell us that he assisted at the funeral of Gamaliel, and was at a prodigious
                    expense to render it magnificent. Prideaux observes, that the Targum of Onkelos
                    is rather a version than a paraphrase, since it renders the Hebrew text word for
                    word, and for the most part accurately <hi rend="superscript"> 7</hi> and
                    exactly, and is by far the best of the kind; wherefore it has always been held
                    amongst <pb break="no" facs="nls:194561298?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-1298-0341"/>the Jews in much greater esteem than the other
                    Targums; and being set to the same musical notes with the Hebrew text, is
                    thereby capable of being read in the same tone with it in their public
                    assemblies. From the excellency and accuracy of the Targum of Onkelos, Prideaux
                    also concludes that he must have been a native Jew, since, without having been
                    bred up from his birth in the Jewish religion and learning, long exercised in
                    all the rites and doctrines of both, and being also thoroughly skilled in both
                    the Hebrew and Chaldaic languages, as far as a native Jew could be, he could
                    scarcely have been thoroughly adequate to the work which he executed. The same
                    author also thinks, that the representing him as a proselyte may have proceeded
                    from the error of supposing him to have been the same with Akilas or Aquila of
                    Pontus, author of the Greek Targum or version of the prophets and Hagiographia,
                    and who was indeed a Jewish proselyte.</p>
