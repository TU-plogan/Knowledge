                <p part="N"><label type="entry">OMBRE</label>, a well-known game at cards, borrowed
                    from the Spaniards, and played by two, by three, or by five persons, but
                    generally by three. When three play at this game, nine cards are dealt to each
                    party; the whole ombre pack being only forty, because the eights, nines, and
                    tens are thrown out of the pack. There are two sorts of counters for stakes, the
                    greater and the lesser. The last has the same proportion to the other as a penny
                    has to a shilling. Of the greater counters each man stakes one for the game; and
                    one of the lesser for passing for the hand, when eldest, and for every card
                    taken in. As to the order and value of the cards, the ace of spades, called <hi
                        rend="italic">spadillo,</hi> is always the highest trump, in whatsoever
                    suite the trump be; the <hi rend="italic">manille,</hi> or black deuce, is the
                    second; and the <hi rend="italic">bαstο,</hi> or ace of clubs, is always the
                    third. The next in order is the king, the queen, the knave, the seven, the six,
                    the five, four, and three. Of the black there are eleven trumps, and of the red,
                    twelve. The least small cards of the red are always the best, and the most of
                    the black, except the deuce and red seven, both of which are called the <hi
                        rend="italic">manilles,</hi> and are always second when the red is a trump.
                    The red ace, when a trump, enters into the fourth place, and is called <hi
                        rend="italic">punto</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> otherwise it is only called
                    an ace. The three principal cards are called <hi rend="italic">matadores,</hi>
                    and have this privilege, that they are not obliged to attend an inferior trump
                    when it leads; but, for want of a small trump, the person may renounce small
                    trumps, and play any other card; and when these are all in the same hand, the
                    others pay three of the greatest counters a piece. with these three for a
                    foundation, the player may count as many matadores as he has cards in an unin
                    terrupted series of trumps; and for all these the others are to pay one counter
                    a piece. He who has the first hand is called <hi rend="italic">ombre,</hi> and
                    has his choice of playing the game, of naming the trump, and of taking in as
                    many or as few cards as he pleases; and after him the second, &amp;c. But if he
                    does not name the trump before he looks on the card which he has taken in, any
                    other may prevent him, by naming what trump he pleases. He who has the first
                    hand should neither take in nor play, unless he has at least three sure tricks
                    in his hand; for, as he wins the game who wins most tricks, he that can win five
                    of the nine has a sure game. This is also the case if he win four, and can so
                    divide the tricks that one person may win two, and the other three.</p>
                <p part="N">If a person play without discarding or changing any of the cards, this
                    is called playing <hi rend="italic">sans prendre</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi>
                    and if another win more tricks than he, he is said to win <hi rend="italic"
                        >codille.</hi> The oversights in the course of the game are called <hi
                        rend="italic">beasts</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and if the ombre wins all
                    the nine tricks, it is called winning the <hi rend="italic">vole.</hi> ln ombre
                    by five, which many, on account of its not requiring so close an attention,
                    prefer to that by three, only eight cards a piece are dealt; and five tricks
                    must be won, otherwise the ombre is beasted. Here the person who undertakes the
                    game, after naming the trump, calls a king to his assistance; upon which the
                    person in whose hand the king is, without discovering himself, is to assist him
                    as a partner, and to share his fate. If, between both, they can make five
                    tricks, the ombre wins two counters, and the auxiliary king only one; but when
                    the counters are even, they divide them equally. If the ombre venture the game
                    without calling in any king, this too is called playing <hi rend="italic">saris
                        prendre</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> in which case the other four are all
                    against him, and he must win five tricks alone, or be beasted. The rest is much
                    the same as by three.</p>
