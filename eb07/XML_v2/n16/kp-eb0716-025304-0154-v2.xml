                    with another tract called Bedlingtonshire, on the southeast. But in a general
                    description it is unnecessary to attend to these distinctions. The Tweed may,
                    therefore, be considered as the northern boundary of the county, and in this
                    case it will include the towns of Berwick and Norham. Lindisfarne or Holy
                    Island, on the north-east cdast, which in like manner belongs to Durham, is
                    situated about two miles from the mainland, opposite to the mouth of the brook
                    Lindis, and accessible to all kinds of conveyance at low water. Although about
                    nine miles ’ in circuit, it contains, little more than 1000 acres, the half of
                    which is sand-banks. These several portions may extend to something more than
                    100 square miles, or about one twentieth part of the whole. In this view,
                    Northumberland is situated between 54. 51. and 55. 48. north latitude, and
                    between 1. and 2. 27. west longitude from London. Its greatest extent from north
                    tα south is sixty-four miles, and from east to west it varies from about
                    forty-six miles, which is its usual breadth between the river Tyne on the south
                    and the Coquet on the north, till it terminates at the town of Berwick on the
                    north, in a breadth of only five or six miles. According to Mr Rickman’s Report
                    of 1831, the area of the county is 1871 square miles, or 1,197,000 acres; but
                    the actual returns from the parishes give only 1,165,430 acres, a difference
                    which is supposed to arise from the inaccurate measurement of the mountainous
                    and uncultivated part of the western division of the county. Nearly one third of
                    the county is scarcely capable of beneficial cultivation.</p>
                <p part="N">It is divided into six wards, namely, Tindale, Coquetdale, Glendale,
                    Bamborough, Morpeth, and Castle, the first three comprising the western and
                    mountainous district, and the second three the coast lands on the east. These
                    last, though extending over only one fourth of the county, are by far the most
                    wealthy and populous, owing chiefly to the great coal-works in Castle ward, near
                    the town of Newcastle, and along the banks of the Tyne. It contains five
                    deaneries and seventy-three parishes, all of which are in the archdeaconry of
                    Northumberland and diocese of Durham.</p>
                <p part="N">All the western side of this county is mountainous, from the common
                    boundary with Durham on the south, almost to the valley of the Tweed on the
                    north; but this extensive tract, comprising more than a third of the whole area,
                    is not all of the same character; the northern, or Cheviot Hills, extending to
                    about 90,000 acres, being mostly all green nearly to their summits,
                    comprehending many narrow but fertile glens, and affording excellent pastures
                    for the breed of sheep to which they have given their name; whilst those to the
                    west and south are, in general, open solitary wastes, covered with heath, and of
                    very little value. On the coast, from the mouth of the Tyne to that of the
                    Tweed, and also on the north, throughout its whole breadth <pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194560167?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-0167-0254"/>from
                    Belford to Mindrum, the country is, with few exceptions, level and rich, with a
                    soil which in some places is a strong clay, and in others a dry loam, but almost
                    everywhere very productive, under the enlightened system of cultivation which
                    prevails so generally throughout Northumberland.</p>
                <p part="N">The principal rivers of the county are the Tyne, Blyth, Wansbeck,
                    Coquet, Ain, and the Tweed, all of which fall into the sea, carrying with them
                    the tribute of many smaller streams. The Till, which empties itself into the
                    Tweed, is also a considerable rivulet. The Tyne and Tweed are by far the most
                    important, the tide flowing up the former sixteen miles, and up the latter eight
                    or ten miles; whilst the navigation of the other rivers is confined to a small
                    distance from their mouths. Both of these have long been celebrated for their
                    salmon fisheries, which yield great rents, and afford a valuable article of
                    trade with London, to which the fish are sent packed in pounded ice, by which
                    means they are presented in the market in nearly as fresh a state as if they had
                    been newly taken from the water.</p>
                <p part="N">Northumberland has been long distinguished for its subterranean
                    treasures, which are the main source of its wealth and population. Of these,
                    coal, which abounds in most parts of it, is by far the most important. It is of
                    the best quality in the south-eastern quarter, on the banks of the Tyne, whence
                    those vast quantities are exported which supply the great consumption of the
                    metropolis, as well as the coasting and foreign trade. In some years the
                    exportation from the port of Newcastle has amounted to upwards of 600,000
                    chaldrons of fifty-three cwt. each, and probably, as much more has been sent
                    from Sunderland and consumed in Northumberland and Durham, the same coal-field
                    extending across the Tyne to the latter county. This coal is all of the kind
                    called “caking coal,” which melts and runs together in the fire, and, when of
                    the best quality, leaves very few ashes. Calculations have been made as to the
                    extent of this tract, the quantity of coal which it may contain, and the period
                    when it must be exhausted; but upon this last point there is a great difference
                    of opinion, some estimating that the supplies must cease in three hundred years,
                    some not in less than eight hundred, whilst by others it is held to be almost
                    inexhaustible. Of the coal found in Bamborough, Islandshire, and Glendale ward,
                    the seams are in general thin, and the quality inferior, not caking nor burning
                    to a cinder, but yielding a great quantity of ashes. ⅛ This is used only for
                    home consumption and for burning limestone, a purpose for which it is well
                    adapted; and through all this district coal and lime are generally found
                    together. The south-eastern quarter, which is so rich in coal, is destitute of
                    limestone. Lead ore abounds in the mountains on the south-west, particularly
                    towards the head of that branch of South Tyne called Allendale, where it has
                    long been wrought to a considerable extent. Iron ore is found in many parts;
                    stone marl near Tweedside, shell marl in Glendale ward, and various sorts of
                    sandstone or freestone are obtained in almost every quarter, somé of it
                    affording tolerable slates for roofing, and flags for floors. Excellent
                    grindstones are raised in the sandstone quarries, of which a great many are
                    exported from Camus and Warkworth.</p>
                <p part="N">The agriculture of Northumberland is an object which is only second in
                    interest and importance to its coal works. Almost all those branches of rural
                    economy for one or more of which other districts are celebrated, may here be
                    found combined into one system, and conducted upon the same farms. One finds
                    here the Leicester sheep and the shorthorned cattle of Durham and Yorkshire,
                    both in great perfection; the turnips of Norfolk cultivated upon the drill
                    system of Scotland; the well-dressed fallows of East Lothian and Berwickshire;
                    and that regular alternation of tillage and grazing which is, of all other
                    courses of cropping, the one best adapted to sustain and even to improve the
                    productiveness of the soil. These remarks apply in an especial manner to the
                    northern part of the county, where the farms are in general large, and the
                    occupiers men of education and liberal acquirements. This quarter has been long
                    distinguished as a school of agriculture, to which pupils are sent, some of them
                    gentlemen of fortune, from various parts; a character for which it is eminently
                    indebted, as well as for other distinctions, to the late Messrs Culley, who were
                    amongst the most extensive and successful farmers in the kingdom. The common
                    period of leases, at least in the northern district, is twenty-one years,
                    although many are shorter, and upon a few estates no leases are granted. By the
                    account taken for the purpose of levying the property-tax in the year 1815, it
                    was found that the annual value of the real property amounted to L.1,240,594. It
                    may be worthy of remark here, that at the seat of the Earl of Tankerville,
                    called Chillingham Castle, there still exists in the forest the remains of the
                    herds of wild cattle which are supposed to have formerly abounded in this
                    island, and to have been the origin of our races of cows.</p>
                <p part="N">Northumberland is not eminently a manufacturing county. Some
                    wool-combing is carried on at Hexham, and some thread is spun in the villages;
                    but the chief branches of manufacturing industry are those depending upon the
                    cheapness of iron and coal, and are chiefly carried on within and around the
                    town of Newcastle, to which head in this work the reader is referred.</p>
                <p part="N">The population of the county at the four decennial enumerations has been
                    as follows:—In 1801 it amounted to 157,101, in 1811 to 172,161, in 1821 to
                    198,965, and in 1831 to 223,000. The burials, including both the registered and
                    unregistered, in the ten years from 1821 to 1831, appear to have been one in
                    fifty-two of the whole number of inhabitants then living. The illegitimate
                    births were one in fifteen of the whole number born.</p>
                <p part="N">The occupations of the people, according to the returns arranged by Mr
                    Rickman, were in 1831 as follows:</p>

                    America, situated between 42. 30. and 49. north latitude, and 87. 30. and 95.
                    30. west longitude. It is bounded on the north by the British possessions and
                    Lake Superior, on the east by Lake Michigan, on the south by Illinois, and on
                    the west by the Mississippi, and a line drawn from the source of that river to
                    the northern boundary. In length it extends about 500 miles, and in breadth
                    about 400 miles. In some of its physical features this territory resembles that
                    of Missouri; but a greater proportion of it is covered with wood. It is,
                    generally speaking, a hilly country, with the exception of extensive levels of
                    prairie land. At the western extremity of Lake Superior are the Cabotian
                    Mountains; and near the mineral district are the Smoky Mountains. The chief
                    rivers, with the exception of the Mississippi (see the article <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Mississippi),</hi> are the Ouisconsin, Fox, Chippeway, St
                    Croix, Rum, St Francis, and Savannah of the Mississippi. Grand Portage,
                    Ontonagon, Montreal, Mauvaise, Boisbrule, St Louis, and nearly fifty smaller
                    streams, discharge themselves into Lake Superior. Riviere la Pluie falls into
                    the Lake of the Woods. None of the lake rivers have a course of more than a
                    hundred and fifty miles, and few of them more than fifty miles. The Ouisconsin,
                    the largest tributary of the Mississippi in this territory, rises in the
                    northern interior of the country, and interlocks with the Montreal of Lake
                    Superior. It has a course of between three and four hundred miles, with a
                    shallow and rapid current, which is, however, generally navigable by boats in
                    good states of the water, and is 800 yards wide at its mouth. There is i portage
                    of only half a mile between this and Fox River, lt extends over a level prairie,
                    across which, from river to 'iver, there is a water communication for periogues
                    in high dates of the water. Fox River has a course of 260 miles, flowing through
                    Winnebago Lake, and into the Green Bay of Lake Superior. The country on its
                    banks is very fine, and the climate is salubrious. Another considerable
                    tributary of the Mississippi is the Chippeway, which enters it immediately below
                    Lake Pepin. It is half a mile wide at its mouth, and has communication, by a
                    short portage, with Lake Superior. This is one of the very best regions for
                    hunters. In the upper part of the country, buffaloes, elks, bears, and deer, arc
                    common. Beavers, otters, and muskrats, are taken for their furs. The trappers,
                    and also the Indian tribes, pursue their prey over an immense extent of prairie.
                    The soil is fertile in some parts, and no doubt the enterprise and industry of
                    civilized men will ere long bring a great portion of it under cultivation. White
                    and yellow pine and white birch are common amongst the forest trees. All the
                    water courses, ponds, and marshes, are covered with wild rice, which the
                    inhabitants use as one of their chief articles of food. The elevation of the
                    head waters of the Mississippi is estimated at 1330 feet above the level of the
                    sea.</p>
                <p part="N">This country abounds in minerals, and rich veins of valuable ore have
                    been discovered and wrought to considerable advantage. Great quantities of <hi

                    also found in it. The lead-mine district is situated in the lower part of the
                    country, between Rock River and the Ouisconsin. The chief establishments of the
                    present miners are on Fever River, and the mines are reckoned as rich and
                    productive as any in the world. The following are the quantities produced in
                    each year from 1823 to 1832.</p>

                <p part="N">The great increase in the years 1828 and 1829 reduced the price so low
                    as to render the working of the mines in a great measure unprofitable. For
                    upwards of half a century it has been confidently asserted that great quantities
                    of native copper may be found along the northern shore of Lake Superior. On the
                    Outogon there is a vast abundance of pure copper in detached masses. One of
                    these masses is estimated to weigh 3000 lbs. The common reports, however, of the
                    existence of large veins of copper, have not been confirmed by recent
                    travellers; but there are nevertheless sufficient indications that mines of this
                    metal are to be met with in this territory. Besides lead, iron is found in
                    various places, and in great abundance.</p>
                <p part="N">In the southern portion of this large territory the climate is
                    comparatively mild, and not unlike that of the northern belt of Missouri. At the
                    Falls of St Anthony, on the Mississippi, the summers are temperate, whilst the
                    winters are extremely cold. The sources of the Mississippi are in a region
                    extremely inclement. At St Peters, in 1820, the mean temperature of January was
                    zero, a degree of cold which is never experienced in any part of the United
                    States that has been extensively settled. The summer, however, was temperate,
                    and the atmosphere beautifully serene. Even at Prairie du Chien, although much
                    more temperate, the winters are extremely severe. At the Falls of Packagama&gt;
                    on the Mississippi, about 1200 feet above the level of the sea, water has been
                    known to freeze to a considerable extent in the middle of July. The following
                    table, extracted from the work of an American writer, will convey the best idea
                    of the nature of the climate in different parts of the North-west Territory:</p>

                <p part="N">The North-west Territory is divided, or rather marked off, into four
                    counties, which have been named and partially settled by whites; but there are
                    still a number of Indians in it. Prairie du Chien, Cassville, and Green Bay, are
                    the largest villages; and the whole population has been estimated at 16,000.
                    Green Bay settlement is situated at the outlet of Fox River, and contains 952
                    inhabitants. A few miles up Fox River, in a most romantic position, there is an
                    interesting Episcopal missionary settlement. Prairie du Chien is of importance
                    as a place of outfit from the Lower Mississippi to the upper waters. It is
                    situated near a beautiful prairie, and there are flour-mills in its vicinity.
                    Most of the permanent settlers here are a mixed race <hi rend="italic">of</hi>
                    Indians and whites. Frequent voyages are made from St Louis to Prairie du Chien
                    in keel-boats. The richest copper mines, and the largest masses of pure copper,
                    are said to be found here. One third of the land is capable of being farmed, and
                    about one sixth is well timbered.</p>
                <p part="N">The whole of this vast region has been for some time politically
                    connected with Michigan for the sake of convenience, but it must ultimately
                    constitute a state by itself. Most of the lands are owned by Indians, or by the
                    United States; the latter havingyecently made a purchase from the former <hi
                        rend="italic">of</hi> a very considerable tract of country. The following
                    description of the Indian territory is from Flint’s Geography: “The tract
                    reserved to the Indians, of 500,000 acres, is also a fine body of land,
                    containing very extensive and fertile meadows along the Fox River, with
                    woodlands of good timber, in which there is no underbrush. The writer proceeded
                    thirty-eight miles from Green Bay, up the Fox River, to Winnebago Lake, passing
                    rapids whose whole descent is about 100 feet. The river is ninety yards wide,
                    its bed a limestone rock, the banks from fifty to 150 feet high. The water is of
                    course adequate to move any machinery. Doty’s Island, in the outlet of the lake,
                    contains 400 acres heavily timbered. The bank of the lake itself is covered with
                    trees of a height and diameter indicating the nature of the soil, which is a
                    black loam, rich and deep. The Cliff, so called, is a mountain 300 feet above
                    the level of the lake, presenting a picturesque prospect. The main roads leading
                    from Green Bay to Chicago, Ouisconsin, Portage, the Lead Mines, and Galena, will
                    probably pass this point. Beyond this the mountain recedes three or four miles
                    from the shore, forming a valley fifteen miles in length, of as fertile land as
                    can be found in the United States, terminating to the south in a dry prairie
                    called Cass Plains. These plains contain 25,000 acres of rich land, which are
                    already cleared by nature for the plough, and they extend to the Manitoovoc
                    River. Soon after begin the prairies, which run, with scarcely any timber, to
                    the Mississippi. In the whole distance, near 100 miles, passed by the writer,
                    the land seems to be of the kind and aspect just described, namely, rich
                    prairie, with occasional growths of fine timber, equally indicative of
                    fertility. A road from the mouth of Fond du Lac River to Galena would be of
                    great advantage to the mines, and a direct route for one might be followed at a
                    trifling expense. It would facilitate the transportation of property from New
                    York by the canal and the lakes</p>
