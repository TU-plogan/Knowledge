                        Children</hi></label>. The following observations and directions were
                    published in the Annual Register (vol. vi. p. 130), as the results of long
                    experience. The <pb break="no" facs="nls:194560908?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-0908-0311"/>child should be laid, the first month, upon a
                    thin mattress, rather longer than itself, which the nurse should keep upon her
                    lap, that the child may always lie straight, and only sit up as the nurse slants
                    the mattress. To set a child quite upright before the end of the first month,
                    would hurt the eyes, by making the white part of the eye appear below the upper
                    eyelid. Afterwards the nurse will begin to set it up and dance it by degrees.
                    The child must be kept as dry as possible.</p>
                <p part="N">The clothing should be very light, and not much longer than the child,
                    that the legs may be got at with ease, in order to have them often rubbed in the
                    day with a warm hand or flannel, and in particular the inside of them.</p>
                <p part="N">Rubbing a child all over takes off scurf, and causes the blood to
                    circulate. The one breast should be rubbed with the hands one way, and the other
                    the other way, night and morning at least.</p>
                <p part="N">The ankle bones and the inside of the knees should be rubbed twice a
                    day; this will strengthen those parts, and make the child stretch its knees and
                    keep them flat, which is the foundation of an erect and graceful person.</p>
                <p part="N">A nurse ought to keep a child as little in her arms as possible, lest
                    the legs should be cramped, and the toes turned inwards. Further, she should
                    always keep the child’s legs loose. The oftener the posture is changed the
                    better. Tossing a child about, and exercising it in the open air in fine
                    weather, is of the greatest service. In cities, children are not to be kept in
                    hot rooms, but to have as much air as possible. Want of exercise is the cause of
                    large heads, weak and knotted joints, a contracted breast, which occasions
                    coughs and stuffed lungs, an ill-shaped person, and waddling gait, besides a
                    numerous train of other ills.</p>
                <p part="N">The child's flesh is to be kept perfectly clean, by constantly washing
                    its limbs, and likewise its neck and ears, beginning with warm water, till by
                    degrees it will not only bear, but like to be washed with cold water.</p>
                <p part="N">Rising early in the morning is good for all children, provided they
                    awake of themselves, which they generally do; but they are never to be waked out
                    of their sleep, and as soon as possible to be brought to regular sleeps in the
                    day. When laid in bed or in cradle, their legs are always to be laid
                    straight.</p>
                <p part="N">Children, till they are two or three years old, must nêver be suffered
                    to walk long enough at a time to be weary.</p>
                <p part="N">Girls might easily be trained to the proper management of children, if a
                    premium were given in free schools, workhouses, and other places, to those that
                    brought up the finest child to one year old.</p>
                <p part="N">If the mother cannot suckle the child, get a wholesome cheerful woman
                    with young milk, who has been used to attend young children. After the first six
                    months, small broths, and innocent foods of any kind, may do as well as living
                    wholly upon milk. A principal thing to be always attended to is, to give young
                    children constant exercise, and to keep them in a proper posture.</p>
                <p part="N">With regard to the child’s dress in the day, let it be a shirt, a
                    petticoat of fine flannel two or three inches longer than the child’s feet, with
                    a dimity top, commonly called a boddice coat, to tie behind; and over that a
                    surcingle made of fine buckram, two inches broad, covered over with satin or
                    fine ticken, with a ribbon fastened to it to tie it on, which answers every
                    purpose of stays, and has none of their inconveniences. Over this put a robe, or
                    a slip and frock, or whatever you like best, provided it is fastened behind, and
                    not much longer than the child’s feet, that their motions may be strictly
                    observed. Two caps are to be put on the head, till the child has got most of its
                    teeth. The child’s dress for the night may be a shirt, a blanket to tie on, and
                    a thin gown to tie over the blanket.</p>
