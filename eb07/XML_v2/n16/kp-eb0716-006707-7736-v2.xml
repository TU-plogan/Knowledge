                    and was obliged to fly from Macedonia when Philip began to be suspicious of the

                    countries. (Arrian, iii. 6, 8; Irid. 18, 4, 10.) After the conquest of Darius,
                    he was called from his province by Alexander, and appointed to command the fleet

                    Onesicritus was appointed second in command. Both admirals afterwards left a
                    detailed account of their voyage from the mouth of the Indus, where they parted
                    with Alexander, proceeding along the coast towards the Persian Gulf, and as far
                    as the river Euphrates. The journal of Nearchus has luckily been preserved for
                    us by Arrian in his Indian history (cap. 20), and it corresponds in general so
                    closely with the descriptions of modern navigators, that there can be no doubt
                    of its authenticity. Strabo (ii. 70) indeed expresses doubts respecting the
                    correctness of his statements; and perhaps there may have been some exaggeration
                    of the dangers he encountered, and the wonders he saw, but he has certainly
                    given a very accurate account of the coast along which he sailed.</p>
                <p part="N">This was the first time that a Greek fleet had entered the Indian Ocean;
                    and when Alexander made known his intentions, the sailors murmured at the
                    unknown dangers to which they were going to be exposed. The appointment,
                    however, of his beloved friend Nearchus to command the exploring expedition
                    quieted their apprehensions, as they were satisfied that the dangers could not
                    be so great as they imagined, when Alexander was willing to allow Nearchus to be
                    exposed to them. Alexander left the fleet at a spot called Xylenopolis, in the
                    month of August 326 before Christ, and proceeded with his army across the sandy
                    deserts of Mekran to Persia. About the month of October, when the south-west
                    monsoon had ceased to blow, Nearchus sailed down the western branch of the
                    Indus, now called Buggaur, into the Indian Ocean, which he reached after a
                    passage of 150 stadia. He directed his course to the north-west, and, after
                    sailing 150 stadia, reached a small sandy island called Crocala, now Chulna, or
                    Chilni, which is situated off Cape Mouze, about five miles from the mainland. It
                    is now described as a small desolate rock, about two miles in circumference,
                    rising abruptly from the sea in a conical shape, to the height of about two
                    hundred feet. Proceeding from Crocala, and having a mountain, which he calls
                    Eiros, on his right, and a low sandy island on his left, he entered a large and
                    safe harbour, which he designated Port Alexander. This is now called Sonmeany,
                    and is said to be a creek runnin^g up some distance inland. Here he found that
                    the south-west monsoon was still blowing with much fury, and he therefore
                    remained quietly for twenty-three days. During his voyage for the next three
                    hundred miles, he landed at many spots along the coast; and at the mouth of the
                    Tomerus, or Tuburus, now called Busul, he had an engagement with the
                    inhabitants, who assembled to the number of six hundred. He describes their
                    bodies as in the most filthy state; their nails being so long and hard that they
                    made use of them instead of iron, with which they were unacquainted. The people
                    along this coast he calls Oreitae, or Orae, and states, that they had the same
                    dress and arms as the Indians, but that their language and manners differed. A
                    passage of 300 stadia then brought him to Malana, said to be still called Malin,
                    which was the last spot belonging to the Oreitae.</p>
                <p part="N">The whole of the remainder of the coast, to the vicinity of the entrance
                    to the Persian Gulf, was inhabited by the Ichthyophagi or fish-eaters, a name
                    which the Greeks gave to them on account of their mode of life. The country, to
                    a considerable distance inland, was little else than a sandy desert, and the
                    inhabitants supported themselves chiefly on the fish which they caught. From
                    Malana Nearchus sailed 600 stadia to Bagisara, which he represents as a harbour
                    fit for the reception of a fleet. It is now known under the name of Arabah or
                    Hormarah Bay. The high rugged promontory which he passed immediately after
                    leaving this place is now Cape Arabah., At the small island of Car-ninë, now
                    Ashtola, he was hospitably received by the inhabitants, who supplied him with
                    some sheep; but they found that even these animals tasted of fish, as well as
                    the sea-birds which they caught. This island is represented as about four or
                    five miles in circumference, and situated twelve miles from the coast of Mekran;
                    but not a vestige of any habitation now remains. Proceeding 350 stadia, he
                    reached an excellent harbour, which he calls Mosarna, where there were
                    fishermen, and plenty of water, from the want of which they had suffered since
                    they left the river Indus. This harbour was formed by a promontory projecting
                    150 stadia into the sea, now called Ras No, and the bay is that of Gwadel.
                    Nearchus states, that he considered his dangers as now ended, and that the coast
                    began to assume a much less desolate appearance. In 1150 stadia, he reached a
                    small village, Barna, where there were palm trees, gardens with myrtles and
                    flowers, and the inhabitants seemed to have some degree of cultivation. He
                    began, however, to suffer from want of provisions; and having reached a small
                    city, the only one he mentions in his voyage along this coast, he determined to
                    compel the inhabitants to supply him with whatever they had. It is curious that
                    the name of the city should not be mentioned; but having obtained possession of
                    it by stratagem, he found that they had little else than flour made of the bones
                    of fish ground to powder. He at length reached the end of the coast of the
                    Ichthyophagi, which he describes as being 10,000 stadia in length. He now found
                    himself on the co¾st of the fertile province of Carmania, and at Badis, now
                    Jask, he obtained abundance of water and corn. On reaching Harmozia, at the
                    mouth of the river Anamis, now called Minab, he discovered that Alexander was at
                    no great distance with his army; and having landed, he proceeded to the camp,
                    where he was received with great joy by the king and the whole army. He was
                    directed to conduct the fleet up the Persian Gulf, to the mouth of the
                    Euphrates, and reached the city Diridotis in safety. .(See Notes on the Eastern
