                    especially in that part of Africa which lies within the tropics. In the
                    complexion of negroes we meet with many various shades; but they likewise differ
                    from other men in the features of their face. Round cheeks, high cheek-bones, a
                    forehead somewhat elevated, a short, broad, flat nose, thick lips, small ears,

                    climate; for although the heat of the sun may darken the colour of the skin, yet
                    experience does not show that it is sufficient to produce a new blackness like
                    that of the negroes. In Africa itself, several nations of Ethiopia are not
                    black; nor were there any blacks originally in the West Indies. In many parts of
                    Asia under the same parallel with the African region inhabited by the blacks,
                    the people are only tawny. Dr Barrière alleges that the gall of negroes is
                    black, and, being mixed with their blood, is deposited between the skin and
                    scarf-skin. Dr Mitchell of Virginia, in the Philosophical Transactions, has
                    endeavoured, by many learned arguments, to prove that the influence of the sun
                    in hot countries, and the manner of life of their inhabitants, are the remote
                    causes of the colour of the negroes, Indians, and other races. Lord Kames, on
                    the other hand, contends, along with many others, that no physical cause is
                    sufficient to change the colour, and the regular features of white men, to the
                    dark hue and the deformity of the negro. The arguments of these writers have
                    been examined with much acuteness and ingenuity by Dr Stanhope Smith of New
                    Jersey, Dr Hunter, and Professor Zimmerman, who have rendered it in a high
                    degree probable that the action of the sun is the original and chief cause of
                    the black colour, as well as of the distorted features, of the negro. In the
                    article <hi rend="smallcaps">Man</hi> the reader will find opinions stated which
                    have been advanced in regard to the varieties of the human race.</p>
                <p part="N">The most serious charge brought against the poor negroes is, that of the
                        <hi rend="italic">vices</hi> which are said to be natural to them. If,
                    indeed, they be such as their enemies represent them, treacherous, cruel,
                    revengeful, and intemperate, by a necessity of nature, they must be of a
                    different race from the whites; for although all these vices abound in Europe,
                    it is evident that they proceed not from nature, but from bad education, which
                    gives to the youthful mind such deep impressions as no future exertions can
                    completely eradicate. Let us inquire coolly if the vices of the negroes may not
                    have a similar origin.</p>
                <p part="N">In every part of Africa with which the nations of Europe have any
                    commerce, slavery of the worst kind prevails. Three fourths of the people are
                    slaves to the rest, and the children are born to no other inheritance. Most
                    parts of the coasts differ in their governments; some are absolute monarchies,
                    whilst others approach to an aristocracy. In both the authority of the chief or
                    chiefs is unlimited, extending to life, and it is exercised as often as caprice
                    dictates, unless death is commuted into slavery, in which case the offender is
                    sold; but if the shipping will not buy the person condemned, he is immediately
                    put to death. Fathers of free condition have power to sell their children, but
                    this power is very seldom enforced. In Congo, however, a father will sell a son
                    or daughter, or perhaps both, for a piece of cloth, a collar or girdle of coral
                    or beads, and often for a bottle of wine or brandy. A husband may have as many
                    wives as he pleases, and repudiate or even sell them, though with child, at his
                    pleasure. The wives and concubines, though it be a capital crime for the former
                    to break their conjugal faith, have a way of ridding themselves of their
                    husbands, if they have set their affections upon a new gallant, by accusing them
                    of some crime for which the punishment is death. In a word, the bulk of the
                    people in every state of Africa are born slaves to great men, reared as such,
                    held as property, and as property sold. There are indeed many circumstances by
                    which a free man may become a slave, such as being in debt, and not able to pay;
                    and in some of these cases, if the debt be large, not only the debtor, but his
                    family likewise, become the slaves of his creditor, and may be sold. Adultery is
                    commonly punished in the same manner, both the offending parties being sold, and
                    the purchase-money paid to the injured husband. <hi rend="italic">Obi,</hi> or
                    pretended witchcraft, in which all the negroes firmly believe (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Witchcraft),</hi> is another, and a very common offence,
                    for which slavery is adjudged as a suitable punishment; and it extends to all
                    the family of the offender. There are various other crimes which subject the
                    offender and his children to be sold; and it is more than probable, that if
                    there were no buyers, the poor wretches would be murdered without mercy.</p>
                <p part="N">In such a state of society, what dispositions can be looked for in the
                    people, but cruelty, treachery, and revenge? Even in the civilized nations of
                    Europe, blessed with the lights of law, science, and religion, some of the lower
                    orders of the community consider it as a very trivial crime to defraud their
                    superiors; whilst almost all look up to them with stupid malevolence or
                    rancorous envy. That a depressed people, when they get power into their hands,
                    become revengeful and cruel, the present age affords a dreadful proof in the
                    conduct of the anarchists of a neighbouring nation; and is it wonderful that the
                    negroes of Africa, unacquainted with moral principles, blinded by the crudest
                    and most absurd superstitions, and whose customs tend to eradicate from the mind
                    all natural affection, should sometimes display to their lordly masters of
                    European extraction the same spirit which was so generally displayed by the
                    lower orders of Frenchmen towards their ecclesiastics, their nobles, and the
                    family of their murdered sovereign? When we consider that the majority of the
                    negroes groan under the most cruel slavery, both in their own country, and in
                    every other where they are to be found in considerable numbers, it cannot excite
                    surprise that they are in general treacherous, cruel, and vindictive. Such are
                    the caprices of their tyrants at home, that they could not preserve their own
                    lives or the lives of their families for any length of time, except by a
                    perpetual vigilance, which must necessarily degenerate, first into cunning, and
                    afterwards into treachery; and it is not conceivable that habits formed in
                    Africa should be instantly thrown off in the West Indies, where they become the
                    property of men whom some of them must consider as a different race of
                    beings.</p>
                <p part="N">But the truth is, that the bad qualities of the negroes have been
                    greatly exaggerated. Mr Edwards, in his valuable History of the West Indies,
                    assures us that the Mandingo negroes display such gentleness of disposition <pb
                        break="no" facs="nls:194557892?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-7892-0079"
                    />and demeanour, as would seem the result of early education and discipline,
                    were it not that, generally speaking, they are more prone to theft than any of
                    the African tribes. It has been supposed that this propensity, amongst other
                    vices, is natural to a state of slavery, which degrades and corrupts the human
                    mind in a deplorable manner; but why the Mandingos should have become more
                    vicious in this respect than the rest of the natives of Africa in the same
                    condition of life, is a question he cannot answer.</p>
                <p part="N">“The circumstances which,” according to the same author, “distinguish
                    the Koromantyn or Gold Coast negroes from all others, are firmness both of body
                    and mind; a ferociousness of disposition; but withal, activity, courage, and a
                    stubbornness, or what an ancient Roman would have deemed an elevation of soul,
                    which prompts them to ⅜p- terprises of difficulty and danger, and enables them
                    to meet death, in its most horrid shape, with fortitude or indifference. They
                    sometimes take to labour with great promptitude and alacrity, and have
                    constitutionswell adapted for it; -for many of them have undoubtedly been slaves
                    in Africa. But as the Gold Coast is inhabited by various tribes, which are
                    engaged in perpetual warfare and hostility with each other, there cannot be a
                    doubt that many of the captives taken in battle, and sold in the European
                    settlements, were of free condition in their native country, and perhaps the'
                    owners of slaves themselves. It is not wonderful that such men should endeavour,
                    even by means the most desperate, to regain the freedom of which they have been
                    deprived; nor do I conceive that any further circumstances are necessary to
                    prompt them to action, than that of being sold into captivity in a distant
                    country. One cannot surely but lament,” says our author, “that a people thus
                    naturally intrepid, should be sunk into so deplorable a state of barbarity and
                    superstition; and that their spirits should ever be broken down by the yoke of
                    slavery. Whatever may be alleged concerning their ferociousness and
                    implacability in their present notions of right and wrong, 1 am persuaded that
                    they possess qualities which are capable of, and well deserve, cultivation and
                    improvement.</p>
                <p part="N">“Very different from the Koromantyns are the negroes imported from the
                    Bight of Benin, and known in the West Indies by the name of Eboes. So great is
                    their constitutional timidity and despondency of mind, as to occasion them very
                    frequently to seek, in a voluntary death, a refuge from their own melancholy
                    reflections. They require, therefore, the gentlest and mildest treatment to
                    reconcile them to their situation; but if their confidence be once obtained,
                    they manifest as great fidelity, affection, and gratitude, as can reasonably be
                    expected from men in a state of slavery. The females of this nation are better
                    labourers than the men, probably from having been more hardly treated in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p part="N">“The natives of Whidah, who in the West Indies are generally called <hi
                        rend="italic">Papaws</hi><hi rend="italic subscript"> i</hi> are
                    unquestionably the most docile and best disposed slaves that are imported from
                    any part of Africa. Without the fierce and savage manners of the Koromantyn
                    negtoes, they are also happily exempt from the timid and desponding temper of
                    the Eboes. The cheerful acquiescence with which these people apply to the
                    labours of the field, and their constitutional aptitude for such employment,
                    arise, without doubt, from the great attention paid to agriculture in their
                    native country. Bosman speaks with rapture of the improved state of the soil,
                    the number of villages, and the industry, riches, and obliging manners of the
                    natives. He observes, however, that they are much greater thieves than those of
                    the Gold Coast, and very unlike them in another respect, namely, in the dread of
                    pain, and the apprehension of death. They are, says he, so very apprehensive of
                    death, that they are unwilling to hear it mentioned, for fear that alone should
                    hasten their end; and no man dares to speak of death in the presence of the
                    king, or any great man, under the penalty of suffering it himself, as a
                    punishment for his presumption. He relates further, that they are addicted to
                    gaming beyond any people of Africa. All these propensities are observable in the
                    character of the Papaws in a state of slavery in the West Indies. That
                    punishment which excites the Koromantyn to rebel, and drives the Ebo negro to
                    suicide, is received by the Papaws as the chastisement of legal authority, to
                    which it is their duty to submit patiently. The case seems to be, that the
                    generality of these people are in a state of .absolute slavery in Africa, and,
                    having been habituated to a life of labour, they submit to a change of situation
                    with little reluctance.”</p>
                <p part="N">In a word, as the colour,∙and features, and moral qualities of the
                    negroes may be accounted for by the influence of climate and the modes of savage
                    life, so there is good reason to believe that their intellectual endowments may
                    likewise be referred to circumstances, and that they are equal to those of the
                    whites who have been found in the same hapless situation.</p>
