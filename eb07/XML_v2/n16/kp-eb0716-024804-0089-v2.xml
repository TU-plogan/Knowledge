                    retirement; and wrote a small folio of miscellanies, in prose and verse,

                    privately in the country, and towards the end of his life entertained himself
                    with books, but, as his numerous issue required, with economy. He wrote a little

                    Kettling, and studied at St John’s College, Cambridge, whence he removed to the
                    Middle Temple. He acquired French, Italian, Spanish, and Dutch, and became not
                    only a good lawyer, but thoroughly conversant with history, mathematics,
                    philosophy, and music. He was afterwards made the king’s solicitor-general, and
                    chosen to represent the borough of Lynn in parliament. He succeeded Sir Heneage
                    Finch in the office of attorney-general; and Lord Chief Justice Vaughan, in that
                    of lord chief justice of the Common Pleas. He was afterwards made keeper of the
                    great seal, and in 1683 was created a baron by the title of Lord Guildford. He
                    died at his house at Wroxton in the year 1685. Lord Guildford wrote a
                    philosophical essay on music; a paper on the gravitation of fluids in the
                    bladders of fishes, printed in Lowthorp’s Abridgement of the Philosophical T

                    Foundling Hospital and of the Asylum, a governor of the Turkey Company and of
                    the Charter House, was born on the 13th of April 1732. On the 20th of May 1756,
                    he married Miss Ann Speke, an heiress of the ancient family of Dillington in
                    Somersetshire, by whom he left two sons and three daughters. His lordship
                    succeeded the celebrated Charles Townsend as manager of the House of Commons and
                    Chancellor of the Exchequer; and, in 1770, on the resignation of the Duke of
                    Grafton, was made First Lord of the Treasury, in which office he continued until
                    the close of the American war, or rather until the formation of the Rockingham
                    ministry, which began the business of peace with the colonies. He tvas a man of
                    strong mental faculties, and an orator of very considerable powers, enlivened
                    and recommended by much pleasantry and amenity; but taking the helm at a time
                    when the king’s party were unpopular, and when it was supposed that the Earl of
                    Bute was the great engine by which the cabinet was moved, he continued in a
                    state of great unpopularity until he resigned the seals. During the whole of his
                    premiership, he studiously avoided imposing any taxes which could materially
                    affect ,the lower class of people. The luxuries and not the necessaries of life
                    were repeated objects of his budget. As a financier he stood high, even in the
                    opinion of an opposition forming a combination of all the great talents in the
                    kingdom; but being fatally wedded to the destructive plan of subduing the
                    republican spirit of the Americans, his administration is marked by an immense
                    waste of the public treasure, and a lavish expenditure of blood. The very last
                    time he spoke in the senate, however, he defended that war, and said he was
                    then, as he had formerly been, prepared to meet the minutest investigation as to
                    his conduct in that contest, which nothing but the unforeseen intervention of
                    France could have prevented from being crowned with success. His lordship was
                    one of the firmest and most strenuous supporters of the constitution in church
                    and state. He died on the 5th of August 1792.</p>
