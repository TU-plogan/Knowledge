                    which belong the most magnificent water-falls in the world. The river, forming
                    part of the boundary line between New York and Upper Canada, runs from Lake Erie
                    into Lake Ontario, thus connecting the St Lawrence and Lake Ontario with the
                    upper lakes. It is thirty-five miles in length, and is from half a mile to
                    several miles in breadth. There are many islands in the Niagara, all the way to
                    the falls, and close above them; but the principal island is about half-way
                    between the ∙'&gt;'lage of Black-Rock and the falls; it is called Grand Island,
                    and contains about 17,000 acres. The river is about two miles and a half in
                    width below Grand Island, and there the current increases; but it becomes more
                    contracted on its way to the falls. The rapids succeed, which are swift
                    currents, occasioned by great descents of the river, tumbling perpendicularly,
                    in some places six, eight, and ten feet, over ledges of rock, the whole descent
                    being about sixty feet. From Fort Erie on the Canada shore, at the outlet of
                    Lake Erie, to Chippewa (eighteen miles), the bank is from four to ten feet high.
                    From Chippewa to the Great Fall, two and a half miles along the Canada shore,
                    there is a descent of ninety-two<pb break="no"
                        facs="nls:194559452?mode=fullsize" xml:id="kp-eb0716-9452-0199"/> feet, and
                    the bank is from ten to one hundred feet in height. The river is here so rapid,
                    that notwithstanding its great depth, it is always covered with a white foam.
                    From the cataract to Lewiston is seven miles; and near this place the bank is
                    310 feet high, being composed of strata of soft mud and sand, clay, gypsum,
                    slate, limestone, and a superstratum of earth. From Lewiston to Lake Ontario is
                    seven miles, and in this distance the northern terrace or mountain ridge crosses
                    the course of the river. The height of the bank then diminishes to twenty-five
                    or thirty feet. The difference of level between Lakes Erie and Ontario, forming
                    the whole descent of the river, is 334 feet. The Niagara affords a great variety
                    of fish, such as sturgeon, bass, muscanunge or muscalunga; and salmon-trout are
                    numerous below the falls. The white fish, weighing from two to six pounds, are
                    taken in seines, from October to May.</p>
                <p part="N">The stupendous Falls or Cataracts of Niagara are situated about half way
                    between Lakes Erie and Ontario. Although mere description can convey no adequate
                    idea of the momentum of the Niagara, some notion of it may be formed when we
                    reflect that the descent above the falls is about sixty feet in half a mile;
                    that the column of water is three quarters of a mile in breadth and twenty-five
                    feet in depth; and that it is propelled onward, not only by its own gravity, but
                    by the weight of the whole surplus waters of the immense inland seas of North
                    America. Two small islands, Bath Island and Goat Island, intervene on the
                    American side, very near the falls, and separate the river into two branches,
                    the great mass of water descending by the more direct and wider channel on the
                    western or Canada side, by what is called the Horse-shoe Fall. A portion of the
                    fall on the American side is cut off by a small island on the precipice; the
                    rest descends in one vast body, almost perpendicularly, from a height of 164
                    feet, its breadth being about 220 yards. Both the falls on the American side are
                    crossed by bridges. The Horse-shoe Fall is several feet less in height; but it
                    far surpasses the other in grandeur. Its breadth is estimated at 600 yards, and
                    seven eighths of the waters of the river are supposed to pass over it. This
                    great body of water sweeps over the precipice with such tremendous force that it
                    forms a curved sheet, which strikes the surface of the water beneath fifty feet
                    from the base of the precipice, so that visitors may venture to pass behind this
                    watery wall. The best points of view are from the Table Rock, which projects and
                    looks over the falls; and here the cataracts on both sides may be seen at once,
                    But the rapids are beheld to the greatest advantage from Goat Island, to which a
                    very ingeniously constructed and strong rough bridge has been thrown on the
                    American side, over great blocks of rock and rapids. The river is crossed by a
                    small boat about two hundred or three hundred yards below the falls, where it is
                    about 1200 yards in breadth. There is a steep wooden stair from the landingplace
                    to the top of the bank on the American side; and from thence, by the bridge over
                    the rapids, already mentioned, Goat island may be readily approached. “On the
                    north side of that island,” says Mr Stuart, “the rocks, projected into the
                    river, two hundred or three hundred feet immediately over the falls, are
                    accessible by a rough wooden bridge, below which the water runs with fearful
                    velocity. From these rocks, the view over the precipice and great fall is
                    terrific, absolutely appalling, although the prodigious magnitude of the
                    tumbling water is not so apparent at this spot as from the Table Rock and the
                    boat.” A spiral stair-case conducts to the edge of the river below the Table
                    Rock, and from a point a little way nearer the falls than the foot of the ladder
                    there is an excellent view. “The overwhelming sensations,” continues the
                    traveller above named, “with which a spectator can hardly fail to be affected,
                    are produced by the immense flood, not less than one hundred millions of tons of
                    water per hour, the stupendous mass, and overpowering force of the roaring and
                    falling waters. It is, in truth, a great deep ocean thrown over a precipice
                    nearly 160 feet high. Every thing, every surrounding object, is viewed with
                    indifference, whilst the mind is wholly absorbed in the contemplation of a
                    spectacle so sublime, surpassing in majesty, and grandeur, and power, all the
                    works of nature which have ever arrested the attention, or presented themselves
                    to the imagination. No just or adequate description can be conveyed by language.
                    Such words as grandeur, majesty, and sublimity, fail altogether to express the
                    feelings which so magnificent a sight, exceeding so immeasurably all of the same
                    kind that we have ever seen or imagined, excites.” Mr Stuart gives just praise
                    to the following description of Mr Morris, an American minister, which appears
                    to be as simple, plain, and intelligible as a mere verbal picture of the
                    spectacle can be. “To form,” says this individual, “a faint idea of the
                    cataract, imagine to yourself the Frith of Forth rush wrathfully down a steep
                    descent, leap foaming over a perpendicular rock 175 feet high, and then flow
                    away in the semblance of milk from a vast basin of emerald.” The great volume of
                    water, as we have said, inclines very much forward in its descent, and it falls,
                    for the most part, in an unbroken sheet of a dark-green colour, until it meets a
                    cloud of spray ascending from the rocks below, in which it is lost to the eye.
                    This cloud of vapours, the “everlasting incense of the waters,” as it has been
                    finely designated, rises a hundred feet above the precipice, and can be seen at
                    the distance of seventy miles. Prismatic colours are always present, and
                    complete rainbows, sometimes three at a time, of the most brilliant hues, are
                    not unfrequently “set in the cloud.” The thunder of the cataract can be
                    distinctly heard at ten miles from the falls, and in favourable states of the
                    wind and atmosphere at even twice that distance. With regard to the height of
                    the fall, there is a discrepancy amongst authorities, some calling it 150,
                    others 160, and a third class of writers carrying it up as far as 176 feet. It
                    appears to us that some calculate from the surface of the column of water, some
                    from its medium depth, and some from its base, just as it bends over the
                    incurvated precipice. This view of the matter reconciles them all, the largest
                    number answering to the top of the column of water, and the lesser numbers to
                    its average depth and the height of the precipice. The Niagara is usually frozen
                    over during a part of the winter, except at the falls, and where the rapids are
                    most violent. At this season of the year, myriads of wild ducks alight on the
                    foaming stream above the falls, and, sailing on the bosom of the cataract until
                    it reaches its extreme circular verge, at about half its descent, rise aloft
                    into the air amidst the spray of the “phlegethon” below, wheel round to the
                    place on the rapids whence they began their descent, and again perform with ease
                    and for pastime what bids defiance to the utmost power and ingenuity of man. <hi
