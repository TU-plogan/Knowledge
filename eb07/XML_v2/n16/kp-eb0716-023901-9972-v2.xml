                        Antoine</hi></label>, regius professor of physics in the College of Navarre,
                    and member of the Academy of Sciences at Paris, of the Royal Society of London,
                    of the Institution of Bologna, and of the Academy of Sciences of Erfurt, was
                    born at Pimbré, in the diocese of Noyon, on the 17th of November 1700. He was
                    the son of respectable but not wealthy parents, who, to make up for the want of
                    riches, determined to give their son a good education. They sent him to the
                    College of Clermont in Beauvoisin, and afterwards to Beauvais, there to finish
                    his introductory studies. The progress which he made in the different classes
                    decided them to send him to study philosophy at Paris; and having intended him
                    for the clerical order, they considered the strictness and purity of his morals,
                    together with his unwearied application to study, as sufficient proofs of his
                    vocation. The young Nollet yielded without reluctance to the wishes of his
                    parents. As soon as he was capable of showing an inclination for any thing, he
                    had discovered a taste for physics; but this had not become his ruling passion;
                    and he therefore sacrificed it to the study of scholastic divinity, to which he
                    wholly dedicated himself during the time of his probation in 1728. No sooner had
                    he been invested with the deaconship, than he solicited and obtained a license
                    to preach. This new occupation, however, did not make him entirely lose sight of
                    those studies which had first engaged his attention, and insensibly began to
                    occupy a greater portion of his time, which was now more equally divided between
                    theology and the sciences. The latter, however, prevailed; and thenceforth he
                    entered upon the study of physics with an ardour which was only increased by
                    that kind of privation to which he had been long subject. He was received into
                    the Society of Arts established at Paris under the patronage of the Count de
                    Clermont. In 1730, the Abbé Nollet was engaged in a work in conjunction with
                    Reaumur and Dufay of the Academy of Sciences. In 1734 he went to London in
                    company with MM. Dufay, Duhamel, and Jussieu; and his merit procured him a place
                    in the Royal Society without any solicitation. Two years afterwards, he went to
                    Holland, where he formed an intimate connection with Desaguliers, s’Gravesande,
                    and Musschenbroeck. On his return to Paris, he resumed the course of
                    experimental physics which he had begun in 1735, and which he continued till
                    1760. These courses of physics first suggested the idea of giving particular
                    courses in other branches of science, such as in chemistry, anatomy, and <pb

                    />natural history. In 1738, the Count de Maurepas prevailed on Cardinal Fleury
                    to establish a public class for experimental physics; and the Abbé Nollet was
                    appointed the first professor. In the beginning of the year 1739, he was
                    admitted a member of the Royal Academy of Sciences; and in the month of April
                    following, the king of Sardinia, intending to establish a professorship of
                    physics at Turin, invited the Abbé Nollet to visit his dominions. In 1744, he
                    was honoured with an invitation to Versailles, to instruct the dauphin in
                    experimental philosophy; and the king and royal family were often present at his
                    lectures. The young prince, until the period of his death, showed marks of the
                    strongest attachment to this ingenious philosopher; and even prevailed upon him
                    to go and pay court to a man in power whose patronage might be of service to
                    him. The Abbé Nollet accordingly waited upon the placeman, and made him a
                    present of his works. “I never read any works of that kind,” said the patron
                    coldly, at the same time casting a look at the volumes before him. “Sir,”
                    replied the Abbé, “will you allow them to remain in your antichamber? <hi
                        rend="italic">There,</hi> perhaps, there may be found men of genius who will
                    read them with pleasure.” In the month of April 1749, he made a tour in Italy,
                    having been sent thither for the purpose of making observations. At Turin,
                    Venice, and Bologna, the Abbé Nollet appeared as a deputy from the philosophers
                    of the rest of Europe. During his short stay in Italy, the wonders of
                    electricity were not the only object of his researches; every part of physics,
                    the arts, and agriculture, came equally under his notice. Upon his return
                    through Turin, the king of Sardinia, sensible of his merit, offered him the
                    order of St Maurice, which, however, he did not think proper to accept without
                    his sovereign’s permission. In 1753 the king instituted a class of experimental
                    philosophy in the Royal College of Navarre, and appointed the Abbé Nollet prof
                    essor. In 1757 he received from the king a brevet appointing him preceptor in
                    physics and natural history to the <hi rend="italic">Enfans de la France.</hi>
                    In the month of August the same year he was appointed professor of experimental
                    philosophy in the school of artillery, which was at that time established at La
                    Fère. In the month of November following, he was admitted as a pensionary of the
                    Royal Academy of Sciences. Μ. de Cremillo, director-general of artillery and
                    fortification, having founded a class of experimental philosophy at Mezieres in
                    1761, the Abbé Nollet was appointed professor. This celebrated and laborious
                    philosopher, who rendered the most important services to physics by the
                    discoveries with which he has enriched every branch of this science, but
                    particularly electricity, died at Paris on the 25th of April 1770, aged seventy.
                    His works are, 1. Several Papers inserted in the Memoirs of the Academy of
                    Sciences, amongst which one on the Hearing of Fishes is particularly valuable;
                    2. Leçons de Physique Expérimentale, in six vols. 12mo; 3. Recueil de Lettres
                    sur l’Electricité, three vols, !2mo, 1753; 4. Essai sur l’Electricité des Corps,
                    one vol. 12mo; 5. Recherches sur les Causes particulières des Phénomènes
                    Electriques, one vol. 12mo’; 6. L’An des Expériences, three vols. 12mo,
