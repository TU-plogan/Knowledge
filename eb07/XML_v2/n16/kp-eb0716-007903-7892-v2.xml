                    cause it is sometimes called the Rio Sauces. Its Indian name is Cusu-Leubu,

                            South America, has hitherto been laid down solely on the authority of
                            Father Falkner’s work upon Patagonia, published in this country in the
                            year 1775. In the year 1836', however, the Royal Geographical Society of
                            London published a correct account and map of it, which were derived
                            from a Journal of an Original Voyage of Discovery up the Rio Negro,
                            performed in the years 1782-1783, by Don Basilio Villarino, who had been
                            employed for tlιb purpose by the Spanish government. To these we have
                            had recourse in drawing up the above article.</p></note> The results of
                    the expedition alluded to in the note were important, although not so completely
                    satisfactory as could have been wished, as the large affluent from the north,
                    supposed to be Diamante, was not examined. But the great point established was,
                    that it is possible to navigate the main stream of the Rio Negro from its mouth,
                    in the Southern Atlantic, to the very foot of the Cordillera of Chili, within
                    fifty miles of Valdivia, upon the shores of the Pacific, a distance of about 525
                    miles without including the windings of the river. From its mouth in south
                    latitude 41 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> 5 <hi rend="superscript"> f</hi>, to
                    the great island of Choleechel or Chuelechel, in latitude 39°, its general
                    course tends to the north-north-west, although in some parts it is exceedingly
                    tortuous. As far as this point, the bottom of the river is sand, and the country
                    is described as an arid sandy level, destitute of vegetation, excepting some
                    insulated patches along the shore, which being from time to time flooded, are
                    covered with good pasturage. The island of Choleechel, which constitutes so
                    conspicuous a feature in the map of the river, is twenty-seven miles in length
                        <pb break="no" facs="nls:194557905?mode=fullsize"
                        xml:id="kp-eb0716-7905-0080"/>and nine in width; but appears to produce
                    nothing except pasturage. From this island to Diamante, a distance of 156 miles,
                    the course of the river is nearly due west; its bottom is gravelly, with many
                    pebbles, and the aspect of the country is for the most part desolate from want
                    of vegetation. The Diamante, at its confluence with the Rio Negro, is nearly as
                    large as the latter river; and as it appears to be the drainage of numerous
                    streams which descend from the eastern side of the Cordillera, between the
                    latitudes of 32° and 36°, its periodical floods must be formidable, and much
                    greater than those of the Rio Negro. It is much intersected by small islands
                    overgrown with stunted willows. The low lands along the shore are sterile, and
                    all beyond a range of steep red cliffs, by which these are bounded, the country
                    appeared totally destitute of herbage, not a tree being visible. From about the
                    confluence of these two rivers, the Rio Negro takes a southsouth-western
                    direction, running between high precipitous banks, where in some parts the river
                    was not more than five hundred yards across. After these are passed, the country
                    becomes more level, and the stream widens. Another considerable tributary,
                    called the Pichi Epicuntu, which descends from some of the snowy peaks of the
                    Cordillera, flows into the Negro in lat. 39° 35' S. Farther onwards the river
                    becomes intersected by innumerable islands, extremely shallow in some parts; and
                    the bottom is strewed with rounded stones and boulders, which increase in size
                    as the range of the Cordillera is approached. The windings of the river also
                    become very large, and, from flowing in a main current nearly due south, it
                    takes a westerly direction, and then bends to the north. The farthest point
                    reached by Villarino was in lat. 39 <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi> 40'; and
                    here, within fifty miles of Valdivia, his course was checked by the Indians, who
                    appear to have been apprehensive that his expedition had for its main object the
                    stoppage of a great pass near Choleechel, by which they were in the habit of
                    making predatory excursions into the province of Buenos Ayres. He, in fact,
                    points out how these marauders might be effectually kept in check by
                    establishing a fort at the point above mentioned; and, after a lapse of fifty
                    years, this suggestion has been carried into effect by the authorities of Buenos
                    Ayres. In 1833 a military post was formed at the Choleechel, which will not only
                    secure the southern parts of the republic from the hostile inroads of the
                    Indians, but will no doubt ultimately lead to our obtaining much new and
                    interesting information respecting a vast tract of country as yet unknown to us.
                    The depth of the Rio Negro varies much, as well as the current, depending in
                    some measure on the breadth of the bed of the river; and it is liable to great
                    changes in the time of the floods, which are periodical, and twice in the year,
                    from the rains in the winter, and the melting of the snows in summer. With
                    regard to its breadth, nothing satisfactory can be stated, as it varies
                    exceedingly at all times, and widens and contracts at different seasons of the
                    year.</p>
