                <p part="N"><label type="entry">NEGATIVE</label>, in general, something which
                    implies a negation. Thus we say negative quantities, negative powers, negative
                    signs, and the like.</p>
                <p part="N"><hi rend="smallcaps">Negative Sign.</hi> The use of the negàtive sign,
                    in algebra, is attended with several consequences which at first are admitted
                    with difficulty, and has sometimes given occasion to notions which appear to
                    have no real foundation. This sign implies, that the real value of the quantity
                    represented by the letter to which it is prefixed is to be subtracted; and it
                    serves, with the positive sign, to keep in view what elements or parts enter
                    into the composition of quantities, and in what manner, whether as increments or
                    decrements, that is, whether by addition or subtraction. It serves therefore to
                    express a quantity of an opposite quality to the positive, as a line in a
                    contrary position, a motion with an opposite direction, or a centrifugal force
                    in opposition to gravity; and thus often saves the trouble of distinguishing and
                    demonstrating separately the various cases of proportions, and preserves in view
                    their analogy. But as the proportions of lines depend on their magnitude only,
                    without regard to their position, and motions and forces are said to be equal or
                    unequal, in any given ratio, without regard to their directions; and, in
                    general, the proportion of quantity relates to their magnitude only, without
                    determining whether they are to be considered as increments or decrements; so
                    there is no ground to imagine any other proportion of — <hi rend="italic">b</hi>
                    and + <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (or of — 1 and 1) than that of the real magnitude
                    of the quantities represented by <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >a,</hi> whether these quantities are, in any particular case, to be added
                    or subtracted. It is the same thing to subtract the decrement as to add an equal
                    increment, or to subtract — <hi rend="italic">b</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                        >a</hi><hi rend="italic">—</hi><hi rend="italic">b,</hi> as to add to it +
                        <hi rend="italic">b.</hi> And because multiplying a quantity by a negative
                    number implies only a repeated subtraction of it, the multiplying — <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> by — <hi rend="italic">n</hi> is subtracting — <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> as often as there are units in <hi rend="italic"
                        >n</hi><hi rend="italic">;</hi> and is therefore equivalent to adding + <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> so many times, or the same as adding + <hi
                        rend="italic">nb.</hi> But if we infer from this, that 1 is to — <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi> as — &amp; to <hi rend="italic">nb,</hi> according to
                    the rule, that unit is to one of the factors as the other factor is to the
                    product, there is no ground to imagine that there is any mystery in this, or any
                    other meaning than that the real magnitudes represented by 1, <hi rend="italic"
                        >n, b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ηb</hi> are proportional. For that rule
                    relates only to the magnitude of the factors and product, without determining
                    whether any factor, or the product, is to be addpd or subtracted. But this must
                    likewise be determined in algebraic computations; and such is the proper use of
                    the rules concerning the signs, without which the operation could not proceed.
                    Because a quantity to be subtracted is never produced in composition by any
                    repeated addition of a positive, or repeated subtraction of a negative, a
                    negative square number is never produced by composition from the root. Hence √ —
                    1, or the square root of a negative, implies an imaginary quantity; and, in
                    resolution, it is a mark or character of the impossible cases of a problem,
                    unless it is compensated by another imaginary symbol or supposition, when the
                    whole expression may have a real signification. Thus 1 + √ — 1, and 1 — √ — 1,
                    taken separately, are imaginary, buttheir sum is 2; as the conditions that would
                    separately render the solution of a problem impossible, in some cases destroy
                    each other’s effect when conjoined. In the pursuit of general conclusions, and
                    of simple forms representing them, expressions of this kind must sometimes arise
                    where the imaginary symbol is compensated in a manner that is not always so
                    obvious.</p>
                <p part="N">By proper substitutions, however, the expression may be transformed into
                    another, in which each particular term may have a real signification as well as
                    the whole expression. The theorems which are sometimes briefly discovered by the
                    use of this symbol may be demonstrated without it by the inverse operation, or
                    in some other way; and though such symbols are of some use in the computations
                    by the method of fluxions, their evidence cannot be said to depend upon arts of
                    this kind.</p>
