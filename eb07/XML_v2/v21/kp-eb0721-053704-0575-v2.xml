                    Foy</hi></label>, to whom, according to Voltaire, France was indebted for the
                    science of medals, and Louis XIV. for one half of his cabinet, was born at
                    Beauvais on the 24th of May 1632. At the age of three, he lost his father, and
                    the charge of his education was undertaken by one of his maternal unclcs. This
                    uncle, who belonged to the magistracy, and who had destined him for his
                    successor, died after bequeathing him his name and a part of his fortune; and
                    being thus left to follow his own inclination, he relinquished the study of law
                    for that of physic, and took a doctor’s degree. He engaged in practice at
                    Beauvais, but was accidentally drawn into a new department of study, which he
                    prosecuted with great ardour during the remainder of his life. A farmer of that
                    vicinity had found a great quantity of ancient coins, and Vaillant at first
                    inspected them in a cursory manner; but perceiving that they bore a reference to
                    events either forgotten or inaccurately detailed by historians, he was induced
                    to resume their examination with deep attention, and he succeeded in explaining
                    them with a facility which is generally the result of long experience. Having
                    afterwards made a visit to Paris, he became known to Seguin, eminent for his
                    numismatic skill, and astonished him by the extent of his knowledge. He was
                    introduced to other men of learning; and the minister Colbert proposed to employ
                    him in travelling to collect medals for the royal cabinet. He accepted of the
                    offer, and after travelling into Italy, Greece, Egypt, and Persia, he returned
                    with so many medals as made the king’s cabinet superior to any in Europe. In one
                    of his voyages, in 1674, the ship was taken by an Algerine corsair. After a
                    captivity of nearly five months, he w as permitted to return to France, and
                    received at the same time twenty gold medals which had been taken from him. He
                    embarked in a vessel bound for Marseille, and was carried with a favourable wind
                    for two days, when another corsair appeared, which, in spite of all the sail
                    they could make, bore down upon them within the reach of cannon shot. Vaillant,
                    dreading the miseries of a fresh slavery, resolved at all events to secure the
                    medals which he had recovered at Algiers, and therefore swallowed them. But a
                    sudden change of the wind freed them from this adversary, and cast them upon the
                    coast of Catalonia; and after expecting to run aground every moment, they at
                    length fell among the sands at the mouth of the Rhone. He reached the shore in a
                    skiff, but felt himself extremely incommoded with the medals he had swallowed,
                    which might weigh altogether five or six ounces, and therefore did not pass like
                    Scarborough waters. He had recourse to a couple of physicians, who were a little
                    puzzled with the singularity of his case; however, nature relieved him from time
                    to time, and he found himself in possession of the greatest part of his treasure
                    when he arrived at Lyon. Among his collection was an Otho, valuable for its
                    rarity. He was much caressed on his return; and when Louis XIV. gave a new form
                    to the Academy of Inscriptions in 1701, Vaillant was first made associate, and
                    then pensionary. In the course of his researches, he had twelve times visited
                    Italy, and twice England and Holland. He was successively married to two
                    sisters; having obtained a dispensation from the pope, upon condition <pb

                    at St. Peter’s church in Rome. He died on the 23d of October 1706, in the
                    seventy-fifth year of his age.</p>
