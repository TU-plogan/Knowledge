                        GeroNIMO</hi></label>, a very elegant Latin poet, was a native of Cremona,
                    but the time of his birth is uncertain. Different writers have placed it in
                    1470, 1480, and 1490. His parents were noble, but not wealthy. He prosecuted his
                    studies at Padua and Bologna, and at an early age was admitted into the
                    congregation of the canons regular of St Mark at Mantua. Here however he did not
                    long remain, but removed to Rome, where he became a canon of St John of the
                    Lateran. His poetical talents recommended him to the favour of Leo the Tenth,
                    who bestowed upon him the priorship of St Sylvester near Tivoli. Vida published
                    a collection of his poems at Rome in the year 1527. This collection, a quarto of
                    110 leaves, contains De Arte Poetica libri iii., De Bombyce libri ii., De Ludo
                    Scacchorum, Hymni, Bucolica. Leo recommended to him the subject of a sacred
                    poem, which was not completed till after the death of that pontiff. Under the
                    title of “Christiados libri sex,” it was published at Cremona in 1535. In 1532
                    Clement the Seventh had promoted him to the bishopric of Alba. Another pope,
                    Paul the Third, destined him for the bishopric of Cremona, but died before he
                    could fulfil his intentions. Vida composed several other works in verse, and
                    some in prose. When his episcopal city was attacked by the French and the
                    imperialists in 1542, he displayed his courage by urging the garrison to make a
                    strenuous defence, and he afterwards contributed to the recovery of this
                    conquest out of their hands. He accompanied the papal legates to the council of
                    Trent; and upon that occasion composed a prose work, entitled “Dialogi de
                    Reipublicae Dignitate,” and printed at Cremona in 1556. He died at Alba on the
                    27th of September 1566, and his remains were interred in the cathedral. Vida
                    possessed a very elegant taste, and was a great master of Latin versification.
                    The art of poetry, the operations of the silk worm, and even the game of chess,
                    he has discussed with singular grace and harmony. The encomium of Pope rendered
                    his name familiar to English ears:</p>
                <p part="N">Immortal Vida, on whose honoured brow</p>
                <p part="N">The poet's bays and critic’s ivy grow.</p>
                <p part="N">Of his poems there are several collective editions. A collection,
                    exclusive of his sacred poems, was published by Thomas Tristram, A.M. Oxon.,
                    1722-3, 2 part. 8vo. But the best edition, containing all the poems which he
                    acknowledged as his, together with the Dialogi, appeared soon afterwards,
                    “curantibus J. Ant. et Cajetano Vulpiis. Patav. 1731, 2 tom. 4to. Some of Vida’s
                    poems have been translated into various languages. Of the Poetics an English
                    translation was published by Pitt in 1725, and another by Hampson in 1793. Of
                    the poem on Chess an English version is said to have been published by Erskine
                    in 1736. A translation of another work, accompanying the original, appeared
                    under the title of “The Christiad, a Poem in six books: translated from the
                    Latin of Marcus Hieronimus Vida, by J. Cranwell, M.A., Rector of Abbots Ripton
                    in Huntingdonshire." Cambridge, 1768, 8vo.</p>
